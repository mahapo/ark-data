JOHANN WOLFGANG von GOETHE In terms of wealth and strength, the United States is one of the great nations of the world. It covers over 3,000,000 square miles from sea to sea, plus Alaska and Hawaii, and has vast material resources. Amazing productive capac- ity has given it the world's highest average standard of living But the true greatness of a nation may have relatively little to do with its size or its ability to produce goods. We can talk of the greatness of the city-state of Athens in the fifth century before Christ, even though its area was smaller than Rhode Island and its population one- thirtieth that of modem New York City. The glory of Athens lay in the fact that it produced men whose ideas and actions have affected the world ever since. The lasting greatness of the United States must rest on something more than material things. What ideals has this country preached and tried to practice? What in Ameri- can life, in addition to mere abundance, has made this country a desirable place to live? Outstanding characteristics of \"American- ism\" have varied from period to period and section to section, but the following can be traced from colonial times to the present: (1) Economic opportunity. There has gen- erally been a fair chance for individuals to im- prove themselves by their own efforts. For over two centuries there was abundant cheap land, and even now the United States contains great untapped wealth. Americans have prized will- ingness to work as a primary virtue and have been skilled in turning natural resources into food, clothing, houses, lu.xuries, and gadgets. Furthermore, they have found means to see that wealth is. widely shared without going as far as socialism. When, in certain circumstances, Americans have used the power of government to promote prosperity, it has seldom been in the direction of sharing wealth through state- owned enterprise. Instead, they have used government to aid private enterprise as well as to regulate it. They have also used govern- ment to prevent monopoly. (2) Wide participation in politics. From colonial times to the present there has been widening opportunity for Americans to have a share in government. The United States was the first large nation to attempt \"government of the people, by the people, and for the people.\" In the twentieth century, while many countries"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xii Prologue have fallen under totalitarian forms of govern- ment, Americans have continued to maintain democracy. (3) Belief in reform rather than revolution. The United States is now nearing the close of its second centur>'. During this period there has been only one major armed conflict within the country. In general, Americans have agreed to settle even the most bitter disputes by ballots rather than by bullets. (4) A mobile population. People of this coun- try have been continuously on the move. That American invention the rocking chair may be evidence of an inability to be still even when at rest. .Americans have usually been ready to \"pull up stakes\" and move to other sections of the countn,'. TTiey have also been socially mobile: people do not have to remain fixed in one social class or occupation. Although in fact there have been large disparities between the rich and the poor, Americans have cherished the ideal of a \"middle class\" society, without noblemen or commissars at the top and without serfs or proletarians at the bottom. (5) A high position and freedom for women. It is only recently that American women have achieved anything close to political, economic, and educational equalit)'. From the first, how- ever, they have been accorded greater freedom and opportunity' than existed in the countries from which their ancestors came. (6) Belief in education and widespread educational opportunity. From the Massachu- setts School Law of 1647, which directed that all children in the Massachusetts Bay Colony be taught to read and write, to the present, there has been ever-increasing educational op- portunity. Without schooling for all, there can- not be effective democracy or equal economic opportunity. (7) Concern for the welfare of others. \\V'hen .\\mericans lived under frontier conditions, they had to cooperate in order to survive. Today Americans are noted for their private and public generosity. Concern for others has been shown in innumerable private organizations, such as the Community Chest and the March of Dimes. It was shown in national legislation such as the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which attempted to end the abuses of alcohol. It has been seen on the international scene in the Marshall Plan, which helped to restore western European prosperity after World War II. (8) Toleration of differences. To this coun- try have come people of many nations, speaking difi^erent languages and practicing different religions. To weld these different groups into one nation, Americans have had to learn toler- ance. The first clause of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution promotes the right of all to speak, think, and worship freely. (9) Respect for the rights and abilities of the individual. This is the most fundamental char- acteristic of all, and to some degree includes all the others. Free public education is based on the idea that people have the right to an equal start in the race of life. Freedom of speech and press are based on both the right of persons to speak their minds and the faith that people have enough intelligence to choose wisely be- tween voices urging different courses of action. (10) World-wide responsibility. At the time they declared their independence, in 1776, American political philosophers had a sense of responsibilit)' to the world. They thought it their mission to show mankind something new: a free society governed by reason and law. But until the t\\\\'entieth century the people of the United States hoped to be isolated politically from the Old \\\\'orld; their foreign policy was generally confined to the Western Hemisphere. In the twentieth century', however, they have been drawn into two world \\\\'ars. They have"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Prologue come to realize that they cannot isolate them- selves from the rest of a world that is rapidly shrinking as communication and transportation continue to improve. The United States has been suddenly thrust into a position of world leadership, and its people have accepted— although sometimes reluctantly— world-wide responsibility. Taken together, these characteristics have helped to form the American system of values from the first. They have been celebrated by orators, preached from pulpits, taught in schools, and celebrated in song and story. It must be remembered, however, that none of them should be thought of as exclusively American. Participation in politics is wider in several other countries than it is here. Belief in the ballot box is so strong in England that there has been no civil war there for over three centuries. Technical skill, tolerance, belief in education, respect for the individual, and the rest- none of them is the exclusive possession of Americans. It should also be noted that many of the qualities described as typical of America have not been completely realized. Negro slavery, which existed in this country until 1865, was an absolute denial of the ideals of equal op- portunity and respect for individual rights, and in the century since emancipation the Negro has been generally the \"invisible man\" in our society, a second-class citizen. Opportunity of every sort has generally been less open to recent immigrants than to those whose ancestors have been here for two or three generations. There are still large inequalities in educational op- portunity; there is still a tendency to pay women less than men for the same work. It is also true that the American people have shown traits not to be admired. They have permitted vast waste of their natural resources and corruption in government. Their crime rate is higher than that of any country in western Europe and is still rising. Occasionally they have been stam- peded into unwise or unjust actions. But to say that American ideals have not been fully carried out is merely to say that Americans are human. Taken as a whole, the history of the United States has been that of a bold and exciting experiment, an attempt to found a society on faith in human intelligence, human freedom, and human brotherhood. So far this experiment has been on the whole a suc- cess. Its future success depends on the intelli- gence, good will, and sense of responsibility of coming generations."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Maryland Historical Society"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Parti 11 A FREE COUN IN A NEW WORLD BALTIMORE, MARYLAND, 1752"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"DONT FORGET THE \"BACK TIER\" We tend to think of the early American colonists as frontiersmen, hewing farms out of the wilderness, building homes, gradually establishing a relatively pros- perous and comfortable society \"from Europe's woes and wars remote.\" But we must also remember that behind this frontier was a \"back tier.\" The ancestors of all of us (except the few of Indian descent) came from across the seas, bringing with them technical skills, art, music, language, literature, and religious beliefs. They brought social and political skills as well, as can be seen by the way the Pilgrims organized their community before they disembarked from the Mayflower. The first eight amendments to the Constitution, on pp. 138 and 140, are rights of Americans that the federal government is forbidden to invade. They are rights for which Americans fought the Revolutionary War. But every one of these was previously one of the \"rights of Englishmen\" whose every phrase was hammered out in nearly five hundred years of struggle between the British people and their monarchs. To carry the point further, the court procedures in all but one of our fifty states come from the common law of England. Furthermore, the thirteen colonies were very much part of what we have re- cently come to call the \"Atlantic community.\" What they gathered or produced was what Europe or Africa or the West Indies would buy, whether tobacco from Virginia, cod and lumber from Massachusetts, rum from Rhode Island, or furs from New York. A complex web of trade tied together the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediter- ranean (see diagram, p. 26). The books the Americans read, their costume, their architecture, were dictated by Europe. And whenever England and France went to war, the English and French colonies dutifully enlisted Indian allies and fought each other. And yet — something unique was also developing in the thirteen colonies. The French settler, Crfevecoeur, writing at the time of the American Revolution, main- tained that the American was \"a new man\" living in \"a new society,\" a society in which there was far greater chance than in Europe for the average man to make his own way by his own efforts. And the American Revolution owes its enduring Importance to the fact that it was much more than a rebellion against England. It was also, as Lincoln said in the Gettysburg Address, an attempt to found \"a new nation . . . dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\""},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 The Heritage of the Colonial Period The land was ours before we were the land's.

And forthwith found salvation in surrender. Such as we were we gave ourselves outright (The deed of gift was many deeds of war) To the land vaguely realizing westward. But still unstoried, artless, unenhanced. Such as she was, such as she would become. — ROBERT FROST Robert Frost recited the above poem at John F. Kennedy's inaugviration as President of the United States on January 20, 1961. Thou- sands in the audience, shivering in the cold winter winds, and millions more glued to tele- vision screens heard the white-haired poet as he directed their thoughts back to when our land was first settled. At first America was simply an obstacle in the way of mariners seeking to get to Asia, and more than two centimes after Christopher Co- lumbus discovered the New World, men were still searching for the fabled Northwest Passage that would lead to the riches of China, Japan, and India. With the discovery^ of gold in Mexico and Peru, the new continents also became a prize in their own right. The stories of the wealth to be found there did not lose in the telling. In 1605 a play called \"Eastward Ho,\" dealing with voyaging to America, was put on in London. In it one character asks: \"But is there such treasure there. Captain, as I have heard?\" The answer was: \"I tell thee, gold is more plentiful there than copper is with us . . . Why, man, all their dripping-pans and their pots are pure gold; and all the chains \\\\'ith which they chain up their streets are massy gold; all the prisoners they take are fettered in gold; and for rubies and diamonds, they go forth on holidays and gather 'em by the sea- shore to hang on their children's coats.\" Only the Spanish found precious metals in abundance, although the French, the Dutch, the Swedes, and the English, all of whom com-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"4 A Free Country in a New World peted for a foothold in North America, found other resources quickly convertible into cash, such as fish in luibelievable abundance oflF the Grand Bank of Newfoundland and furs gained from barter with the Indians. But the greatest resource of all, especially in that portion of the coast where the English established settlements, was the land itself. Here were untold millions of fertile acres awaiting the plow, once the for- ests were cut or burned out and the scanty population of Indians driven oflF. To develop this land, however, the transplanted Europeans had to put up with starvation, disease, Indian raids, cold in winter, and in summer the petty and incessant torture of flies and mosquitoes. They had to learn new skills and new methods of organization. Above all, they had to work. for, as Captain John Smith remarked of Vir- ginia: \"Nothing is to be expected thence but by labor.\" THE AGE OF DISCOVERY The first European colonies in America were estabhshed during the so-called Age of Dis- covery, which lasted from about 1450 to about 1550, and which saw the greatest increase in geographical knowledge in the history of man. Like the twentieth century, it was a \"space age,\" although the space involved was the sur- face of the earth, not that outside it. The men who performed almost incredible feats of heroism and endurance in making the great voyages of discovery were driven by powerful motives. The hope of immense wealth lured both the QUESTION .

This was the period of the Renaissance inJEurope, when many men were intensely curious about the world about them. Excited by fabulous reports of the first voyages, adventurers flocked to new lands in search of more marvels. The Age of Discovery would not have taken place except for the rise in Western Eiu-ope of the new middle class of bankers and merchants who were gaining wealth at the expense of the landowning nobibty. From this class came many of those most eager to find new sotu'ces of wealth. They financed many of the explorers and established trading posts throughout the known world. In Europe central governments were increas- ing their power and seeking new sources of revenue.

At first they were intent on breaking the monopoly of eastward trade held by Genoa and Venice, but later they engaged in bitter rivalry to establish colonies and con- trol the new trade routes. A number of technical discoveries enabled Europeans to sail the great oceans for the first time. Previously, sailors had to depend on land- marks. Now the compass, the astrolabe (for determining latitude), and the development of more accurate mapmaldng enabled them to navigate the open seas with at least a rough idea of where they were, although it was not until the invention of the chronometer (for measuring time) in the eighteenth century that really accurate navigation was possible. In less than a hundred years, European ex- plorers traced the outlines of all the major continents except Australia and Antarctica. This was done in ships as small as fifty tons. The Scandinavian mariners l<new about the New World long before Columbus. The Vinland map (above) was drawn by monks around the year 1000. Jesuit mis- sionaries drew an amazingly accurate map of Lake Superior in 1670-1671, revealing how carefully they had explored in their zeal to convert the Indians. No map as accurate as this appeared until after 1850.

These early vessels were so slow, and so little was known of prevailing winds, that a journey across the Atlantic often took three months. Seamen regularly suffered from scurvy, a terrible disease caused by lack of vitamin C that sometimes carried off whole crews. (A chart in the Appendix, p. 798, gives information about the major European ex- plorers to the New World and Asia.) From Obstacle to Goal At first North America was thought to be part of Asia. Columbus believed that Haiti was part of Japan and died not knowing he had discovered new continents. When it was real- ized that North America barred the way to the Far East, explorers sought a way around it to the north. On a map of Canada today the names Davis Strait, Hudson's Bay, and Labra- dor commemorate men who took part in these fruitless explorations. Even after gold was dis- covered in Mexico and Peru, the search for a northwest passage went on. During the two centuries after Columbus, Spain, France, and Great Britain gained control over large portions of North America and started colonies. Thus they determined how people have lived on this continent ever since. One must go back to colonial times to explain the different ways of living of today's French Canadians, Mexicans, and people of the United States. The carry-over of patterns of life inherited from Europe is understandable when you re- alize the length of the colonial period. It was almost as many years from the founding of the first permanent English colony at Jamestown in 1607 to the winning of the independence of the United States in 1783, as from the latter event to the present. And the Spanish colonies were founded more than a century earlier than the English. THE SPANISH COLONIES The Spanish were the first to find wealth in the Americas, and the first to estabhsh colonies. In the century after Columbus, the Spanish founded an empire that was larger than the United States today and that lasted for over three centuries. The Spanish empire-builders, the conquistadors, have often been pictured as bent on looting the lands they discovered and enslaving their people. Many conquistadors were certainly cruel; they wiped out some Indian tribes and made slaves of others. Yet a traveler in Mexico in the year 1600— before the EngUsh had started a single perma- nent colony— would have seen aqueducts, thea- tres, bookshops, a university, great cathedrals, and scores of fine churches. He would have found that the Spanish had introduced Euro- pean crops such as wheat and alfalfa; fruits such as oranges, figs, and pears; and livestock such as cattle, sheep, and horses. The Spanish had foimd mineral wealth that was the envy of all Europe. From Peruvian and Mexican mines flowed so much precious metal that ships re- tnming to Spain were sometimes ballasted with silver. Many Spaniards had become farmers on great estates worked by Indian or Negro labor, producing grain, livestock, and sugar. Protection of Indians and Negroes by the Church Although the Indians were subdued and put to work for their conquerors, their interests were guarded by the Roman Catholic Church. As worthy of remembrance as any conquistador was the Spanish priest Bartolome de Las Casas, who devoted most of his ninety-two years to defending Indians from his own countrymen. Las Casas was only one among thousands of"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Heritage of the Colonial Period 7 missionaries who regarded the Indians primarily as souls to be saved. The missionaries influenced the kings of Spain to issue orders defending Indians from oppression. They taught the In- dians agriculture and handicrafts. Both the Church and the Spanish government approved of marriage between whites and Indians, so that the distinction between the races was gradually reduced. In the United States today probably less than 1 per cent of the population has any Indian ancestry; in Mexico, however, mestizos (those people who are of mLxed Indian and white descent) form the great majority of the population. Almost from the first, the Spanish imported Negro slaves from West Africa to work in plan- tations and mines. That the lot of the slaves was hard was demonstrated by several desperate insurrections against their white masters. As in the case of the Indians, the Catholic Church tried to better the lot of the Negro slaves whose souls were as worth saving as those of their white masters. The Church taught that \"Slavery is not to be understood as conferring on one man the same power over another that men have over cattle. . . . For slavery does not abolish the natural equality of man.\" Church authori- ties therefore insisted that slaves be baptized, that they marry, and that they be granted holidays when they might work for themselves and earn money to buy their freedom. Both the Spanish government and the Church en- couraged masters to free slaves. Slavery as an institution was not abolished, however, until the nineteenth century and usually only after the colonies had gained independence. Weaknesses of the Spanish Empire Although the founding of the Spanish Em- pire was one of the great achievements of history, it was not followed by vigorous devel- opment after the first century of conquest and settlement. There are several reasons for this. (1) Spain tried to do too much in the \"Spanish century.\" In addition to founding an empire in America and in the Philippines, Spain led the fight against the Turks in the Medi- terranean, was embroiled in costly wars in Italy, tried to put down the revolt of the Dutch, and attempted the conquest of England. After the defeat of the great Spanish Armada by the English in the year 1588, Spanish power declined. (2) The Spanish kept colonial trade in a strait jacket. Until 1713, goods could be legally imported to Spain only in Spanish ships, and only at a few ports. Any colonist trading with a foreigner was liable to the death penalty. Al- though these niles were poorly enforced, such excessive control stifled commerce and industry. (3) Society in the Spanish colonies became fixed in a pyramid. There were a few wealthy landowners and officials at the top, while the mass of the people lived in poverty. Many of the latter were peons, tied to the soil they culti- vated. Such a society kept down initiative and abiHty. Despite these drawbacks, the Spanish ex- tended their culture over an area many times larger than their own, and kept control for three centuries or more. Furthermore, they protected the native population from extermination and from the worst forms of oppression. THE FRENCH COLONIES Compared to that of Spain, French coloniza- tion in North America was late and feeble. France had sent early explorers such as Giovanni da Verrazano and Jacques Cartier to the New World, and her fishermen had been on the Grand Bank since about 1500, but there was no serious attempt at colonization until after 1600. The colonies established by France in North America were little more than a long string of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"u < (0 o UJ t z u u. o Q. < -J < a. < o o Q. o - 4) O 4) « lU A 60 M a; 1— ) ca > P t; K -a ^ Q-a -\"2 3 S a c o c £ So « IB . . -c o > « c o _- to O _ 43 13 O j= J3 M .2 1) ^ S a-\" S>^ «_^ i33'UhOD'S':3 U « M ^ M J' D bc M o. « a-\" -J J5 ^ « J .2 -^ s-s-^. a .\"> -\"S^g 2 \"33 M \"a \" H > S 5^ ca ° P \" n « c \" r5 «3j3 P • w ^ u ffl e \"2 'c 'o p rS '3 « rt « Sao\"'-' S .•S 4) o s \" lU 4* \"\" H *- o 4) o jq £ f S p^ 5 ;« .2 s ^ Si - § w,o >-o ^ « g - g 2 as -r\" c o g c « c 4j « '*' -a ^ 2 •S •€ 4) o *. jg K g 4) V C O \" .a .3 ^ = „ 4> rtj t4 -^ r; iM ?; .2 S'S t £ BC » - -5 ^ I o o ^ 2 ^ o I e >. 1 j2 o P- o .2 \"§ \"^ « S 4) E-5 •'\" - *;' \"\" o 4) in •\" _Q £ ^ ^ - *. 5 «^ E?^«^ S a - S 2 — p y w o o s s •S3 ° p \" 2-2 C^^4>PC-^<^ 4)«>3.j;o c^ !* o Yl \" j:^ O S c S £ O.y 4) « 13 .i.^\" O M C 4^ U -a ^ o O 4J P 2 -5 ^ 5^ 2 4) -D 5°11- 8 e S p «£ 5i3^ £?^«^ 3 '3 p S? _ o ** 2 Sn'-'gc— B<nffl S„4)a)*.-t!u4)fei] \"5 C 4) -^ 4) 4) --^a « S?

Only Acadia ( now Nova Scotia ) and the shores of the St. Lawrence were settled. Obstacles to French Colonization The French did not consider their holdings on the continent of North America as valuable as their West Indian \"sugar islands\"— Guade- loupe, Martinique, and what is now Haiti. Furthermore, the kings of France were far more interested in extending their dominions in Europe than in settling the North American wilderness. The French government had great difficulty in recruiting colonists, and was even reduced to such dishonest practices as ordering regiments of soldiers to Canada and disbanding them there without means of transportation home. The French missed an opportunity to gain an ener- getic group of settlers when they forbade French Protestants, called Huguenots, to settle in America. Denied the right to practice their rehgion at home, many Huguenots would have been glad to come over to the New World. They were mostly well-to-do merchants and craftsmen whose industry and organizing ability would have greatly increased the prosperity and strength of the French colonies. Government and Society The government of the French colonies resembled that of the Spanish in that the colonists enjoyed almost no self-government. Political power centered in the person of the royal governor. As in the Spanish colonies, land was often parceled out to great landlords, called seigneurs. They were supported by fees from the peasants, who were called habitants. The society that developed, like that in the Spanish colonies, was aristocratic. The habitants were. however, considerably more independent than the Mexican peons. The influence of the Roman Catholic Church was, as in the Spanish colonies, very great, the bishop vdelding practically as much power as the royal governor. The descend- ants of the habitants are today among the most devout Catholics in the world. In the French colonies, as in the. Spanish, trade was strictly controlled by the government. The greatest efforts to colonize North America were made in the reign of King Louis XIV under the direction of Jean Colbert, finance minister from 1661 to 1683. Colbert was a defend er of the economic theory known as mercantilism. According to this theory, a_natioji sTiould make itself wealthy by taking in more specie (gold and silver) from exporting goods abroad than it spends abroad for imports. It should make itself secure by becoming self- sufficient, depending on no other country for vital imports. A colony, therefore, existed for the good of the mother country. If the colony lacked deposits of precious metals, it should furnish commodities such as sugar and tobacco that were readily salable in other countries. Or it should produce goods the mother country would otherwise have to buy elsewhere— especially those of military importance, such as masts and ship timber. The industry of a colony should not compete with that of the mother country because the colony was supposed to provide a market for goods produced at home. Putting mercantilism into practice demanded statejegulation^at-eveiy turn. In France, Col- bert raised tariffs on foreign goods, paid for- eigners fo come and start new industries, and forbade skilled workmen to leave the country on pain of death. In the colonies the govern- ment required that furs, lumber, and fish be sent only to France or to other French colonies. Fur traders had to swear not to trade with the Dutch or British. Colonists might import only French goods carried in French ships."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Heritage of the Colonial Period 11 In the English colonies, the way of life developed differently in different parts of the country. In Williamsburg, Virginia (left), a bedroom in the Governor's Pal- ace reflects the formality of the English way of life — fine furni- ture and elegant accessories. New England (below) developed a distinctive pattern suited to the economy — white frame homes with fine furnishings collected by sea captains on their voyages. French Treatment of Indians The French generally treated the Indians well, as useful allies in war and also as a source of furs. French missionaries, like those of Spain, devoted their lives to the conversion of Indians to Christianity. Undaunted by starvation and torture, Jesuit priests made heroic journeys far into the middle of the continent. The French made one serious mistake, however. In 1608, Samuel de Champlain, founder of French Canada, joined a war party of Algonquins and Hurons in a raid against their enemies, the Iroquois. From then on the Iroquois, the most formidable warriors in eastern North America, were the sworn enemies of the French and the allies of the British. Occupying rich lands south of Lake Ontario, the Iroquois protected the colonies of New York and Pennsylvania from invasion and forced the French to use a round- about route to the Ohio and Mississippi valleys.

As a result of mistakes in policy and lack of interest at home, the French colonies grew very slowly. By 1750, after nearly a century and a half of colonization, only about 80,000 whites inhabited the huge area claimed by France. Meanwhile, the Enghsh had started colonies which grew so rapidly that by 1750 their popu- lation approached two million. THE FOUNDING OF THE ENGLISH COLONIES England, like France, participated in the early voyages of discovery, but then failed to establish colonies for more than a century. In 1497. the merchants of the city of Bristol sent the Venetian seaman John Cabot westv^ard in order to discover a route to the Far East. Cabot explored the shores of Nova Scotia, Newfound- land, and Labrador. Like Columbus, he be- lieved he had found Japan. But when a second expedition found only the barren coasts of Lab- rador and Greenland, English interest in west- ward exploration and settlement waned. The great Tudor monarchs— Heiuy VII, Henry V'lII, and Elizabeth I— had little money to spend on colonization, their country being disturbed first by religious difficulties and later by the threat of war with Spain. Rivalry Between England and Spain The rivalr\\' bet\\\\een England and Spain was one reason why the English became interested in colonization. English buccaneers, such as Francis Drake, cruised the shores of Spanish America, capturing treasure ships and looting towns. But a better way to strike at Spain was obviously to attempt to seize the Spanish colonies, or at least to set up permanent English bases in America. As long as Spain seemed the strongest power in Europe, founding colonies in America appeared a risky business. The \\\\'ay for English colonization was cleared by the defeat of the Spanish Armada that sailed against England in 1588. Comprising 130 ships manned by 27,000 men, this was the greatest naval expedition the world had ever seen. The English fleet sent out to meet it had a new idea of naval warfare: that a warship should be a floating platform for artillery. The Spanish had the older idea that it should carry soldiers who would board the enemy ships. The English ships were also far easier to handle than the Spanish galleons. Able to choose its point of attack and pound Spanish ships to pieces without coming close enough to allow them to grapple, the English fleet harried the Armada up the English Channel and out into the North Sea. Most of the survi\\ing Spanish ships were later destroyed in a storm north of 12"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Although the over-all English policy toward the Indians was harsh (see page 21), sonne settlers did treat the Indians favorably.

Disheartened by this disaster, Spain was no longer a serious threat to settlement of North America. The English gained new faith in their ability to undertake great enterprises. Motives and Methods of English Colonization Rivalry \\\\'ith Spain was only one of several reasons for English colonization in America. Clergymen hoped to bring \"savages from the Devill to Christ.\" Colonies would provide an outlet for idle women and \"sturdy beggars.\" American fisheries and trade would strengthen English naval power by increasing the number of ships and sailors. Above all, there was the hope of wealth. Although they started late, the English had certaijL^dvantages in the race to establish colonies in ^Smerica. England's island position. her good harbors, her fisheries, and her exten- sive trade with Europe all encouraged seafaring. Her people enjoyed a relatively high level of prosperity, and there was capital available for investment in the expensive business of planting .lew settlements. English society was aristocratic; it was domi- nated by a few great lords at the top and many more \"gentlemen,\" who boasted coats of arms and were considered to be above the common people. But by the standards of most other European countries the society of Elizabethan England was remarkably mobile. An industrious apprentice might become a rich man and marry his daughter to a nobleman, and in turn the penniless younger son of a nobleman might himself become an apprentice or hire himself out as a soldier in foreign wars. Changes in agriculture drove some farmers off their hold- 13"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"14 A Free Country in a New World ings, and they were ready to go anywhere they could make a Hving. English women were less restrained by social taboos than the women on the Continent. They were free to come and go and marry as they pleased. Many of them worked at trades, and some owned their own businesses. Thus of all the countries in Europe, England probably had the highest proportion of men and women ready to travel to a new and strange environment and to survive when they got there. The first permanent English colony was started at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. By 1640, Englishmen had made several more settlements on the Atlantic seaboard (see map, p. 43). English methods of planting colonies differed from the Spanish and French in three major respects. (J) The English colonies were founded by private enterprise instead of by the government. The expense and risk of founding the English colonies were borne by individual proprietors such as George Calvert in Maryland, or by joint- stock companies such as the London Company, which founded Virginia. These companies were organized by businessmen who shared in the profits and losses resulting from the company's trading, according to the number of shares they owned. (2) The English permitted religious dissenters to settle in their colonies. Avoiding the mistake of the French in excluding the Huguenots, the English government allowed men to worship in the colonies in ways forbidden at home. Most of the settlements made before 1640 were led by men who came to America to worship as they pleased. (3) The English colonies enjoyed a large meas- ure of self-government. The English settlers enjoyed personal freedom and rights of self- government unknown in other colonies. Ever since Magna Carta in 1215, the idea had been developing that there were certain \"rights of Englishmen\" which even the king was bound to respect.

In 1619 the settlers in Vir- ginia first elected their ov4ti legislature, the House of Burgesses, to manage local affairs. In 1639 the towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield drew up the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, the first written constitution in modem times that actually worked. \"A Newe Englishe Nation\" A generation after the first settlement of Massachusetts, a Salem clergyman could ex- ult about the Success of the young colony as follows: Look on your habitations, shops, and ships and behold your numerous posterity and great increase of blessings of land and sea. . . .

By 1700 all but one of the English colonies later to become the thirteen original states had been founded, and all were growing rapidly due to immigration and the natural increase of the population. \"A newe EngUshe nation\" was be- ginning to appear.

Sturdily con- structed to withstand bumps and jolts, it could also float across streams too deep to ford. In such a wagon, it might take twenty-one days to travel from Philadelphia to Fort Pitt. MAKING A LIVING IN THE ENGLISH COLONIES Captain John Smith complained of the first settlers at Jamestown that they thought of noth- ing but to \"dig gold, wash gold, refine gold, load gold.\" But the hope of finding quick and easy wealth proved to be a mirage; it turned out that the two great sources of wealth in the thirteen colonies were land and labor. Colonial proprietors learned that the kind of settlers they most wanted were those described by William Penn in a prospectus for Pennsylvania: \"industrious Husbandmen and day Laborers . . . Carpenters, Masons, Smiths, Weavers, Taylors, Tanners, Shoemakers, Shipwrights, etc.\" The great attraction of America for such people was the opportunity to own land, and the cheap land available in the English colonies acted like a magnet drawing poor men and women with the ambition to better themselves. Eventu- ally perhaps 90 per cent of the colonists made their living by farming. Most of them were subsistence farmers— that is, they supplied nearly all ^f their wants from what they raised or made themselves. The cities were still so small that there was not a clear-cut distinction between lu-ban and rural life. \"A prosperous tradesman of Boston might graze his cows on Boston Common and drink mUk from his own dairy. A New York or Charleston merchant would expect to eat vegetables grown in his own kitchen garden, and he might own a nearby farm upon which he kept a watchful eye.\" Although agriculture was everywhere the main pursuit, differences in geography and cli- mate produced different ways of making a living in the various colonies. Three distinct regions appeared: New England, the middle colonies, and the southern colonies. The Southern Colonies: The Plantation System and the Piedmont The cliief products of the soiithem col- onies—rice, indigo, turpentine, and above all tobacco— either commanded a ready market in Europe or were needed by the mother country. Except for turpentine, these products were best grown on large estates worked by cheap labor. As a result, a plantation system of agriculture V"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"grew up, similar to that in the sugar islands of the West Indies. The large-scale fanning of the plantations was limited, however, to the tidewater area, where crops could be loaded directly on ships instead of being hauled long distances overland. Upstream from the tidewater lay the pied- mont (see map, p. 27), where the land was tilled by small farmers. Here was that char- acteristic American phenomenon, \"the frontier,\" a region where men were pushing back the wilderness, hving partly by farming and partly by hunting and trapping, in frequent danger from Indian attacks. The people of the pied- mont, poor for the most part, tended to resent the aristocratic planters of the coastal areas. The \"Bread Colonies\" The middle colonies, blessed with rich soil and navigable rivers, were sometimes called the \"bread colonies.\" Their principal exports were grain and livestock. These were produced on family-type farms, except in the Hudson Valley, where there were large estates. Pennsylvania attracted some excellent German farmers, the \"Permsylvania Dutch,\" many of whom have kept their language and traditional ways to this day. To send produce to market, the Ger- Whaling was a profitable industry in New England, but also danger- ous. When a whale attacked one of the small boats then in use, many a sailor was lost. The widow's walks atop homes in such coastal towns as Nantucket gave wives a view of the water from which they anxiously awaited the return of husbands and sons. Shelbume Museum Inc. mans invented the Conestoga wagon, a roomy, high-wheeled vehicle which horses or oxen could pull over rough roads; it was the ancestor of the \"prairie schooner\" which later carried pioneers to California and Oregon. The great Philadelphia Road, the most heavily traveled highway in America in colonial times, was crowded with Conestoga wagons. By the end of the colonial period, Philadelphia, with per- haps 30,000 inhabitants, was not only the largest city in the colonies, but had become the second largest city in the English-speaking world. The back country of nearly all the colonies produced furs and other pelts that were not only used here but provided an important export to Europe. The great center of the fiu- trade was Albany, New York, where pelts were ob- tained from French smugglers and from the Iroquois Indians. New England: Fisheries and Shipping New England, with thin soil and a harsh climate, had the scantiest natural resources; the region's onl)' important native product was lumber.

By the close of the colonial period, 30 per cent of the ships in the British merchant marine were American, and most of these sailed from New England ports. New Englanders carried on a large share of the African slave trade. They were the first to hunt whales in the Antarctic; in 1774, 360 whaling ships sailed from the island of Nantucket alone. In these activities New England became a formidable competitor of the mother country. In no colony, however, did the colonists ofiFer much competition to the British in manufac- turing. They usually obtained from Britain any manufactured goods not homemade. As transplanted Europeans, the colonists de- manded European goods— fine clothing, books, wine, cutlery. But to pay for them they had to produce staples that Europeans wanted or to send gold or silver. They acquired the latter mostly through trade with the West Indies. There the Spanish dollar was the common cur- rency, and this explains why the United States today uses the dollar instead of the pound as its monetary imit. COLONIAL SOCIETY In each of the thirteen colonies there was an upper class whose superior position was fixed by law or custom. In New England this class was composed of merchants, shipowners, and clergymen. Ln the South and along the Hudson River in New York, the great landowners made up an aristocracy who aped the country gentry of England. Early colonial laws forbade any but men in the upper class to wear silver buttons, and any but their \\%ives and daughters to wear silk dresses. Social rank was indicated in col- lege catalogues and marriage certificates, and even on tombstones. By modem standards, therefore, life in the Enghsh colonies might appear undemocratic. It was, however, an even more mobile society than that of England, one in which a man could move up or dovwi ac- cording to his ambition, ability, and energy, or his lack of such qualities. At the bottom of the scale were \"indentured servants,\" men who by contract were bound to ser\\e a master for a number of years in return for nothing more than their keep and the cost of passage to America. When the contract ex- pired, the servant was a free man able to seD his labor for what he could get. Since labor was scarce, wages in the colonies were two or three times those in England. In some colonies an indentured servant received as much as fifty acres of land on achieving his freedom. So a man who started life in America practically a slave might end it an independent landowner. Shortly after 1660, thirteen of the twenty-eight members of the Virginia House of Burgesses were men who had originally come to the col- ony as indentured servants. Effects of the Frontier The frontier was a leveUng force in colonial life. With land to be had almost for the asking, any energetic man could try to improve his lot by moving west. In the hard life on the edge of the wilderness a man was judged not by his ancestors but by his practical abihties and character. The violence of frontier life brutal- ized some men, but it did promote equality of opportunity for all. Life on the frontier also made women more self-rehant. A visitor to the North Carolina-Vir- ginia backcountry in 1710 gave this description of a frontierswoman: . . . she is a very civil woman and shows nothing of ruggedness or Immodesty in her carriage, yett she will carry a gunn in the woods and kill deer, turkeys, etc., shoot down wild cattle, catch and tye Hoggs, knock down beeves with an axe and f)erform the most manful exercises."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The art and architecture of colonial America reflected European models.

They had more freedom of action and more chance to take part in hfe outside the home than in Eng- land. Colonial laws gave them more protection. In England, for instance, the common law allowed a husband to beat his wife with any \"reasonable instrument\"; according to Massa- chusetts law, he could beat her only in self- defense. Widespread home manufacturing al- lowed wives as well as their husbands to leam trades. In the South the mistress of a plantation was a full partner in directing the working force. When seafaring New England husbands left their wives, sometimes for years at a time, women were successful as merchants or store- keepers. Still other women were printers, news- paper publishers, druggists, and doctors. Widespread Prosperity During the first half century or so of col- onization, life in English America was hard. A high proportion of those who sailed for these shores died within the first year because of the hardships of the voyage. Settlements were prey to Indian attacks, to starvation from crop fail- ures, to disastrous fires, and to epidemics of smallpox, dysentery, malaria, diphtheria, and yellow fever. By the eighteenth century, conditions were much improved. Epidemics were still common and human life was therefore uncertain, but this was also true in Europe. There was wade- spread prosperity— a product of cheap land, a ready market for colonial exports, and hard work. Idleness was generally regarded as a sin akin to drunkenness or gluttoily. There were no beggars and few paupers. Organized crime was almost unknown, except for occasional piracy on the high seas and banditry on the frontier. It was a society of mixed origins. At first most of the settlers, except for the Dutch and the Negroes, came from England. From about the time of the founding of Pennsylvania in 1681, American prosperity began to attract people of different nationalities and religions- Scots, Irishmen, Huguenots, Jews, and Ger- mans. Just as there was no class of beggars at the bottom, there was no class of idle rich at the top. Even the wealthiest men, whether New England merchants, Hudson Valley patroons, or Virginia plantation owners, habitually arose at dawTi and worked until dark. Crdvecoeur on American Life By the eighteenth century the people of the thirteen colonies were beginning to call thernselves \"Americans\" and to think of them- selves as a breed apart, free of the constraints and corruptions of Europe. This view was some- times confirmed by the observations of visitors to these shores. The most notable of these was a young French nobleman, Michel Guillaume Jean de Crevecoeur, who came 'here in 1759 and eventually bought a farm of his own. In 1782 he published a book on life in America, entitled Letters from an American Farmer. When a European comes to America, he wrote, \"a modem society offers itself to his contem- plation.\" Here are no great lords vdth every- thing and a horde of common people with nothing. Here are no kings, no courts, no luxuries, and— no poverty. Instead, \"a people of cultivators\" work for themselves; all can af- ford enough food, \"a dry and comfortable hab- itation,\" and clothes of \"neat homespvm.\" \"The American, this new man,\" as Crevecoeur called him, might have an English grandfather, a Dutch wife, and a French daughter-in-law. \"Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men,\" wrote Crevecoeur, \"whose labor and posterity will one day cause great changes in the world.\""},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"20 A Free Country in a New World Negro Slavery One group of setders must be omitted from this happy picture— the Negro slaves. By the time of the American Revolution they were nu- merous in all the colonies, the proportion being highest in the southern colonies because slave labor proved most profitable on rice and to- bacco plantations. In South Carolina three- quarters of the population were Negroes. About 20 per cent of the total colonial population were colored. The slave trade that furnished Negroes to American markets was a horrible example of man's inhumanity to man. It has been esti- mated that about 30 per cent of the Negroes put on shipboard in Africa died crossing the Atlantic, it being a conmion practice to throw the sick overboard. Probably half the survivors died soon after reaching America, because of strange food and diseases for which they had built up no immunity. At first it was not clear that the Negroes were to be treated differently from white in- dentured servants, who were temporary slaves. The white servants had usually chosen to migrate to America, however, and the Amer- icans wanted to persuade more to come. They inherited the rights of Englishmen and so had the protection of the law. The Negroes, on the other hand, had been totally uprooted; they were protected by no law or tradition and by no powerful institution like the Cath- ohc Church in the Spanish colonies. Thus white indentured servants gained freedom and even wealth, while methods were fovmd to rivet the Negro into hopeless bondage. Slave labor was especially well adapted to the southern plantation system, where much of the work demanded little skill and was done in gangs so that it could be easily overseen. Slavery came to be considered necessary to the prosperity of the South, and slaves came to compose a high proportion of the population in the tidewater areas. The laws of the southern colonies declared QUESTION • How much Negroes to be of their former rich Afri- slaves for life, can culture did the Ne- and their children groes retain in America? after them; they even forbade mas- ters to teach Negroes to read for fear that they might acquire dangerous ideas. Whereas in the Spanish colonies slaves were obliged to marry and the integrity of the family was protected, in the English plantation colonies slave marriages had no standing in law and children might be sold away from their moth- ers. Slaves could own no property and had shght legal protection against irresponsible or cruel masters. In brief, Negroes were treated as cattle. Their only protection was that they were such a valuable commodity that it was to the interest of the master to keep them reasonably healthy and reasonably provided with food, clothing, and shelter. In the North, where slavery was less prof- itable and slaves less numerous, and where religious convictions sometimes operated against slavery, Negro slaves were treated less harshly. In New England they were not only allowed but required to marry; they could ac- quire property and testify in court. They might be punished by their masters, but a master who killed a slave was held guilty of murder. There was also increasing feeling that slavery was a moral wrong. In 1700 Samuel SewaU, a famous Massachusetts judge, published The Selling of Joseph, a pamphlet that maintained that slavery was contrary to the Bible. In Penn- sylvania the institution was denounced by both the Quakers and the Mennonites, a German rehgious sect. The number of free Negroes increased, and a few even became prosperous. In Jaffrey, New Hampshire, Amos Fortime bought other Negroes out of slavery and left money for the town school. Even when free,"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Heritage of the Colonial Period 21 however, Negroes did not attain equality with whites in the northern colonies. Custom kept them usually in menial positions, and the laws denied them the right to vote or hold office. In the South, there were masters who dis- approved of slavery, but hesitated to free their Negroes because the lot of the freedman was not a happy one. Since his color marked him as different, the free Negro was kept in an inferior position, lacking the security of the slave, who was at least clothed and fed. Freedmen were feared as possible leaders of slave insurrections. Most southern colonies therefore had laws that made it difficult or impossible to give Negro slaves their freedom. English Treatment of Indians The coming of the English was a disaster for the Indians. A few colonial leaders, notably Roger Williams and William Penn, tried to treat them fairly, and some Protestant ministers regarded the Indians principally as souls to be brought to knowledge of Christ. The Iroquois were so valuable as allies in war and as a source of furs that they were not molested. But the overall English QUESTION . P^'^'^y ^^^ °\"^ °^ Now we live in a land expulsion and ex- of plenty, termination, and But where would we be if various reasons in 1620, were put forth to Indians, fired with justify it. It was a racist notion, held that since Had tossed our fathers into (}jg Indians did the ocean? ^ot have settled dwellings, but were on the move hke \"the foxes and wild beasts ... so it is lawful now to take a land which none useth; and make use of it.\" Some Puritan ministers held that the Indians were children of the devil, in the same category as witches; they therefore might be killed in good conscience. Man for man, the Indians were better fighters than the white man— more skillful, more inured to hardship, more self-reliant, more dar- ing. But they were divided into scores of tribes and never united for long. The Indian warrior was often unreliable. He might or might not fight on a particular day according to his mood, or omens, or dreams; he did not cooperate easily with others. The whites had the advantages of far better organization and larger numbers. They also had grim allies in diseases such as smallpox, which sometimes wiped out whole Indian communities. Rum, which white traders exchanged for furs, de- stroyed Indian character and self-respect. In any case, the English lived in compact settlements, and constantly pushed inland. The historian James Truslow Adams wrote: When a French trader or trapper plunged into the forest, and the green leaves closed behind him, it was to mingle with the life of the natives, which, in its main aspects, flowed on unaltered by his presence. When, on the other hand . . . the English frontier crept ever farther and farther inland, and town succeeded town, it was as if, adding stone to stone, great dykes were being built, which more and more dammed up the waters of native life. Religion The variety of religious beliefs in the Eng- lish colonies was almost as great as in west- em Europe. In the South the planter aristocracy usually belonged to the Church of England, but there were also Roman Catholics, Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians. In New England the great majority of the people were Con- gregationalists, but there were small groups of other Protestant sects. The middle colonies had the greatest variety— Dutch and German Lu- therans, Mennonites, Quakers, Presbyterians, and members of the Church of England. In most colonies a single official church was \"es- tablished\"— that is, supported by taxes."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"22 A Free Country in a New World Although many people came to America to worship as they pleased, this did not imply that they were ready to grant others the same privilege. Thus the Massachusetts Puritans be- lieved that religious toleration was a weakness inspired by the devil and that one who favored it must be \"either an atheist or a heretic or a hypocrite or at best a captive of some lust.\" Thev banished both Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson for preaching what Puritans con- sidered dangerous doctrines, and they hanged Quakers on Boston Common. Virginia, on the other hand, expelled ministers who came from Massachusetts to preach. In time, however. toleration of rehgious differences developed. Roger Williams claimed that it was \"the will and command of God . . . that a permission of the most Paganish, Jewish, Turkish, or Anti- christian consciences and worships be granted to all men,\" and his colony of Rhode Island followed this principle from the first. In the seventeenth century no other colony went as far as that, but in Maryland the Toleration Act of 1649 granted liberty of worship to Christians, and later Pennsylvania welcomed people of all Christian sects. By the eighteenth century, re- hgious persecution in the colonies was a thing of the past, although all rehgious groups were Samuel Sewall, Yankee Puritan A grim Judge Sewall faced the woman accused of witchcraft and condemned her to death. The law of the colony of Massachusetts Bay decreed that witches must be hanged, and the judge believed that laws must be enforced strictly and literally. Five years later, however, he stood up in the church congregation to hear the minister read his public confession of \"blame and shame\" for his part in persecuting the unfortunate \"witches.\" Thereafter, he marked his repentance with an annual day of fasting. A man of strange contradictions, Samuel Sewall was generous, yet thrifty; humane, yet macabre; kindly, yet stern; an orthodox Puritan, yet outspoken when convinced that injustice had been done. His diaries — written in code — reveal his many facets. One year he refused to dine with Governor Edmund Andros and the Council to celebrate the pagan feast of Christmas. Instead he spent the day rearranging the coffins in the Sewall family vault. Friendly and warmhearted, he loved to gossip with farmers along the road as he followed the judicial circuit. Yet in his diary at the end of each year, the two-hundred-pound magistrate counted up the gloves and scarves and rings he had received during the year as pall- bearer at funerals, like a girl counting the times she has been a bridesmaid. Sewall was able to fix his affection on and wed the only daughter of a wealthy merchant. That, and the fact that he traded shrewdly, lent money wisely, and speculated in land, made his fortune prosper. Generous in gifts to the deserving poor, at the same time he \"set down carefully in his diary what his benefactions cost, that there might be no mistake when he came to make his reckoning with the Lord.\" He was courageous in his outspoken attacks on slavery.

The Selling of Joseph, much in advance of his time, included a memorable measure of the man: \"There is no proportion,\" he declared firmly, \"between twenty pieces of silver and liberty.\" (Theme 2, see p. xi)"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Heritage of the Colonial Period 23 not equal before the law. Foreigners were es- pecially struck by the freedom granted Jews, who still suffered severe penalties in most European countries. A foreign traveler to New York about 1750 was astonished to find that Jews owned prosperous shops, farms, and trad- ing vessels. In Newport, Rhode Island, another prosperous Jewish community built a handsome synagogue. Arts and Architecture The lack of leisure in colonial America may be one reason why little attention was paid to the arts. Another reason was that many pious people regarded the visual arts as \"vanity,\" and music or the theatre as positively immoral. In spite of such handicaps, colonial craftsmen pro- duced work that is prized and imitated today. Artistic expression found its outlet in objects of practical usefulness— furniture, chests, glass- ware, andirons, silver bowls and teapots. Co- lonial handicraft is often more pleasing to modem taste than the more elaborate work of European craftsmen because American work- men, aiming at usefulness rather than display, produced objects that were simpler and cleaner in design. There was an increasing demand for portraits, since people of means wished to pass likenesses of themselves on to their descendants. Early colonial portraits were crude and flat, but by the middle of the eighteenth century a few American portrait painters had achieved real skill. Two of them, John Copley and Benjamin West, went abroad and practiced their art in London with success. In the field of architecture great advances were made. The first colonial houses were crude huts made of poles with branches woven be- tween. Soon after settlement began, the settlers started to erect simple frame or brick buildings. By the eighteenth century, amateur colonial architects, using European textbooks to guide them, were quite accomplished. Using the Georgian style, which is characterized by ele- gance of form and delicacy of ornament, they designed handsome churches, public buildings, and private mansions. Schools and Colleges The New England Puritans believed that citizens should learn enough English to read the Bible and understand the laws of the coun- try. The famous Massachusetts General School Act of 1647 stated: It being one chiefe project of the oulde deluder Satan, to keep men from the knowledge of the scripture ... it is therefore ordered, that evry town- ship . . . after the Lord hath increased them in num- ber to 50 householdrs shall appoint one to teache all such children as shall resort to him to write & reade, whose wages shall be paid eithr by the parents or mastrs of such children or by the in- habitants in genrall. This law contains two principles of Ameri- can education today: local communities have a duty to set up schools, and this duty is en- forced by law. In the middle colonies, schooHng was not as universal as in New England, but it was widesoread nevertheless. William Penn pro- posed that all children should be taught some useful trade, \"to the end that none may be idle, but the poor may work to live, and the rich, if they become poor, may not want.\" Perm's ideas were not carried out completely, not even in Philadelphia. But throughout the middle colonies, rehgious groups established schools for their own children; in the cities, schools for orphans and children of the poor were en- dowed. In the southern colonies, book learning was generally limited to cliildren of large land- owners and professional men, and there was some feeling that education should be reserved for the few. Governor Berkeley of Virginia ex- pressed this sentiment in a letter to England:"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"24 A Free Country in a New World . . . there are no free schools, or printing, and I hope we shall not have them these hundred years, for learning has brought disobedience and heresy and sects into the world . . . God keep us from both! Even where there was a will to establish schools, the widely separated plantations and farms of the South made them impractical, as compared to the close-knit communities of New England. By modem standards colonial schools were primitive. One New England teacher wrote of his schoolhouse, \"one might as well nigh as good keep school in a hog stie.\" There were few books, and instruction was given only two or three months a year. Most girls received no instruction at all. Two-thirds of the women whose names appear on Massachusetts legal documents in the early 1700's could not write their signatures. In spite of all shortcomings, however, colonial schools taught so many chil- dren that in no other region of equal size in the world could such a high proportion of the population read and write. Religion was the principal force behind the founding of most institutions of higher learning in the English colonies. Harvard, William and Mary, Yale, Rhode Island College (later Brown^^The College of New Jersey (later Princeton), and Rutgers were founded princi- pally to train young men for the ministry. Colleges were also attended, however, by sons of wealthy families and by ambitious poor boys anxious to improve their situation in life. By the middle of the eighteenth century, college cur- riculums began to change because there was a growing interest in science and a demand for practical subjects. Thus when King's College (later Columbia) was opened in New York City in 1754, it was announced that the \"com- prehensive scheme of studies\" would include not only the traditional Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, but also \"Surveying and Navigation, Geography, History, Husbandry, Commerce, Government, the Knowledge of All Nature in the Heavens above us and in the Air, Water, and Earth Aroimd us, Meteors, Stones, Mines and Minerals, Plants and Animals, and of every- thing useful for the Comfort, Convenience and Elegance of Life.\" The colonial colleges had an important in- fluence outside their classrooms. By bringing young men from different colonies together, they helped to break down local loyalties and to create a larger attachment to America. Their debating societies helped to train many of the men who later became the leaders of the Amer- ican Revolution. Science As the curriculum of King's College sug- gests, there was genuine and widesoread in- terest in science in the colonies. A professorship of science was established at William and Mary in 1711 and one at Harvard in 1727. The new physics and astronomy of Isaac Newton were taught in both institutions. Later, David Ritten- house of Philadelphia built the first American orrery, a moving mechanical model of the imi- verse that included the moons of Jupiter (see page 92). Some twenty-five Americans were elected members of the Royal Society, founded in London under the sponsorship of King Charles II to promote the advancement of sci- entific knowledge. Thus the Reverend Cotton Mather of Massachusetts sent to the society in- formation concerning rattlesnakes, rainbows, and variations in the magnetic needle. Mather learned how to inoculate against smallpox from his Negro servant, who had brought the knowl- edge with him from Africa. He practiced and promoted inoculation in spite of the denuncia- tion by other clergymen, who insisted that Mather was interfering with God's will, and of mobs, which surrounded his house and threat- ened bodily harm. John Bartram, a Philadelphia Quaker, was appointed botanist to George III; he supplied the royal horticultural gardens with American plants and shrubs."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Heritage of the Colonial Period 25 The Enlightenment This interest in science produced in Amer- ica, as in Europe, a new confidence in human reason \\\\'hich came to be known as the En- lightenment. Characteristic works of the En- lightenment widely read in America were those by the English philosopher John Locke, a friend of Newton. In An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Locke maintained that man could best gain knowledge of and power over the universe by obser\\ ation of the world around him and by experiment. In the second of two Treatises on Government, Locke taught that men were bom with certain \"natural rights\" to life, liberty, and property; that men formed governments to protect these rights; and that a government interfering with these might rightfulh' be o\\erthro\\\\Ti. Practical Amer- icans readily accepted his idea that government was the agent of the people, not their master. Schools and colleges were not the only edu- cational influences in the colonies. Newspapers, almanacs, books, and circulating hbraries all helped to raise the level of public information. Since paper and type were expensive and the reading public in America small, most books came from England. But by 1750 there were twenty-five or thirty newspapers, mostly four- page sheets, printed weekly. The subscription lists were never more than a few thousand, but readers were more numerous. Printed on tough rag paper, these newspapers were passed from hand to hand until half the men in a village often read a single copy at the local tavern. Colonial editors occasionally criticized Brit- ish laws or officials. In 1735, Peter Zenger of the New York Weekly Journal accused the royal governor of corruption. As a result, copies of the paper were publicly burnt by the sheriff, and Zenger was brought to trial on a charge of libel. His lawyer, Andrew Hamilton, argued that the editor was not guilty, since the charges against the governor were true, and since free speech was one of the rights of Englishmen. Zenger was acquitted. Later, the case came to be regarded as a landmark in the development of a free press in America, but at the time it was of less importance. During the colonial period, most newspapers made money by doing busi- ness for the colonial governments, and their editors were not likely to bite the hand that fed them. Until the eve of the American Revolu- tion, few found fault with their rulers. Almanacs attracted as many readers as newspapers. In addition to a calendar, dates of holidays, and times of sunset and sunrise, al- manacs published advice on farming, accounts of scientific discoveries, poems, jokes, news of the year, and practical advice. European travelers in America were amazed to find that pobtical discussions in public inns were joined intelligently by everybody from college-educated gentlemen to stableboys. The schools and other agencies of information had extended general knowledge and interest in pubhc affairs to a degree previously unknown. ENGLISH COLONIAL GOVERNMENT Crevecoeur attributed much of the pros- perity of Americans to freedom from govern- mental control. The degree of power exercised by British officials varied from colony to colony, but it was limited every\\vhere. In all colonies the voters elected their own legislature, and in \"charter\" colonies, such as Connecticut, their governor as well. In \"proprietary\" colonies, such as Pennsylvania, the governor was ap- pointed by the proprietor or by his heirs to whom the colony had been granted; in \"royal\" or \"crown\" colonies, such as Virginia, the governor was chosen by the king. The governor of a proprietary or crown colony had wide powers, such as a veto over the legislature and control of land grants. Yet he was often at the mercy of the legislature which might refuse to \\ote him his sahiry. (See chart, p. 12.)"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"26 A Free Country in a New World Government at the town and county levels was run entirely by the colonists themselves. In New England, the important local imit was the township, and all major decisions were in the hands of the town meeting, which most heads of families had a right to attend. The town meeting was (and is) one of the most demo- cratic types of government ever devised. In the southern and middle colonies, local government was usually less democratic, but nevertheless entirely independent of British control. None of the colonies was so democratic as to allow full political rights to all men or to any women. Active citizenship and the right to vote and hold office were everywhere limited to adult males owning property, who usually had to be members of the established church. In spite of these limitations, a higher proportion of people was involved in government in the English colonies than anywhere in the European world. This wdde participation gave Americans the idea that governments existed to serve them rather than to rule them. It also gave training that was valuable when the colonies later de- clared independence. The Acts of Trade and Navigation While allovraig her colonies to run local affairs pretty much as they pleased, Britain at- tempted to control their foreign trade in the interest of the British Empire as a whole. Here the basic idea was the same mercantile theory which Colbert put into effect in France (see p. 10). The Acts of Trade and Navigation, passed by Parliament in 1651 and repeat- edly amended, ruled that certain \"enumerated commodities,\" all of them goods that Britain lacked or produced in small quantity, must be sent to England. Among these were tobacco, cotton, indigo, and sugar. This was a profitable"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"PRODUaS OF THE ENGLISH COLONIES ABOUT 1750 NEW ENGLAND COLONIES arrangement for British merchants, who resold many of the enumerated commodities outside their own country. American ships returning from European ports were required to make a \"broken voyage,\" stopping at a British port on the way home to pay duty on goods acquired on the Continent before returning to America. By raising the price of non-British goods, this widened the colonial market for British prod- ucts. The Navigation Acts said that all trade within the British Empire should be carried in British ships. This helped colonial shippers, however, because in this case they were given the same rights as inhabitants of the British Isles. A number of British laws were clearly de- signed to help special groups at the expense of the thirteen colonies. The Molasses Act of 1733 was designed to help the owners of sugar plantations in the British West Indies, by putting a heavy tax on the import of sugar and molasses from any other source. To protect the farmers of the mother country from competi- tion, the export of grain from the colonies to England was forbidden. Large-scale manu- facturing in the colonies was prohibited in order to prevent competition with British manu- facturers. One British law forbade the export of hats from the colonies; another, the con- struction of steel and iron works. Benjamin Frankhn expressed himself sarcastically on this kind of legislation: A colonist cannot make a button, a horse shoe, nor a hobnail but some sooty ironmonger or re- spectable buttonmaker of Britain shall bawl and squall that his honor's worship is . . . maltreated, injured, cheated and robbed by the rascally Amer- icans. In spite of all these laws, Britain regulated colonial tiade much less strictly than did other European nations. The English colonies might ship their fish, lumber, grain, and furs wher- ever they could find a market. Certain laws SOUTHERN COLONIES Even in the self-sufficient economy of colonial life, each section produced some staple that It could ex- port. Common to all sections were furs, for which there was a constant demand in Europe. were designed to help the colonists, such as the one ruling that no British merchant could buy tobacco except in the colonies, and that tobacco might not be grown in England itself. British regulations were seldom strictly en- forced. Revenue oflBcers, receiving their posi- tions through political pull, often did not bother to go to America, but hired deputies. In regard to the Molasses Act, the British pursued a policy of \"salutary neglect,\" and did not provoke colonial resistance by trying to enforce the law. The colonists naturally got into the habit of evading British legislation, and smuggling as- smned the position of a long-estabhshed right. When smugglers were occasionally brought to court, colonial juries seldom found them guilty, no matter how strong the evidence. Although British trade regulations were de- hberately designed to subordinate the colonies to the mother cotmtry, on balance they may have helped as much as they hindered. The colonists benefited from those regulations that favored them and evaded those that hurt them. But if ever the latter should be enforced, there were certain to be outcries in America."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"28 A Free Country in a New World BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, PRINTER In 1706 a child destined to achieve world- wide fame was bom to a candle- and soap- maker in Boston, Massachusetts. Benjamin Franklin was a tenth child, and his family was so poor that he went to work at the age of ten after only two years of school. But he had little need of schooling, since from boyhood until death he never stopped teaching himself. To escape family jealousy caused by his superior abilities, Ben ran away to Philadelphia at the age of seventeen. His possessions on en- tering the city of which he later became the most famous citizen consisted of the clothes on his back and a few copper coins. He had no diflBculty making a living, however, because he was already a skilled printer. Before long he was the best and busiest printer in the colonies. He_ published a ^ii.e\\vsiiaper, the Permsi/Ivania Gazette, which enjoyed a large sale partly be- cause he criticized British officials. As Postmaster of Pennsylvania, and later of the thirteen colonies, Franklin greatly im- proved the mail service, even to the extent that a merchant might send a letter to New York one day and get a reply the next. His best- known business venture.

Franklin acted on the principles of Poor Richard so successfully that he was wealthy at forty, and at the same time did much to ad- vance the welfare of Philadelphia. He helped organize the first police force and the first fire department in the colonies. He promoted a circulating library, debating societies, a city hospital, street lighting, and better paving. A true child of the Enlightenment, Frank- lin had tremendous intellectual energy and curiosity. He taught himself French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Latin. He in\\estigated the temperature of the Gulf Stream, the effect of lime on soil fertility, and the direction of storms. His electrical experiments made him world famous. He developed the theory of positive and negative charges, constructed an effective battery, and proved that lightning was an electrical phenomenon. Indeed, it has been said that Frankhn \"found electricity a curiosity and left it a science.\" He made his discoveries serve humanity by putting them to immediate practical use— hence the lightning rod, the bi- focal lens, and the Franklin stove. He sought no money from these, but was honored both here and abroad, being elected to every important scientific societv in Europe. He also founded the American Philosophical Society to promote scientific advance. During his latter years, Franklin spent many years abroad in public service. From 1757 to 1775, he spent all but two years in Britain, as an agent explaining the colonial point of view to the British government. From 1776 to 1785, he was the first minister from the United States to France, and after his return took part in making the Constitution. During his many years abroad he was in constant association with im- portant people and received many honors, yet never let his head be turned. Continuing to refer to himself as \"Benjamin Franklin, Printer,\" he remained the same busy, patient, humorous person he had always been. Europeans were tremendously impressed with Franklin because he seemed to represent what Crevecoeur meant when he said that \"a modem society\" had developed in America. Here was a man with no advantages of birth or formal education, who spoke as an equal with European kings and scholars. Franklin's career seemed proof that a free society helped human beings to develop their highest capacities."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Ben Franklin, American Genius Franklin's versatility is evidenced in his many inven- tions, including the Franklin stove and the lightning rod.

They are also designed to lead you on to further exploration. Different classes and different individuals will use these suggested activities in different ways, but the important thing if you want to enjoy history and do well in it is to learn to study actively. When you are asked to compare some- thing tuith something else, for instance, think of both similarities and differ- ences. Also, try to make your own comparisons and connections. Since a textbook by its nature must point out only the principal landmarks and mtist sometimes oversimplify complex events, treat it critically. Don't hesitate to question the text or to look for places where it omits information. In this first chapter the purposes of each section are explained, so that you may know how to make more intelligent use of them.

The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. JOHN ADAMS The American Revolution was an unforeseen event. The people of the thirteen colonies had prospered under the mild rule of Britain and had seemed devoted to George III, who came to the British throne in 1760 and who was known to his affectionate subjects as \"fanner George.\" Benjamin Franklin, who knew as much as anyone about colonial opinion, later wrote, \"I never heard in any Conversation from any person drunk or sober the least Expression of a wish for Separation or Hint that such a thing would be advantageous to America.\" Two centuries later historians still argue why the freest colonies of any European nation were the first to rebel. In any case, the revolution had its origins far back in the colonial period. By the mid-1700's most Americans of Eng- lish descent were three to six generations re- moved from their immigrant ancestors. The original settlers themselves had not been the most loyal Engbsh subjects, since many came here to escape poverty, or imprisonment. Other settlers, such as the Dutch, the Irish, and the Germans, had been either indifferent or anti- British from the first. The colonies had been foimded v.'ith httle help from the British government and had de- veloped their prosperous agricultuu-e and ex- tensive trade on their own initiative. In a fertile area many times larger than the mother country, they were doubling their population every twenty-five or thirty years. They had learned to govern themselves. Above all, they had developed a sense that they were different;} from Europeans— more free, more able to rise in the world by their own exertions. Ten years before the Americans deciared their independ- ence, John Adams wrote, \"I always consider the ^ settlement of America as the opening of a grand _, scheme and design in Providence for the illu- mination of the ignorant and the emancipation of the slavish part of mankind all over the _ earth.\" One great tie holding the Americans to the mother country was the need for protection. Without aid from Great Britain they had diffi- culty defending themselves from the French in Canada. Not until France was expelled from North America did the thirteen colonies take the road to revolution. 32"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Road to Revolution 33 THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN FRANCE AND ENGLAND In 1689 England and France began a contest that went on for generations with only short intervals of peace. It was on a world-wide scale, with acti\\e military operations in Europe and the Mediterranean, in the East Indies and India, in the Caribbean and North America. The long rivalry for the control of North Amer- ica was a drama full of excitement and horror played against the romantic backgroimd of a vast wilderness. Francis Parkman, Historian The heroism of the men who engaged in the struggle for a continent was hardly greater than that of the man who best described it. As a sophomore in college, Francis Parkman ( 1823-1893 ) made it is his Ufe's aim to tell the story of the rise and fall of the French empire in America. He achieved his ambition— although it took him fifty years-in spite of eyesight so poor that he could only read through a mag- nifying glass and such a fragile physique that he could sometimes write only five or six lines a day. To learn about Indian life, he went west and hved with a party of Sioux Indians along the Oregon Trail. The ten books resulting from this courageous life of effort are still read be- cause Parkman was both a great historian and a great storyteller. Comparative Strength of Britain and France The Anglo-French contest for North Amer- ica had two phases. Between 1689 and 1713 oc- curred wars known in the thirteen colonies as King William's War and Queen Anne's War, in Europe as the War of the League of Augsburg and the War of the Spanish Succession. At the close of this first phase. Great Britain gained Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Hudson's Bay Territor>' ( see map, p. .35 ) . The second phase, from 1742 to 1763, included the wars known in the colonies as King George's War ( 1742- 1748) and the French and Indian War (1754- 1763); in Europe they were called the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War. This ended in complete victory for Britain, with the French giving up all their holdings on the mainland of North America. It is not as difficult to see why Great Britain won the war in America as it is to understand why France was able to hold out so long. The British colonies were many times more popu- lous than the French, and the British navy generally had control of the sea, over which supplies and troops were sent to America. The French, however, had the great advantage of a unified command; on the other hand the thirteen colonies were highly independent of one another. In 1754, on the eve of the Seven Years' War, delegates from seven northern colonies met at Albany to find some means of union. Benjamin Franklin presented to the conference a remarkable document, the so-called Albany Plan of Union. Franklin proposed that tiie col- onies form a Grand Council to deal vvdth Indian relations, new settlements, raising troops, and taxes for defense. The actions of this inter- colonial legislature would be subject to the veto of the British crown. The plan never went through because both the colonial and British governments feared loss of power. The re-\\ suiting lack of cooperation handicapped the war effort. American militiamen would seldom! consent to serve outside their own colony. Colonies evaded taxes imposed by Britain for their own defense, nor would they tax them- seh'es. Colonial merchants and ship captains continued illegal trade with the French West Indies."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"34 A Free Country in a New World The French and Indian War The final round of the great struggle began in the Ohio Valley. In the mid-eighteenth cen- tury the French, determined to possess this rich and beautiful area, drove out English fur traders. In J253 they built Fort Duquesne at the point where the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers meet to form the Ohio River. Fort Du- quesne, in territory claimed by both Virginia and Pennsylvania, was a threat to these col- onies and a barrier to their expansion westward. In 1754 a force of 150 Virginia militiamen imder the command of young Major George Washing- ton advanced on the fort and ambushed a party of French troops sent out to scout them. But later, the French captured Washington's en- tire force at Fort Necessity. Thus hostihties be- gan without a declaration of war. In the next year, the English General Edward Braddock, commanding 1,300 men, advanced again only to suffer a defeat even more disastrous than Washington's. Two-thirds of Braddoclc's force were killed or woimded, and he himself was mortally wounded. He was buried on the line of march; the survivors with their baggage trains passed over his grave, obhterating all traces of it, so that the Indian allies of the French might not find the body and mutilate it. Disasters continued after Great Britain and France formally declared war in 1756. French Canada had a great mihtary commander in General Louis Montcalm, while British generals were poorly chosen. Utter failure met British expeditions seeking to advance on Montreal by way of Lake George and Lake Champlain and to take the French fort of Louisburg on Cape Breton Island (see map, p. 35). These setbacks coincided with equally severe defeats else- where. All along the frontier the Indian aUies of the French attacked outlying settlements, massacring men, women, and children. They even wiped out a settlement only sixty miles from Philadelphia. In the midst of disaster, WiUiam Pitt, Eng- land's greatest war minister before Winston Churchill, came to power. Pitt's supreme self- confidence was expressed in the famous sen- tence, \"I know that I can save this coimtry and that no one else can.\" Immediately he instilled new vigor into the British war effort. By the end of the \\ear 1758, Louisburg and Fort Du- quesne were in British hands; and in June 1759, a British army of 9,000 men was en- camped on the St. Lawrence River a few miles below the great fortress of Quebec. The Fall of Quebec, 1759 The British forces at Quebec were com- manded by James Wolfe, an able yoimg oflBcer whom Pitt had advanced from heutenant colo- nel to temporary major general in less than two years. For over two months, Wolfe tried in vain to find a weak spot in the defenses of \"the Gibraltar of America.\" Time was running short, for winter would soon set in. Finally the Eng- lish commander hit upon a plan so daring that his staff refused to approve of it. This was to land at night and scale a wooded cliff almost tmder the guns of the fortress. Wolfe gambled on surprise, suspecting that the French would not have a strong guard at a point considered completely safe from attack. As Wolfe sat with his oflBcers the night before the assault, he perhaps foresaw his death the next day, for he read them Thomas Gray's recently published poem, \"Elegy Written in a Coimtry Church- yard,\" emphasizing the verse: The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power. And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave. Await alike th' inevitable hour: The paths of glor\\' lead but to the grave.

Mont- calm was qtiick to gather a force to meet them. In the ensuing battle, the volleys of the British infantry mowed down the French and Cana- dians, who were driven back into the town and forced to surrender. Both commanders were mortally woimded in the battle. The fall of Quebec meant the end of the French empire in North America. The Peace of Paris, 1763 Great Britain was equally successful else- where, and by the Peace of Paris, which ended the Seven Years' War in 1763, she secured control of the largest amount of territory ever gained by a single nation in a single treaty. From France, Great Britain obtained all of Canada not yielded earlier, and all the eastern watershed of the Mississippi. From Spain, France's ally, Great Britain gained Florida. To repay Spain for her losses, France transferred the Louisiana Territory to her at this time, although in 1800 Napoleon took it back, just before selling it to the United States. On the other side of the globe, Britain gained a dom- inant position in India. It is no wonder that Englishmen were dazzled by the briUiance of their triumph. \"Bum up your Greek and Roman books, histories of little peoplel\" exulted the English author Horace Walpole. From this time dated England's sense of being a great im- perial power with a mission to hold \"dominion over palm and pine.\" The French defeat was as bitter as the Brit- ish victory was exciting. One hundred and fifty years of colonization, all the enterprise and heroism of her great pioneers, missionaries, and soldiers had proved utterly fruitless. There was only one small crumb of comfort— the thirteen colonies might revolt. A French statesman likened them to a \"ripe fruit,\" ready to drop off the bough. Within two years after the Peace of Paris, secret agents of the French government were travehng through the English colonies to investigate the chances of a revolution. With the coming of peace in 1763, Benjamin Franklin wrote verses to celebrate the loyalty of the colonies: Know ye, bad neighbors, who aim to divide The sons from the mother, that she's still our pride. And if ye attack her, we're all on her side. Which nobody can deny, deny. Which nobody can deny. Thirteen years later Franklin had completely reversed himself: he was a member of the Con- tinental Congress that declared America's in- dependence of Britain and was fighting a war to make it good. He had been caught up in a revolution. Ask anyone today what comes to mind when you say the words, \"American Rev- olution,\" and you will usually get^me such \"answer as \"redcoats,\" \"Yorktown,\" or \"Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes.\" People natvually think of the Revolution in terms of the war against Great Britain.

The down much more than British had a new the English colonies. Why sense that they didn't they revolt first? must rule their colonies. The for- mer slipshod practice of leaving them pretty much alone should be replaced by strict and efficient control. British taxpayers, furthermore, felt that the Americans should pay a fair share of the immense cost of the \\'ictory over France. ENGLAND TIGHTENS CONTROL The new British attitude was apparent as soon as the Seven Years' War came to an end. It showed itself in stricter enforcement of exist- ing laws, in attempts to tax the colonies, in an effort to take over control of the West, and in attacks on colonial rights of self-government. Stricter Enforcement of Laws George Grenville, British minister of finance from 1763 until 1765, was an energetic admin- istrator who beheved that existing laws should be enforced. He was said to be the first min- ister in a generation who read the dispatches from American revenue collectors and so was really aware of the degree to which the Amer- icans had become habitual smugglers. The reve- nue service in the thirteen colonies was costing the British government four times as much as it collected in customs duties I During Grenville's term of office, customs men were required to go to their posts in Amer- ica rather than stay in England and hire dep- uties. They were armed with Writs of Assist- -^ ance— general search warrants allowing them to seek smuggled goods without swearing out a particular warrant for every building they entered. British men-of-war helped in the sup- pression of smuggling, and alleged smugglers were tried in Admiralty Courts, where the accused person had no right of trial by jury and the judges pocketed five per cent of the fines they imposed. New Taxation Between the years 1764 and 1767, the Par- hament levied new taxes designed to shift part of the burden of the war debt from British land- owners to the colonists. Never before had the British government seriously tried to raise reve- nue in America. The idea of previous taxes had not been so much to collect money as to steer colonial trade into channels that would make it profitable to England or to other por- tions of her empire. Grenville increased the number of enumer- ated commodities that had to be shipped to the mother country; this reduced the profits of colonial trade with Europe. He persuaded Par- liament to pass laws levying new duties on colonial imports, the most important of these being the Sugar Act of 1764. This law cut in half the rates of the Molasses Act of 1733 (see p. 27). The British government had winked at evasions of the earher act; the appalling thing about the new one was that it was likely to be enforced. It would reduce the profits of the trade with the Spanish and French West In- dies that brought much-needed specie (gold and silver) into the colonies. In the same year as the Sugar Act, Parhament forbade colonial governments to issue paper money, so that specie became scarcer than ever. Caught in a"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"38 A Free Country in a New World \"two-way squeeze\" of lower profits and scarcity of money, many colonial merchants faced bank- ruptcy. In 1765 Parliament, on Grenville's advice, passed the famous Stamp Act designed to raise revenue within the colonies themselves instead of through customs duties collected at the ports. It required that stamps be aflBxed to 54 kinds of articles and documents, including wills, play- ing cards, newspapers, dice, almanacs, and licenses. Duties ranged from 1 cent on news- papers to $10 for college diplomas. Payment was to be made in specie. Whereas the previous laws devised by Grenville affected principally those engaged in foreign trade, especially in New England, the Stamp Act angered colonists everywhere. It especially affected those best able to stir up feeling against it: laviyers, news- paper editors, and ministers. On the day it was supposed to go into effect, men and women wore mourning, and church bells tolled in towns all the way from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to Savannah, Georgia. For reasons shortly to be described, the Stamp Act proved to be vmenforceable and was repealed in 1766. In 1767 the so-called Townshend Act attempted to raise revenue by import duties on tea, paper, glass, and paint. These could not be collected either, and all the Townshend duties except the tax on tea were repealed in 1770. British Attempt to Control the West In 1763 the violent Indian uprising known as Pontiac's Rebellion broke out in the West. Pontiac, one of the greatest Indian leaders, had foreseen that the defeat of France by Britain meant a hard fate for his people. The French had traded with the Indians, protected them, intermarried with them; the ever-advancing settlers of the British colonies threatened to wipe them out. Pontiac's Rebelhon began with simultaneous surprise attacks on the English posts beyond the Appalachians, destroying eight of eleven. It was suppressed by British regulars, specially trained in wilderness fight- ing, after nearly two years of warfare. To pacify the frontier and prevent American pioneers from being massacred, the British gov- ernment issued the Proclamation of 1763, where- by all settlement west of a line running along the crest of the Appalachian Mountains should cease (see map, p. 43). The entire western region was to be reserved for Indians. Although this was alleged to be a temporary measure, some members of the British government hoped it would be permanent. It would divert settlers to Georgia or Nova Scotia \"where they could be useful to their Mother Country instead of plant- ing themselves in the Heart of America out of reach of Government where, from the great difficulty of procuring European commodities, they would be compelled to engage in com- merce and manufactures to the infinite prejudice of Britain.\" Although the Americans at first ac- cepted the Proclamation of 1763 as a means of averting bloodshed, they later resented it. They claimed that it deprived them of land rightfully theirs for settlement and interfered with the charter rights of colonies whose grants extended \"from sea to sea.\" American interests, it ap- peared, were being sacrificed in order to fill the pockets of British fiu- traders who wished to see the Indians undisturbed. Threats to Colonial Self-Government There could be no question that the British government now pursued a deliberate policy of increasing its power within the thirteen col- onies. Grenville's new customs collectors and admiralty judges were followed by ten thousand British regulars, for whom the colonists were re- quired to provide barracks and supplies. These troops were sent, it was said, to protect the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"THE RISING TIDE OF COLONIAL DISCONTENT Declaration of Independence \\ \"Common Sense' \\ 2nd Continental Congress Lexington and Concord \\ \\/ 1st Continental Congress \\ Repeal of Stamp Act Townshend Duties Intolerable IQQ Acts S^ Boston Tea Party Repeal of Townshend Duties / J 1743 ^1745 1775 1774"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"^mm \\ i^ ii«£%&%.%^ _^ v1L« f f i f t5!ff!^ T^ie Neu) YorA: Public Library Revere's depiction of the landing of British troops in Boston harbor In 1768.

The French had been defeated and the Indians pacified. The redcoats, hirthermore, were not stationed in frontier posts, but in towns such as Boston and New York, where there was no more danger from Indians than in London or Paris. The British motive for sending the redcoats may have been simply to find a way of taking care of veterans, but they also served to strengthen the hand of colonial governors and to overawe colonial legislatures. That the British were eager to free royal oflBcials from colonial control could be seen by the shifting of customs cases to the Admiralty 40 Covuls. In 1767 the Townshend Acts provided that British judges and governors were to be paid out of customs revenues collected by British revenue oflBcers. No longer could colo- nial legislatures restrain royal governors by holding up their salaries. When colonial legislatures became centers of resistance to British measures, royal gov- ernors prevented them from meeting. Thus the New York legislature was suspended in 1767 for protesting against the quartering of red- coats in the colony, and the Massachusetts leg- islatiu-e suffered the same fate in 1768 for issu- ing a Circular Letter which asked other colonies to join with Massachusetts in resisting the Townshend Act. Such actions denied the Amer- icans' long-established rights of self-government. AMERICAN RESISTANCE The efforts of the British government to tighten control met resistance so determined that it surprised even the Americans them- selves. It took a variety of forms, including simple disobedience of British laws, formal pro- tests against British violations of American rights, increased cooperation among the thirteen colonies, boycotts, and violence. Disobedience of British Laws The Americans, long used to evading British revenue laws, did not hesitate to evade the new ones. In spite of a more vigorous customs service, smuggling went on much as usual. The coast of America was so long that revenue of- ficers could not inspect all ships landing, especially when the local inhabitants were con- stantly working to thwart them. When the ten thousand redcoats were sent to America, Parliament passed the Mutiny Act of 1765, which directed the colonies to provide the soldiers with barracks and supplies. The New York and Massachusetts legislatures flatly"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"refused to vote the necessary money, regarding the act as a concealed means of taxation, and most other colonies foimd means of evading it. The Proclamation of 1763, forbidding trans- Appalachian settlement, was flouted by the Americans. In the long years of bitter Indian warfare that started with the struggle for the Ohio Valley, there had developed a new breed of frontiersmen, as familiar with the udldemess as the Indians they had fought, as brave and as wily in warfare, and as contemptuous of all direction from above. Governor Dunmore of Virginia wTOte to England of the impossibility of controlling these men: I have leamt from experience that the estab- lished authority of any government in America, and the policy of government at home, are both insufficient to restrain the Americans They ac- quire no attachment to place; But wandering about seems engrafted in their nature; and it is a weak- ness incident to it, that they should forever im- magine the Lands farther off are still better than those upon which they are already Settled. . . . impressed from earliest infancy with Sentiments and habits, very different from those acquired by persons of a Similar condition in England, they do not conceive that Government has any right to forbid their taking possession of a Vast Tract of Countr>', either uninhabited, or which serves as a shelter to a few scattered tribes of Indians. It was in this period, when the Proclamation of 1763 supposedly forbade them, that the colonists mdde their first settlements across the Appalachians (see map, p. 43). Formal Protests Against British Violations of American Rights Simple disobedience was not enough to meet the crisis presented by Britain's measures.

Such argu- ments appeared again and again in resolutions by town meetings by colonial legis- latures, and by the Staing__A.ct Congress, a meet- ing of colonial representatives in New York in 1765. The colonists revealed extraordinary awareness of the tradition of English liberties as embodied in such documents as Magna Carta (1215) and the Bill of Rights (1689). How strongly they felt is suggested by a resolution voted by the town meeting of Newburyport, Mass. Although professing loyalty to George III, it flady repudiated the St amp Act in these terms: That a People should be taxed at the Will of another, whether of one man or many, without their own Consent is Rank Slavery. For if their Superior sees fit, they may be deprived of their whole Prop- erty, upon any frivolous Pretext, or without any Pretext at all. Intercolonial Cooperation Hitherto there had been very little cooper- ation among the thirteen colonies. The first time they ever seriously united on anything was in resisting the Stamp Act. A committee of the Massachusetts legislature sent letters to leaders of the other colonial legislatures urging that all send delegates to a convention of all the col- onies to decide on a common poUcy toward the British government. As a result, the Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765. Nine state legislatures were represented, and the others sent word that they, approved of the venture. The delegates drew up a set of reso- lutions and organized a general boycott of British-made goods. Unity was promoted in Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, by John Dickinson, published in the Pennsylvania Gazette in 1767 and 1768. Dickinson argued that the people of the thirteen colonies, \"sepa- rated from the rest of the world, and firmly bound together by the same rights, interests, and dangers,\" formed \"one political body of which each colony is a member.\" In 1768 the Massachusetts legislature helped to get common action against the Townshend Act by issuing a Circular Letter calling on all the other state legislatures to join with them in protest against the measure. The new spirit o.f cooperation was accom- panied and given strength by a rising spirit of patriotism. In a speech to the Stamp Act Con- gress, Christopher Gadsden of South Carolina declared, \"There ought to be no New England Man, no New Yorker, kno\\vn on the continent, but all of us Americans.\" At the Princeton Col- lege commencement in 1771, Philip Freneau delivered a poem, 'The Rising Glory j)i America,\" that revealed his optimistic faith in: The rising glory of this western world. Where now the dawning light of science spreads Her orient ray, and wakes the muse's song; Where freedom holds her sacred standard high. And commerce rolls her golden tides profuse Of elegance and ev'ry joy of Ufe. An American nation was coming into being. Boycotts and Violence Colonial protests against the Stamp Act were given real bite because they were ac- companied by an effective boycott of Enghsh goods. Men and women made solemn promises to wear homespun instead of British woolens, and merchants signed agreements to buy nothing from* England until the unpopular law"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"should be repealed. Soon imports from England dropped to the lowest point in a generation, and British merchants, saying that they were faced with \"utter ruin,\" besieged Parhament with petitions against the Stamp Act. Under such pressure, Parhament repealed the la w in 1766 . Although most of the leaders of colonial resistance to the measures of the British Parha- ment were members of the colonial upper classes, they received assistance from an organ- ization of small shopkeepers, clerks, and artisans known as the Sons of Liberty, with a female auxihary, the Daughters of Liberty. The Sons of Liberty, who formed the \"action wing\" of the \"of ganized resistance, kept watch on shop- keepers suspected of selling British goods and pubhcly denounced those they caught or threatened them with bodily harm.

In New York a crowd of three thousand men wrecked the house of an unpopular British officer. Such actions succeeded in cowing British sympathizers into silence, but they also frightened many who favored the American cause. Colonial leaders attempted to prevent their recurrence. At the time that Parliament repealed the Stamp Act, it passed the so-c alled D eclaratory ActjiS? which it claimed full power \"to bind the colonies and people of America, subjects of the crown of Great Britain, in all cases whatsoever.\" Parliament was following the principle of this law when it passed the Townshend Act in 1767. The Townshend duties differed from the stamp duties in being ext ernal tax es on imports which, it was hoped, would irritate the Americans less than an internal tax. But the colonists argued that any law designed to raise revenue from them without their consent was a violation of their hberties. Again they voted non-importa- tion agreements.

Eager for unrest and controversy, they search for incidents that can be blown up into conflicts. Sam Adams was such a man — and as such became one of the architects of the American Revolution. Just possibly, without his constant efforts, there would have been no break with Britain. Why did this Harvard-trained pro- vincial lawyer l<eep agitating against England even after the Stamp Act and Townshend duties were no longer in effect? To be sure, he had personal reasons for disliking the British. His father had been a principal stockholder of the Land Bank organized in Massachusetts in 1740; when Parliament destroyed the bank, the family's fortunes were ruined. This seemed to flavor Sam's entire career, for, as Machiavelli wrote, \"It is better to kill a man's father than to destroy his inheritance.\" Certainly Sam hated the tyranny of an aristocratic government of privilege. And, just as ardently, he believed in liberty. Adams was perhaps the first American to fully understand the power of pub- licity. Using many pen names, he wrote untiringly against the government. He organized committees to take advantage of widespread colonial discontent. He stirred up the committees to write tracts and pamphlets on colonial rights to appeal to the educated. In town meetings he whipped up inflammatory debates and reso- lutions. The Sons of Liberty organized the artisans and craftsmen; the minutemen pledged instant action when needed. Constantly alert, this \"Bostonian in home- spun\" was an instigator of it .all. Considering his social class, Sam Adams might have been expected to be a conservative, even a Loyalist. But he was not, and the American Revolution perhaps came when and as it did because he was not. (Theme 2, see p. xi)"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Road to Revolution 45 duced homespun rioth. New England ministers organized the women of their congregations in great spinning contests. On one occasion, over a hundred Daughters of Libertji ran spinning wheels all day, while hundreds of spectators cheered them on. Perhaps never before in his- tory had so many women taken an active role in politics. In 1770 Parliament gave in a second time, retaining only the tea duty as a symbol that it was not giving up the right to tax the colonies. In 1770 the first clash between Americans and British troops took place. Two regiments of redcoats had been sent to Boston to support the governor and to overawe the radicals who, led by Samuel Adams, were making Massa- chusetts a center of opposition to Britain. One evening a squad of soldiers, .commanded by a Captain Preston, was set upon by 50 or 60 men and boys led by a powerful Negro, Crispus At- tucks. The redcoats fired into the crowd, with- out orders, killing five men, including Attucks. Later a colonial jurv' acquitted Captain Preston and all but tvvo of the soldiers, who were found guilty of manslaughter. It is ironic that a member of a race deprived of freedom became the first martyr of the American Revolution. The event became known as the \"Boston Massacre\" and has come down in history as the first physical resistance to the British. British still held that Parfiament had the right to legislate for the colonies \"in all cases what- soever.\" The Americans, while admitting some vague parliamentary right to regulate their trade, continued to insist that they were no more obliged to pay taxes levied by Parliament than Englishmen had to pay those levied by the Virginia House of Burgesses. That the calm would not last indefinitely was indicated by occasional acts of violence. In 1771 a British customs schooner that had taken a smugglers' ship into custody was attacked at night. The captive ship was released, the cus- toms men locked into their o\\\\ti hold, and their schooner badly damaged. When another British revenue boat, the Gaspee, ran aground off Rhode Island, \"persons unknown\" attacked and burned it. Meanwhile the men who led the resistance to British measures were improving their or- ganization. Starting in Virginia and Massachu- setts, imder the leadership of such able agi- tators as Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams, they formed \"committees of correspondence\" in towns throughout the colonies. In forming this network, they were greatly assisted by the eflBciency of the British intercolonial postal service that Franklin had organized. By keep- ing in constant touch with each other, these committees enabled the radicals to work out common policies and common lines of action. CALM FOLLOWED BY STORM From 1770 to 1773 there was a lull in the controversy between Great Britain and the thirteen colonies. Having won relief from some taxes, the Americans allowed the British to col- lect others. The colonial boycott on tea was retained, but was widely violated. Imports of British goods rose from 8 million dollars in 1768 to 21 million dollars in 1771. The basic issues had not, however, been settled. The The Boston Tea Party, 1773 The three-year truce came to an end with the so-called Boston Tea Part^^ This started a chain of events leading directly to war and a breaking of the tie between England and the colonies. In 1773 the British East India Company was in difficulties for several reasons, among them being a terrible famine in the Indian province of Bengal, shrinking of the American tea market, and mismanagement.

To save the East India Company, Parliament voted to relieve it of all taxes on tea at home and to grant it a monopoly of the American market. At the insistence of Lord North, the prime minister, the three-penny per pound tax on tea imported into the colonies was retained. Even so, the company would be able to under- sell tea smuggled in from France or Holland. The move would thus be a blow to colonial tea merchants. The announcement of the new plan pro- duced an immediate outcry in America. It was argued that if Parliament could give the East India Company a monopoly of trade in tea, it could arrange for monopolizing other commod- ities as well. Old rehgious fears came into the controversy. There had been rumors that the English government would appoint a bishop to preside over the Anglican chiu-ches in America, and that then the other Christian sects would be placed in the subordinate place they held in England.

At none of the four ports where it was to be landed— Charleston, \"Phila- delphia, New York, and Boston— did the com- pany sell a poimd. At New York and Phila- delphia the tea ships were forced to turn back. At Charleston the tea was kept in a warehouse until after the Revolutionary War broke out. In Boston a great protest meeting in the Old South Meeting House was followed by the famous \"tea party.\" Radicals disguised as In- dians boarded the tea ships and threw 342 chests of tea, valued at $75,000, into \"the harbor. The Intolerable Acts Benjamin Frankhn called the Boston Tea Party \"an act of violent injustice,\" and some Boston merchants were willing to take up a subscription to pay for the damage. To the British government, it was an act of lawless- ness that had to be severely punished. Thomas Gage, an oflScer with long service in the col- onies, told George III, \"They will be Lions whilst we are Lambs, but if we take the resolute part they will undoubtedly prove very meek.\" Acting on this advice, in March 1774, Parlia- ment passed what the colonists called thejn; tolerable ^Acts. They provided (1) ihat the port of Boston should be closed to shipping until. the tea was paid for; (2) that British oflBcials accused of violence in carrying out their duties should be tried in English courts rather than American; (3) that troops might be quartered in any town in Massachusetts- even in private homes; and ( 4 ) that the Massa- chusetts charter should be so amended as to greatly reduce the colony's right of self-gov- ernment. Town meetings, for instance, could not be held more than once a year without spe- cial permission from the royal governor. Thus, the city of Boston and the whole colony of Massachusetts were to suffer severely for the actions of a handful of unknown men.

In the excited state of American opinion the first two provisions seemed to prophesy abolition of jury trials and of the Protestant religion in the thirteen col- onies unless the power of Parliament was checked. The change of boundaries seemed an attempt to exclude American settlers perma- nentlv from western lands; it also violated char- ter claims of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia. The Intolerable Acts revealed that the British government now intended once and for all to show the Americans who was master. This was partly because of the attitude of George III. George III Tries to \"Be a King\" During the reigns of George Ill's predeces- sors, George I and George II, the direction of English affairs had been taken over by the leaders of Parliament.

Members who voted as the king wished received government jobs with large salaries and few duties. By 1770 the king's power had become so great that Lord North, his personal nominee, became prime minister. George III did not begin the quarrel be- tween the British government and the colonies, but he intensified it because he came to be- lieve that they must be ruled with a strong hand. After the Boston Tea Party he refused any compromise. \"The colonies,\" he said, \"must submit or triimiph.\" THE FIRST CONTINENTAL CONGRESS The British Parhament had passed the In- tolerable Acts in the expectation that the other American colonies would agree to Massachu- setts being justly punished. William Pitt (now Lord Chatham) had warned, however, that the acts would give the colonies new reason to unite. Chatham proved to be right. The Intol- erable Acts convinced many Americans that the men who ruled Britain were engaged in a conspiracy to extinguish their liberties. What happened to Massachusetts could easily hap- pen elsewhere. Other colonies came to her aid, and hundreds of cartloads of food were sent to Boston to enable the city to hold out. AH the colonies except Georgia sent delegates to the First Continental Congress, which held its first ' session in Philadelphia in September 1774. The Congress acted much as the Americans had done before in resisting the Stamp Act and the Townshend Act. It petitioned the king for rehef from the Intolerable Acts, and cut off trade vtdth England until they should be re- pealed. A Declaration of Rights and Grievances was designed to appeal to moderate men in that its tone was reasonable and it expressed devotion to George III. But it denoimced every step taken by Britain since 1763 to raise reve- nue or to tighten control as violating colonial charters or the colonists' rights as Englishmen. \"The Association\" The new boycott established by the First Continental Congress proposed to cut off ex- ports to Britain as well as imports. To make the colonies able to bear such a self-inflicted blow to their commerce, the Congress urged Americans to set up local manufactures. Ap- pealing to the spirit of self-sacrifice, the Con- gress also resolved to \"discourage every species of extravagance and dissipation, especially all horse-racing, and all lands of gambling, cock- fighting, exhibitions of shows, plays and other extensive diversions and entertainments.\" For the enforcement of its rules the Congress tried to set up \"in every county, city, and town,\" an organization known as \"the Association.\" By the very nature of its task the Association ex- erted a surprising degree of control over Amer- icans, telling them what they should eat, drink, and wear, as well as how they should behave in public. The Association was extraordinarily effective; imports of British goods into New York, for instance, dropped from over two mil- hon dollars in 1774 to six thousand dollars in 1775. Meanwhile in every colony a volunteer army was organizing, and military stores were being collected. In New England, minutemen assem- bled to drill on village greens, while the town oflBcials gathered powder, ball, uniforms, and food. In Philadelphia a group of young men formed a company called \"the Quaker Blues\" and were \"read out of meeting\" for violation of the Quaker stand against war. In the southern colonies, wealthy planters imdertook to recruit and equip companies of men at their own ex- pense.

The Battle of Bunker Hill, as it came to be called, was a moral victory for the Americans because their mihtiamen had stood up to professional troops.

Asked by what authority he made such a demand, he replied, \"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress.\" So says his own account; other sources hint that his language could not have been repeated in polite society. Ticonderoga's conqueror was a real adventurer. A man of gargantuan strength, with showy manners and a taste for fine clothes, he was a frequent speechmaker and a natural leader. He had gone into the back country of New England with his brothers to speculate in land. There, he was made the \"commander\" of the local militia — the Green f^^ountain Boys. Vermont, lying between New Hampshire and New York, was claimed by both colonies, but the residents rejected all outside rule. Rough pioneers, they resented any decisions they had not helped to make. They insisted that Vermont be separate from any other colony — and, after independence, from any other state. They defied the British Privy Council, the Continental Congress, Governor Clinton, and General Washington. Stoutly, they fought the British at Ticonderoga and at Saratoga. Just as stoutly, they prepared to be a separate nation rather than accept New York authority. This was the way frontiersmen played politics, a heritage still traceable in local political dog fights. The Vermonters were successful: New York gave up her claims in 1790, a convention at Bennington ratified the United States Consti- tution, and Vermont became the fourteenth state of the Union on February 18, 1791.

Instead, they wanted union with the mother country through common loyalty to the king, but \\vith the right to rule themselves and not submit to Parhament. In a petition to George III, the Americans blamed all their troubles on his ministers, \"those artful and cruel enemies who abuse your royal confidence and authority for the purpose of effecting our destruction.\" Congress appealed to the king for rehef from Parhament and continued to open its meetings with prayers for his health. The Americans were careful to refer to the British armies they were fighting as \"ministerial\" troops. No matter what Congress might have in- tended, events were driving them toward sep- aration. First, there was the great fact of continviing war. Not content with bottling up Gage in Boston, the Americans invaded Canada —a possible base for British operations. One force vmder General Richard Montgomery, starting from Ticonderoga, took Montreal and advanced on Quebec by way of the St. Law- rence. Another httle army under General Bene- dict Arnold also reached the great stronghold after an amazing march through the wldemess of Maine. When in December the two armies joined on the Plains of Abraham outside Que- bec, they did not number more than 1,200. Yet the commanders attempted to surprise the de- fending garrison by an early morning assault. The attack failed when Montgomery was killed and Arnold wounded; as a result, Canada re- mained in British hands? George Ill's inflexible Attitude Meanwhile, the British government adopted a more and more inflexible attitude. George III refused even to read a concihatory petition from the Continental Congress, but instead de- nounced the \"diverse wicked and desperate persons\" leading the Americans. He called on loyal subjects to bring the American leaders to justice as traitors. At this time the British pun- ishment for treason was as follows: . . . that the offender be drawn on a hurdle to the place of execution, that there he be hanged by the neck but not till he be dead, that while yet alive he be disembowelled and that then his body be di\\'ided into four quarters, the head and each quar- ter to be at the disposal of the crown. In October a British naval force burned to the ground the defenseless port of Falmouth, Maine. Finally, in December, George III de- clared the thirteen colonies entirely outside his protection and all their ports under blockade by the British fleet. Unable to raise troops in England, because the war against the Amer- icans was so unpopular there, the Idng hired soldiers from the rulers of small German states. They were generally knoviTi as \"Hessians,\" be- cause a large contingent was supplied by the Prince of Hesse, who was paid $500,000 a year plus $35 for each soldier killed and $12 for each one wounded. It was increasingly obvious that compromise between Great Britain and the thirteen colonies was impossible. Yet the Amer- icans still held back, unwilUng to cut their ties with the mother country. \"Common Sense\" At this critical moment, there appeared one of the most persuasive and widely read pam- phlets in all history. Entitled Common Sense, and published in January 1776, it was vmtten by Tom Paine, an Enghsh radical recently ar-"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"54 A Free Country in a New World rived in America. Paine hit directly at the strongest bond still keeping America tied to Britain— the sentiment of loyalty to the king, which was as ingrained an attitude as is respect for the Stars and Stripes in the United States today. Paine ruthlessly attacked monarchy in general and George III in particular. Hereditary kingship, he wrote, was a superstition that had been sold to the ignorant by means of hes and fables. A king was usually \"the principal ruffian of some ruthless gang,\" and George III, \"the royal brute of Great Britain,\" was typical of his breed. Paine added to the effect of this by explaining the advantages the Americans might gain when rid of English commercial restrictions and when no longer involved in England's quarrels with her European neigh- bors. Above all, Paine appealed to the Amer- icans' sense that they were a chosen pe»ple, pioneers of liberty. \"Freedom hath been hunted around the globe,\" he wrote. \"Asia and Africa have long expelled her. Europe regards her like a stranger, and England hath given her warning to depart. O receive the fugitive, and prepare in time an asylum for mankind!\" Common Sense had an amazing circulation and helped to convince thousands of Amer- icans that it was \"time to part.\" Its arguments were more persuasive because American arms were extraordinarily successful! In Virginia the royal governor and the soldiers defending him were expelled; in North CaroUna the mihtia repulsed an attempted landing of redcoats; in South Carolina a full-scale British attack on Charleston was brilliantly driven back. The greatest victory was in Boston. At first Wash- ington had almost no artillery, but during the winter over fifty cannon from Fort Ticonderoga, weighing two to six tons apiece, were lashed to sledges and dragged by oxen 200 miles over snowy trails and frozen rivers. This amazing feat was followed up by bold action. On the night of March 4, 1776, about 2,000 men set batteries of these guns on Dorchester Heights, Museum of Fine Arts^ Boston Although most famous for his ride to arouse the coun- tryside against the British, as depicted in Grant Wood's famous painting (right), Paul Revere was a noted silversmith, artist, and political agitator.

General William Howe (who had replaced Gage as commander of the British force) had no choice but to abandon the city. On March 17, he sailed for Halifax, carrying with him a thousand Loyalists who preferred exile to rebellion against George III. A strong argument for independence was the need for military supplies and for reopen- ing foreign trade. The Americans lacked gims, gunpowder, ammunition, uniforms, tents, and medical supplies, and did not have the facilities to make them in quantity.

New markets were needed, and to get them commercial treaties with other nations had to be arranged. Such treaties could not be written by rebellious colonies, but only by in- dependent states. Furthermore, the members of the Continental Congress hoped for aid from France. Ever since 1763 the French had been planning revenge on Great Britain for the ter- rible defeat sufFered in the Seven Years' War (see p. 36). As early as November 1775, a French secret agent conferred with members of the Continental Congress. A few months afterward the French government started to smuggle arms to the Americans. But it was made clear that no alliance was possible and no commercial treaty guaranteeing American Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York ships the right to trade with French ports until the Americans declared themselves an inde- pendent nation. Colony after colony, starting wdth North Carolina in April 1776, advised its delegates in Congress to vote for independence. On June 7, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia introduced a resolution calling for independence and foreign alliances.

The changes, mostly by Benjamin Franklin, were few, but each made the Declaration more forceful. On July 2, 1776, Washing- ton wrote, \"The time is now near at hand which must probably determine whether Americans are to be Freemen or Slaves.\" Two days later, the Congress voted for independence. The scene is shown above in a painting by Robert Edge Pine and Edward Savage, done in 1785. THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE The Declaration of Independence was prin- cipally the work of Thomas Jefferson, a young Virginian who had been a rather inconspicuous member of Congress. Shy, a poor speaker in public, Jefferson was nevertheless known to be an able writer of pamphlets, so that when a committee was appointed to draw up a public statement justifying independence, he was in- cluded. Of the five members of the committee, two took no part in the work, and the other two, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, more prominent and busier than Jefferson, were glad to leave to him the rather routine task of draw- ing up the statement of a decision already made. Since Jefferson was busy and time was short, he did not compose an entirely new document. Instead, he did a scissors-and-paste editorial job of piecing together fragments from a declara- tion of grievances he had written earlier, from the new Virginia Bill of Rights (written by George Mason), and from Lee's resolutions. He then took his draft to Franklin who, wearing bifocal glasses of QUESTION • Look care- fully at the corrections made in Jefferson's original longhand copy of the pre- amble of the Declaration of Independence.

(The text of the Declaration of Inde- pendence is found on pp. 799-800.) The Preamble Of the three sections, the preamble is the most important. It sets forth a philosophy of himian rights and of democracy that has af- fected men's behavior ever since. This was by No American, not even Washing- ton, made quite such an impact on eighteenth-century Europe as did Benjamin Franklin. This was partly because of his versatility: he was eminent as a scientist, a journalist, and a statesman. Also, his rise to fame from humble be- ginnings made him a symbol of a free and mobile society. This por- trait by Charles Willson Peale was made when Franklin was 81 years old and a member of the Constitutional Convention. The Historical Society of Pennsylvania no means Jefferson's own invention, but was especially derived from the Second Treatise on Government written by John Locke to justify the right of the English to overthrow James II in the \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688. After a statement that the Americans are publishing the Declaration out of \"a decent respect to the opinions of mankind,\" comes this famous sentence, the basis for all that follows: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Struggle for Independence 59 their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. Few sentences in all human history have been so debated. It has been endlessly pointed out that it is self-evident that men are created unequal: no two men are exactly equal in phy- sique, ability, circumstances, or character. Rights are not \"inalienable\": they are taken away by tyrants and surrendered by men tm- willing to defend them. Such criticisms are based on misimderstanding of JeflFerson's mean- ing. \"Equal\" does not mean \"equal in abihties\" nor \"equal in circmnstances,\" but simply \"equal in rights.\" As all men are equal before God, so they are equal in God-given rights. Therefore society should see that men are equal before the law and that they should have equal opportuni- ties. \"Inalienable\" does not mean that a tyrant is unable to take men's rights away, but simply that he may not do so without violating divine law. A contract to sell yourself into slavery is null and void from the first, because your God- given rights are not yours to abandon. Government as the agent of the people. Out of the idea of natural rights flow the following \"self-evident truths\" about the relation of the people to government: That to secure these rights. Governments are in- stituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foun- dation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Thus the origin of government is traced to a contract in which the people grant power to the rulers and in exchange are promised pro- tection of their rights. It may be pointed out that most eighteenth century governments had their origin in conquest or seizure of power by strong men in the distant past, surely not in any agreement by the people to set up a right-pro- tecting agency. This passage, however, insists only that the rightful aim of government is to protect the individual, and that government is the agent of the people, not their master. Ob- viously, then, a rightful government is one in which the people continually and freely consent to the rule of the state because all officials are their servants. In 1776 this idea was stated in contrast to the notion that a king had a divine right to govern. It has had force in the twen- tieth century in contrast to the Fascist idea that man exists to serve the state or to the Com- munist tendency to sacrifice individual wants to the alleged needs of society as a whole. The rights of revolution and self-determina- tion. The idea that a just government rests on popular consent leads to the idea that the people may refuse their consent to an unjust government, may \"alter or abohsh it,\" and may set up a government of their own. This passage, then, is a statement of a right of revolution. It is also a statement of what has been called in modem times the right of \"self-determination,\" meaning the right of a people to be free from foreign rule. When the Philippines gained their independence from the United States on July 4, 1946, it was an expression of this right. The United States was also acting in accordance with its principles in freely granting independ- ence to the Philippines. From the expression of the right of revolu- tion, the Declaration turns to showing that the govenmient of Great Britain had been attempt- ing to put the Americans under an \"absolute despotism,\" that is, to put them completely im- der the power of the king. An early version blamed British misdeeds on Parhament, but this was altered to \"the present King of Great Britain.\" This change increased the effective- ness of the Declaration by helping to destroy that loyalty to the monarch already mentioned."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"60 A Free Country m a New World A Listing of Grievances The greater portion of the Declaration is taken up with a list of grievances against \"the present King of Great Britain\" (note the hint that he may not be on the throne much longer). Relentlessly, JeflFerson piles wrong on wrong. Note the effectiveness of the monotonous, dirge- like repetition: \"He has refused . . . He has for- bidden . . . He has utterly neglected . . . He has obstructed . . . He has plundered . . . He has . . . He has . . . He has. . . .\" There was a measure of unfairness in these charges. George HI did not begin the quarrel with the thirteen colonies, nor did he play any important role in shaping pohcy toward America until 1774. From then on, to be Slue, he resisted all concessions and so helped to bring on the Revolutionary War. But major blame cannot be truthfully laid at his door. Jefferson, however, was not writing a cool appraisal of the causes of the Revolution. He was appealing to world opinion in the heat of battle. Write about the unwarrantable actions of the majority in Parliament and you have to explain the workings of the British constitution. How much easier, how much more effective it is to blame everything on George HI and add him to the long roll of tyrants who have written their names in blood— Xerxes, Herod, Nero, King John, Genghis Khan, Ivan the Terrible I Independence The Declaration of Independence closes by maintaining that the Americans have done everything possible to preserve peace with \"our British brethren\" and have been spumed. There is nothing left for them but to declare that \"these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, Free and Independent States.\" To defend this action, the Americans pledged their Uves, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. Then come the signatvires of the members of the Conti- nental Congress, each man now a traitor in the eyes of the British government. Widespread Influence of the Declaration However casually it may seem to have been produced, the Declaration of Independence is one of the two or three most important docu- ments of modem times. By it the Americans made a commitment, as Lincoln said in the Gettysburg Address, \"to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" As a resvdt, the Declaration has been a continual lever for change in American society, in the direction of equal rights, equal opportunities, and equal voice in government. At different times in our history, it has operated toward ending Negro slavery, giving women the right to vote, enlarg- ing job opportimities, and extending the chances for education. With a genius for simple and eloquent prose, Jefferson managed to express the democratic faith in such a form that ideals of equality and self-govemment, while not yet fully realized, are embedded in the American tradition. Up to 1776 the colonists based their claims to self-govemment within the British Empire on colonial charters and on their inherited rights as Englishmen. Now they demanded independence from Britain on the basis of the natural, inbom rights of all men. Thus the Declaration of Independence acquired worldwide significance. When Lafayette went back to France after fighting on our side in the Revolutionary War, he hung a copy of the Declaration in a niche in his dining room, with an empt>' niche beside it awaiting a similar French declaration of human rights. When the Spanish-American colonies revolted in the early nineteenth cen- tury, several of them drew up declarations modeled on ours. And in the twentieth cen- tury, the late Jawaharlal Nehru, who was the first prime minister of India, called the Declaration of Independence a \"landmark in human freedom.\""},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAR, 1775-1781 Quebe ^^ / 5 X Ontario Ft.Oswego' ^ , ' * BURGOYNE Ft-Ticondcroqci o Junc-OctJm N.H.

Furthermore, only a minority of the American people actively supported the war. Most of them were indifferent to the Patriot cause except when fighting reached their door- steps. There were portions of the country, too, where the Loyalists were in control, and thou- sands of Loyahsts enlisted in the British army. (2) The strength of the British government and the weakness of the Continental Congress meant that the British had the larger purse. The British paid their troops in hard cash and could always buy food for them in America. The Continental Congress, lacking the power to tax, printed paper money called \"Continental Currency\" which became so worthless that the phrase \"not worth a Continental\" has been part of American slang to this day. American soldiers starved, deserted, and sometimes mutinied be- cause Congress could not pay them. ( 3 ) The British had more disciplined troops and more trained officers. The easy victories won by American militia in 1775 were seldom repeated. The American cause, in fact, suffered from \"the myth starting with the day of Concord and Lexington that amateur, half-disciplined mihtia were fully the equal of trained troops under any circumstances provided they pos- sessed the ability to shoot.\" The fact was that militiamen were sometimes worse than useless. They were often unruly and mutinous. They were Hkely to run away in the face of danger, or to desert before danger was near. The only trustworthy force the United States possessed was the Continental Army, seldom numbering as many as 5,000. (4) During most of the war. Great Britain had command of the sea. This gave British armies the choice of where to strike along the Atlantic coast and enabled them to supply their armies with ease. At one time or another the British held most of the principal ports of the United States— Boston, Newport, New York, Philadelphia, Wilmington (North CaroHna), Charleston, and Savannah. What Favored An American Victory? There were a number of reasons why the Americans overcame the advantages of the British and ultimately won the War for Inde- pendence: (1) The United States had only to hold out to vdn, while the British had to utterly destroy American resistance. In this latter task they had to \"conquer a map.\" Distances were so great in America and the people, living mostly on self-sufficient farms, were so scat- tered that Great Britain could not win the war just by taking the principal cities. When British forces ventured into the country, they could often march in any direction they pleased without meeting American forces strong enough to resist them, but they suffered continual losses from guerrilla attacks. (2) The British had to carry on war across the Atlantic. It took whole fleets to transport as many troops as a single great liner could ferry across the ocean today. Sailing vessels were so uncertain that a British commander sometimes went six months without receiving dispatches from home. It was difficult, sometimes impos- sible, to keep in touch with commanders in the field. Because of this, the British lost a whole army at Saratoga. (3) The war was not popular in Britain. The British could fill their regiments only by recruiting criminals and vagrants, as well as 30,000 Hessians. Many of these German troops deserted and some even joined the Continental Army. Although untrained \"embattled farmers\" were not to be rehed on, when the Americans were disciphned, as in the Continental Army, they proved to be excellent troops— active, en- terprising, inventive. Thousands of Negroes served in the Continental Army, generally re- ceiving freedom as the reward for enlistment. \"For great patience under privations, fatigue, and wounds,\" it was reported, \"the Negro, trained in the hardest of schools, was not to"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"iJ-iiJiy Although to Americans Washington seemed the embodiment of an aristocrat and his home at Mount Vernon quite a grand house, Europeans who met him were impressed by the simplicity of his manners and the lack of great style at Mount Vernon, which he used to call \"my farm.\" be surpassed.' QUESTION • What is the difference between the musket and the rifle? Why is one superior? Metropolitan Museum of Art American troops were more skillful in the use of firearms than European sol- diers, and some of them were equipped with the 'Tennsylvania rifle \" a far more effective weapon than \"Brown Bess,\" the British musket. The Americans might not have been perfectly united, but a far higher proportion of them than of the English people believed in their cause and were wilhng to risk their lives for it. (4) American leadership was superior to that of Britain. In spite of its weakness, the American Congress displayed more statesman- ship and devotion to duty than did the British Parhament. Favoritism and bribery were an ac- cepted part of British politics. There was graft and self-seeking on the American side too, but there were also men like Nathan Hale, who regretted that he had but one life to give for"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Struggle for Independence 65 his country, and leaders like John Adams and Benjamin Franklin, who freely gave their serv- ices to the Patriot cause. It has been estimated that nearly a third of the graduates of American colleges served as members of American state governments, as members of the Continental Congress, or as army officers. Although handicapped at the start, the Americans eventually found able commanders. Some were men with httle training but great natural ability, such as Nathanael Greene, Dan- iel Morgan, and George Rogers Clark. Others were foreigners such as Karl von Steuben, Thaddeus Kosciusko, Casimir Pulaski, and Marquis de Lafayette. In terms of leadership, Washington was undoubtedly the greatest American asset, even though he lost more bat- tles than he won. He may have been mistaken in training his army on strictly European lines. He sometimes annoyed his men by his stiflF manner and by a tendency to talk as though all were lost. But no man did more to win the war. While British commanders often returned to England for the winter, Washington's devo- tion to duty was such that he saw his home at Mount Vernon only once during the war, and then only for a few hours. He alone com- manded sufficient respect to keep the Conti- nental Army in being. Often soldiers remained with the army, even when they were unpaid and their enlistments were up, because, as one of them used to tell his grandchildren, \"He was a fine man, General Washington— he was everything a man should be.\" (5) Finally, the United States was able to win the Revolutionary War because of foreign help. It is hard to see how the Americans could have held out without the aid of France. In the latter years of the war, when money raised by the Americans Haym Salomon and Robert Mor- ris had been exhausted, the French government provided more money as well as trained troops. The French navy briefly wrested control of the sea from Great Britain. Also, the struggle grad- ually developed into a general European war in which Great Britain was fighting a ring of enemies in the West Indies, the Mediterranean, and India, as well as in the United States. THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR: PRINCIPAL CAMPAIGNS The Declaration of Independence had been signed during a period when there were no British armies on our soil. But in August 1776, perhaps the largest single military force ever sent from Europe to America appeared off New York— over 400 transports bearing 32,000 troops, guarded by 30 warships, under the command of Sir William Howe. Easily defeating 20,000 ill- trained militia under Washington's command, the British took New York City and held it until the war was over, seven years later. They followed Washington up the Hudson and, when he crossed to New Jersey, pursued him south- ward to the Delaware River. The American army was now reduced to 5,000 men and the Continental Congress fled from Philadelphia to Baltimore. Washlngtan's Victories at TrenUn and Princet«n Then, when all seemed lost, Washington won brilliant victories in New Jersey at Trenton and Princeton. Trenton was held by three regi- ments of Hessians under the command of a Colonel Ralls, who regarded the Americans as \"coimtry clowns.\" Ralls took few precautions against attack. Washington, knowing that these German troops would be hkely to celebrate Christmas by getting thoroughly dnmk, took a chance on surprising them the morning after.

Ralls was killed in the battle; on his body was found an unopened note from a Loyalist who had warned him the night before that Washing- ton was coming. Had Ralls read this note, he might have ambushed Washington instead of the reverse, and the course of history might have been changed. \\Vhen General Howe heard of the defeat at Trenton, he sent General Charles Comwallis from New York with 6,000 men to capture Washington's force. Washington, whose troops numbered only 1,500, pretended to be trapped, then slipped away and successfully attacked a surprised British force at Princeton on January 3, 1777. He then moved his army into the high- lands of New Jersey out of reach of Comwallis. These victories saved the American cause. There were great celebrations at Philadelphia when the Hessians captured at Trenton were paraded through the streets. Because of his re- peated failures, Washington had been in danger of being removed from command. Now a hero again, he was given more power by Congress, and new enhstments filled the ranks of his army. British Attacl( from Canada Although the American attempt to conquer Canada in 1776 had been a failure, it forced the British to divert to Canada troops who might have been better used in New York and New Jersey. In 1777 the British government planned to bring these forces into the war, as part of a great three-pronged attack which would cut the colonies in half along the line of Lake Champlain and the Hudson Valley. While Howe moved up the Hudson from New York City, an army under General John Bur- goyne was to come south from Montreal, and a lesser force under Barr>' St. Leger was to in- vade by way of Lake Ontario and the Mohawk River (see map, p. 61). The three armies were eventually supposed to meet near Albany. Because the British war oflBce could not keep in touch with him, Howe's army never partici- pated in the plan at all. Instead Howe made the fatal mistake of leading an expedition to Pliiladelphia, leaving Burgoyne in the lurch. He took the city in September, o\\'ercoming Washington's forces at the Battle of Brandywine and inflicting a further defeat on the Americans at Germantown in October. Congress fled to York, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, Burgoyne's force of 8,000 men had started south. Claude Van Tyne in The War of Independence described the spectacle as the army came down Lake Champlain: As the great fleet pushed out into the lake, the Indian forces were first, in great birchbark canoes. Then came the British advance guard, followed by the flotilla which had beaten Arnold, and the bulk of the army, in row galleys, forming the rear. Into the still blue of the lake, and against the varied greens of the wooded shore, came a rainbow of color such as the wilds had seldom seen. There were, in the combined British and German troops, companies and regiments in blue coats, others in red or in gieen with cuffs of red. The breeches might be of yellow buff, or of white, or even the leather of the dismounted dragoons. In headdress there were Httle caps of black leather, plumed cocked hats, and the high hats of the grenadiers. ... In footwear the most notable things were the high-spurred jackboots of the German dragoons, whose whole outfit was far too heavy for forest warfare. Finally, as if to clog the dragoon still further, he carried a broadsword with a three-pound scabbard. Swelling this riot of color were the varied regimental flags flaunting in the breeze. Opposed to Burgoyne's army were ill- trained, ill-equipped American soldiers, com- manded by oflBcers who employed so much energy quarreling among themselves they could scarcely control their men.

John Stark. Soon came news that St. Leger's advance from Lake Ontario had been stopped at the bloody battle of Oriskany, and that Howe had gone south to take Philadelphia instead of north to meet Burgoyne. Saratoga — Turning Point of the War, 1777 In spite of his own difficulties near Phila- delphia, Washington sent some of his best troops to General Horatio Gates, the American commander opposing Burgoyne. Meanwhile, vwth their homes actually threatened by the British advance and Burgoyne's Indian allies scalping civilians, New York and New England militia began to gather. Eventually, Burgoyne was surrounded by a force nearly twice as large as his own. He was unable to get food, to re- treat to Ticonderoga, or to advance on Albany. .After making one unsuccessful attempt to cut through the American lines, the entire British army surrendered at Saratoga in October 1777. Saratoga proved to be the turning point of the war because it brought France into the war. Although the French had been pro\\iding so much secret aid that most of the guns and half the powder used at Saratoga had come from them, they had refrained from full support until the United States had proved that it could carry on efiFective war. Saratoga offered this proof. Furthermore, England now offered to grant the Americans generous rights of self- government within the British Empire, and the French were afraid the offer might be accepted. In February 1778, the French signed t\\vo treaties with the United States: the first rec- ognized American independence and granted commercial privileges; the second offered an alliance on generous terms. The French alliance proved absolutely in- valuable to the American cause. From then on, the Continental Army was largely supplied and paid with French gifts and loans, and was re- enforced by disciplined French regiments. The French navy interfered with the ability of the British to move troops as they pleased up and down the Atlantic coast. Following the lead of France, Spain and the Netherlands entered the war against England, while Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, and Portugal formed a League of Armed Neutrality to resist British sea power. Benjamin Franklin in Paris One reason why French aid came so gen- erously was that Benjamin Franklin was Ameri- ca's principal envoy to France. Perhaps no foreign diplomat in all history enjoyed such popularity as did Franklin in Paris. His homely face appeared everywhere, not only in books and pamphlets, but on rings, watches, brooches, and snuffboxes. Women even did their hair in a \"coiffure d la Franklin,\" designed to imitate his beaver hat. The middle class admired him be- cause of his successful business career and the sayings of Poor Richard. Intellectuals admired him as a scientist. To radicals and liberals, he represented the way a free society allowed a man to rise by his own talents. The French officials whom he pressed for more troops, money, and supplies to America were won over to his cause by his ability, courage, cheerful- ness, and tact.

It was only with the utmost diffi- culty that Washington held a starving army together at Valley Forge, outside Philadelphia, during the winter of 1777-1778, while the British inside the city lived well on food bought from American farmers. In 1778 the British evacuated Philadelphia and marched across New Jersey toward New York. While they were on their way, Washing- ton attacked their 12-mile baggage train at Monmouth, New Jersey, but a mistaken order and possible treachery prevented an American victory. This was the last major battle in the north, although New York City remained in British hands and Washington kept his head- quarters in New Jersey. From 1778 on, the British made their major mUitary effort in the South, partly because they had the idea that the region was a stronghold of Loyalists and partly because the southern colonies were considered more valuable, since they fitted better into the mercantile system. For three years the redcoats marched almost at will through Georgia, the CaroUnas, and Vir- ginia, their main forces never suffering defeat. The year 1780 was one of gloom for the American cause. British armies were victorious in the South. A French army of 6,000 men landed at Newport, Rhode Island, but was promptiy blockaded by a British fleet.

The unpaid Continental Army was mutinous. There was great suffering among civilians because of high prices; tea sold at $90 a pound in the paper money with which the Continental Congress and the new state governments had flooded the country. Military Victory: Yorktown, 1781 The British were having their troubles too. Ireland was in a state of rebellion and there were pro-American riots in London. The Brit- ish armies could not keep their conquests in the south because they could not win the loy- alt>' of the inhabitants. A British officer likened the force in which he ser\\'ed to a ship at sea: it mo\\ed in any direction at will, but left no trace behind. The British were also harassed by guerrilla fighters imder the leadership of MS Marion, \"the Swamp Fo.x.\" Sometimes commanding as few as 30 men, sometimes as many as 900, Marion repeatedly surprised and defeated small British forces. The worst aspect of the British position in 1780 and 1781 was that they suffered naval defeats at the hands of the French and so lost command of the sea. This made possible the capture of the principal British force in the South, under Lord Comwallis, who was sta- tioned at Yorktown, Virginia. At the urging of General Jean Baptiste Rochambeau, commander of the French troops in America, Washington agreed to a remarkable combined operation against Comwallis. A French fleet sailed north from the West Indies and blocked the entrance of Chesapeake Bay, beating off a British fleet sent to reUeve Comwalhs. Meanwhile, a French army sailed from Rhode Island to Virginia, and Washington went south with most of his best troops from the New York area. Besieged on land and hemmed in by sea, Comwallis was forced to surrender in October 1781. After this disaster, and defeats elsewhere at the hands of Spain and France, the British government Nvas finally ready to make peace, even if it meant recognizing American independence. Diplomatic Victory: The Treaty of Paris, 1783 The peace treaties ending the Revolutionary War were not finally signed imtil 1783, because it took some time for France and her ally Spain to stop fighting. Spain, more or less backed by France, was not eager to see the United States extend its boundaries beyond the Appalachians and become a threat to the Spanish control of Louisiana and Florida. This situation allowed Great Britain to drive a wedge between the United States and France by offer- ing the former thirteen colonies generous terms. According to the Treaty of Paris between Great Britain and the United States (not to be confused with the Peace of Paris, 1763), the United States gained independence and land from the Atlantic to the Mississippi. This re- sulted partl\\- from the British effort to bribe its way out of war, partly from the abilit\\- of the American peace commissioners John Adams and Benjamin Frankhn, and partly from a bril- hant ex-pedition of 180 Virginia soldiers under George Rogers Clark in 1778. Clark's capture of the British posts of Kaskaskia and Vincennes ( see map, p. 61 ) gave the United States a claim to the trans-Appalachian West. Although several provisions of the Treaty of Paris led to later disputes, it was a great diplo- matic victory. The United States gained an area fouj- times that of France and nearly ten times that of the British Isles, so that from the first they had the natiu-al resources to become a great power.

Antagonism beUveen them and the Patriots was even more bitter than that between the Patriots and the Enghsh, since the Loyahsts were regarded as traitors to the American cause. John Adams said that if his own brother became a Loyalist, he would not hesitate to have him hanged. Loyahsts tended to belong to the wealthier classes, but this was by no means universal. In some southern states, for instance, backcountry farmers became Loy- ahsts because they dishked the Patriot mer- chants and planters of the coastal areas. Some- times the division between the two groups, involved rehgious differences. Where Loyahsts were few in number, they either lay low or fled, but in some parts of the country they were numerous and well enough organized to carry on mihtary opera- tions. At one time there were as many Loyahsts in the British Army as there were Patriots serv- ing in the Continental Army. Westchester County, north of New York City, was the scene of an ugly struggle. Bands of Loyahsts plun- dered and tortvued, destroying houses, bams, and even whole villages. Supporters of the American cause retahated in kind. Parts of the county became entirely depopulated, and the fields began to go back to the wilderness. In most areas, known Loyahsts lost their property and were banished. It is estimated that a hundred thousand people fled to Canada, where their descendants still hve. Many Loy- ahsts who remained were tarred and feathered, not a few killed by angry mobs. Their confis- cated estates were put up to pubhc auction. Since these were often divided and sold to small owners, a wider distribution of prop- erty among the people resulted."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"72 A Free Country in a New World Trends Toward Greater Equality and Democracy The division of Loyalist estates was only one example of a general trend toward greater equality. State laws promoted more equal prop- erty division by abolishing primogeniture, a legal arrangement whereby property was in- herited entirely by the eldest son. Follo\\\\'ing the principles of the Declaration of Independ- ence, most of the thirteen states solemnly proclaimed bills of rights, spelling out in detail the equal rights of citizens that it was the duty of government to protect. A result of the war was an increase in religious freedom. Throughout the southern states, the Church of England was disestab- lished, that is, it was no longer supported by taxation. The state of Virginia passed a bill for religious freedom written by Thomas Jef- ferson. It asserted : . . . that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support Einy religious worship, place or ministry whatsoever, . . . nor shall otherwise suffer on ac- count of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinion in matters of religion. In New England, although rehgious difiFerences were tolerated, the Congregational Church con- tinued to be supported by taxation, and only Protestants were allowed to vote. There was no way to square the proposition that all men were created equal with Negro slavery. One important result of the American Revolution was that nearly all the northern states arranged to free their slaves. In some states this was done by \"compensated emanci- pation,\" that is, by paying off the masters; in others by declaring that children of slaves bom after such and such a date would be free. In two states the courts held that provisions in the state constitutions that \"all men are bom free and equal\" meant the end of slavery. In the South there were many slave owners who felt that slavery was a terrible wrong. In 1782 the Virginia legislature passed a law al- lowing slave owners to free their slaves, and 10,000 Negroes were granted freedom within eight years. Little was done elsewhere. The slaves represented a large proportion of the wealth of the South, and the plantation system was dependent on their labor. Thomas Jeffer- son hated slavery and wTOte, \"I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; that His justice cannot sleep forever. . . .\" Yet Jeffer- son, and men like him, could see no immediate way to end the institution of slavery in the southern states. The break \\%'ith England made it necessary to set up new governments to take the place of the former colonial administration. The only exceptions were Connecticut and Rhode Island, formerly self-governing colonies, where the old charters continued to operate. The new con- stitutions revealed the influence of John Locke in their insistence that government existed to protect individual rights and that it was the agent of the people. They also revealed a dis- trust of strong executive power, the result of experience with the former royal governors and ^vith George III. Most state governors were elected for only one year at a time and had no power to veto bills passed by the legislature. Although the new governments were sup- posed to represent the people as a whole, there was a question as to who should be allowed to vote. According to John Locke, a major purpose of government was to protect prop- erty, and so in every state the right to vote depended on the possession of a certain amount of property, such as fifty acres of land. Qualifi- cations for office-holding were often more re- strictive. There was also some debate in north- em states as to whether the franchise should be limited to whites. In 1778 the town meeting of"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The Struggle for Independence 73 Sutton, Massachusetts, protested a proposed provision of the state constitution that denied the franchise to Negroes and Indians in these strong terms: This [provision] is manifestly adding to the already accumulated burden of guilt lying upon the Land in supporting the Slave Trade, when the poor innocent Africans who never hurt or offered any Injury or Insult to this country have been . . . cruelly brought from their Land, and sold here like Beasts, and yet now by this Constitution, if by any good Providence any of their Posterity gained their Freedom and a handsome Estate they must be excluded from the Privileges of menl This must be the bringing or incurring more Wrath upon us. And it must be thought more insulting tho not so cruel, to deprive the original Natives of the land the Privileges of Men. This protest was not heeded, and Massachu- setts, along \\vith the other states, limited the franchise to white males. Although the American Revolution did not immediately bring the full equality and democ- racy that a literal reading of the Declaration of Independence would indicate, it did push American society in that direction. As revolu- tions go, the domestic revolution was a com- paratively mild affair. Many Loyalists were treated harshly, but there were no heads on pikes, and no guillotines set up in city squares. The American Revolution was led by men of property and position in society who desired reform without violent overthrow of existing arrangements. Here, there was no oppressed class of peasants consumed with a desire to plimder the nearest castle, nor at the other end of the scale was there a hereditary class of noblemen. Colonial society was already one in which property was widely distributed, and there was a large measure of freedom. The Revolution simply hastened processes that had begun long before. WIDE INFLUENCE OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION When the British troops marched out of Yorktown to lay down their arms, their band played a tune called \"The World Tum'd Up- side Down.\" The defeat of England, a strong, estabhshed nation, by a raw, new country was considered amazing. The success of the United States promoted ideas of freedom and equahty. It gave new hope to the friends of the op- pressed in Europe, and endangered the old system of monarchy and a privileged upper class. France was the country most immediately affected by the American Revolution. The ideas found in the preamble of the Declaration had already been popularized by famous writers such as Jean Jacques Rousseau. The contention of these authors that a free society made men virtuous seemed borne out by the honesty and patriotism of American diplomats such as John Adams, JefiFerson, and Franklin. It was even more impressive when Washington quietly re- turned to Mount Vernon, instead of using his position as head of the army to make himself a dictator or a king. The French watched Amer- icans establish successful state governments; they read state bills of rights; they marveled at the reports of widespread prosperity, so imlike the unequal distribution of wealth in France. The example of America was a trump card in the hands of those who planned revolution in both society and government. The amount of money France poured into the Revolutionary War brought the government to the verge of bankruptcy. When in 1788 the king's ministers proposed new loans or taxes to balance the budget. Frenchmen raised the fa- mihar cry of \"no taxation without representa- tion\" and forced King Louis XVI to call repre- sentatives of the pe«jile together in a body"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"74 A Free Country in a New World known as the Estates-General. In the sximmer of 1789, the French Revolution began. The Es- tates-General set itself up as a national assembly to make over French government and law, according to the principles of equality and self-government; French peasants seized the land of the nobles; and a Paris mob took the great royal fortress and prison called the Bas- tille. That the French revolutionaries fully re- alized their debt to America was shown when they sent Washington the key to the Bastille and when they decreed three days of national mourning on hearing of the death of Franklin in 1790. In Great Britain, the British defeat in the Revolutionary War discredited George III and put an end to his attempt to \"be a king\" by buying control of Parhament. After the news of Yorktown, Lord North, George IITs personal choice as prime minister, was voted out of of- fice, and Parliament took steps to see that in the future no king could corrupt and control its members as George III had done. Thus the American Revolution helped to make the long of England the figurehead he is today. In the long nm, it also persuaded the British to allow their colonies more self-government. The idea expressed by the colonists before the Revolu- tionary War was that they were tied to Great Britain only by loyalty to the cro\\vn and not by subjection to the British Parliament. This is essentially the arrangement by which Canada, Austraha, and New Zealand are tied to Britain today. Emerson did not exaggerate when he wrote in the \"Concord Hymn\" that the shot fired by the minutemen on April 19, 1775, was \"heard round the world.\" Activities: Chapter 3 To the Student: See pp. 30-31 for suggestions as to how to use these chapter-end activities.

But as each ol them had always had a separate existence and a government within its reach, separate interests and peculiar customs had sprung up which were opposed to such a compact and intimate union as would have absorbed the individual importance of each in the general importance of all. Hence arose two opposite tendencies, the one prompting the Anglo- Americans to unite, the other to divide, their strength. -ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE The United States was the first \"new nation\" in modem history, the first of many colonies to throw off the yoke of European domination. Its example was followed in the nineteenth century by the colonies in Latin America and in the mid-twentieth century by scores of colonies in Asia and Africa. It is instructive to compare the situation of the United States when it had first won its independence with that of the new nations of today. Take Nigeria, for example, the most popu- lous state of Africa, which gained independence from Great Britain in 1960. In establishing a unified nation, the Nigerians have certain ad- vantages from the very fact of living in the twentieth century. It is easier for modem gov- ernments to keep in touch with large areas because there is instantaneous communication by telephone and radio, and rapid travel and transportation by steamship, railroad, automo- bile, and airplane. In eighteenth-century Amer- ica, a message could go no faster than a man on horseback or a sailing vessel. The fastest travelers could seldom average more than 50 miles per day. In winter and spring, roads were impassable because of snows and floods. Nigeria today is also more fortunate than the United States was in the 1780's because its separation from Great Britain was amicable. The British govemment has poured millions of dollars into Nigerian education and economic development; it has granted Nigerian products a privileged position in her markets. The United States, on the other hand, were at first handi- capped because Britain showed an unfriendly attitude toward them. The British deliberately ) hampered American trade and refused to evac- ^ uate territory that had been granted to the United States by the Treaty of Paris.

The Nigerians have adopted English as their official language. They attempted to set up an English form of government and English guarantees of personal liberty, but before gaining independence they had had only thirteen years of practice in lim- ited self-government. It is not surprising, there- fore, that elections were marked by violence and that early in 1966 a military clique ousted the ci\\-ilian government in a coup in which the prime minister lost his life. And in 1967 the Ibos in the East seceded, proclaiming themselves the independent Republic of Biafra. Ci\\'il war fol- lowed. Compare this situation to the young United States, where nearly all the people spoke one language, practiced forms of the same religion, inherited the same system of government, and where they had been govern- ing themselves in all local matters for over a century. Yet with all their blessings, the Americans had a difficult time in establishing a nation. Many intelligent men thought that the wartime union of thirteen states would certainly break apart. It was a common opinion that countries in which the people had a voice were too changeable, too unmilitary, and too slow-mov- ing to govern large areas. Republics could be successful, according to eighteenth-century no- tions, only in small, defensible countries such as the Netherlands or Switzerland. An English clergjTnan, Josiah Tucker, who was not un- friendly to America, reflected the ideas of his time when he wrote of the United States: As to the future Grandeur of America, and its being a rising Empire under one Head, whether Republican, or Monarchical, it is one of the idlest and most visionary Notions, that ever was conceived even by Writers of Romance. . . . the Americans will have no Center of Union among them, and no Common Interest to pursue, when the Power and Government of England are finally removed. More- over, when the Intersections and DiNisions of their Country by great Bays of the Sea, and by vast Rivers, Lakes, and Ridges of Mountains:— and above all, when those immense inland Regions, beyond the Back Settlements, which are still un- explored, are taken into the Account, they form the highest Probabilit\\' that the Americans never can be united . . . under any species of Government whatever. Their fate seems to be— A DISUNITED PEOPLE, till the End of Time. THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION Although the Continental Congress Jiad taken on most of the functions of a central government in carrying on the Revolutionary War, it had not been formally granted the right to do so. Congress therefore drew up the Articles of Confederation, designed to set up a formal union of the thirteen states. In 1777 it asked the states to accept the plan, which would go into effect onlv when all thirteen states had ratified it. Not until 1781 did all the states agree to ratify the Articles. The reason for delay was the claim of seven states to immense tracts of western land (see map, p. 8.5). These claims mostly went back to colonial charters granting land \"from sea to sea.\" Virginia's claim included all of what is now Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wiscon- sin. States without western lands were faced with the prospect of being completely over-"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"78 A Free Country in a New World shadowed by their neighbors, \\faryland in- sisted that the western claims be abandoned as a condition of ratifying the Articles of Con- federation. Fortunately, the states with western lands valued the long-time benefits of union more than their short-time selfish interests. In 1781 Virginia and other states agreed to cede their claims to the central government and Maryland finally ratified. The authors of the Articles of Confederation were wary of a strong central government. Having thrown off one master, the British Par- liament, they did not intend to put themselves vmder another. They also feared that a national government would be too far removed from the^eople; self-government could be successful, they thought, only at the local level. And yet, the Articles of Confederation granted consid- erable power to a Congress of the United States. The Congress could wage war and make treaties, which the states were forbidden to do. It might raise armies and navies, borrow money, estabhsh a postal system, manage affairs with the Indians, and coin its own money. The states furthermore agreed to \"give full faith and credit to the public acts of other states,\" such as walls and legal decisions, so that citizens of one state could easily do business in another. Each state agreed to return escaped criminals and runaway slaves. There was freedom of movement across state lines: no passports were required for travelers from one state to another and there were no barriers to immigration. Finally, the states agreed that differences be- tween them should be settled not by war, but by arbitration. In spite of the foregoing features, the gov- ernment of the United States under the Articles proved too weak to operate effectively. There was no separate executive department to carry out laws. There were no federal courts. Con- gress had no control over foreign commerce or commerce between states. Worst of all, it had no power to collect taxes, but had to ask the states for most of its money. During the years 1781-1789, the states gave Congress only about one-sixth of the money it requested. Without money or real power, the Confed- eration Congress commanded so little respect that its members often did not bother to at- tend sessions. In 1783 it was diflBcult to get a quorum to ratify the Treaty of Paris ending the Revolutionary War. In the same year, the threats of a few hundred unpaid soldiers drove Congress out of Philadelphia. For a time it wandered from place to place, like a troupe of actors, finally settling in New York. FOREIGN AFFAIRS UNDER THE CONFEDERATION One of the blessings of independence that Tom Paine had predicted in Common Seme was that America would at last be free of European rivalries that had dragged her again and again into war. Even before the Treaty of Paris was ratified, the Confederation Congress passed a resolution saying that \"the true in- terest of these states requires that they should be as little as possible entangled in the politics and controversies of European nations.\" The governments of Europe were quite willing to ignore the upstart new republic; only six of them recognized the United States in the 1780's, and only two, France and Spain, bothered to send ministers to this country. But total isolation from Europe was impos- sible. The prosperity of the United States de- pended, after the Revolution as before, on trade with Europe and the Caribbean colonies. Satisfactory trading arrangements demanded that the Uniied States make commercial treaties. There were also unsolved problems connected with British Canada to the north and Spanish Florida and New Orleans to the south, and these could be settled only by diplomacy. It was in its foreign relations that the United States suffered most from the defects ^-"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Triak of a New Nation 79 of the government set up by the Articles of Confederation. A government unable to control commerce or force states to do its bidding could neither make binding treaties nor carry out existing ones. Unable to tax, it could not pay back the money owed its former allies nor keep up an army and navy to protect its interests. Relations with Great Britain As was predictable, the new government did not enjoy happy relations with its recent foe, Great Britain. The British did consent to receive John Adams as minister from the United States, even though during the war he had been one of the rebels singled out for special pun- ishment. They refused, however, to send a min- ister to the United States, explaining that they did not know whether to send one envoy or thirteen. Neither country carried out in full the terms of the Treaty of Paris. The United States had agreed that British creditors could recover pre-war debts by suing in American courts, and that Congress would recommend to the states that persecution of Loyalists cease. But when British merchants sued American debtors in American courts, they were seldom able to collect a penny from unfriendly juries and judges. The states also ignored the recom- mendation of Congress as to treatment of Loyalists, who for a time continued to suffer exile, confiscation of property, and sometimes even lynching. The British government used the treatment of Loyalists and British mer- chants as an excuse to hold some forts inside the northern border of the United States (see map, p. 85). These \"fur posts\" were the centers of trade with the Indians of the Great Lakes region and the Ohio Valley. This trade was worth more than a million dollars a year, and Great Britain was resolved to keep it for her- self. American trade suffered because the United States were now outside the British Empire. American tobacco and naval stores no longer enjoyed a preferred position in British mar- kets. American ships were banned from the British West Indies, and they were allowed to enter English ports only with the products of their home states. Thus a Massachusetts ship might not carry Rhode Island whale oil. New York furs, or North Carolina turpentine to London. John Adams had been sent to England principally to write a commercial treaty, but the last thing the members of the English govern- ment wanted was to grant economic privileges to their former colonies. Instead, they planned a trade war against the United States. One British pohtician wrote: Our great national object is to raise as many sailors and as much shipping as possible. Parliament should endeavour to divert the whole Anglo-Amer- ican trade to British bottoms. The Americans can- not retaliate. It wiD not be an easy matter to bring the Americans to act as a nation. They are not to be feared as such by us. Difficulties with Spain During the Confederation period, the United States had diflSculties with Spain as serious as those with Great Britain, even though Spain as an ally of France had been on the American side in the recent war. The Spanish were not happy about the immense domain beyond the Appalachians which the United States acquired in the Treaty of Paris. They correctly foresaw that the future expansion of the United States would be a threat to the Spanish empire in America. Spain insisted that the southern boundary of the United States from the Appalachians to the Mississippi was not the 31st parallel described in the Treaty of Paris, but a line nearly 100 miles to the north, or even the Tennessee River (see map, p. 85). The Spanish made alhances with the Cherokee, Creek, and Chickasaw Indians and supphed them with arms. They also found citizens of the United States who were willing, for a price, to act as Spanish secret agents."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"HISfbRY AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES History has never been independent of the social sciences, nor can any one of the social sciences be complete without histor>'. You will have a greater knowledge of history, therefore, if you know something of the complexitv- of human and social be- havior as revealed by the disciplines of geography, anthropology, economics, sociology, and political science. The geographer looks upon man and nature as the interacting parts of this planet. He is concerned with the study of both human and material resources, especially as they are distributed in particular regions of the earth. He points out that the natural conditions in North America had a far different impact on the Europeans from the impact they had on the American Indians. The geographer explains why New York City became a major port in the 1800's as America was becoming an industrial nation and why Manhattan Island was a series of hunting and fishing villages when the Indians lived there. The anthropologist recognizes that the impact of a specific environmental feature depends upon the culture of the people inhabiting that area. He is concerned with the study of human cultures, and he is especially interested in societies, such as those of the American Indians, that ha\\'e compiled few, if any, written records. Anthropologists realize that the significance of the physical conditions of the land depends on the attitudes, objectives, and technical abilities of the inhabitants. The settlement of the Great Plains is an example of how a different set of attitudes, objectives, and technical abilities changed the use of the land from the buffalo culture of the Plains Indians into extensive wheat cultivation. Wherever or however he lives, man must provide himself with the necessities for survival. \"Economics,\" wrote one economist, \"is the study of the social organization of the process by which scarce resources are divided among alternative ends toward the satisfaction of human wants.\" A substance existing in nature has no importance as a resource until man gives it economic value, whether because it is scarce, useful, or desirable. Thus the iron ore in the Mesabi Range was not a resource to the Indians of Minnesota, but the nearby Calumet pipe clay was. The sociologist studies social interaction, focusing on the values, beliefs, and social codes of various groups. He seeks to understand the consequences of group living and the reasons for social change. For instance, he might be concerned with the adaptation of immigrants, especially non-English, who possess one scale of values, to the different standards of the United States. Likewise, he might examine the sla\\e system's policy of preventing the Negro from developing a close family unit as a possible contributing factor to the Negro's present difficulties in America. 80"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Anthropology, Economics, Geography, Pojitical Science, Sociology The most obvious meansJjy which a society is held together is its political system.

What evidence had to be gathered in order for a historian to make such a statement? An economist had to hxpothesize that U.S. prosperity depended on trade with Europe and the Caribbean colonies. To test this hypothesis, what data would an economist use? Customs receipts showing annual U.S. imports from Europe and Caribbean col- onies, 1770-1790; annual U.S. exports to England and Caribbean colonies. Data on employment during this period; data on business failures and new busi- nesses started in this period. Any price indexes showing prices of basic agricultural and manufactured products during this period. Any evidence of changes in personal indebtedness. 2.

The Spanish generally re- fused this privilege except to certain Americans whom they hoped to use as agents. The West- erners demanded that Congress make a treaty by which Spain would grant free navigation of the Mississippi. Meanwhile, the shippers and merchants of the northeastern states wanted Spain to open to them the trade of the Spanish West Indies, which would make up for the loss of markets in the British Empire. The influence of the populous states of the Northeast on the Con- federation government was much stronger than that of the far-off, thinly settled West. In_1785 a Spanish envoy, Diego de Gardoqui, negotiated with the U.S. secretary of foreign affairs, John Jay, a treaty whereby the United States gave up a claim to the right of deposit at the mouths of the Mississippi and other rivers emptying into the Gulf of Mexico, in rettim for which Spain opened her own ports to American ships. The Jay-Gardoqui Treaty so obviously sacrificed the West to the Northeast that Congress was unwilling to ratify it, but even so, Westerners were thoroughly angry. Relations with France Relations with France were not so difBcult as those with Great Britain and Spain, but neither were they entirely happy. During the latter years of the Revolutionary War, the United States had been able to keep armies in the field only with money given or loaned by France. Yet now the United States were unable to pay back even the interest on their debts, and this at a time when the French monarchy was going bankrupt. It is no wonder that Jeffer- son, who replaced Franklin as minister to France, wrote a friend that American diplomats were \"the lowest and most obscure of the whole diplomatic tribe.\" The French were also disappointed by the commercial opportunities opened to them by American independence. Franklin had pre- dicted that with the end of British trade regu- lations the valuable commerce of the thirteen states would be largely transferred from Britain to France. The French did reap some benefits: the French West Indies found more of a market in the United States; a number of Frenchmen invested in American lands; and the French could get American products such as tobacco more cheaply than before. In general, however, trade tended to fall back into the old grooves. By 1789 the British were exporting as much to the United States as ever before, while the French share of the American market had in- creased only shghtly. The Barbary Pirates . The most humiliating evidence of the weak- \\ ness of the United States during the Confed- I eration period was the treatment at the hands / of the Barbary Pirates. The four North African ' states of Morocco, Timis, TripoH, and Algiers made a regular practice of captiuing the ships and crews of all nations not paying them annual tribute. Now that the United States were out- side the protection of the British fleet and the British treasury, American ships were subject to brutal attack.

It was the region where at any particular time white pioneers were driving back Indians; where cultivation was replacing hunting, trapping, and grazing; and where set- tled ways of living were replacing Indian war- fare and lynch law. First to arrive were hunters and trappers. They were followed by a restless population who built temporary homesteads, planted com or wheat, and raised a few hogs. This second wave of pioneers was apt to be always on the move, ever in search of greener pastrures. Abraham Lincoln's father was a typ- ical example of this breed. Bom in Virginia, he moved in the course of his lifetime to Ken- tucky, on to Indiana, and finally to Illinois. Close behind the frontiersmen of legend came others who built flour mills and stores and started to manufacture brick, harness, shoes, barrels, and carts. They congregated at natural points of trade, such as Pittsburgh at the head of the Ohio River, and in areas where the soil was rich, such as Lexington in the bluegrass region of Kentucky. Soon these town dwellers built schools and churches and laid the foimda- tions for a more settled society like that of the East or of Europe from which they had orig- inally come. During the Confederation period, the West lay just beyond the Appalachians. Only three roads connected the region v.'ith the East. Yet on foot and on horseback, so many settlers crossed the mountains between 1780 and 1790 that the white population grew from about 2,000 to perhaps as many as 100,000. Life was hard in the western settlements. So many men and women died of starvation, accident, disease, and Indian attacks that it has been said that the sight of \"a man dying of natural causes in his bed was regarded with special solemnity be- cause it seemed so uncommon.\" ^ \\ As a result of the cession of the state land plaims, the trans-Appalachian West became the , common possession of the United States, under , the direct control of Congress. But the power- less Confederation Congress was unable to meet the Westerners' needs. It could not dis- lodge the British from the fiu- posts to the north or persuade the Spaniards to grant the right of deposit to the south. It could prevent neither the Spanish nor the British from fur- nishing the Indians with arms. In Kentucky alone, 1,500 settlers were killed by Indians between 1788 and 1790. Without money. Con- gress could neither purchase land from the Indians nor provide troops to protect settlers from them. The Westerners had other grievances in ad- dition to the failure of Congress to aid them. Many of them resented the way eastern spec- ulators had laid claim to large tracts of land. In 1785 a convention of Kentucky settlers de- clared: That to grant any Person a larger quantity of land than he designs Bona Fide to seat himself or his Family on, is a greevance. Because it is sub- versive of the fundamental Principles of a free republican Government to allow any indi\\'idual, or Company or Body of Men to possess such large tracts of Country in their own right as may at a future Day give them undue influence.

The Land Ordinance of 1785 During the colonial period, there had de- veloped two distinct methods of^surveying and allotting land. New England had developed a system whereby land was granted to indi- viduals only after new townships had been surveyed, and settlement proceeded township by township. This resulted in orderly, compact settlement and prevented conflicting land claims. In the South, and especially in Virginia, there developed a system of allotting new lands whereby individuals were granted a certain number of acres and then went out and selected the best land they could find. The result was chaos. Claims often conflicted, causing quarrels which sometimes resulted in loss of life. Large blocks of land were left imclaimed, so that settlements were often scattered, making it difficult to estabUsh^ommunities or to ward off Indian attacks. When Congress was planning to dispose, of the first pieces of the lands it controlled north \\ of the Ohio River, it passed the Land Ordinance of 1785 to provide for an orderly method of sin-vey and sale. This law provided for an adaptation of the QUESTION • What prac- New England sys- tical objections can you see tem.

These sections could in turn be subdivided into smaller rectangular tracts. This arrangement was continued in later surveys. From an air- plane over the Middle West today, one can see in the checkerboard arrangement of farms In the older states. Irregular property lines led to constant disputes. The Ordinance of 1785 laid out regular patterns. The rectangular design apparent as one flies over the Midwest today is a result of the early survey system. the permanent influence of the system set up in 1785. The Land Ordinance of 1785 was also de- signed to promote the sale of western lands and so to increase the slender revenues of the Confederation government. To make the land attractive to speculators, purchasers were obliged to buy at least a whole section, 640 acres, and the minimtun price was low, a dollar per acre. The ordinance also provided the first federal subsidy to education. Proceeds from the sale of one section in each township were to be used for establishing schools. The Northwest Ordinance, 1787 The so-called Northwest Ordinance of 1787 was even more important than that of 1785. It provided for future pofitical development of the entire territory bounded by the Ohio River, the Great Lakes, and the Mississippi (see map, p. 85).

The citizens of the new territory were to elect their legislature, while the federal gov- ernment appointed judges and a governor with the power of absolute veto of the laws passed by the territorial legislature. To make sure the judges and governor would be beyond the con- trol of the citizens of the territory, they were ^paid by the federal government. So far it might seem that the United States intended to control their territories in the West as tightly as Great Britain had tried to govern the thirteen colonies. But the Northwest Ordi- nance provided that when the population of a territory reached 60,000, the people might or- ganize a new state, and that it should be ad- mitted to the Union on terms of full equality with the original states. This was something new; never before had a coimtry formally prom- ised full political equahty to its colonies or territories or set up machinery for carrying out such a promise. The Northwest Ordinance provided a model for territorial government that has been fol- lowed down to the present. It started the prac- tice of admitting new states to the Union on equal terms. This was in line with the principles of the Declaration of Independence, as were two other provisions of the ordinance: (1) that all citizens of the region were guaranteed per- sonal rights, such as freedom of reUgion ^nd freedom of speech, and (2) that slavery was forbidden.

These difficulties resulted from interstate sus- picion and rivalry, from the usual postwar de- pression, and from the weakness of the central government. Each state was free to pass tariff laws taxing goods from other states. New York, for instance, taxed firewood from New Jersey. Since these interstate tariffs were lower than those on goods from outside the United States and since there was httle interstate trade anyway, state tariff laws were a less serious cause of ill feeling than might be expected. Much more serious were disputes over bouftdaries. The majority of the thirteen states were engaged in boundary disputes with their neighbors during this period. .Disagreement be- tween Connecticut and Pennsylvania over the possession of lands in the Wyoming Valley ( see map, p. 85) almost resulted in war. In the spring of 1784, Connecticut settlers in the val- ley were driven from their homes by Pennsyl- vania militia, with loss of Ufe to men, women, and children.

Some Vermont leaders even considered rejoining the British Empire, and carried on correspondence with the British governor of Canada. Controversy Over \"Cheap Money\" Another source of disunion was the fact that there was no national currency, the \"con- tinentals\" issued by Congress during the war having lost all value. Since there was httle gold and silver in the country, all the states were forced to issue paper money. These currencies differed in value from state to state and were often worthless outside the borders of the states issuing them. This obviously' made it di£BcuIt to carry on interstate trade. In Rhode Island and North Carolina, state paper money was worth almost nothing because so much was printed. This was a result of pres- sure from debt-ridden farmers. With the closing of the usual markets in the West Indies and Britain, farmers were often unable to pay off their debts and faced the loss of their lands and homes. If the currency could be inflated, how- ever, they could pay their creditors with cheap or worthless paper money. Getting control of both the North Carolina and Rhode Island leg- islatures, the debtors simply ran the printing presses. In Rhode Island, the legislature passed laws forcing creditors to accept the valueless currency in the payment of all debts. Shays's Rebellion, 1786 In Massachusetts wealthy creditors gained control of the state government in 1784. The legislature levied very heavy taxes to pay off the state debts, putting a great burden on smaU farmers, in addition to their normal load of debt. The farmers began to threaten the courts when the property of men unable to pay taxes was confiscated, and when people were sent to jail or deprived of their land because Public unrest and disorder increased in intensity until Daniel Shays, formerly an officer in the Revo- lutionary War, led a rebellion aimed at overthrowing the government of Massachusetts.

Finally, Daniel Shays, a vet- eran of the Revolutionary War, enhsting nearly 1,000 men, tried to seize the hghtly guarded federal arsenal at Springfield, and started a re- bellion against the state government. Only by getting private subscriptions from wealthy mer- chants was the state able to raise a military force strong enough to meet Shays. Shays, a reluctant rebel, proved to be a very poor leader. His main force was easily defeated early in February 1787, and within a few weeks the rebels were wholly dispersed. Only ten men were killed on both sides, and two rebels were later hanged. So Shays's Re- bellion proved to be one of the mildest in his- tory. But it caused great alarm throughout the United States. Even Samuel Adams, a profes-"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"90 A Free Country in a New World sional friend of the people, had been for fierce measures against the Shaysites. Throughout the colonies, men who believed in orderly govern- ment were fearful. In the crisis Massachusetts might have expected help from the central gov- ernment, but Congress had neither troops nor money. Even the federal arsenal in Springfield had been saved from seizure only by the Mas- sachusetts mihtia. Here was just one more ex- ample of the feebleness of the government that had been set up by the Articles of Con- federation. Gloomy Prospects By the year 1787, it seemed as though the prophecies of those who said that the United States, or any other large repubhc, could not form an eflFective government were being ful- filled. The British held the fm- posts and con- trolled the Indians of the Northwest; the Span- ish closed the mouth of the Mississippi and controlled the Indians of the Southwest; feel- ing between creditors and debtors had reached the point of civil war; the West threatened secession; foreign commerce, handicapped by the weakness of the Confederation Congress, was still below what it was in 1774, the year before the Revolutionary War began. There was serious talk that the United States might divide into three or four smaller confederacies. These were some of the difficulties which led Washington to write his friend Henry Lee a gloomy letter: They [the difiBculties of the United States] ex- hibit a melancholy proof of what our transatlantic foe has predicted; and of another thing, perhaps, which is still more to be regretted, and is yet more unaccountable, that mankind, when left to them- selves, are unfit for their own government. I am mortified beyond expression when I view the clouds that have spread over the brightest mom that ever dawned on any country. THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION Washington did not content himself with writing letters. At this time he was much in- terested in a project to build a canal by way of the Potomac River toward the Ohio River system. He saw this venture as a means both of enriching Virginia and of keeping the west- em settlements in the Union. He was one of those who felt strongly, however, that it was fruitless to build canals to overcome natural barriers while there remained pohtical barriers such as tariffs and varying currencies. In 1785_ representatives of Virginia and Maryland met at Washington's home in Mt. Vernon to discuss common problems relating to such matters as the navigation of Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac. The conference worked out an agree- ment between the two states providing for joint control of currencies, import duties, and navigation. It also issued an invitation to all the states asking them to send delegates to Aimapohs, Maryland, for a discussion of better commercial relations. The Annapolis Convention When the Annapohs Convention met in 1786, only five states were represented, so it was powerless. One of the t\\velve delegates, however, was Alexander Hamilton of New York, who ardently desired a powerful central government. Hamilton persuaded his fellow delegates to send a memorial to the thirteen states and to Congress calling for a new con- vention which should devise a uniform system of contiolling commerce and propose measures to make the federal government more effective. Congress acted on this suggestion and sirni- moned representatives of the states to a meet- ing in Philadelphia, \"for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confedera- tion.\""},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Trials of a New Nation 91 Opening of the Constitutional Convention The date set for the opening of the Consti- tutional Convention was May 14, 1787, but it was not until ten days later that enough dele- gates had gathered to do business. Eventually twelve states were represented, although some state delegates did not arrive until midsummer. Of the 73 men chosen as delegates, only 55 ever attended. The average number at sessions of the convention was about 30. In spite of the discouraging start and small attendance, the members settled down to hard work at once. They were in session almost every weekday for sixteen weeks, usually meeting both morning and afternoon. George Washington, who repre- sented Virginia, was elected presiding oflScer. To insure good order, the rules of the conven- tion said, \"That every member, rising to speak, shall address the President; and whilst he shall be speaking, none shall pass between them, or hold discourse with another, or read a book, pamphlet, or paper. . . .\" It was also agreed that the meetings should be private, and mem- bers were forbidden to let the public know what went on in the debates. This secrecy aroused suspicion, but it had the advantage of making compromise easier by preventing dis- putes within the convention from exciting peo- ple outside. The convention was fortunate in its mem- bership, which included many of the ablest political leaders in the United States. The ma- jority were college graduates, and their study of Greek and Latin had familiarized them with the pohtical writings of Aristotle and Cicero. Nearly all of them had had practical experience in government. More than half had sat either in the Continental Congress or the Confedera- tion Congress and so had seen for themselves the unhappy consequences of weakness at the center. The delegates were mostly young men, their average age being 42. They were vigorous. bold, imaginative, and ambitious. They were obsessed vWth a vision of a great continental republic that would teach the world that men were capable of governing themselves. Motives of the Founding Fathers The members of the Constitutional Conven- tion were hardheaded as well as visionary. They were, for the most part, lawyers, merchants, and plantation owners. Such people would benefit from a stronger central government. Landowners wanted the better markets for their produce that would come with the commercial treaties a stronger government could arrange. Merchants wanted better protection for Amer- ican shipping and a national currency that would promote interstate commerce. Owners of western lands wanted protection from the Indians. Creditors wanted more severe bank- ruptcy laws, an end to inflation of currency by the states, and a government that paid its debts. Because the propertied classes wanted a stronger union and would benefit from it, rthe work of the Philadelphia Convention hasvbeen portrayed as a sort of plot whereby the wealthy created a government for their own selfish pur- poses. This \"rich man's plot\" theory overlooks the fact that the Constitution was designed to benefit the poor as well as the rich and that if a stronger government had not been created, the United States ^ight have broken up. A new government could have been formed only by the relatively well-to-do, since at the time the Constitution was created, they alone had the necessary knowledge, political experience, and training to see the needs of the whole country.

His dignity and fairness as presiding oflScer also helped to keep the debates orderly and in good temper. Madison, thirty-six years old, was the first delegate to arrive in Philadelphia, and he came better prepared than any other. He had made a special study of confederations and leagues, ancient and modem, and he brought with him a plan for a new government of the United States. His ideas were embodied in the so-called Virginia Plan, presented to the convention by Edmund Randolph. The Virginia Plan became the basis for discussion in the convention and provided the main ideas for the government as finally set up. Benjamin Franklin represented Pennsyl- vania. Over eighty years old, often in pain, and 92"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"so weak that he had to be carried to the meet- ings in a sedan chair, Franklin took no prom- inent part in tlie debates. His tact and cheerful- ness, along with his ability to tell a good story, helped to keep the convention from breaking up when disagreements developed and tempers rose. Furthermore, he was so popular that, like Washington, he helped to make the convention a success by his mere presence. From New York came Hamilton, one of the youngest men in the convention and per- haps the most brilliant. Hamilton was not par- ticularly influential, however, because his at- tendance was irregular and his views were extreme. He proposed a government in which the states would be reduced to mere provinces under governors appointed by the president of the United States, who was to hold office for life. Hamilton's attitude perhaps had a certain usefulness, since it made other plans to strengthen the union seem mild by comparison. CONCORD, CONFLICT, COMPROMISE Historians have sometimes emphasized the difi^erences of opinion and the resulting con- troversies that divided the members of the Philadelphia Convention. When one considers, however, the varying interests of the states they represented, the remarkable fact is that the delegates were in concord about so many as- pects of their common task. (1) Most of them were \"nationahsts,\" who beUeved that the highest loyalty of Americans should be to the country as a whole rather than to the separate states. The Virginia Plan frankly called the three branches of the government it proposed the \"National Legislature,\" the \"Na- tional E.\\ecutive,\" and the \"National Judiciary.\" The members of the convention believed that the Articles of Confederation were so hope- lessly inadequate for the needs of the country that they decided to create an entirely new James Madison as portrayed by Gilbert Stuart. Al- though a man of great ability, Madison was over- shadowed by his great friend and political colleague, Thomas Jefferson. With Hamilton and Jay, Madison wrote the articles in The Federalist. frame of government. Here, they agreed with Washington, who urged them to create a gov- ernment they beheved in even if it meant vio- lating their instructions, which said they were to do no more than amend the Articles. (2) As good children of the eighteenth- century Enlightenment, the convention mem- bers believed that there were \"Laws of Nature and of Nature's God\" that governed men, akin to those that governed the physical universe. Madison, for instance, had been much im- pressed by the orrery, an intricate and extraor- dinarily accurate mechanical model of the solar system, that Princeton College had bought from David Rittenhouse of Philadelphia (see photo). Just as Newton had revealed that the solar sys- tem was a wonderful mechanism held in its pre- 93"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"94 A Free Country in a New World dictable course by balancing centrifugal force and the power of gravity, so Madison and his colleagues believed that political scientists could discover means to balance such opposing forces as liberty and authority. It was in keeping with this point of \\'iew that one member of the Philadelphia Convention spoke of how \"the general government was to be likened to the sun, the center, and the state governments to the other planets revolving around it. Virginia was the Earth and Kentucky her moon.\" The two political scientists who carried the most weight were John Locke, some of whose ideas we have already encountered in the Declaration of Independence, and Baron Charles de Mon- tesquieu, a Frenchman whose most important work. The Spirit of Laws, was published in 1748. Montesquieu's WTitings, taken as political gospel by the makers of the American Constitu- tion, insisted on the necessity of separating the Montesquieu, Political Phllosoplier It is difficult to get sometfiing out of nothing. And the men at Philadelphia were political practitioners, not philosophers. Where did they get the Constitution? Primarily, they drew on the British constitution. Their view of that unwritten docu- ment, however, was colored by an analysis of it written by Charles Louis de Secondat, Baron de la Br6de et de Montesquieu. And who was he? A judge, legal scholar, satirist, and above all, political philosopher. He was an eighteenth-century Frenchman, a provincial noble who looked so like a peasant as to be mistaken for one as he worked on his lands at La Brede, near Bordeaux. He spent over twenty years analyzing the nature of man and the nature of government. His witty, bitingly accurate Persian Letters surveyed the Parisian court scene through the eyes of two incredulous Persians. But he reserved his best writing, with its \"gaiety, . . . balance, . . . level-headedness, [andt simplicity of style,\" for the monumental De I'esprit des lois — in English, The Spirit of Laws. In that work he described free government in terms that the Founding Fathers of the American republic could appreciate and use. He said that he found in the British constitution the doctrines of the \"separation of powers\" and of \"checks and balances.\" Although modern political writers feel that he was mistaken in some details, he believed that in England men's liberties were protected from arbitrary government because legislative, executive, and judicial powers were \"separated,\" that is, held by different people. Parliament made the laws, the execu- tive (in England, the king) carried them out, and an independent judiciary enforced them. While these ideas were not original with him, his reputation helped to elevate them into \"laws\" of politics, considered by eighteenth-century students of govern- ment to be as fixed as the law of gravity. They also accorded with American colonial experience, since the governors of the thirteen colonies had been appointed by the crown and the legislatures elected by the colonists themselves. The book, published in 1748, was known and used by such diverse Americans as Sam Adams, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton. The last two, for instance, cited it in their Federalist papers as an authority beyond all others on the nature of republican government, a position now often accorded The Federalist itself.

(3) Although familiar with political theory, the delegates were practical politicians who thought constantly in terms of what would work. In attempting to create a federal govern- ment and to define its powers, they were guided by their experiences with British and colonial government. In many important features, the government they set up was simply an adapta- tion of the government of England. (4) The convention was unanimous in want- ing to protect property rights from such assaults as Shays's Rebellion and the Rhode Island paper money laws. They saw these attacks as resulting from an \"excess of democracy.\" Here they found support in the works of Locke, who saw protection of property as the principal task of government, and in the writings of Aristotle, the Greek philosopher, who saw extreme democracy as leading first to chaos and then to tyranny.

There \\\\'ere two serious conflicts in the con- vention for which it proved difficult to find com- promises: that betvveen the large states and the small states over the basis of representation in Congress, and that between the northern and southern states arising from diff^ering economic interests and from slavery. The Conflict Between Big and Small States The dispute bet^veen the large and small states almost broke up the convention. The large states demanded that the representation of each state in both houses of Congress be based on population. By what possible right, they asked, could Delaware's 40,000 inhabitants demand permanent equality with Virginia's 750,000? The small states were just as insistent that they would never part with the equal power they enjoyed under the Articles of Con- federation. If representation in the new Con- gress was to be on the basis of population, they feared to be swallowed up. William Paterson of New Jersey said his state would \"rather sub- mit to a monarch, to a despot, than to such a fate.\" There was also disagreement as to the very nature of the new federal government. As a basis for the Constitution, the large state dele- gates generally favored Madison's Virginia Plan. This proposed a government with sepa- rate executive, legislative, and judicial depart- ments and with the states reduced to a clearly subordinate position. The small state delegates tended to favor the New Jersey Plan, the work of Paterson, which provided only for strengthen- ing the Articles of Confederation. Over this conflict the Constitutional Conven- tion came to \"a full stop,\" as one delegate de- scribed it. Washington wrote a friend that he despaired of the convention and repented hav- ing had anything to do with it. For a week, during a spell of hot weather, there was bitter debate, while flies buzzed over the delegates' heads and settled on legs exposed by knee breeches. There seemed no middle ground be- tween the demands of the large and the small states. Franklin proposed that each session be opened with prayer, to invoke divine aid in finding an acceptable compromise. The jam was broken when the delegates took a day off to celebrate the Fourth of July."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"96 A Free Country in a New World During the recess, a committee worked out what has since been called \"the Great Compro- mise.\" According to this arrangement in the lower house of Congress, the House of Repre- sentatives, the number of members would be based on population; in the upper house, the Senate, each state would have an equal vote. This was accepted by a vote of 5 states to 4, with one state evenly divided and the others not represented. So today Nevada sends but one representative to Congress and the adjoining state of California sends thirty-eight, but each is represented by two senators. Equal represen- tation in the Senate is a provision of the Con- stitution that may not be changed unless a state agrees to give up the right. On the whole, the Great Compromise was a victory for the small states, since they gained the right to be perpetually represented in the Senate beyond their population. On other mat- ters, however, the convention tended to follow the Virginia Plan, favored by the big states, which provided for a strong and eflFective cen- tral government. Compromises Between North and South Once the dispute between small and big states was settled, the other dangerous conflict was that which eventually led to the Civil War —that between the commercial interests of the North and the plantation interests of the South. The Southerners wanted to count slaves in the population for determining representation to Congress, but not for direct taxation; the North wanted to count slaves for taxation but not for representation. This disagreement was settled by the three-fifths ratio, according to which five slaves were counted as equal to three free people in determining both a state's representa- tion and taxation. The delegates from South Carolina and Georgia, the only states where slavery was profitable in the 1780's, were afraid that a na- tional government might deprive them of their supply of slaves by putting an end to the slave trade. They insisted that the Constitution should forbid any interference with the slave trade and made this a condition of joining the Union. It was arranged that for twenty years the federal government might not prevent the importation of slaves or charge an import duty of more than $10 a head. The other point of dispute between North and South concerned commerce. Northern mer- chants and shippers wanted a government with ample powers to pass navigation laws to pro- tect shipping from foreign competition. South- em planters, fearing that they would be forced to pay more for shipping their produce abroad, insisted that a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress should be required to pass naviga- tion laws. Such a provision would give the South practically a veto on such legislation. The South also feared that the federal government would try to raise money by duties on exports such as tobacco. As the great ex-porting region, the South would then pay more than its share of taxes. A compromise was arranged whereby navigation laws might be passed by a simple majority in Congress, while the federal govern- ment was forbidden to levy taxes of any Idnd on exports. THE NEW FEDERAL GOVERNMENT These compromises cleared the way for the two essential jobs of the Philadelphia Conven- tion: to give the federal government more power and to provide a workable machinery of government. The new Constitution clearly granted to the federal government the powers it had most needed under the Articles of Confederation: (1) It could levy and collect taxes, except duties on exports, provided such taxes were"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Triab of a New Ngtion 87 \"uniform throughout the United States.\" The new government would be able to pay its own way rather than beg from the states. (2) It could regulate commerce with foreign nations and between the states. Thus it could write and enforce commercial treaties which would increase foreign trade, and it could keep trade among the states free of barriers. (3) It had the sole right to coin money and regulate its value, so there would be only one national standard of money instead of state cur- rencies with differing values. Many of the powers granted the central government were not new but were simply carried over from the Articles of Confederation. For instance, the Articles had granted power to Congress to raise armies and navies and borrow money. But since the Confederation Congress could not raise money by taxation, such powers existed only on paper. Now the federal gov- ernment could carry out all the powers granted to it. This was especially true because it could exert its power directly on individuals and com- pel them to obey. Under the Confederation, the central government had generally been able to act only through the states. Now it could carry out its laws through its own agents, such as revenue collectors, and enforce its laws in federal courts. In certain matters the states were put under federal control. No longer might state legisla- tures relieve debtors by scaling dowTi debts or issuing paper money. No state might levy tariffs on goods from another state. Moreover, all state officials had to swear to support the Constitution of the United States, as well as federal laws and treaties. This made all of them, from gov- ernors to constables, agents of the federal government as well as of their own states. The state militias were also put under control of Congress, so that they might be used in the future for defense of the nation or for the sup- pression of uprisings like Shays's Rebellion. THE STRUGGLE OVER RATIFICATION On September 17, 1787, the Founding Fathers, as the members of the Philadelphia Convention came to be called, held their last meeting and signed the document they had written. In the evening they held a farewell dinner. Their work, however, was not yet over. It remained to be seen whether the states would agree to accept the new Constitution. The authors of the Constitution provided that it would go into effect when ratified by nine of the states. It was impossible to propose unanimous acceptance, as pro\\'ided in the Articles of Con- federation, because Rhode Island was certain not to ratify and other states were doubtful. Ratification was to be carried out by conven- tions called for the purpose, a democratic process following out the idea of the Declara- tion of Independence that governments \"derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.\" To get even nine states to ratify the Con- stitution was no small task. Opposition was \\videspread, and there was suspicion of any sort of strong central government. Why revolt from Great Britain, it was asked, simply to fall under a new Idnd of tyranny? Debtors and paper-money advocates were opposed to any plan forcing full payment of debts and restoring sound currency. Popular leaders, including Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee of Vir- ginia, George Clinton of New York, and Samuel Adams and John Hancock of Massachusetts, maintained that a federal government as power- ful as that provided in the Constitution would eventually suppress the Hberties of the people. \"Fe«leraiists\" and \"Anti-Federalists\" Those who favored the new plan of govern- ment, most of whom should rightly have been called \"nationahsts,\" called themselves \"Feder- alists\" to emphasize the fact that under the new"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"98 FIRST VOTES ON RATIFICATION OF THE CONSTITUTION*"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Trials of a Neiv Natiot^ 99 to offer other than to continue with the hapless Confederation or to call a new constitutional convention. ( 2 ) In the election districts of the time, the more recently settled backcountry, which tended to be Anti-Federalist, was under- represented. Therefore, the votes of the Feder- alist coastal districts counted more heavily than their actual numbers warranted. ( 3 ) The Federalists were supported by men commanding great popularity and respect, es- pecially Franklin and Washington. They were supported by most of the newspapers of the country. They usually had the better of the ar- gument in pamphlets, sermons, and debates in state ratifying conventions. The electioneering over ratification produced, in fact, one of the finest pieces of political writing of all time. This was a collection of eighty-five articles, called the Federalist, written by Hamilton, Madison, and John Jay to explain how the Constitution would benefit the people. The articles were originally published under a pen name in a newspaper, the New York Journal. The very first paragraph contains a passage that reveals the great importance the Founding Fathers at- tached to the success of the American union, not only for this country, but for the world: It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the im- portant question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good govern- ment from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force. Although written for the needs of the moment, the Federalist papers contain so much political wisdom that they are still widely read and have had a continuing influence not only in this coimtry, but in South America and in Europe. (4) The Federalists succeeded in getting the Constitution ratified not merely because they were pohticaUy wise, but also because they were politically shrewd. In states where there was strong opposition, they were able to outmaneuver their opponents. In Pennsylvania, the Federalists managed to call an election to the state convention before the Anti-Federalists had a chance to organize. In Massachusetts, a slight majority against the Constitution was changed to a slight margin in its favor by sug- gestions to the influential John Hancock that he might be elected the first president under the new government. In New York two-thirds of the State Convention were Anti-Federalists. But the persuasiveness of John Jay and the news that ten states had already ratified induced enough Anti-Federahsts to change sides so that New York became the \"eleventh pillar\" of the new federal roof. Ratification Completed The vote in various key states was extremely close: in Massachusetts it was 187 in favor of the Constitution to 168 opposed, in Virginia 88 to 78, and in New York 30 to 27. By July 1788, however, all the states except Rhode Island and North Carolina had ratified, and preparations were made to start the new gov- ernment the next year. As the news of the state ratifications came in, there were great Federahst celebrations in the cities. These culminated in an Independence Day procession in Philadelphia in which there were eighty-eight separate parts and about five thousand participants. The displays included elaborate floats drawn by as many as ten horses. All the various craftsmen took part, many of them giving demonstrations of their art. Shoe- makers made shoes; cabinetmakers made chairs; and a pair of blacksmiths made plow irons out of old su'ords. Following the craftsmen came the officials of the city and state, the students at the University of Pennsylvania, the lawyers and law students, military companies, and \"the clergy of the different denominations, and the Rabbi of the Jews, walking arm in arm.\" The"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Federalists evidendy knew how to enlist public opinion. The framing and adoption of the Constitu- tion were indeed events worthy of celebration. The Constitution was a unique document whose influence on the course of world history cannot yet be estimated. It gave a new meaning to the word \"federal\" by creating a new type of government, one which attempts to combine a powerful national government with vigorous local go\\emments, and thus meets the needs both of the nation as a whole and of particular regions. It has provided a pattern for uniting other large areas, such as Canada and Austraha. It is especially adapted today for meeting the needs of new nations containing peoples of dif- ferent languages and cultures, such as India and Nigeria. Advocates of a imion of the free nations have recommended it as a model. It was an impressive fact that this new, strong government was formed not by military leaders bent on conquest, nor by a seizure of power by a strong man or clique, but by citizens acting for the good of the country and submit- ting their work to their fellow countrymen. As the French student of America, Alexis de Tocqueville observed, \"It is new in the history of a society to see a great people tiun a calm and scrutinizing eye upon itself . . . when the wheels of its government are stopped.\" Activities: Chapter 4 To the Student: See pp. 30-31 for suggestions as to how to use these chapter-end activities.

THEMES PARTI Recurring ideas, concepts, or \"themes\" run through most of American history and help to give it its unique character. Most of these are either explicit or implicit in each of the nine Parts into which this text Is divided. It is useful, however, to select particular themes for illustration, emphasis, and study at the end of each Part. The first two themes described in the Prologue — \"economic opportunity\" and \"wide participation in politics\" — are of particular relevance to the early history of the United States. In considering them, questions such as these arise: 1. What was the strongest motivation in bringing men and women to colonial America — religion, patriotism, force, search for adventure, or economic opportunity? 2. Which was the more important cause of the American Revolution, political grievances or economic grievances? If the latter, what special grievances of what special groups? See Labaree, The Road to Independence, 1763-1776 3. The Preamble to the Constitution of the United States declares that the Constitution was ordained by \"We, the People of the United States.\" Just what people actually did the ordaining? This matter is discussed in Broderick, The Origins of the Constitution, 1776-1789, especially pp. 49-67. 4. What was the economic reason for the statesmanlike provisions of the North- west Ordinance that offered settlers in the Northwest Territory eventual self- government and statehood? See Bragdon et al., Frame of Government, pp. 64-87. READINGS PART1 Special Supplements Arnof, 'A Sense of the Past, Part One.

What starts with a few street riots or demands for a new constitution escalates into full-scale social upheaval, mass violence, and civil war and ends in dictatorship as the only apparent alternative to anarchy. This was the course pursued, for instance, by two of the great revolu- tions of modern times, the French Revolution that started in 1789 and the Russian Revolution of 1917. Usually, the moderate leaders of the early phase are im- prisoned, exiled, or executed by later extremists. The American Revolution was unusual in that it ran its course with little domestic violence, and the same men who led the revolutionary movement at the first also guided the destinies of the new nation. As previous chapters have shown, the Americans set up local governments with little difficulty and, after a period of uncertainty, wrote a new constitution to bind the thirteen states together. The great English statesman William E. Gladstone once called the Constitu- tion of the United States \"the most wonderful work ever struck off at one time by the brain and purpose of man.\" While people interested in fields other than politics, such as literature, music, art, or science, may dispute Gladstone's opinion, there can be little doubt that the Constitution is one of the most important docu- ments in the history of the world. It is the oldest written frame of government used by any major country, and most constitutions adopted since 1789 have been influenced by it. But it is one thing to write a constitution and another to make it work. The United States Constitution was a success not merely because the Founding Fathers at Philadelphia were able, informed, moderate, and persuasive. The new govern- ment needed men of the highest ability, and fortunately they were available. For the most part, the same men who led the thirteen states through the War of Independence and the troubled period that followed it now helped to set up the new national government. The first three Presidents were George Washington, commander of the Continental Army, John Adams, leader of the independence movement in the Second Continental Congress, and Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence. They did their work well, and the American Revolution brought nationhood and self-government along with independence. In another sense the American Revolution is not yet over: the principle of equal opportunity for all, expressed in the Declaration of Independence, has never been achieved, in spite of immense advances during the nearly two cen- turies since it was written. And the Revolution goes on, as Americans continue to crusade for equality."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 The Constitution of the United States It will be the pattern for all future constitutions and the admiration of all future ages. WILLIAM PITT Every American citizen should have a thor- ough knowledge of the Constitution. To under- stand the Constitution requires that the student know the different ways in which it has been applied and interpreted in the course of nearly two centuries. To encourage frequent reference, the pages on which it is printed are edged in blue. In studying the following pages the reader should note that: (1) Description of general features of the federal government and the Constitution is placed at the top of the right-hand pages in double column. ( 2 ) Explanatory notes on particular clauses, phrases, or terms are printed on the bottom part of the right-hand page. (3) Portions of the Constitution that are no longer in operation are printed in light-face type. (4) The descriptive headings on Articles, Sections, and clauses of the Constitution are not part of the document itself, but have been added for the convenience of the readers. One way to study this chapter systemati- cally is as follows: ( 1 ) Read through an article, rather rapidly, simply to get the over-all sense of what it is about. (2) Read the relevant sections of the gen- eral discussion on the top right-hand pages, referring constantly to the document itself. (3) Read the explanatory notes of the arti- cle, again referring to the actual text. (4) Go on to subsequent articles and do the same thing, but do not attempt to do too much at one sitting.

When the preamble states, \"We the- ?e«ple of the United States ... do ordain and establish this Constitution . . .\" it follows the principle expressed in the Declaration of Independence: that governments derive \"their just powers from the consent of the governed.\" The Constitution was drawn up by representa- tives of the p)eople and ratified in conventions elected by them. In 1789, however, \"We the People\" did not mean all the people, but only the minority pos- sessing pohtical rights. The right to vote was limited to white adult males with a certain amount of propert>'. The proportion of voters varied from state to state. We do not know just how many voted in elections, but in any case it was certainly a minority. In the many years since the Constitution went into effect, how- ever, the advance of democracy has broadened the meaning of \"We the People\" so much that today it means \"nearly all adults.\" For many years there was dispute as to whether \"We the People of the United States\" meant \"We the people of the difiFerent states\" or \"We the people of an American Nation.\" In 1789 the former meaning was more accurate: the delegates to the Philadelphia Convention were chosen by states, the Constitution was ratified state by state, and a man's first loyalty was to his state. The meaning of the phrase changed, however, as the loyalty of the Ameri- can people to the nation became stronger than that to the states. (See, for instance, the ac- count of Daniel Webster's \"Second Reply to Hayne,\" pp. 264-265. ) Each purpose of the Constitution described in the preamble had a special meaning in 1789. The authors of the Constitution were trying to create \"a more perfect Union\" than the Articles of Confederation. They sought to \"establish Justice\" for creditors, to \"insure domestic Tran- quility\" by suppressing disorders such as Shays's Rebellion, and to \"provide for the com- mon defence\" against Indians and Barbary pi- rates. They hoped the new government would \"promote the general Welfare\" by increasing interstate and foreign commerce. Finally, the purpose of the Constitution was to \"secure the Blessings of Liberty\" by creating a stronger government to protect people in their rights. Thi^, was different from the purpose of the Declaration of Independence which had been to obtain liberty by freeing the United States from the strong government of England. Since the establishment of the Constitution, its purposes have become wider. Today, for in- stance, the federal government tries to \"estab- lish Justice\" in ways not dreamed of in 1789. It attempts to define the rights and duties of labor unions, to fix \"fair\" rates for railroads and bus lines, to protect businessmen from \"unfair\" competition, and consumers from misbranded products. When Americans \"provide for the common defence\" in this century, they may be defending not merely the shores of America, but alhes all over the globe. Provision for the \"general welfare\" now includes federal aid to the needy and unfortunate, such as medical care for the elderly. Today, then, the preamble to the Constitu- tion has a far broader meaning than in 1789. Then a minority set up the federal government to provide for the simple needs of a small rural population living on the edge of an iso- lated continent. Now the federal government represents the great majority of the people, and the Constitution must provide for the complex needs of a great industrial nation in a world made small by instantaneous communication and rapid transportation."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"ARTICLE I.

This was a return to the EngHsh system whereby Pariiament is divided into a House of Lords and a House of Commons. The Senate was originally designed to resem- ble the House of Lords in being somewhat removed from popular control, and the House of Representatives to resemble the Commons in being more democratic. In the American system, a further diflEerence between the two branches of Congress resulted from the Great Compromise (see p. 95). The House, chosen on a basis of population, represented the idea of a nation. The Senate, in which each state is equally represented, retained the idea of a league. Usually in a bicameral legislature one house or the other becomes dominant, and it is usu- ally the house more directly responsible to the people that gains the upper hand. The culmi- nation of this process can be seen most clearly in Great Britain where nearly all legislative power is now lodged in the House of Com- mons, and the House of Lords has become Uttle more than a ceremonial body. In the United States neither the House nor the Senate has gained ascendancy over the other, although individual senators generally enjoy more prestige than individual congress- men, if only because the senators are fewer in number and serve longer terms. But the two bodies retain practically equal powers of le^s- lation. Since every law must be passed by both houses, each acts as a check on the other. Each house judges the qualifications of its own members and enjoys the same privileges of free debate and freedom from arrest during session. On the other hand, each branch of Congress has certain special powers. The Housp has the right to impeach members of the execu- tive and judicial departments for \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" and it first proposes bills which involve raising money. The Senate acts as a cotirt to try impeachments brought by the House, and it has the right to accept or reject the President's appointments. The most famous special power of the Senate lies in the field of foreign affairs. The President must submit treaties to the Senate before they go into operation. A vote of two-thirds of the sen- (, Continued on page 115.)

If there had continued to be one represtnlativc for each 30,000 people, the House v/ould today contain over 6,000 members. Its number is now fixed at 435. Article I, Section 2, clause 5. The speaker is chosen from the majority party in t' e House. This is in contrast to the British Parliament where the speaker is an impartial umpire \"above party.\" The powers of the speaker of the House have varied. At one time his control over debate and appointment to congressional coi.imittees was so great that he had more influence on legislation than the President. \"Impeachment\" means \"indictment,\" \"bringing charges against.\" 'thus President Andrew lohnson was impeached by the House in 1868, but when ihe Ser ite ''ailed to convict him, he remained in office.

This pro- vision was inserted to make sure that no treaty would sacrifice the interests of one section to those of another, as the 1785 Jay-Gardoqui Treaty (see p. 85) had sacrificed western in- terests to those of the Northeast. The two branches of Congress have devel- oped different ways of doing business. The House of Representatives became so imwieldy in size (435 members) that debate had to be severely restricted to get anything done at all. Nearly all the work of the House is done by committees dealing with particular problems, such as agriculture, government finances, for- eign affairs, mihtary affairs, commerce, educa- tion, and labor. The chairmen of these im- mensely powerful committees reach their posi- tion by seniority, and their average age is generally close to seventy years. Debate and the order of business in the House is strictly controlled by the Speaker and a 15-man Com- mittee on Rules. The Senate, because of its smaller size (it now contains 100 members), has been able to retain \"freedom of debate,\" which means that any senator may speak on any motion. This leads to the practice of \"filibustering,\" whereby a few senators, or even a single one, may block legislation they dislike by imlimited talk. A cloture rule to prevent this practice is rarely applied. Full-scale debate in the Senate, on the other hand, often educates the public on {Continued on page 117.) EXPLANATORY NOTES Article I, Section 3, clause 4. The Constitution did not give the Vice-President enough to do. His only stated function is to preside over the Senate, his only constitutional power to cast a vote in those rare cases when there is a tie vote. Until very recently, prominent men avoided an office regarded as a \"pohtical graveyard.\" Parties usually chose their vice-presidential candidates with a view to 'Taalancing the ticket\" by giving representation to a different section of the country or a different faction of the party than that of the presidential candidate. The office often went to men who were hardly more than political hacks. The sudden death of President Frankhn D. Roosevelt in 1945, reinforced by the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, pointed to the danger of treating the vice- presidency as unimportant. Since the second Truman administration (1949-1953), Vice- Presidents have been brought into the inner circle of presidential advisers and have been given important jobs. Most recent vice-presidential candidates have been men of prominence and high ability. Article I, Section 3, clause 6. When trying a case of impeachment brought by the House, the Senate becomes a court. The two-thirds vote necessary to convict an official under impeachment and remove him from office is one of several cases where the Constitution demands a two-thirds majority of either or both houses of Congress. Actions demanding a two-thirds vote involve matters of more than ordinary importance, or ones in which a simple majority vote might be unfair to individuals or minority groups. The complete list is as follows: (1) trial of impeachments— Article I, Section 3, clause 6 (two-thirds of the Senate); (2) expulsion of members from either house of Congress— Article I, Section 5, clause 2 (two-thirds of the house in which the member holds a seat); (3) passing a bill over the President's uefo— Article I, Section 7, clause 2 (two-thirds of both houses); (4) ratification of freoties- Article II, Section 2, clause 2 (two-thirds of the Senate); (5) proposing amendments to the Constitution (two-thirds of both houses of Congress, or a constitutional convention proposed by two-thirds of the state legislatiures)."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"2.

It also often insures thorough consideration of legislation which might other- wise be passed hurriedly. In general, however, the Senate, like the House, transacts most of its business in committee. SEPARATION OF POWERS The authors of the Constitution feared un- limited political power, no matter who wielded it. Concentration of power in the hands of a few men (oligarchy) or in one man (mon- archy) was likely to result, they knew, in the oppression of the people as a whole. The mem- bers of the Philadelphia Convention also distrusted a government -dominated by the unrestrained will of the people. They were con- vinced that such a complete democracy would be weak and changeable, and that it would enable the poor to rob the rich. Finally, there was always danger that men in oflBce would try to seize more power than the people wanted to grant them. In order to avert what they regarded as the triple dangers of tyranny, mob rule, and seizure of power, the Founding Fathers created a government based on the principle of \"sep- aration of powers.\" According to this principle —which stemmed both from American colonial experience and from the writings of Montes- quieu—the major powers of government should be divided among different officials. So in the American Constitution the first three Articles are devoted to defining the powers of the legis- lative, executive, and judicial branches of the federal government, each branch being admin- istered by different people. How careful the authorites of the Constitution were to preserve {Continued on page 119.) EXPLANATORY NOT§S N^ Article I, Section 4, clause 2. The Twentieth Amendment, ratified in 1933, has changed the date of the opening of the regular session of Congress to January 3. Article I, Section 5, clauses 1 and 2. The power enjoyed by each house of Congress to judge the qualifications of its members is absolute; there is no appeal from it to any court or other governmental agency. Very seldom, however, is a member of Congress ex- cluded or expelled, for such action robs the people of his district or state of their right to be represented in the national legislature. Among the reasons why individual members of the House or Senate have been excluded or expelled have been the following: practicing polygamy, using corruption and fraud in elections, advocating a sociahst revolution, and bribing fellow members of Congress to vote generous land grants to railroads. Article I, Section 6, clause 1. Members of Congress now receive a salary of $45,000 plus a tax-free expense account and staff assistance in proportion to the size of their con- stituency anu load of committee work. Very few congressmen can more than break even on their salary because their expenses are heavy. The privileges of congressmen— freedom from arrest during session and freedom of speech within the halls of Congress— are taken from the practice of the British Parliament. These were won by the House of Commons during a long struggle with the Stuart kings of England in the seventeenth century. Such privileges may be abused, as when congressmen recklessly accuse defenseless individuals. Congressional immunity is necessary, however, if congressmen are to act independently and speak freely on public questions. Article I, Section 6, clause 2. The purpose of this clause is to prevent the President from influencing congressmen by promising or giving them jobs."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"SECTION 7.

This system of separation of powers is in contrast to the British system of \"parliamen- tary\" or \"cabinet\" government. In Britain the real heads of the government, the prime min- ister and his cabinet, are chosen from the legis- lature itself. They represent the party that commands a majority in the House of Com- mons. Thus, instead of being separated, the British executive and legislative powers are merged. CHECKS AND BALANCES To prevent any branch of the federal gov- ernment from overstepping its powers, the Constitution sets up an elaborate system of \"checks and balances\" whereby each branch of govermnent is given some power to oversee or interfere in the work of the others. Thus the lawmaking power of Congress is checked by the President's veto, which is a negative power of legislation. While it is the President's job as chief executive to appoint civil servants and judges, the Senate shares in this executive power since it must ratify all major appoint- ments. Although it is the function of the fed- eral judiciary to try persons accused of crime, the President has the judicial power of granting pardons and reprieves. Separation of powers plus checks and bal- ances have received criticism. If any two branches of the federal government disagree, decisive action may be difficult, even impos- sible. Especially if the President and Congress are in opposition, the government tends to go into \"dead center,\" with Congress unwilling to take action recommended by the President, and the President vetoing bills passed by Congress. In any case, checks and balances tend to slow up federal action to such a degree that one (Continued on page 121.) EXPLANATORY NOTES Article I, Section 7, clause 2. The President has a \"suspensive veto\"; it suspends action until Congress has a chance to try to \"override\" the veto by a two-thirds vote. The Presi- dent within less than ten days of the end of a congressional sitting may also use the \"pocket veto.\" In such case, the President ignores a bill (\"puts it in his pocket\"), and it automatically fails to become a law. Article I, Section 8, clauses 1 and 3. These clauses contain the most important new powers: taxation and control over interstate and foreign commerce. The ta.\\ing power has been used for other purposes than raising money. Protective tariffs have always been levied in order to promote American industry. Since \"the power to tax is the power to destroy,\" heavy taxation has been used to prevent the use of certain products, such as sulphur matches, by raising their price so high that no one would buy them. Congress has attempted to discourage gambling by a special tax on professional gamblers. Article I, Section 8, clause 3. The exact meaning of \"commerce\" has caused controversy for many years (see Gibbons v. Ogden, p. 233). The tendency has been constantly to expand the meaning and the application of the word.

They are a protection against rash, ill-considered action. These advantages probably more than out- weigh the apparent ineflBciency of the system. THE FEDERAL SYSTEM Article I, Section 8, has been called \"the heart of the Constitution.\" It grants the federal government the great powers needed to govern the United States effectively. In the many years since the Constitution went into effect, it has been found necessary to add very few new powers to the original list. The authors of the Constitution attempted to set up a system of \"divided sovereignty,\" whereby the federal government was to con- trol interstate and foreign relations, while the states controlled local affairs. This arrangement was probably a result of the fact that during the colonial period Americans had become \\ised to a similar scheme. To try to prevent such an increase in the powers of the central govern- ment as had caused the American Revolution, the Founding Fathers made the federal govern- ment one of \"enumerated powers.\" This meant that the actions of the government of the United States were restricted to the powers specifically granted in the Constitution. All other power remained in the hands of the states. In the course of time federal powers ex- panded with the needs of a growing coxmtry. Until recently this was in part accomphshed by interpretation of the so-called \"elastic clause\" (Article I, Section 8, clause 18). This states that Congress may make all laws \"neces- sary and proper\" for putting into effect its stated powers. Just what \"necessary and proper\" meant was a matter of bitter dispute. Those who wished to restrain the power of the federal government emphasized the word \"nec- essary.\" They were known as \"strict construc- tionists,\" because they wished to interpret the Constitution strictly and so Hmit the federal {Continued on page 123.)

This arrangement was designed to end the confusion which resulted when each state had its own currency. Article I, Section 8, clause 11. The Founding Fathers probably intended that the power to declare war should lie exclusively with Congress. From the very first, however, the President, as commander in chief of the armed forces, carried on warfare without a formal declaration by Congress. The United States carried on undeclared war with France in 1798-1800 during the presidency of John Adams and with Tripoli in 1801-1805 under Thomas Jefferson. In modem times the Korean and Vietnam wars are examples of hos- tilities engaged in without a formal congressional declaration, although the war effort in both cases received congressional support. Article I, Section 8, clause 12. The condition that money may be voted for the armed forces for oiJy two years reveals fear of a standing army.

Those who desired to expand federal power stressed the word \"proper.\" They were known as \"loose con- structionists\" because they wished to allow the federal government to exercise power implied in the document. Loose constructionists argued, for instance, that the enumerated power to build post roads implied the right to dig canals. No matter how much the \"elastic clause\" might be stretched, federal power was theoret- ically limited to the purposes stated in the Con- stitution. According to the Tenth Amendment: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. The twentieth century has seen such im- mense expansion of federal power that the idea that certain matters are exclusively reserved for local jurisdiction is breaking down. This was dramatized by the establishment of cabinet- level Departments of Health, Education and Welfare in 1953 and of Housing and Urban Development in 1965. Local governments lacked revenues to provide relief for the unemployed or decent schools, so the federal government pro- vided funds, at the same time having a say in how they should be spent. When states allowed or even promoted discrimination against mi- nority groups, Congress passed laws whereby the federal government guaranteed the right to vote and to use public facilities such as buses and restaurants. In the course of the Cold War, defense spending has become a seemingly permanent part of the economy, and where defense contracts are awarded may determine whether an urban area will be prosperous or poor. {Continued on page 125.)

Several phrases in this clause protect creditors from state laws designed to make it easier for debtors to repay what they have borrowed. The states are forbidden to \"emit Bills of Credit\"— that is, to print paper money which would reduce the value of the currency.

In spite of the growth of federal power, lo- cal governments still have the major share in controlling matters that concern the day-to-day lives of people most closely— health, schooling, water supply, police and fire protection. This promotes democracy by encouraging people to take an active interest in local politics. States and cities often serve as \"political laboratories\" where new attempts to solve the ever-changing problems of an industrial civilization may be worked out. They are schools of politics for many men who later hold federal office. The federal system thus retains vigor, even though the strict division between the sover- eignty of the national and state governments has become a thing of the past. THE PRESIDENCY ^ No branch of the federal government gave the authors of the Constitution so much diffi- culty as the executive department. The Found- ing Fathers knew that a strong President was needed, but they also had to reckon with wide- spread fear of a strong executive. This was a carry-over from the struggles with royal gover- nors in colonial times and from the dislike of George III during the Revolution. Under the circumstances it is surprising how much power the President was granted. He has been called \"an elective monarch,\" and histori- cally this is an accurate description. The Presi- dent's major powers are those formerly enjoyed by the king of England. They are, briefly, ( 1 ) conduct of foreign affairs, (2) supreme com- mand of the army and navy, (3) appointment of executive and judicial officers, (4) the right to reprieve or pardon those accused of crime, and (5) a veto on legislation. In addition to these great powers, the President had a four- year term and was allowed to succeed himself in office. Contrast this to the position of many state governors, who in the 1780's were allowed to hold office for only one year, had no veto power, and were not allowed to succeed them- selves. It is no wonder that during the fight over ratification in 1787 and 1788 the Anti- (Continued on page 127.) EXPLANATORY NOTES Article II, Section 1, clause 2. The Philadelphia Convention had trouble deciding how the President was to be chosen. A proposal to have him selected by Congress was voted down because it would violate the principle of separation of powers. Direct election was rejected because of fear that a President with a great popular foDowing might seize power. Choice by state legislatures, each state having one vote, was considered, but the large states were naturally opposed. The system finally agreed upon was indirect election by \"electors\" chosen for the purpose. The presidential electors are coUecUvely called the \"electoral college.\" During the early years of the republic, the presidential electors were, like the senators, chosen by state legislatm-es rather than by vote of the people. For further dis- cussion, see notes on the Twelfth Amendment (p. 143). Article II, Section 1, clause 3. This clause has been largely replaced by the Twelfth Amendment. In the original Constitution each elector had two votes, and the man with the highest number of votes became President and the next highest became Vice-President. If there was no majority, the election was throvvTi into the House of Representatives. The House, with each state having one vote, would make a choice from the highest five candi- dates. It was expected that this would happen frequently, on the assumption that electors would vote for \"favorite sons\" from their own states or regions.

Federalists made the presidency one of the principal points of attack in their criticism of the Constitution. If the Constitution went into effect, they predicted, some future President would use the great powers of his oflBce to make himself a dictator. Nearly every one of the President's stated powers has been expanded since the Constitu- tion first went in effect. At first, for instance, the veto power was used sparingly, but since Andrew Jackson's time Presidents have used the veto to hold up any legislation they dis- liked. Lincoln used his power as commander in chief as the basis for issuing the Emancipation Proclamation which declared slaves free in the South (see p. 362). Much of the President's power comes from the fact that he is head of one or the other of the two great political parties. The members of his party in Congress are under pressure to support legislation which he recommends. The presidential oflBce has also gained strength be- cause, as Grover Cleveland said, \"The presi- dency is the people's office.\" While members of Congress represent particular states, he repre- sents the whole country. His every action at- tracts nation-wide attention. No one can rival him in his ability to appeal to public opinion— especially since the invention of radio broad- casting and television. In time of crisis, as in wartime or a depres- sion, when quick, decisive action is called for, Congress may turn over many of its powers to the President \"for the duration.\" On such an occasion he may come close to being a tempo- rary dictator. The influence of the presidency varies ac- cording to the personality and purposes of men ( Continued on page 129. ) EXPLANATORY NOTES Article 11, Section 1, clause 6. Congress has made various provisions for succession to the presidency in case of the death or removal of both the President and Vice-President. As of 1966 the law provides that the speaker of the House of Representatives shall succeed to the presidency, followed by the president pro tern of the Senate. A question never satisfactorily answered until 1967 was; who decides if a President is unable to discharge the duties of his office, and in such case, who takes over? In 1919 and 1920 the country was almost leaderless when President Wilson fell seriously ill and yet failed to give others authority to act for him. The problem reappeared in less acute form when President Eisenhower suffered serious illness three times during his presidency. Both Presidents Kennedy and Johnson had written agreements with their Vice-Presidents on the disability question. These did not, of course, have the force of law. Such informal agree- ments were only interim attempts to solve a serious problem. The other question, brought back once again by the assassination of President Kennedy, was the lack of a way to fill the office of Vice-President when it became vacant. This lack had ^een noticed on previous occasions when the Vice-Presidency was vacant, but the shock of the Kennedy assassination finally forced a constitutional amendment. Both ques- tions were settled once and for all in 1967 with Amendment XXV (see p. 152). Article II, Section 2, clause I. Mention of \"the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments\" is the only suggestion of the President's cabinet to be found in the Consti- tution.

Andrew Jackson and Theo- dore Roosevelt increased their power by sheer force of personality. A President with a pro- gram of legislation he wants to put through Congress wiU generally exert more power than a \"stand-patter\" who wants to continue things as they are. During the last three decades the Presi- dent has been the leader of international alli- ances against the expansive forces of fascist and communist aggression. His decisions have pro- foundly affected the lives of men in other coun- tries as well as in his own. Greatly as the power of the President has expanded, there has never been serious danger of dictatorship. Only in times of crisis will congressmen consent to be \"rubber stamps.\" The Supreme Court also stands ready to check im- due use of power, as when in 1952 it forbade President Tnmian to settle a strike by seizing the steel industry. And America's allies cer- tainly do not accept the President's decisions without question; he must persuade them of the wisdom of any course of action. THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY Of the three branches of government, the judicial department is the one most sketchily described in the Constitution. It was simply stated that there was to be a Supreme Court and inferior courts. Other details were left for later decision by Congress. Soon after the first Congress met, during the administration of George Washington, it passed the Judiciary Act of 1789 which set up the federal courts on a plan which has been followed ever since. The lowest courts are the district courts, each presided over by a district judge. Most cases involving federal laws are tried here. Above the district courts are the circuit courts. Their prin- cipal business is to hear cases which have been appealed from district courts on the ground that there was an error or injustice in the orig- inal decision. (Continued on page 131.) EXPLANATORY NOTES Article II, Section 3. By delivering special messages urging particular laws or by calling special sessions for Congress to consider some particular problem, the President can focus public attention on legislation which he wants passed. When a crisis comes up while Con- gress is not in session, the President may attempt to keep matters in his own hands by failing to call Congress into session before the regular time. The President's duty to receive foreign diplomats carries with it the power to ask a for- eign country to withdraw its diplomatic officials from this country. This is called breaking diplomatic relations, and often carries with it the threat of war. The President likewise has the power of deciding whether or not to recognize a new foreign government. Thus in 1913 President Wilson refused to recognize a Mexican government headed by Victoriano Huerta, because Huerta had gained power by violence. Presidents Truman; Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson have all refused to recognize the Communist government of China. The President's duty to faithfully execute the laws carries with it a power to interpret laws according to his judgment. A President must decide what to do when two laws con- tradict each other— as they sometimes do. Or Presidents may vary in the degree to which they carry out a law. Thus the Sherman Antitrust Act was almost a dead letter until Theodore Roosevelt chose to enforce it more vigorously than his three predecessors (see p. 505). Article II, Section 4.

The Constitution was more precise about the types of cases which should go to federal courts than about how the courts should be set up. The principal function of the federal judiciary under the Constitution is plain: to try oflFenses against federal laws and treaties. Thus the new federal government differed from that established by the Articles of Con- federation because it could compel individual citizens to obey it. One of the most vital powers of the federal judiciary is not stated in the Constitution. This is the practice known as \"judicial review,\" whereby the courts decide whether state and federal laws accord with the Constitution. If the judiciary decides that a law is vmconstitu- tional, it ceases to have effect. Thus the federal judiciary, and especially the Supreme Court, exerts a veto power. Fvuthermore, this veto extends beyond legislation to the actions of state and federal executives (see p. 196) and to the decisions of state courts. In no other coimtry in the world does the judiciary exert so much power. It is not clear whether the authors of the Constitution meant to grant the courts such immense authority, but judicial re- view was an obvious interpretation of Article VI, clause 2, which states that the Constitu- tion is the \"supreme Law of the Land.\" Today almost the only business of the Supreme Court is constitutional questions. In the performance of its task the Supreme Court not merely decides the law, but may also issue orders (called injunctions) demand- ing compliance with its decisions. One way to override a Supreme Court decision is by the difficult process of amending the Constitution. For example, Amendment XVI permitted Con- gress to levy an income tax after the Supreme Court had declared such a tax unconstitutional. Another way of controlling the Court is by Con- gressional action. Thus the \"crime control\" Act of 1968 eliminated some restrictions the court had placed on criminal confessions to the police. Furthermore, the court is cautious in declaring state or federal actions illegal. Nor does it pass (Continued on page 133.) EXPLANATORY NOTES Article HI, Section 2, clause 1. The phrase \"in Law and Equity\" reflects the fact that American courts took over two kinds of traditional law from England. The basic law was the \"common law\" which was based on over five centuries of judicial decisions. \"Equity\" was a special branch of law developed to take care of cases where common law did not apply, or to prevent an injustice from being done. Federal courts deal mosdy in \"statute law\"— legislation passed by Congress, treaties, or the Constitution itself. \"Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction\" is a branch of law inherited from Great Britain. It covers all sorts of cases involving ships and shipping on the high seas and on navigable waters such as rivers, canals, and the Great Lakes. The meaning of the phrase \"between a state and citizens of another state\" has been altered by the Eleventh Amendment (see pp. 142-143). Article III, Section 2, clause 2. When a court has \"original jurisdiction\" over certain types of cases, it means that such cases are referred to it first. A court with \"appellate jurisdiction\" tries cases which have been appealed from lower courts. Article HI, Section 3, clause 1.

And while the justices do not face the people at election time, and so feel free to oppose the popular will, actually the court sooner or later usually \"follows the election retums\"-in other words, it goes along with pubhc opinion as expressed through the actions of state govern- ments, of Congress, and of the federal execu- tive. As old justices die or resign, new men are chosen by the party in power. Sometimes justices simply change their minds. The Su- preme Court, in short, acts as a balance wheel rather than as a brake. Federal judges hold office \"during good be- havior,\" which means for life or until they choose to resign. Combined with the provision that judges' salaries may not be reduced, this is designed to make the federal courts inde- pendent. As long as they are not guilty of \"high crimes or misdemeanors\" (for which they may be impeached), federal judges are free of popular, presidential, or congressional control. The idea of an independent judiciary origi- nated in England in the seventeenth century in order to prevent judges from being con- trolled by the king. The idea was carried over into the United States Constitution to prevent judges from being controlled by anybody. While the wisdom of the federal judiciary has often been questioned, the Supreme Court has never been touched by corruption, and it has always behaved with the dignity fitting its high position as guardian of the Constitution. INTERSTATE AND FEDERAL-STATE COOPERATION The Constitution provides for cooperation between the states and between the states and the federal government. Article IV declares that the states shall respect each other's laws and court actions, shall aid each other in bring- ing persons accused of crime to justice, and {Continued on page 135.) EXPLANATORY NOTES ^•»4.- Article IV, Section 1. The \"full faith and credit clause\" was carried over from the Articles of Confederation. It means that court judgments and legal actions such as contracts wills marriages, partnerships, and corporation charters should be valid throughout the United State's \"FuU faith and credit\" does not extend, however, to matters that fall withm what is called the \"police power\" of the states. It does not extend, for instance, to licenses to practice medicine, law, or engineering. Article IV, SecHon 2, clause 1. The \"privileges and immunities\" guaranteed by each state to citizens of other states do not include privileges that demand residential qualifications such as the right to vote, to run a restaurant, or to sell drugs. By the so-caUed \"msular decisions\" in the early twentieth century, the Supreme Court decided that this provision of the Constitution did not extend to inhabitants of the overseas territories of the United States. Such people became citizens only when Congress granted them the privilege by legislation (see p. 483). « j i l . Article IV, Section 2, clause 3. During the early nineteenth century, fixed labor conb-acts of apprentices and indentured servants were abandoned. In 1865 slavery was abolished. This clause thus became a dead letter.

It also says that the federal government shall aid states in preserving rights of self-government, in re- peUing invasion, and in keeping order. In the twentieth century the area of inter- state cooperation has been widened. Since state lines often cut across natural geographical re- gions, a single state may be incompetent to deal with important problems. With the ap- proval of Congress, states may make compacts for cooperative action. New Jersey and New York jointly estabUshed the Port of New York Authority and turned over to it control of ship- ping and docking in the Hudson River. Before it was worthwhile to build the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River, seven states had to make an agreement about the control and use of its water. Cooperation between the federal and state governments also extends far beyond what is specified in the Constitution. In certain fields, such as conservation and control of aviation, federal and state governments have arranged similar laws and joint enforcement. It is a fed- eral oflFense to carry across a state line game killed in xaolation of local law. The federal government also provides financial aid for state activities such as road building, public health, control of insect pests, and education. THE AMENDING PROCESS If amendments to the Articles of Confedera- tion had not required unanimous consent of the states, the Confederation might have lasted much longer than it did. Twice during that period, a single state blocked a proposal to give Congress the power it most needed— the right to levy taxes. The authors of the Consti- tution made the amending process easier by arranging (1) that amendments be proposed either by a two-thirds vote of Congress or ( Continued on page 137. ) EXPLANATORY NOTES Article V. One of the two methods for proposing amendments— through a convention called on request of two-thirds of the states— has never been used. In the 1960's there was a movement, however, to call for such a convention with a view to overriding a Supreme Court decision that electoral districts for elections to state legislatures must be approxi- mately equal in population. Only one amendment, the twenty-first, has been ratified by state conventions. Article VI, clause 2. The \"supremacy clause\" is one of the most important in the entire Constitution. It was principally on the basis of this clause that Chief Justice John Marshall wrote his classic statement of loose construction in Marbury v. Madison (see p. 196). The Judiciary Act of 1789 and the Fourteenth Amendment reinforced this supremacy of federal law over state law. Article VI, clause 3. Notice that state as well as federal ofiBcials must solemnly agree to support the Constitution. This makes local officers, from policemen to governors, federal officials as well. Also, the Constitution put many duties on the states, such as arranging elections to federal office. The fact that the Constitution forbids a religious test as a qualification for office reveals that its authors thought that church and state should not mix. How or whether a man wor- ships God should be, they felt, a private affair. This principle of \"separation of church and state\" is also found in the First Amendment, which forbids Congress to set up a state church or to interfere with religious freedom."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"ARTICLE VII.

Ratification might be either by state legislatures or by state conven- tions called for the purpose. Although these provisions made altering the Constitution easier than changing the Articles, the process of amendment was still so difficult and slow that the original Constitution has undergone few alterations. How is it possible that a Constitution de- vised in the eighteenth century to meet the needs of a sparsely settled, isolated, agricultural country is still used by a great industrial nation with world-wide interests? As has already been suggested, the Constitution has been greatly altered by interpretation and by usage. It has changed its meaning from generation to genera- tion. New demands on government have tended to widen its sphere and to alter its methods. The Supreme Court, by its power of judicial review, generally controls how far and how fast this change in meaning may go. Ulti- mately, though, the power of modifying the Constitution rests with the people and the of- ficials whom they elect. RATIFICATION OF THE CONSTITUTION The authors of the Constitution arranged that it should go into effect when ratified by special conventions in nine states. This carried out the idea expressed in the Declaration of Independence that governments \"derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.\" As has already been pointed out, all the people did not have an opportunity to say whether or not they would accept the Constitution be- cause in the 1780's voting rights were limited to men of property. At the time it was ratified, however, the new federal Union came nearer to expressing the will of the people than did the governments of any other country in the world. As Jefferson said at the time, the United States had given an example to the world in altering its government \"by assembling the ( Continued on page 139. ) EXPLANATORY NOTES Article VII. \"The Unanimous Consent of the States present\" does not mean \"the unanimous consent of delegates from aU the states,\" because Rhode Island was not repre- sented. Nor does this mean that all the delegates sent to the Convention approved of the Constitution. A few men were so much opposed to what was going on in Philadelphia that they went home. The Signers. The signers were young men for the most part; only eleven had passed their fiftieth birthday. Of the 55 delegates who attended the Constitutional Convention, 42 remained to the end. Three of these were opposed, however, and George Mason of Virginia said that he would sooner chop off his right hand than sign the Constitution. But more common was the attitude of Benjamin Franklin, who said that he did not approve of every feature of the document, but was still astonished to find it as good as it was. Thirty- nine signed it. (Six delegates-Benjamin Franklin, Robert Morris, Roger Sherman, George Read, George Clymer, and James Wilson-signed both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.) Historians who have studied the work of the Founding Fathers generally agree with the judgment of Charles and Mary Beard, who wrote, \"Among the many historic assemblies which have wrought revolutions in the affairs of mankind, it seems safe to say that there never has been one that commanded more political talent, practical experience, and sound substance than the Philadelphia Convention of 1787.\""},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"AMENDMENT I.

Opponents of the Constitution therefore claimed that the Foxmding Fathers had been guilty of exceeding their powers by providing for ratification by only nine out of thirteen states. In fact, however, the Constitu- tion was not an amendment to the Articles of Confederation, but an entirely new frame of government. For many years it was not clear whether once a state had joined the Union it had the right to withdraw. The Constitution itself is silent on the point. The question was put to the ultimate test when in 1861 eleven southern states attempted to form a separate union of their own, the Confederate States of America. Northern victory in the war that followed de- cided that problem: once having joined the Union, a state may not leave it. (See Chapter 14.) THE BILL OF RIGHTS One of the principal objections to the Con- stitution when it was presented for ratification in 1787 was that it contained no section spell- ing out the rights and liberties of American citizens. Several states were persuaded to ratify only on the assurance that such a statement would be added immediately. The first ten amendments, ratified in 1791, are known as the Bill of Rights. They were designed to make sure that the new federal government would not abuse its great powers by oppressing the people or the states. They underline the basic principle of the Declaration of Independence: that the purpose of government is to protect individual rights. The rights of the individual stated here are not unlimited. In general, a citizen's rights end where his abuse of them hurts other individuals or threatens public safety. Freedom of speech does not include the right to utter slander (de- faming a person by word of mouth ) or to pub- { Continued on page 141.) EXPLANATORY NOTES r^. Amendment 11. This provision is designed solely to guarantee to states the right to maintain a militia. It in no way restricts the right of the federal, state, or municipal govern- ments to regulate private ownership and use of weapons. Amendments EU and FV. These are based on an ancient principle of English law: \"a man's house is his casde.\" They also reflect grievances against the British government before the Revolution. The British had quartered redcoats in private houses and had used \"writs of assistance\" ( general search warrants ) to seek out smuggled goods. Amendments IV-VIII. These amendments carefully protect the rights of the person most at the mercy of society: the man accused of crime. They reflect two principles of Anglo- Saxon justice: that a man is assumed to be innocent until proved guilty, and that it is better to let the guilty go free than to punish the innocent. To bring \"a presentment or indictment\" means to bring formal charges against a per- son. It is the function of a \"Grand Jury\" to see whether there appears to be enough evidence against a man to warrant his being brought to trial. \"The land and naval forces\" and \"Militia\" are, while in actual service, subject to \"military law,\" breaches of which may be tried in a \"court martial.\" In times of emergency, such as invasion or natural disasters, civilians may temporarily be controlled by the armed forces imder martial law."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"/• I nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in ^ jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be K ^ a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, with- :^N^ out due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

Free- dom of assembly does not include the right to organize a lynching mob, nor does freedom of religion give the right to practices, such as polygamy, which offend the public sense of morality. Most of the rights and privileges stated in the Bill of Rights are drawn from the \"liberties of Englishmen\" won in Great Britain during the long struggle between king and Parliament which came to a head in the seventeenth cen- tury. It was to these rights Americans had ap- pealed in the struggle with the British Parlia- ment which finally resulted in the Revolutionary War. The exact meaning of the provisions of the Bill of Rights is partly determined by Congress. At various times Congress has, for instance, passed laws which define sedition (conspiring against the government). In general, however, the definition of the rights and liberties of citizens is the function of the federal judiciary. Since during each passing year new condi tions are constantly arising, the courts are con- stantly engaged in bringing the Bill of Rights up to date. Some of the questions which the courts have had to answer in applying ancient rights to modem situations are: Have federal oflBcials the right to tap telephones of suspected criminals? Have the members of a religious sect the right to insist that their children not be required to salute the American flag in school? May a gangster refuse to give testimony to a committee of Congress on the ground that if he did so he would tend to incriminate him- self? In time of crisis, such as the Civil War, the First and Second World Wars, and the \"Cold ( Continued on page 143. ) EXPLANATORY NOTES ::^^ Amendment V. The phrase \"nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\" means that an accused person may refuse to answer questions on the ground that his answers might tend to incriminate him. This does not weaken his right to be assumed innocent until proved guilty. The right to refuse to testify on grounds of self-incrimination extends to witnesses ap- pearing before congressional committees. \"Nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\" This refers to the \"right of eminent domain\" which allows governments to take land or other property for public use if they pay a fair price. There are many cases where the \"general welfare\" outweighs an individual's right to possess property— as when a government needs to build a road, erect a fort, or lay out a park. Governments may employ the right of eminent domain to assist a private corporation in building a public utility such as a rail- road or an electric power plant. Amendment VI. \"An impartial jury\" here refers to a petit (pronounced \"petty\") or trial jury which in the federal courts and in most state courts must reach a unanimous verdict before a person charged with crime is held guilty. In some state courts a less-than- unanimous verdict is allowed in certain types of cases. Amendment IX. In other words, the people retain rights, even if these rights are not specifically described in the Constitution. Amendment X. While most of the Bill of Rights deals with the rights of the individual, the Tenth Amendment is specifically directed toward protecting the states from over- extension of federal power. It may be regarded as an effort to reduce the \"elasticity\" of Article I, Section 8, clause 18 (see pp. 118 and 120)."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"AMENDMENT XI.

Such times produce an intense feeling of patriotism and along with it an intolerance for any who are even suspected of disloyalty. There is a tempta- tion to deny to suspects the protection of the individual which is found in the Bill of Rights. (Continued on page 145.) EXPLANATORY NOTES Amendment XI. This amendment, like those preceding it, reflects distrust of federal power. No sooner had the Constitution gone into effect than private individuals began to sue state governments in federal courts. In the case of Chisholm v. Georgia in 1793, the Supreme Court upheld a decision in which the state of Georgia was ordered to pay damages to the heirs of a Britisher whose property had been confiscated during the Revolution. This decision caused such a howl of protest that Congress proposed, and the states ratified, the Eleventh Amendment. The Eleventh Amendment does not prevent a state from being sued before the Supreme Court by another state or by a foreign country. If State A, for instance, dumps garbage into a river running into State B, State B may bring charges before the Supreme Court to end the nuisance. Amendment XII. According to the original Constitution (Article II, Section 3) there was a single ballot in the electoral college for President and Vice-President. This caused serious difficulty in the election of 1800, when Jefferson and Burr were tied (for details, see p. 186). To prevent confusion, the Twelfth Amendment specifies separate ballots. The House of Representatives, voting by states, makes the choice for President in case of no majority in the electoral college, and the Senate chooses the Vice-President. The authors of the Constitution intended that the electors should make up their own minds. Ever since the first party election in 1796, however, electors have been pledged to the support of party candidates. Thus they have become simply \"rubber stamps\" registering the popular will. May a presidential elector still use his individual judgment or does a centiuy and a half of custom outweigh the intentions of the Founding Fathers? The evidence on this point is confused. In 1952 the Supreme Court held that a political party might legally require a binding pledge that an elector vote for the party nominee. Yet in 1956 an Alabama elector pledged to Adlai Stevenson voted for a local judge never before men- tioned for the presidency, and the action was accepted by Congress. In 1960 a Republican elector from Oklahoma voted for Senator Harr>^ Byrd of Virginia. The Twelfth Amendment tries to insure that the President and Vice-President come from different states. In practice, they have usually come not only from different states but from different sections of the country. For many years, as an example, it was the practice of the Republicans to nominate their presidential candidates from the Middle West and to \"balance the ticket\" by nominating Easterners for the vice-presidency. The electoral college system does not provide for an accurate determination of the popular will. The small states are over-represented. When there are more than two candi- dates, a man may poll a minority of the popular vote and yet win a majority of the electoral college, as happened when Lincohi was elected in 1860 and Wilson was elected in 1912. In 1888, when there were only two major candidates, Harrison with a minority of the popular vote won over Cleveland, who had a larger proportion of the popular vote than in 1884 when he had been elected to the presidency."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"AMENDMENT XIII.

Such periods of excitement reveal the advan- tage of putting judges beyond direct popular control by allowing them to hold office \"during good Behavior\" (Article III, Section 1). Less swayed than most citizens by the emotions of the moment, the federal judiciary preserves the liberties the Constitution guarantees to the sus- pect and the fanatic as much as to the man whose loyalty is unquestioned and whose opin- ions are those of the majority. THE NATIONAL SUPREMACY AMENDMENTS During the Reconstruction period that fol- lowed the Civil War ( see Chapter 14, pp. 365- 376), three amendments were added to the Constitution. All of them attempted to define the position of the Negroes of the South. The Thirteenth Amendment declared all slaves free; the Fourteenth Amendment granted them citi- zenship; and the Fifteenth Amendment was intended to give them the vote. The Civil War resulted not only in the free- ing of the slaves, but decided once and for all the supremacy of the nation over the states. Until the war, supporters of \"states' rights\" in- sisted that the federal government was simply an agent of the states, that states might nullify (ignore) federal laws they considered uncon- stitutional, and that states might secede from the Union. The victory of the North marked the defeat for such ideas. Furthermore, these \"National Supremacy Amendments\" limited state action and deprived states of powers they formerly claimed. Of these amendments, the most important is the Fourteenth. Through its first clause, which says that a state may not \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law,\" the federal courts have gained a general power to oversee state legislation. Thus a New York law that fixed a 10-hour day for employees of bakeries was declared uncon- stitutional; the Supreme Court said that it de- prived workers of their \"liberty\" to make their own contracts with employers as to how long they might work {Lochner v. New York, 1905). A Minnesota law that set up a commission to fix railroad rates was declared unconstitutional on the ground that it deprived railroad cor- porations (which are \"persons\" under the law) of property by lowering rates. Since the late 1930's, the federal judiciary has reversed itself, however, and no longer opposes state regula- tory legislation which it formerly found uncon- stitutional. Recently its major emphasis in in- terpreting the Fourteenth Amendment has been in the direction of protecting individuals from unfair trial by state courts and from violations ( Continued on page 147. ) EXPLANATORY NOTES Amendment XIII.

In Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the Supreme Court declared that to segregate school children by race was a denial of \"the equal protection of the laws.\" More recent cases under the Fourteenth Amendment have protected Negro rights to equality and peace- ful protest against grievances. THE PROGRESSIVE AMENDMENTS Following passage of the three National Su- premacy Amendments of 1865-1870, it was forty years before others were added to the Constitu- tion. Then there occurred a period, 1913-1920, when four amendments were ratified within a space of seven years. These tnay be called the \"Progressive Amendments\" because they reflect the reforming spirit of the progressive move- ment of the early twentieth century ( see Chap- ter 21). The Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Eighteenth, and Nineteenth Amendments are characteristic of their period. It was a time when there was re- sentment against men of great wealth, and the Sixteenth (income tax) Amendment gave the federal government power to make them pay a larger share of taxes. It was a time when there was increasing behef that government should actively intervene to make people's lives better. By the Eighteenth (prohibition) Amendment the federal government was given power to interfere with the personal habits of American citizens. It was a time when there was widespread belief that \"the cure for the evils of democracy is more democracy.\" The Seventeenth Amendment made the federal {Continued on page 149.) EXPLANATORY NOTES Amendment XV. From the end of the period of Radical Reconstruction (see pp. 367-373) until recently, the Fifteenth Amendment, purporting to guarantee Negroes the right to vote, was widely evaded throughout the former slave states. Starting in 1957, however, Congress passed successively stronger laws designed to end racial discrimination in voting rights. Amendment XVI. The demand for this amendment went back to 1895 when the Su- preme Court declared that a federal income tax was unconstitutional. Such a tax, said a majority of the Court, violated Article I, Section 9, clause 4, which states that the federal government may levy no direct tax unless in proportion to population. The only lawful way to overrule a Supreme Court decision on the Constitution is to pass an amendment. Amendment XVII. In clause 1 of this amendment, as in Article I, Section 2, clause 1, of the original Constitution, \"electors\" means simply \"voters.\" The Seventeenth Amendment had been urged for many years before it was finally passed. It was designed not only to make the choice of senators more democratic, but also to reduce corruption and to improve state government. When choosing senators, state legislatures had been too often influenced by bribery or by political bosses. The task of electing senators was an extra burden on the states; the proper business of a legislature is to pass laws for the good of the state, not to choose federal officials. In the latter part of Section 2, it is provided that states may empower their governors to appoint men to fill unexpired terms of senators when vacancies occur. But in the House of Representatives vacancies can only be filled by new elections (Article I, Section 2, clause 4). This difference results from the theory that the senators represented the separate states, as did the Confederation Congress, while the members of the House represented the people as a whole, the nation."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"AMENDMENT XVIII.

The Nineteenth Amendment gave women the right to vote. World War I helped to promote the pas- sages of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Amendments. The enactment of nation-wide prohibition was aided by the fact that the American people were in a self-denying mood as a result of war sacrifices. Women's contribu- tions to the war effort caused many who had opposed woman suffrage to change their minds and hastened the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. The opponents of the amendment had included President Wilson, but he, too, now joined its supporters. EXPLANATORY NOTES Amendment XVIII. This amendment was repealed by the passage of the Twenty-first Amendment in 1933. In providing for the enforcement of this amendment, Congress in 1919 passed the Volstead Act, which defined intoxicating beverages as those having an alcoholic content of more than one half of one per cent. One reason why this amendment was widely violated was that some states, especially those with a large urban population, made little effort to aid the federal authorities in enforcing prohibition. Amendments XVIII and XIX. These amendments marked the triumph of reform move- ments which had been demanding prohibition and woman suffrage for many years. The temperance movement, which started in the 1820's and 1830's, had won its first great triumph in 1851 when Maine passed a state prohibition law (see p. 289). The women's rights movement, dating from the same time, first gained full voting rights for women in four western states before 1900 (see pp. 282, 532). Amendment XX. This amendment had two major purposes: (1) to abolish the \"lame duck\" session of Congress, and (2) to shorten the time between a President's election and his inauguration. Lame duck sessions took place every other December, after the November congressional elections. The Congress which met in December of an election year was not the newly elected Congress but that which had been elected over two years before. It therefore contained many 'lame ducks\"— congressmen who had failed to be reelected. In order to make Congress more responsive to the will of the people, the Twentieth Amend- ment abolished the lame duck session and provided that Congress hold its first session soon after election. When the Constitution first went into effect, means of transportation and communication were slow and uncertain. It was necessary to arrange for quite a long period, November to March, between the President's election and his inauguration. With the development of rapid travel and instant communication, however, such a prolonged gap between election and taking office was unnecessary. In a time of crisis it was also dangerous. Between Lincoln's election in November 1860, and his inauguration in March 1861, seven southern states left the Union and nothing was done to prevent it. Buchanan, the outgoing President, was unable to act because he had lost the confidence of the people. Lincoln, the President- elect, could take no action because he was not yet in office. Between the election of Franklin Roosevelt in November 1932, and his inauguration in March 1933, there was a similar crisis. The country was in the grip of the Great Depression, yet President Hoover could do nothing; although still in office, he had been repudiated by the electorate. Roosevelt could not act until in office. Clauses 3 and 4 of the Twentieth Amendment provide for various situations where choice of a President or of his successor might be difficult."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"4.

They neglected, for instance, to grant Congress the power to acquire new territory. This caused embarrassment at the time of the Louisiana Purchase (see pp. 199-200). Another omission that later caused difficulty was that although the Senate was given power to ratify the Presi- dent's appointments to office, nothing was said about whether senatorial approval was neces- sary when the President wanted to remove a man from office. Beginning with Washington, Presidents insisted that they had the sole power of removal. For many years the senators grumbled at this without taking action. In 1867, however, Congress passed a Tenure-of-Office Act that forbade removals without senatorial approval. When President Andrew Johnson defied the law, he was impeached and came within one vote of being expelled from office (see p. 371). The Tenure-of-Office Act was re- pealed in 1887, antl now it is agreed that Presi- dents need not consult the Senate before firing a subordinate official. But a century of dispute would have been averted if the Constitution had been clear in the first place. The Twentieth Amendment attempts to tie up some loose ends by providing for various situations in which the choice of a President or his successor may be difficult. Even so, it can- not provide for every possible future contin- gency. To fit an eighteenth-century constitution to twentieth-century needs means constant new adaptations and new interpretation— see the dis- cussion of the \"imwritten constitution\" on page 153. EXPLANATORY NOTES Amendment XXI, clause 3. The Twenty-first Amendment was the only one ever sub- mitted to special ratifying conventions; all others have been ratified by state legislatures. The convention method is considered to be more democratic because the voters express their opinion of a proposed amendment in choosing the convention members. Amendment XXU. This amendment wrote into the Constitution a custom started by Washington, Jefferson, and Madison whereby Presidents limited themselves to two terms in office. Although both Ulysses S. Grant and Theodore Roosevelt sought third terms, the precedent was not broken until Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to a third term in 1940 and a fourth in 1944. The passage of the Twenty-second Amendment was therefore in effect a posthumous rebuke to F.D.R. It has received criticism by authorities on American politics to the effect that it is unwise for the United States to deny itself in advance the continued services of some future President of great ability after only eight years of service, when some congressmen and Supreme Court justices sometimes hold office usefully for several decades. On the other hand it serves notice that no President is to be considered indispensable."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State; they shall be in addition to those appointed by the States, but they shall be considered, for the purposes of the election of President and Vice President, to be electors appointed by a State; and they shall meet in the District and perform such duties as pro\\'ided by the twelfth article of amendment. 2.

Most state constitutions are much longer, that of Louisiana running to 200,000 words. By its very brevity the Constitution left a great deal to be filled in later, either by legislation or by custom. This legislation and custom may be called the \"Unwritten Constitution.\" The Un- written Constitution includes the power of the Supreme Court to decide on the constitutional- ity of state and federal laws, and the practice whereby the President calls the heads of execu- tive departments together to form an advisory body known as the cabinet. Institutions never dreamed of by the Founding Fathers have been added to the governmental system. Among these are the commissions which regulate much of the nation's economic life, such as the Inter- state Commerce Commission and the National Labor Relations Board. Others include the two-party system and such institutions as pri- mary elections and national conventions. The Twenty-second .\\mendment, forbid- ding the President to serve more than two terms, is an example of a part of what was formerly part of the Unwritten Constitution be- ing written into the document itself (see Ex- planatory Notes on p. 151). A most important element in the Unwritten Constitution is the loyalty of Americans to the system established by the Founding Fathers. For its successful operation it demands self- discipline, patience, and tolerance. In ofiice, a majority must be willing to try to achieve its ends without violating the rights of the minor- ity. Out of office a minority must be willing to wait until it is able to gain its ends by peace- ful victory at the polls. The very success of the Constitution has, of course, helped to make citizens willing to prac- tice the discipline and self-restraint necessary to make it work. EXPLANATORY NOTES Amendment XXIII. This grant of the vote in presidential elections goes only a short way to meet the charge that the people of the District of Columbia are second-class citizens. At one time die city of Washington had an elective mayor, but since 1874 the District has been under the direct control of Congress and elected none of its officials. In 1965 Congress rejected a proposal to give the District local self-government. In 1967 President Johnson gave day-to-day control of the city to a nine-man commission of appointed residents, and gave one of them— Walter E. Washington, a Negro— the title, \"Mayor.\" But die city's taxes and budget were still under the control of Congress, and no officials are as yet elective, except the Board of Education. Amendment XXTV. The poll tax as a condition of being registered as a voter was a way that states kept poor people, especially Negroes, from the polls. Usually the poll tax was cumulative— that is, in order to get his name on the voting list a citizen had to pay all back taxes for the years since he came of voting age. Passage of Amendment XXIV was the climax of years of agitation to abolish this barrier to equal political rights. Amendment XXV.

GEORGE WASHINGTON, 1789 The Confederation had come to an end, lea\\ing behind it 70 unpaid clerks, an \"army\" of 672 men, and millions of dollars of debts. Before it disbanded, the Confederation Congress had arranged for elections under the new Con- stitution in November 1788, and for starting the new government on March 4, 1789. When March arrived, however, only a third of the senators and less than a quarter of the repre- sentatives had reached New York, the temporary capital. This delay \\\\as partly the result of bad roads and bad weather, but it was a discour- aging way to have things start. \"The people will forget the new government before it is bom,\" lamented a senator from Massachusetts. It was not until April that the houses of Con- gress had enough members to do business. Their first action was to send word to George Washington at Mount Vernon that the electoral college had unanimously chosen him to be the first President. THE FIRST PRESIDENT Washington accepted the presidency un- willingly. On the day he set oflF for his inaugu- ration, he confided to his diary: About ten o'clock I bade adieu to Mt. Vernon, to private life, and to domestic felicity, Eind with a mind oppressed with more anxious and painful sen- sations than I care to express, set out for New York. Washington's practical training had been in agriculture and military service. Because of lack of experience in government and limited knowl- edge of political science and history, he felt himself unfitted to be chief magistrate. Although Washington doubted his own ca- pacities, his countrymen regarded him with admiration bordering on awe. No sooner had he won his first xictories at Trenton and Prince- ton than a Philadelphia newspaper wrote of him: \"If there are any spots in his character they are like the spots on the sun, only discern- ible through a telescope. Had he lived in the days of idolatr)' he would have been worshipped as a god.\" This hero worship continued, and it had its uses for the new government. As a visible symbol of the unity and power of the new government, ^^'ashington provided a focus for loyalty to the nation. It is not far-fetched to say that he filled a psychological void that had been left when the concept of George III was suddenly altered from that of the beloved father of his people to that of a detested t>'rant. 1^"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Museum of the City of New York In addition to tfie tumultuous salute in New York harbor (see page 158), Washington received a tremen- dous ovation at his inauguration. When he l<issed the Bible after taking the oath of office, bells were rung, cannon boomed, and a great crowd shouted enthusiastic approval of their first President. The building on Wall Street where Washington was inaugurated still stands today. As President, he was far more than a sym- bolic figurehead. He knew the United States as well as any man alive, having traveled in every state except Georgia and having met or exchanged letters with most of the prominent men of the country. From the time he took over the army in 1775, he had worked, as he said, to \"discourage all local attachments\" and to substitute \"the greater name of American.\" Washington's mind moved with deliberation; he studied public questions with great care and reached decisions only after consulting men with differing points of view. After making a decision, he often turned over the job of ex- pressing his ideas to men with abler pens than his own, such as Madison or Hamilton. But no one dictated his conclusions, and one of his greatest personal qualities was good judgment, both of men and of courses of action. Although Washington's reputation is that of a man of action, and he was surely not a political philosopher, he was devoted to the principles of the American Revolution. In the course of the Revolution, for instance, he had changed his opinion of slavery. Whereas in his early life he had accepted the institution un- thinkingly, he now beheved that it was a terrible evil. He saw its continuance as leading to national disaster. \"Not only,\" he wrote a British friend, \"do I pray for it [the abohtion of slav- ery] on the score of human dignity, but I can clearly foresee that nothing but the rooting out of slavery can perpetuate the existence of our union, by consolidating it in a common bond 157"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"158 Launching the Republic of principle.\" In his will, Washington freed all the Negroes he owned and provided that they should be educated at the expense of his estate. As the excerpt from his inaugural address at the head of this chapter reveals, Washington was one of those who thought that the American experiment in trying to found a government based on popular will was of vital importance for the whole world. At almost every town and village on the way to New York, where he was to be inaugu- rated, Washington was met by cheering crowds, troops of cavalry, and addresses of welcome. When he reached the capital on April 22, he was rowed across the Hudson River on a barge built especially for the occasion, manned by thirteen harbor pilots in white uniforms. Prac- tically the whole population of New York lined the wharves and cheered as he neared the shore. On April 30, 1789, he took the oath of office and gave the first inaugural address, an event celebrated by the ringing of church bells and the firing of cannon. The public rejoicing over Washington's taking office was fully justi- fied. He was perhaps the only indispensable man in the history of the United States. Administration and Finances Even with Washington in office and Con- gress in session, the Constitution was still only a book of directions, and it was months before the government was really functioning. Laws had to be passed to establish the administrative departments such as the treasury and the post office. One of the most important actions taken by Congress was to pass the Judiciary Act of 1789, which filled a gap in the Constitution (see p. 129). Once offices had been established, hundreds of men had to be found who were willing to give up their regular employment to serve as judges, tax collectors, and postmasters. In staflF- ing the new federal government, Washington's wide acquaintance and the respect he com- manded were invaluable, since he was able to find competent men to serve the new govern- ment. Once the executive departments were set up, Washington proved himself to be a first-rate administrator. He kept in touch with his subor- dinates and insisted on being consulted in all important matters, but he knew how to delegate authority and did not interfere in matters of detail. When seeking counsel on important mat- ters, he asked the heads of departments to meet with him. Thus, the cabinet was created as it remains to this day: an advisory body with only such influence as the President gives it. The creation of the cabinet %\\'as only one of several ways in \\\\'hich Washington set prec- edents in areas where the Constitution was silent or not clear. Thus he insisted that the Senate's power to accept or reject appointments did not extend to removal from office. Partly because the Senate refused to cooperate \\\\'ith him, he took the active direction of foreign affairs entirely into his own hands, leaving it to the Senate to ratify ( or reject ) treaties after they were made. In regard to legislation, Wash- ington was much more than a mere executive. Both directly through messages to Congress, and indirectly through reports prepared by his Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, he took the initiative in urging that Congress pass laws that he thought to be in the pubbc interest. Congress almost invariably followed his lead. So the President became what the pohtical scientist Clinton Rossiter calls him today: \"the chief legislator.\" The Tariff of 1789 Finances were the most important problem facing the country. The new government had to be able to pay its way if it were to sur\\'i\\'e. Even before Washington took office, Congress had discussed taxation. All members of both houses agreed that as soon as possible the fed- eral government should begin to collect taxes on imports."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Washington Administration 159 A tariflF law was not passed until July 1789. This delay was caused because certain interests wanted to make tariff duties high enough to protect them from foreign competition.

Thus, Penns>'l\\'ania iron manufacturers had a hard time competing with Britain. But the rest of the country preferred buying cheap British iron to paying more for Pennsylvania iron. Similarly, the South wanted a high tariff on hemp, which was used in making rope, but New England was opposed because it would cost more to rig ships. New England, in turn, wanted a high tariff to protect its rum distilleries, while the South wanted to import rum direct from Jamaica. The settlement of these intersectional differ- ences in Congress was managed by what has since been called 'logrolling.\" Logrolling means \"I will vote for what you want, if you \\\\ill \\'ote for vi'hat I want,\" or sometimes \"I will abandon my demands, if you will give up yours.\" In mak- ing the first tariff law, the second t>'pe of log- rolling was followed. On the whole, the duties were set low, averaging about 8 per cent of the value of the goods. The primary puq^ose of the tariff was to bring in rcAenue. The greater part of the money raised by federal taxation was needed to pay off the $54,000,000 owed by the United States. This debt was of t^vo kinds: (1) about $12,000,000 owed to France and the Netherlands for loans made during and after the Re\\olutionary War and (2) about $42,000,000 in domestic bonds, also a result of the war. The Continental Con- gress, unable to ta.x, had borrowed from in- dividual Americans. Also, when unable to pay off veterans and army contractors in cash. Con- gress had given them promises to pay in the future. In addition to the money the United States owed, there were state debts, estimated at $25,000,000. Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of the Treasury In the debate over federal finances, the dominating figure was Alexander Hamilton, the relatively young man whom Washington had chosen as Secretary- of the Treasur\\-. Bom in the West Indies in 1757, Hamilton had shown ex- traordinary ability from boyhood. At the age of thirteen, he had been left in sole charge of a merchant's business. At fifteen he wrote an account of a hurricane which was considered so remarkable that a group of men raised enough money to send him to New York for further education. Hamilton entered King's College (later Columbia) in 1774, but left college to fight in the Revolutionary War. Be- fore reaching the age of nineteen he was a captain, and before twenty-one he was a mem- ber of Washington's staff with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He later became a successful lauyer and married into the Hudson River aris- tocracy. During the Confederation period, Hamilton favored the interests of the wealthy merchants and large landowners over those of the small farmers and laborers. Believing in a strong cen- tral government, he wTOte many of the Federal- ist papers in support of the Constitution and was the strongest leader of the pro-ratification forces in New York. He was, however, by no means pleased with the Constitution and called it \"a irail and worthless fabric\" because it allowed too much power to the states and to the people. Asked by Congress to recommend action on federal finances, Hamilton produced tvvo \"Re- ports on Public Credit\" and a \"Report on Man- ufactures.\" Not only did these become the basis for a series of laws passed in 1790 and 1791, but they had a continuing influence both in this country- and abroad. Hamilton was a brilliant financier and a writer of great clarity and force."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"160 Launching the Republic Hamilton's Financial Program The essentials of Hamilton's program were: (1) There should be sufficient revenue to meet the running expense of the government, to pay interest on the debt, and gradually to reduce the principal of the debt itself. In addition to the tariff law already described, Hamilton pro- posed an excise tax on whiskey produced in the United States. In 1791 Congress passed a law establishing the whiskey tax. (2) The debt owed foreign nations should he paid off at once. As long, said Hamilton, as we owed money to any foreign nation, we were not truly independent. The debts of the United States to France and the Netherlands were en- tirely paid back by 1796. (3) The domestic debt should be funded at par. By this Hamilton meant that new federal bonds should be issued to take the place of the old, and that the amount paid back should be the original face value plus interest. This was treating the bondholders generously, because the original bonds had seldom or never been worth their face value and sometimes had gone as low as 10 cents on the dollar. Hamilton ar- gued that in paying its debts at par, the United States would give notice to its citizens and to the world that its promises were good. Hamil- ton's ideas were followed out in-the-Ftmding BiU of 1790. (4) The federal government should take over the state debts. Hamilton argued that since the state debts had resulted from state eflForts to help the nation as a whole in the Revolution, they should be paid back by the national gov- ernment. This assumption of state debts would also reduce state taxes and thus make it easier for the federal government to tax. This was acqomplishedtoM^ Assumption Act of 1790. •^^5) Thejederal government should estab- lish a central bank. Hamilton proposed that there should be a federal bank on the model of the Bank of England. Such an institution would have many useful functions. Its central office FUNCTIONS OF THE BANK OF THE UNITED STATES Aided the Federal Government Collected taxes Depository for government funds Made short-term loons to it Agent in selling its bonds Served individual banking needs Accepted deposits Mode loans Transferred funds from place to place Promoted Interstate Commerce Transferred funds from city to city by drafts Provided a sound paper money Increased the money in circulation Regulated state banks Required their bank notes to be sufficiently backed by specie Prevented excessive lending beyond their resources i The Bank of the United States was really a private institution, since the government ovi^ned only one-fifth of its stock. It served as an agent of govern- ment and gave the country a sound currency. It also faced strong opposition from those who considered the B.U.S. an over- extension of federal power."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The Washington Administration —101 and branches would provide places where taxes could be paid and where the government could deposit its money. When the government needed money to tide it over a temporary deficit, it could borrow from the central bank for a short term. If it wished to borrow and pay back slowly (long-term borrowing), the bank could act as the selling agent for federal bonds. Furthermore— and this was most important— the central bank would promote interstate com- merce. It could move large sums of money for either tlie government or indi\\iduals. If a businessman or treasury official wanted to send funds, say, from Massachusetts to South Caro- lina, he would ask that money deposited in the Boston branch be paid in Charleston. The Boston branch then would issue a \"transfer draft\" asking the Charleston branch to deliver the amount to ainone named by the sender. Although the authors of the Constitution hoped to establish a \"hard\" currency, meaning one based on gold and silver, there was an in- sufficient amount of these precious metals in the country. To attempt to carry on commerce with only the specie (gold and silver coin) actually minted would be like playing a poker game with too few chips. To remedy this situation, Hamil- ton proposed that the new bank issue bank notes. These notes, which would come into cir- culation when the bank loaned money, were to be limited in amount, in order to prevent any- thing like the runaway inflation that occurred during the Revolutionary War. As an additional safeguard, they were to be \"backed\" by specie. The central bank might issue notes for a greater amount than its gold or silver on hand, but there was to be enough specie on deposit so that holders of banknotes could at any time exchange them for coin. The notes of the cen- tral bank, circulating freely throughout the country, would furnish a national currency, as good in New Hampshire as in Georgia. This would be in contrast to the situation a few years earlier when each state had its own money, as we saw on page 89. The notes of state banks were often used to pay ta.\\es. In receiving these state bank notes, the central bank would become the creditoi of other banks. Thus it could require that state- chartered banks pay their notes in specie and curtail their loans to individuals. The central bank was to be privately owned and managed, SO per cent of its stock being reserved for private individuals, the federal government taking the remaining 20 per cent. But the Secretary of tlie Treasury had the right to investigate the management of the central bank at any time, thus providing for public control. Congress followed Hamilton's recommenda- tions, and in 1791 established a central bank, the Bank of the United States, with a 20-year charter and a capital of $10,000,000. (6) The federal govcrnmei\\t should encour- age the development of home ij^diistries. In December 1791, Hamilton sent to the House of Representatives a \"Report on Manufactures.\" In it he argued that the federal government should encourage home industries. He maintained that increase in industry would make the country more wealthy, since capital applied to manufac- tures often yielded a higher return than cap- ital invested in agriculture. Industrial growth would also encourage the immigration of skilled labor. Factories would pul idle women and children to productive work. Furthermore, Hamilton argued that the United States would be neither truly independent nor safe in war until it ceased to depend on Europe for many essential goods. Hamilton proposed a variety of measures to promote manufacturing. Bounties should be paid to producers of certain products which the country gready needed, and premiums for goods of especially high qualit\\'.

All import duties should be re- moved, however, on much-needed raw mate- rials. Thus Hamilton proposed a tariff on gunpowder, but none at all on sulphur and salt- peter, two of its principal ingredients. Although the \"Report on Manufactures\" later became one of the most influential state papers in American history, its proposals comprised the one portion of Hamilton's program that did not go through at once. Most of the American people were farmers, and a high proportion of the rest were engaged in foreign trade and shipping. Farmers feared that protection would raise the price of goods they had to buy; ship- pers feared it would reduce the volume of for- eign trade. Congress refused to act on Hamil- ton's plans, and duties on imports remained low. Hamilton's program was an immediate suc- cess in restoring the credit of the United States. In 1788, United States bonds were selling at 15 to 20 per cent of face value. By 1792 they were selUng for 120 to 125 per cent, even in foreign cities such as London and Amsterdam. Eight million dollars' worth of shares in the 1 Bank of the United States were sold to private ' investors in two hours. There was another purpose in addition to sound finance behind Hamilton's policies. He beheved in government by the wealthy, and distrusted the people. All his measures were designed to attract men of property to the support of the federal government, because they then would be selfishly interested in its survival. Funding the domestic debt at par put millions of dollars into the pockets of specu- lators who had sent agents throughout the country buying the old bonds from people ig- norant of their value. The Assumption Act turned the attention of investors from the states to the federal government. The federal govern- ment received no interest on the money it de- posited in the Bank of the United States, even though the B.U.S. charged interest when it lent this money to borrowers. This was one of the reasons why the B.U.S. shareholders re- ceived high returns. These annual returns aver- aged over 8 per cent on their investment. Opposition to Hamilton It was no wonder that the Hamilton pro- gram met with bitter opposition. The Funding Bill was attacked as unfair to the original hold- ers— \"the warworn soldiers\" and their \"widows and orphans,\" to quote an anti-Hamilton news- paper. The Assumption Act was opposed not merely by those states which had paid off most of their debts, but by those who did not want to see all financial power centered in the federal government. ~^Vhen the bill to estabhsh the Bank of the United States was before Congress, James Mad- ison, then a representative from Virginia, at- tacked it on the ground that the federal gov- ernment had no right to establish a bank. Such a power is not found among the enumerated powers of Congress ( Article I, Section 8, clauses 1-17, pp. 118, 120). Nor, argued Madison, is it an \"implied power\" allowed by the \"elastic clause\" (Article I, Section 8, clause 18, p. 120). The elastic clause gives Congress such powers as are \"necessary and proper\" for putting its stated powers into effect. A central bank, said Madison, might be use- ful in collecting taxes, borrowing money, and regulating interstate commerce, but it was not necessary. The federal government must be denied a power which was neither stated nor implied in the Constitution.

Jefferson and Hamilton: A Comparison The opposition to Hamilton was led by Jef- ferson. The struggle between the two men has affected American politics ever since. Hamilton, a self-made man, distrusted the people and called democracy a \"poison.\" He thought that man is naturally selfish, unreasonable, and vio- lent. Jefferson, bom to wealth and social posi- tion, thought that if men are given the oppor- tunity, they are naturaUy decent and reasonable. Hamilton beheved in a highly centrahzed gov- ernment as a means of keeping order. While the people must be given some share in choosing their rulers, government should be as far re- moved from them as possible. This in Hamilton's opinion meant strengthening the federal govern- ment and reducing the powers of the states. It also meant a strong executive department, strong courts, and a standing army.

He was much opposed to standing armies be- cause he feared that a military leader might seize control of the government. Hamilton was considered a conservative; yet his policies looked forward to the time when the United States would become a great industrial nation. Jefferson was thought a radical, yet he wished to keep American society in much the same condition it was in his own day. The contrast between Hamilton and Jeffer- son can be overdone. Neither man was an ex- tremist. While Hamilton despised \"this thing of a republic,\" he worked loyally to make it a success. While Jefferson professed to fear the power of the federal government, he spent six- teen years of his life holding federal ofiice. While Hamilton believed in a government as much like that of Great Britain as possible, he thought that those who wanted to introduce a king and nobility into America were \"vision- ary.\" Jefferson believed in self-government, but he had been in France when the Paris mob looted, burned, and carried heads on pikes. He therefore favored putting political power in the hands of men with some education and prop- erty (especially in land). Finally, while Hamil- ton favored centralized power, he realized that state powers and state interests could not be ignored. And while Jefferson favored local gov- ernment, as ambassador to France he had come to reahze how much the United States had suffered because the government was despised by European nations. He therefore favored the new Constitution. Although one of the least military of men, he also favored the creation of an American navy as the best means of per- suading Europe to respect our shipping. While the two great antagonists carried on bitter and often unfair political warfare against each other, they played the game of pohtics within the rules that democratic government requires. They strove to win their battles by winning elections or by persuading congress- men to \"vote right\" rather than by resorting to violence. THE WEST The West presented the Washington ad- ministration several difficult problems left over from the Confederation period. It was fortunate that the President had an extensive and sym- pathetic knowledge of the people of the region and their difficulties. The most immediate cause for alarm .was the Indian menace, to which Washington devoted most of his first message to Congress in 1789. Made bold by the weak- ness of the Confederation government and armed and egged on by the British and Span- ish, the Indians were raiding the entire fron- tier, killing thousands of men, women, and children. Once the new federal government had money to raise armies, Washington sent a force- to defend the new settlements north of the Ohio River. In 1790 an expedition destroyed a few Indian villages, but suffered heavy losses. The next year General Arthur St. Clair ad- vanced into Indian country with the largest military force the trans-Appalachian West had ever seen— 2,300 regular troops, plus several companies of militia.

Two other treaties in the same year, the Jay Treaty with England and the Pinckney Treaty with Spain, also helped to reduce the Indian danger. By the former, England gave up the fur posts inside the United States boun- daries and retreated beyond the Great Lakes. By the latter, Spain accepted the United States claim to the boundary of West Florida and agreed to stop giving military aid to Indians within the United States. (See map, p. 175.) The Whiskey RelieHi«n, 1794 Washington was aware that the western settlers had been discontented in the 1780's, and he feared that they might attempt to secede. An uprising did in fact take place at the time that Wayne was defeating the Indians. Known as the Whiskey Rebellion, this was a violent protest against Hamilton's excise tax. In a day before canals and railroads. Westerners could not sell their grain in the East because the cost of transportation by wagon was prohibitive. Western grain was therefore distilled into whis- key which, with its small bulk and high value, could pay the cost of transportation. Whiskey was even used as currency in the West, where there were few gold and silver coins or bank notes. In these circumstances. Westerners thought that the excise tax on whiskey, first levied in 1791, was aimed directly at them. There may have been some truth in this idea. Hamilton had welcomed the excise tax as a means of getting the interior of the country used to rec- ognizing the authority of the new federal gov- ernment. Feeling against the excise tax was espe- cially strong in \\\\'estem Pennsylvania, where the citizens refused to pay the tax, attacked revenue officers, and burned the bams of neigh- b»rs wh« inftrmed where stills were located. Th*y even raised a military force and defied the federal government. The Whiskey Rebellion was as plain a challenge to law and order as Shays's Rebellion eight years before. The out- come, however, was very different. Massachu- setts had suppressed the Shaysites entirely by her own effort, without help from the near- bankrupt Confederation government. When the Governor of Pennsylvania hesitated to take ac- tion against the Whiskey Rebellion, the federal government stepped in and crushed it with ease. Washington called out over 12,000 militia from four states, a force so overwhelming that when it reached western Pennsylvania the 'Whiskey boys\" had dispersed. Some of their leaders were taken to Philadelphia for trial and tw'O were found guilty of treason. Washington pardoned both of them. The new government, he felt, had shown itself so strong that it could afford to be merciful. Settlement of the West Even before the new government was or- ganized, a great migration to the West had begun. In the spring of 1788 it was reported that 308 boats carrying 6,320 people, 2,824 horses, 515 cattle, 600 sheep, and 150 wagons had passed a single point on the Ohio River. Once the Indians had been pacified, the blue- grass meadows of Kentucky and the rich bottom lands along the rivers of Tennessee drew over 300,000 settlers into the region south of the Ohio between 1790 and 1800. With this great increase in population, Kentucky and Tennessee demanded admission to the Unien. The North- west Ordinance, which had been re-enacted by the new federal government, legally applied only to territory north of the Ohio River, but it had established the principle that new states should be admitted on terms of equality with the old. Accordingly, Kentucky became a state in 1792 and Tennessee in 1796. Meanwhile, Vermont had won her claim to independence from New Hampshire and New York, and had been taken into the Union in 1791."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"'.'Ji-^4''Ma.w.'.rA»nKrmT t : I Original 13 sbot^ ' \" ' ' (Pne^ent ^^ boundar,e^ Fnonbier tine.s I 1 1790 I I 1820 I 1 1940 1836 Dobu oF admission In fifty years the frontier moved from just across the Appalachians to the edge of the Great Plains. There it was expected to stop, since the plains were thought to be unsuitable for settlement and were therefore by law reserved for the Indians. A New England migration to the Northwest Territory began in 1788, when General Rufus Putnam and 48 Massachusetts settlers came down the Ohio River on a flatboat fittingly named The Mayflower and established a town they called Marietta. Another center of New England settlement was the Western Reserve on Lake Erie— land which Connecticut had re- tained to pay oflF veterans of the Revolution. By 1800 the region north of the Ohio contained over 50,000 settlers. (See map, pp. 174-175.)

These men sent agents through New England with accounts of the marvelous fertiUty of the Genesee Valley, where there were no rocks in the fields and farms did not \"he edgeways.\" Such salesmanship started a mass movement, called the \"Genesee fever,\" which almost de- populated some New England villages. On a single winter day in 1795, five hundred sleighs full of New Englanders and their baggage were counted going westward through Albany on their way toward the Genesee. This rapid filhng in of the West had a great effect on pohtics. Reflecting the spirit of the frontier, the new states were more demo- cratic than those in the East. The constitutions of Kentucky and Tennessee required no prop- erty quahfications for voting; all white men over 21 years of age had the franchise. A good frontier argument for manhood sufi^rage was that any man who helped to clear land and fight Indians had a right to a say in the gov- ernment. The Westerners tended to throw their Museum of Natural History weight on the side of Jefferson, who beheved in Ae people, and against Hamilton and his followers, who distrusted them. Nothing better revealed the effectiveness of the Washington administration than the success of its pohcies in the West. The Indians had been pacified; the Spanish and English had been persuaded to draw back and cease meddling; and all danger of secession had passed. FOREIGN AFFAIRS Shortly after Washington was inaugurated in 1789, the French Revolution began. At first all Americans sympathized with the Revolution, because the French were demanding the same rights as those won by the United States a few years earlier.

They did not go that far, but they did hope to enhst soldiers and sailors in the United States and to use American ports as bases for French privateers. This placed the United States in an ex- tremely difficult position. To be dragged into hostiHties with Great Britain, whatever our sentiment for France, would have been a dis- aster. Three-quarters of American trade was with Britain and tarifiF duties on British goods provided the greater part of the revenue of the federal government. Since the British fleet con- trolled the seas, war would have meant a ces- sation of foreign trade and bankruptcy for the newly established government. On hearing of the outbreak of the Anglo- French war, Washington called a cabinet meeting and presented a series of questions, the most pressing of which was whether the President should issue a declaration of neu- trality. The cabinet members, including both Jefferson and Hamilton, thought he should, and accordingly, in April 1793, Washington issued a Proclamation of Neutrality. This de- clared that the conduct of the United States toward the warring powers was to be \"friendly and impartial.\" It warned that American citi- zens who helped either side would be denied the protection of the government and would be subject to punishment. The arrival of a new French minister. Citi- zen Edmond Genet, put the neutrality procla- mation to the test. Disembarking in South Carolina, Genet went overland to Philadelphia, capital of the United States from 1790 to 1800. He was invited to so many dinners and pro- French celebrations that his journey was a triumphal progress. Along the way, he made arrangements to man French privateers with American crews and offered George Rogers Clark a commission in the French army. On arriving in Philadelphia, Genet demanded that the United States advance him money to pay his new recruits. The French minister's efi^orts to involve this country in war were soon checked. Washington received him with icy politeness. Hamilton, who hated the French Revolution, used all his in- fluence against Genet. Even Jefferson, a friend of France, lectured Genet on international law and flatly refused his demands. Genet ignored the warnings issued him, went on fitting out privateers, and even threatened to appeal to the American people against Wash- ington. Finally, our government demanded that he be recalled to France.

After his marriage to a daughter of Governor Clinton, he spent the rest of his life in obscurity. Growing Tension with Great Britain When the British realized that the new government under the Constitution was much more powerful than that under the Articles of Confederation, they at last consented to send a minister to the United States. But once the European war began, they issued a series of Orders in Council that forbade neutral ships to trade with the French West Indies, to carry any French West Indian produce, or to carry arms, munitions, or even food to France. These restrictions fell most heavily on the United States which had the largest neutral merchant marine. English warships seized himdreds of American vessels, often without serious inquiry as to their destination, and confiscated their cargoes. This was a clear violation of the rights of neutrals. Meanwhile, the British governor of Canada made a speech to a delegation of Indians from the Northwest Territory and promised them aid in driving white settlers out of the region. Public opinion was aroused to the point where Congress began preparations for a war against England. In the spring of 1794, Congress embargoed American exports for two months with the idea of hurting British commerce. Washington decided to make one last effort to keep the peace. He sent John Jay, Chief Justice of the United States, as a special envoy to London to try to settle the out- standing disputes between the United States and Great Britain."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"172 Launching the Republic The British were willing to sign a treaty because an American war would divert them from prosecuting hostilities with France and because the United States was their best market. Jay got rather poor terms, however, partly because Alexander Hamilton committed the serious indiscretion of letting the British kaow the American envoy's instructions. The so-called Jay Treaty was completed late in 1794 and presented by Washington to the Senate the next year. By it the British at last agreed to evacuate the fur posts on American soil. American ships were allowed into ports in the British Isles on the same terms as British ships in American ports. The treaty permitted a very limited trade with the British West Indies, but none at all with British ports on the mainland of North America, such as Halifax and Quebec. Some matters, notably the debts owed to British merchants from before the Revolution and losses by American ships at the hands of the British fleet, were to be submitted John Jay, Conservative \"Those who own the country ought to govern it\" was the sentiment of the Federalist party; the words were John Jay's. Jay was surely one of the most conservative of the men who urged the revolu- tion against Great Britain and molded the new republic into stable form. He was twenty-nine, with a substantial law practice, when he became a member of the Continental Congress in 1774. Before the Declaration of Independence, he was among the moderates who tried to check extremists such as Sam Adams and Patrick Henry. When the revolutionary movement started to roll, however. Jay supported it energetically, though the moderates gave it a relatively conservative direction. After the Constitution was written, he was responsible for five of the Federalist papers — on foreign affairs and the treaty-making power of the Senate — urging ratification by New York State. A man of distinguished appearance, with a prominent nose, a strong chin, and a brow which was heightened by partial baldness. Jay was wholly self-assured. He was often suspicious of others; his lack of trust in the French minister, Vergennes, led the American commissioners to deal separately with the British in negotiating the treaty of independence in 1783. It is unfortunate for John Jay's reputation that he is remembered chiefly as the negotiator of the unpopular Jay Treaty, in regard to which he was accused of being hoodwinked by the British. Even here he has been dealt with unfairly, and for the rest the roster of his services to his country is impressive: he was chief justice of New York, minister to Spain, Secretary for Foreign Affairs in the Confederation government (see the Jay-Gardoqui Treaty, p. 83), the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (1789-1795), and, at the same time, acting Secretary of State while Thomas Jefferson was in France. After negotiating the Jay Treaty, he served as governor of New York. In 1801 he went into retirement. Jay lived to be eighty-four, a Federalist and a conservative to the end.

In spite of adverse opinion, the Senate ratified the treaty by an exact two-thirds vote, 20 to 10.

Later there was a struggle in the House of Representatives, where opponents of the treaty, led by Madison, attempted to hold it up by refusing to vote funds necessary to put it into effect.

WASHINGTON STEPS DOWN Washington had wanted to retire to private life after his first term as President, saying he would rather dig ditches than go on. He con- sented to run for a second term only after promi- nent politicians, including both Jefferson and Hamilton, urged him to do so as a patriotic duty. In 1793, as in 1789, he received no opposition vote in the electoral college. He enjoyed his sec- ond term even less than his first. Forced to choose bet\\veen Hamiltonian and Jeffersonian policies, he increasingly leaned toward the former and thus opened himself to the attacks of Jeffersonian orators and newspaper editors. He was accused of trying to make himself long and of selling out to Great Britain. When he left office, the Philadelphia Aurora, a leading anti-administration newspaper edited by Ben- jamin Frankhn's grandson, exulted: If ever there was a period for rejoicing this is the moment. Every heart in unison with the freedom and happiness of the people ought to beat high with exultation that the name of Washington from this day ceases to give a currency to political iniquity and legalized corruption. Washington was more sensitive than is generally reaUzed. He confessed that he wished to escape attacks on him written \"in such exaggerated and indecent terms as could scarce be apphed to a Nero, a notorious defaulter, or even a common pickpocket.\" On returning to his beloved Mount Vernon, Washington had every reason to feel proud of the achievements of the federal government during his eight years as President. Most of the major diflBculties of the Confederation period had been met successfully. As a result of Hamilton's financial program, the credit of the United States was as high as that of any nation in Europe. The easy suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion revealed the power of the new government. The major demands of the West had been fulfilled. In the difficult situation presented by war between France and Britain, Washington had steered a course which kept the United States prosperous and at peace. Farewell Address, 1796 As the last important act of his presidency, Washington published his famous Farewell Ad- dress. After explaining that he felt he had ful- filled his duty in acting as President for two terms and therefore did not propose to serve a third, Washington went on to give advice to the yoimg repubhc. The best known portion of his address is that which relates to foreign affairs. Washington warned the American people against permanent dislike of some nations and passionate affection for others. \"The nation,\" he said, \"which indulges toward an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave.\" Such a nation \\\\'ill be too quick to resent the actions of the coimtry it dislikes, and too apt to make concessions to the country it likes. \"Europe,\" wrote Washington, \"has a set of primary interests which to us have none or a very remote relation.\" The United States should therefore avoid \"the insidious wiles of foreign influence\" and \"steer clear of permanent alli- ances with any portion of the foreign world.\" He did, however, favor temporary alliances for particular situations as well as commercial treaties to open up \"the streams of trade.\" His advice to practice a policy that today would be called \"neutralism\" was directed to the par- ticular conditions of 1796, when the Anglo- saAA-"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The Washington Administration 111 French rivalry was a threat to the very existence of the United States.

The Farewell Address also fitted into a general tradition of attempted isolation from European politics that can be traced back to the Revolution and that became the dominant note in United States foreign pohcy until well into the twentieth century. The Farewell Address warned not only against permanent alHances, but against the formation of permanent political parties. Wash- ington feared that \"the baneful effects of the spirit of party\" might lead to \"riot and insur- rection . . . foreign influence and corruption,\" and even to the destruction of the Union. The President was referring to the bitter struggle that had developed between the followers of Hamilton and Jefferson. The Hamiltonians had crystallized into a party called the Federalists and the opposition to Hamilton had been or- ganized by Madison and Jefferson into a party called the Republicans.

GILBERT There was nothing in the Constitution of the United States to suggest rival politica] parties. When in his Farewell Address Washing- ton deplored the fact that parties had arisen, he simply reflected the general feeling of the founders of the republic about them. Vice- President John Adams had said in 1792, \"There is nothing I dread so much as the division of the Republic into two parties, each under its own leader.\" And yet political parties soon ap- peared in the young republic and have been a characteristic featiu-e of American pohtics ever THE FORMATION OF PARTIES Throughout the revolutionary period there had been a tendency for men who differed on major issues to divide into rival groupings such as the Patriots and the Loyalists, who fought over the question of separation from Britain, or the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists, who fought over ratification of the Constitution. But these groupings broke up as soon as the issues they were connected with were settled. During the debates over Hamilton's financial program, rival combinations again appeared, and those who supported his measures gradu- ally organized into the first American political party— the Federalists. They included not merely those who obviously benefited from Hamilton's program, such as creditors, mer- chants, and bondholders, but people of a generally conservative cast, such as Congrega- tional ministers in New England, Episcopalian clergymen in the South, tidewater plantation owners, and members of the Society of the Cincinnati (an organization of former officers of the Revolutionary War). The Federalists also gained mass support from wage earners in the shipping industry, from small farmer*: who stood to gain from export of agricultural products, and from people in states that had benefited when the federal government assumed the state debts. This comphcated web of sentiment and self-interest was held together and given direction by Hamilton himself, assisted by prominent Federalists holding federal and state offices, by newspaper editors, preachers, and local organizations. Reflecting Hamilton's 179"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"ISO Launclmig the Republic distrust of the people, the Federalist party hoped to put the direction of government into the hands of the \"rich, well-bom, and able.\" They favored a f:trnng central gov ernment, a str opg executive department, a^ '^ a s^anHin g armv to Vfpp- \"the -swinishjnultitude\" in con- trol. President Washington, who tried to stand above party but favored Federalist policies, be- came a sort of patron saint of the new party. Gradually there developed a party opposed to the Federalists, led at first by Madison, with Jefferson as a later recruit. It found its strength chiefly among the agricultural classes— southern planters, subsistence farmers of the backcoimtry, and \"mechanics\" such as carpenters, shoe- makers, and masons. None of these groups gained immediate benefit from Hamilton's measures, although they were taxed to pay for them. The people of Madison's and Jefferson's party called themselves Eepublicans to suggest that they were defending American self- government, freedom, and equality against the aristocratic and monarchical tendencies of the Federalists. The Republicans professed to be- lieve in limiting the power of the central gov- ernment and reducing that of the President, as well as in preserving the maximum of individual liberty.^ The French Revolution widened the division betw 3n the parties. The conservatives who led the Federahst party were appalled by the mob violence accompanying the revolution, as well as by its threat to property and religion. Starting by reducing the power of the Roman Catholic 1 The labels of the two parties may cause confusion. \"Feder- alist\" took on three different meanings in a short time. Just before the formation of the Constitution, the \"federalists\" were those who preferred a loose union of slates. Uke that under the Articles of Confederation, to a \"national\" government. In 1787 and 1788, the \"Federalists\" were those who supported ratifica- tion of the Constitution, as against the \"Anti-Federalists\" who opposed it. Finally, in the 1790's the label was applied, as ex- plained above, to a political party. The Republican party of Jefferson's time is the direct ancestor of the present Democratic party. The modem Republican party was founded in 1854 (see p. 338). Church and taking away its property, the French revolutionaries went on to abandon Christianity in favor of the worship of the \"Goddess of Reason.\" When war broke out be- tween France and Britain, the Federalists sided with the British as defenders of stability and sanity against chaos. Furthermore, the mer- chants and shippers supporting the Federalists felt they would be ruined by a war with Britain, because American commerce would be driven from the seas. By pushing the federal govern- ment into bankruptcy, war would also injure those Federalists who ouned 45 million dollars' worth of United States bonds. The Republicans tended to dismiss the vio- lence of the French Revolution as a passing phase in a great crusade for human rights. Jefferson sorrowed over French friends who were guillotined, but thought that the shedding of \"a little innocent blood\" might be a necessary price for the righting of ancient wrongs. If French aristocrats suffered, so had American Loyalists. The Republicans regarded the French struggle with Britain as a counterpart of the American War of Independence. The early enthusiasm for the French Revo- lution caused the formation of a network of Democratic Societies, rather like the Sons of Liberty of the 1770's. They organized public demonstrations and festivals, such as the one held in Boston in January 1793. Proceedings began at daybreak with the discharge of cannon. An ox was roasted whole and dragged through the streets, accompanied by wagons containing hogsheads of rum punch and hundreds of loaves of bread. These were distributed free to the crowds. Schoolchildren recei\\ed cakes stamped with the words \"Liberty and Equality.\" Money collected from spectators bought debtors out of the city jail.

Some New England Federalist electors left Pinckney off their ballots in order to make sure that Adams would get the highest vote. The result was that Adams was elected President with 71 electoral ^'otes, while Jefferson, his op- ponent, became Vice-President with 68 electoral votes.

An early leader of the revolu- tionary movement in Massachusetts, he was a prominent member of the First and Second Continental Congresses. Jefferson considered him the most effective speaker in favor of de- claring independence. During the Revolutionary War, he was an envoy to France and Holland, as well as one of the commissioners to make peace. During the Confederation period, he acted as our first minister to Great Britain. During Washington's two terms as President, Adams served as Vice-President. In all these positions Adams had revealed abihty and honesty. He was a man of great moral courage, as he showed early in his career when he acted as lawyer for the defense of Captain Preston, who had been in command of the British troops in the Boston Massacre. A modem historian writes of this action: Not only physical courage was here demanded, for he invited personal attack, but moral courage at its highest. He was dependent for his clientage on the Boston public and the \\ictims of the massa- cre were Bostonians. He was an American and he was standing between a hated redcoat and Ameri- can revenge. He gambled with his career, for he armed his enemies with arnmunition, and he was charged with selling his country for an enormous fee. The fact that he received but eighteen guineas would have been the answer, but he maintained a dignified silence. There is nothing finer or more courageous in the records of any politician."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"-J V-- Adams was the founder of the most dis- tinguished family in the history of American politics. His son, John Quincy Adams, also be- came President. A grandson, Charles Francis Adams, was United States minister to Great Britain during the Civil War. A great-grandson, Henry Adams, was one of the best American historians, and a great-great-grandson, Charles Francis Adams, ser\\'ed as Secretary of the Navy under President Hoover. In spite of his talents and character, Adams was not a complete success as President. For one thing, he was too aware of his ovvti virtues. During the Revolution he had written of him- self: \"At such times as this there are many dangerous things to be done_ which nobody else will do, and therefore I cannot help attempting them.\" Enemies satirized both his love of cere- mony and his roly-poly figure by nicknaming him \"His Rotundity.\" He was diflBcult to deal with, because compromise was foreign to his nature and because he was often as suspicious of others' motives as he was proud of his own. Even without these handicaps, Adams's po- sition as President would have been difiBcult. He kept the members of Washington's cabinet in office, and this proved to be a mistake because these men did not feel they owed their first loyalty to the new President. Although Hamil- ton had resigned as Secretary of the Treasury in 1795, the cabinet members were in the habit of consulting him on important mattets. When Hamilton and Adams were in disagreement, as they often were, the cabinet followed the lead of their former colleague instead of that of the President. Difficulties with France Adams inherited the dispute with France.

Pinckney was sent as minister to France in 1796, he was ordered out of the country. Meanwhile, the French navy started to prey on American shipping.

Unwilling and unable to produce the money, our commissioners broke off negotiations. When the news of this incident reached the United States, Adams sent an ac- count to Congress, labeling Talleyrand's agents X, Y, and Z. The XYZ Affair produced an out- burst of popular anger against France. Adams was cheered when he declared to Congress that he would \"never send another minister to France without assurances that he will be received, respected, and honored as the representative of a great, free, powerful, and independent nation.\" The slogan of the day was a toast by C. C. Pinckney,^ one of the^ommissioners: \"Millions for defense, Jjut- not one cent - for tri bute.\" Undeclared War At the beginning of his presidency, Adams had called Congress into special session to strengthen American defenses. A navy depart- ment was created. Soon fourteen warships and two hvindred privateers were carrying on an imdeclared naval war with France. The United States even entered into a sort of unofficial alliance with Great Britain. The British gave the American fleet their system of signals and \"lent\" it guns and ammunition. When Wash- ington died in 1799, British warships flew the Union Jack at half-mast. The war fever suited many of the leaders of the Federalist party, including Hamilton. It strengthened the power of the central govern- ment, made the Federalists popular, and dis- I credited the pro-French Republicans. If war continued, the Federahsts could count on winning the election of 1800. Federalists who wished to use the war for partisan advantage failed to reckon with John Adams. The President absolutely refused to subordinate American foreign pohcy to winning re-election for himself and for his party. As soon as he had word that Talleyrand was willing to receive Amercian diplomats properly, Adams sent to the Senate the nomination of a minister to France. Federalist senators, engaged in a de- bate over war preparations, were furious, but they could not long oppose an effort to make peace. Eventually, another three-man commis- sion was sent to France, where it was honor- ably received. The United States demanded $20,000,000 for damages to American shipping and an end to the Treaty of AlHance of 1778. A compromise was reached in 1800 whereby the United States gave up its claim to damages while France agreed to give up the alliance. Thus the United States bought its way out of the only long-time alhance it has ever made vdth a single nation. Adams's action in making peace against the wishes of most of his party was an act as courageous as his defense of Captain Preston. With imderstandable pride, he later wrote that he wished no other inscrip- tion on his gravestone than, \"Here lies John Adams who took upon himself the responsibility of the peace with France in the year 1800.\" Partisan Legislation Many Federalists had convinced themselves that prominent Republicans were actively and treasonably in league wath France, and that the United States was crawling with French \"apostles of sedition\" who threatened, as one Federahst editor put it, \"to bum all our cities and cut the throats of all our inhabitants.\" In 1798 the Federalist majority in Congress pushed through three laws designed to hurt the Repub- lican party— a Natm-alization Act, an Alien Act, and a Sedition Act. Many French and Irish refugees had recently come to America; being anti-British, they usually joined the Republicans. Therefore, the Naturahzation Act extended the time necessary for a foreigner to become a citizen from five to fourteen years. The Alien Act reflected the almost hysterical fear of French agents who were thought to be using the Re- publicans as dupes. It required all foreigners"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Federalists and Republicans 185 to register with the federal government and al- lowed the President to deport without trial any whom he considered \"dangerous to the peace and safet>' of the United States.\" The Sedition Act was designed to muzzle the Republican press. It forbade citizens to speak or publish anything false or malicious against the federal go\\emment or any of the oflBcers thereof. Vio- lators could be punished by fines up to $5,000 and imprisonment up to five years. Both Adams and Hamilton warned fellow Federalists against abusing their power. As it turned out, the anti-Republican laws hurt the Federalist party itself more than the intended victim. The Naturalization and Ahen acts of- fended recent immigrants and drove them more than ever to the support of \"the Republicans. The ten Republicans, mostly newspajjer editors, who were jailed under the Sedition Act were hailed by their followers as heroic martyrs to the sacred cause of freedom of the press. Typical of the effect of the Sedition Act was the case of Congressman Matthew Lyon, of Vermont, the editor of a violently anti-Federahst paper, The Scouriie of Aristocracy and Repository of Important Political Truths. Lyon was sent to jail for publishing the opinion that President Adams ought to be sent to an insane asylum, ^^'hile in jail, he was re-elected to Congress. When after his release he set off for Philadelphia, he was accompanied on the first day of his journey by a parade of carriages said to have been twelve miles long. Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, 1798-1799 The Federalists' \"reign of terror\" under the Sedition Act had given the Republicans an issue. In 1798 and 1799, the Republican-dominated legislatures of Kentucky and Virginia passed resolutions denouncing the act as unconstitu- tional because it violated the First Amendment, which says, \"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.\" These resolutions, secretly written by Jefferson and Madison, are important because thev first pre- QUESTION .

It was for the individual states to determine when their agent had exceeded its powers. If a state thought that a federal law went beyond the powers granted to the federal government in the Constitution, it had the right to \"nullify\" the law— that is, to declare it null and void and to refuse to obey it. To phrase it differently, the state had the right to \"interpose\" its power to protect its citizens from misuse of federal power. The nulHfication theory was rightly de- nounced by other state legislatures as tending to the breakup of the Union. If any state could nullify any federal law it considered unconsti- tutional, the power of the federal government would cease. The Kentucky and Virginia reso- lutions were intended, however, simply as cam- paign material for the presidential election of 1800 and were followed by no action under- mining federal authority. THE ELECTION OF 1800 It was while he was Vice-President under Adams that Jefferson became the active leader of the Republican party. He was in an ideal situation for the task. He was at the center of the government, yet his job as Vice-President carried with it very few official duties. Through personal contact with members of Congress and through thousands of letters, he kept in touch with Republicans all over the country."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"The New York Public Library Although he was revered by later generations, Jeffer- son was hated by many during his lifetime. This Federalist cartoon shows Jefferson with a brandy bottle at his feet, his pockets stuffed with incendiary literature, pulling down the federal government. Jefferson's guiding hand was seldom seen, sometimes because it was deliberately con- cealed, as in the case of the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions, but more often because he acted in consultation with other men. Even when giving his own ideas, he concealed them imder some such phrase as \"our friends think that. . .\" Above all, he worked through news- papers. He said once that if he had to choose between government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, he would choose the latter. He collected money to foimd dozens of Republican newspapers throughout the country— a tremendous force in turning pub- lic opinion toward his side. As the presidential election of 1800 ap- proached, the Federalists nominated Adams and Charles C. Pinckney; the Republicans nomi- nated Jefferson and Aaron Burr. While the Re- publicans were becoming better organized, the Federahsts were badly split between followers of Hamilton and of Adams. Hamilton, indeed, lost his head and wrote for private circulation among his friends a pamphlet attacking Adams. Burr somehow got a copy of this and saw that it was published in leading Republican news- papers. No conceivable piece of campaign lit- erature could have been more damaging to the Federalists. In the campaign, Jefferson suggested that his followers concentrate their fire on the Sedi- tion Act and the heavier taxes brought on by the French war. The Federalists coimtered by predicting that Jefferson would cancel the pub- lic debt and abolish the navy. Spokesmen for both parties made fantastic charges, those against Jefferson being especially unfair. The Vice-President was portrayed as a drunkard, an atheist, and a French agent. The Hartford Courant, a Federalist newspaper, wrote of the possibility of his election as follows: I. Mr. Jefferson has long felt a spirit of deadly hostility against the Federal Constitution. . . . II. If he should be elected President, the Con- stitution will inevitably fall a sacrifice to Jacobinism. III. The result wiU be dreadful to the people of the United States. The result of the election of 1800 was a close victory for Jefferson and Burr, who each re- ceived 73 electoral votes to 65 for Adams and 64 for Pinckney. The election revealed an in- teresting development. Whereas in 1796 there was a clear sectional division between the two parties, by 1800 each party had found allies in the home territory of the other (compare elec- tion maps on pp. 182 and 187).

This alliance between the South and the northern city machines be- came a characteristic feature of the Democratic party, which has endured, in varying forms, un- til the present day. The Federalists also formed strange alli- ances. In New York and Virginia, for instance, they received strong support from the small farmers of the backcountry, who might have been expected to follow Jefferson. In each case, local rivalries aligned them against the leading Repubhcans of their states. Thus, the differences between the parties began to blur. Ever since, the major American political parties have tended to be bundles of local interests, loosely tied together for the pur- pose of ^viIming elections. On the whole, this may have been QUESTION . How does the party system that origi- nated in the United States differ from party systems in other democratic coun- tries, such as Italy, Great Britain, and Japan, and from those in Communist countries? fortunate, because intersectional dis- putes are often ironed out by compromise with- in the parties. Ex- cept on the eve of the Civil War in 1860, there has seldom been need to fear what Washington warned against in his Farewell Address— parties formed on sectional lines, whose struggle might break up the Union.

There was no doubt that the Repubhcans in- tended Jefferson for the presidency, but since every Repubhcan elector had voted for both ELECTORAL VOTE J.Adams 65 (C.RnckneyM) Contrast this with the map on p. 182. Each party has begun to invade the home territory of the other. Thus, instead of promoting sectional divisions, parties =4^ became a means of playing them down. Jefferson and Burr, there was a tie vote. By the Constitution, the choice of the President was thrown into the House of Representatives, which was controlled by the Federahsts (Ar- ticle II, p. 124). Some Federahsts tried to elect Burr as President, and came close to doing so. The House was so evenly divided that it took 35 ballots over a period of sLx days before deciding who was to be elected. Responsible leaders such as Hamilton threw their weight to Jefferson because they thought him a man of higher character and clearly the choice of the coimtry. Finally, enough Federahst congressmen withdrew from the balloting to allow the Re- pubhcan members of the House to elect Jeffer- son. As a result of this confusion, the Twelfth Amendment was added to the Constitution in 1804. This provided for separate ballots in the electoral college for President and Vice-Presi- dent.

Although the Federalists were un- happy at the outcome, they accepted it and quietly surrendered control of the federal gov- ernment. It was the first time in modem history that the political control of a country was trans- ferred as the result of a democratic election. In spite of the partisanship and the wild talk, the new party system was beginning to work in ways that helped the nation. The parties that the Founding Fathers had feared and warned against had become useful country-wide organ- izations that found and nominated candidates for public oflBce, that kept the oflBcials of the federal government and the people back home in touch with each other, and that found means of compromising factional and sectional dif- ferences. Achievements and Eclipse of the Federalists Although the Federalists were defeated in 1800 and never won another presidential elec- tion, the United States owed them a debt of gratitude. During their years in oflSce, the Con- stitution had been put into successful operation. Every outstanding problem left over from the Confederation period had been solved, at least for the time. The wonder is that in spite of such achievements the Federalists were driven from power. Part of the explanation lies in the split between Hamilton and Adams, and part in Jef- ferson's ability in organizing the Republicans. Fundamentally, however, the Federalists lost control of the national government in 1800 because they had little trust in the people. Jef- ferson appealed to public opinion and worked with \"his friends\" in every state and town. The Federalists, on the other hand, were run by small cliques that were mortally afraid of de- mocracy. A Massachusetts Federalist said that he held \"democracy, in its natural operation, to be government of the worst.\" The editor of the principal Federalist newspaper described the people as \"the stupid populace, too abject in ignorance to think rightly, and too depraved to draw honest deductions.\" The attempt of Federalist congressmen to elect Burr over Jefferson was just one example of their scorn of the people's will. As more west- em states brought frontier ideas of democracy into politics, and as more men received the right to vote in the older states, the Federalist party lost ground and eventually disappeared. A NEW CAPITAL AND A NEW KIND OF PRESIDENT In the last year of Adams' presidency, the federal govemment had moved to the new cap>- ital city of Washington. TTie Constitution had made provision for a separate capital, and the French Revolution had convinced Congress that one was necessary. In France the govemment had often been terrorized and dominated by the Paris mob. It was therefore resolved not to locate the capital in one of the big cities such as New York or Philadelphia. The site was a matter of dispute. It was expected that the new capital would attract trade and industry, so half a dozen states of- fered to donate land. Northern congressmen preferred a location north of the Mason-Dixon line (see map, p. 255), while southern congress- men favored one on the Potomac River. The matter was settled at the time of the passage of the Assumption Act of 1790 by a piece of logrolling between Hamilton and JeflFerson. The proposal to take over state debts was opposed by Virginia, which had paid off its debt. Ham- ilton therefore offered to round up northern support for the Potomac site if Jefferson would persuade some Virginia congressmen to stop opposing assumption. Jefferson fell in with the scheme, and thus the site of Washington, D.C., was fixed.

To design the new city, Washington chose Pierre L'Enfant, a Frenchman who had served in the American army during the Revolutionary War. L'Enfant's plans for a vast metropolis with great avenues radiating from key points were so ambitious and expensive, and he was so diflScult to work with, that he was dismissed. L'Enfant took his maps and designs with him, but they were partly reconstructed from memory by one of his sm^eyors, Benjamin Banneker, a free Negro from Maryland, who was also noted as a self-taught astronomer and editor of a popular almanac. At the time the federal government moved to Washington, the plans for a great city had not proceeded far. The President's house, with Mrs. Adams' laundry sometimes hanging in the imfinished East Room, stood in an open field with two boxlike buildings for executive oflSces Benjamin Banneker, Man of Many Talents The group meeting in Philadelphia was perplexed. A new city was to be built on the banks of the Potomac, designed expressly to be the capital of the United States. Commissioners had been named by President Washington, and they had chosen Major Pierre L'Enfant to draw the city plans. Now that irascible genius had stormed away in a rage, tal<ing the plans with him. The Commission met to examine their plight. Thomas Jefferson, presiding, asked for suggestions. Every eye turned to Benjamin Banneker as he stood up. \"May I ask, sir,\" he hesitated a little, \"If the plans we had were satisfactory?\" Jefferson frowned slightly. \"How can I say? I never saw them. Why?\" The single word was like a pistol shot. \"Because, sir,\" responded Banneker evenly, \"I have the plans In my head.\" Benjamin Banneker was a \"free Negro from Maryland,\" and free Negroes in the late eighteenth century faced difficult problems. American slaves had security even though the price was the absence of freedom. They knew where they stood in the social order; indeed, they had their own social lines, which placed house servant \"aristocracy\" above the artisan \"middle class\" and both above the field workers. But the free Negro was a displaced person, on the fringe of society. Banneker, however, was extraordinary. Through hard work and study, he had become a skilled draftsman and surveyor. He used his brilliant mind to become a notable mathematician. His professional ability enabled him to work with Major L'Enfant, and his phenomenal memory reproduced the plans on which they had worked. From L'Enfant's plans come the immense vistas and formal de- sign. And the often-remarked position of the Capitol, which faces away from the center of Washington, is a reminder of L'Enfant's wish that it face the rising sun.

As late as 1809, a Brit- ish diplomat noted a covey of partridges within a quarter of a mile of the Capitol. Thomas Jefferson, Scientist If Washington, D.C., was an odd sort of capital in 1801, the first President inaugurated there was in many ways an odd sort of man to be the founder of a political party and head of a state. Thomas Jefferson hated crowds, avoided making speeches, and disliked the rough-and-tumble of pohtics. Like Washington, he infinitely preferred farming to public oflBce.

He was a scientist. It was fitting that he was elected president of the American Philosophical Society in 1796 and re-elected annually for nearly twenty years. He had a passion to assist in extending the boundaries of knowledge and by doing so to increase the happiness of mankind. His interest in govern- ment was part of his purpose: he wanted to apply organized reason to the problems of so- ciety in such a way as to benefit individual human beings. In appearance and manner Jefferson had little of Washington's dignity. He deliberately tried to reduce the ceremony surrounding the office of President because he felt his predeces- sors had acted too much like monarchs. He walked to his inauguration instead of being drawn by a coach-and-six, and sent written messages to Congress instead of appearing be- fore that body in person. It amazed foreigners to see him riding through the dusty streets of Washington on horseback, dressed in faded corduroy overalls, with a bag of clover seed in front of the saddle. A British diplomat de- scribed him as follows: He was a tall man, with a very red freckled face, and gray neglected hair; his manners good- natured, frank and rather friendly, though he had somewhat of a cynical expression of countenance. He wore a blue coat, a thick gray-colored hair waist- coat, with a red underwaistcoat lapped over it, green velveteen breeches with pearl buttons, yam stock- ings, and slippers down at the heels,— his appearance being very much like that of a tall, large-boned farmer. Jefferson's Inaugural Address Jefferson's Inaugural Address was in its day ahnost as famous as Washington's Farewell Address or the Declaration of Independence. In relatively few words it explained his philosophy of government. (See pp. 801-802.) After declaring that the task before him was beyond his talents, Jefferson asked for national harmony after the bitterness of the election of 1800. \"Let us,\" he said, \"restore to social inter- 193"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"194 Launching the Republic course that harmony and aflFection without which hberty and even life itself are but dreary things. . . . We are all Republicans,\" he went on, \"we are all Federalists.\" By this he meant that in spite of their distrust of democracy, the Fed- eralists recognized the republican principle that decisions are finally settled by the will of the people, and that in spite of their distrust of centralized power, the Republicans did not propose to destroy the federal government. JeflFerson then took up three problems still much discussed in the twentieth century: (1) What is to be done with those \"who would wish to dissolve this Union or to change its republican form\"? Should such people be jailed, exiled, or forced to register with the police, as the Alien and Sedition acts had pro- vided? There was genuine and widespread fear of disloyalty and foreign influence. Jefferson, however, had such a belief in human freedom and such faith in human reason that he refused to be seriously alarmed. Of those who wished to alter or destroy the Union he said, \"Let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.\" (2 ) Can a government by the people be suf- ficiently strong to meet crises? Many feared that because the federal government lacked a strong pohce system and a big standing army, it was too weak to last. Jefi^erson answered that he thought the government of the United States was on the contra? rongeH^in the world because each citizen had a personal interest in d^^ding it- (3) Can man be trusted to govern himself? Jefferson countered this perpetual doubt about democracy by asking who is good enough to govern someone else. \"Or have we,\" he asked sarcastically, \"found angels in the form of kings to govern him?\" \"King\" in Jefferson's time had much the meaning that \"dictator\" has today. Jefferson then went on, as thousands of speakers have done since, to describe th^ pe- culiar good fortune of Americans, isolated from \"the exterminating havoc\" of European wars, possessing land enough for \"the thousandth and thousandth generation,\" nearly all professing some form of religion designed to make men honest, truthful, and friendly. Jeffersonian Principles of Government Jefferson described in some detail what he thought to be the right principles of \"wise and frugal government.\" In contrast to Hamilton's idea that the federal government should actively promote banking, commerce, and industry (pp. 160-165), he expr essed his belief in what econ- omists called laissez-faire— \"leave people alone.\" Government should not control the way busT- nessmen or farmers carry on their affairs, but should simply \"restrain men from injuring each other, and . . . leave them otherwise free to reg- ulate their own pursuits.\" Jefferson urged the preservation of personal freedom and the rights of the states.

Once in^ Control of the federal administra- tion, the Republican leaders found that their new role of being in power instead of in op- position pushed them toward modifying or even violating some of their previously expressed principles of government. Jefferson, for instance, professed to fear executive power, and in his Inaugural Address hinted that he would allow Congress to guide policy. He reduced the sym- bolic dignity of the presidency. He made ges- tures toward giving Congress more detailed control of the executive departments, but he soon found that if he did not give leadership, his party would break into factions. He there- fore used his position as party leader to influ- ence congressional legislation. By consultation with Republican leaders in Congress, and by seeing that his supporters gained key positions, Jefferson became just as much \"chief legislator\" as Washington had been. Similarly, Jefferson professed to fear extension of the power of the federal government, but, as the next chapter will show, when he felt he had to choose be- tween the welfare of the nation and his prin- ciples, he chose the former. Thus he illustrated the fact that the \"outs\" tend to be strict con- structionists, because they want to prevent action by their opponents who control the federal government, while the \"ins\" are apt to be loose constructionists, because they are in power and wish to act.

In 1804 a Federahst district judge, John Pickering, was impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate for actions that indicated that he had gone insane. The House then impeached Justice Samuel Chase of the Supreme Court. Chase had attacked de- mocracy in general and Jefferson in particular while addressing a Baltimore jury. The Senate, however, refused to convict Chase because it was not convinced that he had been proved guilty of \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" (See Article H, Section 4, p. 128.) The failure to remo\\'e Chase reduced the use of impeachment in the future to serious wrongdoing.

It was in fact hot the first time that the federal judiciary had declared federal laws unconstitutional, and judicial re- view of state legislation had been established in the Judiciary Act of 1789, but Marhury^y. Madison was in the long run of immense im- portance. The relentless logic with which Mar- shall showed that the federal courts , must inter - pret _ the ^ ^opstihitinn _ in orde£_to__obev_it impressed its elf on men's min ds.

TROUBLE WITH TRIPOLI The first threat to peace came not from one of the great po wers of Europ e, but tromTVipoli, a smalT^untry on the north coastal Africa. Piracy was a principal business of Tripoh and the other Barbary Coast states of Morocco, Algiers, and Tunis. The ships of countries not paying them tribute were subject to capture and their crews to enslavement. In the Confed- eration period, American shipping had been driven from the Mediterranean because the United States lacked money to pay tribute. During the Federalist period, however, the United States treasury could afford the demands of the Barbary pirates. Between 1789 and 1801 the United States paid over $2,000,000 in \"pro- tection\" for our ships. At the time of the XYZ Affair, when Americans were cheering the toast, \"Milhons for defense, but not one cent for tribute!\" a United States warship carried twenty-six barrels of silver dollars to Algiers. T hinking th eJUnitgd Statesji weak as it was d istant, th e^ Barbary ^ oast states i ncreased their dg mands. I n 1801, just two months after Jeffer- son's inaugiu-ation, the ruler of Tripoh cut down the flagpole of the American consulate in his capital to show his dissatisfaction with the amount of American tribute. Although peace' might have been Jefferson's passion, he did not propose that the United States should be perpetually subject to organ- ized robbery.

THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE, 1803 A far more serious threat to the United States than any possible demands of the Bar- bary pirates came with the news that in 1800 S pain had,secretlY ceded Louisiana, including ^ev.' Orleans, back to France. The French were now ruled by Napoleon Bonaparte, whose de- votion to conquest and war kept Europe in turmoil for many years. Napoleon made France -Stronger in Europe than ever before, and he intended to create a new French empire in America. The prospect of seeing New Orleans taken over by French officials and garrisoned with French troops greatly alarmed Jefferson. Al- though regarded as a friend of France, he wrote Robert Livingston, our minister in Paris, as follows: There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our national and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans, through which the pro- duce of three-eighths of our territory must pass to market. If France took possession of New Orleans, wrote Jefferson, \"we must marry ourselves to the Brit- ish fleet and nation.\" Thus, to keep a strong power from controlling the mouth of the Mis- sissippi, Jefferson was willing to abandon his opposition to \"entangling alliances.\" Before tying up with Britain, h e authorized _Ljvingston to offer France^l O,00(X6DD for New~O rieans an\"a~\"Wesr Floridarand_s ent James Monroe as a special envoy to^aris to help put across t he purchase. It^^s unlikely that American arguments, threats, or dollars would have moved Napoleon if his plans for a French empire had not suffered a terrible defeat.

In 1801 Napoleon sent an army under his brother-in-law. General Charles LeClerc, to subdue the Haitians. Toussaint L'Ouverture organized such effective resistance, however, that the French expedition failed, although he himself was captured. The warfare and yellow fe\\er killed 50,000 French troops, including LeClerc himself. The disaster was so complete that Napoleon was induced to abandon his American ambitions completely. Meanwhile, Livingston for many months had been urging the French to sell New Orleans. One day in April 1803, Talleyrand, French for- eign minister, astounded him by asking how much the United States would give for the whole of Louisiana.

When news of French willingness to sell this vast territory reached the United States, Jefferson was torn betvveen joy over a magnifi- cent bargain and worry over the constitutional powers of the federal government. Although the right to acquire new territory is nowhere stated in the Constitution, Jefferson had al- ready convinced himself that the federal gov- ernment possessed such a power. What really worried him was a provision in the Louisiana Purchase treaty which stated that Louisiana was to be \"incorporated into the Union\" and its inhabitants were to become Citizens of the United States. If the treaty were carried out, it meant that the executive departmeiifT^with the consent of the SenateT^assumed the light to ad mit al iens to^citizenship. Yet undeTThe Constitution the powers ot admitting new states and naturahzing foreigners were clearly re- served to Congress. Jefferson urged a constitutional amendment to remove any doubts about the legahty of the Louisiana Purchase treaty. His followers in the cabinet and Congress pointed out that time was pressing and that Napoleon might change his mind. Waiting for the slow processes of a constitutional amendment might lose Louisiana altogether. Jefferson therefore agreed to submit the treaty to the Senate. His strict-construction- ist principles were thus sacrificed to the im- mense benefits which the Louisiana Purchase brought to the farmers of the \\\\'est by acquir- ing the mouth of the Mississippi, and to the whole nation by averting diflBculties with France. The Senate approved the greatest real estate bargain in history in October 1803, and Amer- ican oflBcials took over from the French in De- cember. Just what territory the United States had acquired was still, however, not clear. Did- the purchase include 'Wesmonda\"^(see map, p. VToJ? Did ir mclude Texas7 No one knew for sure.

None could doubt the tremendous sig- nificance of the Louisiana Pur- chase in spite of its vague bound- aries. The annexation of this \\ast area made the United States master of the largest and one of the most fertile river valleys in the world. There could no longer be much doubt that, if it could remain united, the United States would dominate North America and expand to the Pacific. (See U.S. in 1850, pp. 320-321.)

The plotters found a tool in Aaron Burr, who was willing to desert Burr's plans were thwarted in part by Alex- ander Hamilton, who in 1800 had helped to prevent his being elected President over Jeffer- son. Some of Hamilton's criticisms of Burr were quoted in an Albany newspaper and had a wide circulation.

Apparently, he believed he must observe the code of military men of the day so that he might later be available for com- mand. He foresaw a situation in which he might be needed as an American Napoleon to suppress an uprising of the people and restore order. Early on a July morning in 1804, Hamilton, Burr, their seconds, and a physician rowed across the Hudson to a little shelf of rock at the foot of the Palisades. At the signal to fire Burr, an excellent shot, sent a bullet into Ham- ilton's body. Hamilton died the next day.

Burr's Conspiracy, 1805-1806 In 1805 and 1806, Burr was in the West arranging a conspiracy of which the details are even now obscure. He tried to draw a number of influential men into his schemes, as partners or as dupes. These included a senator from Ohio, the British and Spanish ministers to the United States, the commander of the federal troops in the West, and leaders of the former French colony in New Orleans. Some- times Burr talked of secession of the western , states, sometimes of the conquest of Mexico (with himself as emperor). He collected arms, ^ bought flatboats on the Ohio, and floated down toward New Orleans with fifty or sixty men. His movements became so widely known, how- ever, that the federal government had ample time to prepare for anything he might do. Eventually, Burr fled in disguise, but he was caught and taken to Richmond to face trial for treason before Chief Justice Marshall. At the trial Marshall followed the letter of the Constitution in protecting the rights of a person accused of treason.

North of the Ohio, the Tr eaty of Greenville had not satisfied the ^wfiiF es^^gsire for land. ^By persuasion, force, and fraud, Indian chiefs were induced to give up more and more land. In spite of solemn treaty promises that were to run \"as long as the sun shall climb the heavens or the waters shall run in the streams,\" whites persisted in hunting in areas reserved for Indians, thus destroying their principal soiuce of livelihood. Mere contact with the white men degraded the Indians. WillianLHenry Harrison^ _ long governor of the Northwest Territory, wrote as follows: I can tell at once upon looking at an Indian whom I may chance to meet, whether he belongs to a neighboring or more distant tribe. The latter is generally well-clothed, healthy, and vigorous; the former half -naked, filthy, and enfeebled by intoxica- tion. Harris on, who has been described as \"the m ost talent ed American at depriving the Ind ians from their ancest ral lands,\" wrote fi fteen -treaties whereby Indians^ gave up nearly all of modem Indiana andTITinois, plus other territories. At this time of crisis for the Indians, there appeared a remarkable leader, Tecim iseh, chief of the_Sha%viiees^JEIeJiQped_to~unite^rihe tribes, north and-south, into a great federation to resist the ever-encroaching whites. He and his brother persuaded his people to avoid al- cohol and to refrain from fighting white men except in self-defense. He went to Harrison and urged that the United States give up some re- cently \"purchased\" territory on the ground that the chiefs who signed the treaty had no au- thority. Harrison replied that only the President of the United States could comply with the request. Tecumseh answered: Well, as the great chief is to decide the matter, I hope the Great Spirit will put sense enough into his head to induce him to give up this land. It is true, he is so far off he will not be injured by the war; he may sit still in his town and drink his wine, while you and I will have to fight it out. This prediction came true. In 1811 Harrison starte d a p rgygptive war against^ Tecumseh's followers at a time when he knew The ^feal Indian leader was absent. Invading the Indian lands, he fought a rather inconclusive battle at Tippecanoe in modem Indiana. The Indian braves were armed with guns received from British fur traders. Westemers beheved that Tecumseh was a hired British agent, and that the British govemment egged on the Indians and paid them handsomely for the scalps of white settlers. DEFENDING AMERICAN NEUTRAL RIGHTS AT SEA Jefferson's presidency saw a renewal of war in Europe. In 1803 Great Britain and France went to war, after a trace of less than two years. Again the United States as the neutral nation possessing the largest merchant marine bene- fited greatly because of the wartime demand for goods. As in the period from 1793 to 1801, the warring countries again violated American rights. 'IMMa In 1805 NapoleAn won the great battle of Austerlitz, which made him master of most of westem Europe.

Neutral ships bringing British goods, stopping at British ports, or even submitting to search by British naval vessels were to be con- fiscated. Great Britain ansvv'ered the Napoleonic de- crees by Orders in Gouncil directed especially at the United States. British traders were already alarmed by the great increase in the American merchant marine. If American ships now took over the trade with Europe forbidden to the British by the French decrees, the United States might displace Britain as the greatest trading nation in the world. Therefore, Orders in Coun- cil of 1807 forbade neutral ships to trade with Europe unless they stopped in England first, and in any case to carry no products of the French colonies and nothing of mihtary value. American Shipping in Difficulties If thoroughly enforced, the Napoleonic de- crees and the Orders in Coimcil might have put Tecumseh, the Great Failure History is too often written by the winners, about the successful. The United States, however, sometimes honors the greatness of a loser and a failure. Such was Tecumseh, chief of the Shawnees. A tall, handsome man, with proud bearing, Tecumseh had little reason to feel friendly toward the whites — his father had been brutally murdered by frontiers- men — but he sternly opposed the savagery of Indian retaliation against white captives. Learning English from the daughter of a pioneer farmer, he tried to understand Americans in order to deal with them. Someone had to deal with them: white settlers were flooding into the Old Northwest. Tecumseh tried to stop them by uniting the Indian tribes into a single, strong nation. Traveling constantly, he spoke eloquently at tribal meetings from Florida to Michigan and west to Iowa. Young braves, anxious for adventure, shouted approval, but the older leaders shook their heads. Not for them any union with old enemies! Tecumseh's greatest wrath fell on the common white practice of \"lickering up\" the Indians and persuading them to sign treaties ceding tribal lands. In conference with General William Henry Harrison, he challenged the rights of a drunken chief: \"Sell a country? Why not sell the air, the clouds and the great sea as well as the earth? Did not the Great Spirit make them all for the use of his children?\" Alarmed at Tecumseh's activities. General Harrison wiped out the town of the Prophet, Tecumseh's brother and ally, on the Tippecanoe River. But the chief was not there. As the American-Indian warfare merged into the War of 1812, he joined his British allies against American forces near Detroit, on the Thames River. Deserted by the British, the Shawnees fought gallantly until Tecumseh fell. Then they fled, carrying his body — and all hope of Indian unity — with them.

If an American ship visited a British port, it was liable to seizure by the French; if it sailed direct to the Continent, the British might confiscate it. British warships cruised outside American harbors to search our ships and learn their destinations. French officials confiscated hun- dreds of American ships in European ports. Neither blockade, however, was complete, and the profits from successful evasion were so great that the American merchant marine prospered. Even more humiliating than the attempt to cut off our trade was the British practice of \"impressing\" sailors from American ships. Dis- cipline in the British navy was so strict, and the pay so low, that it was impossible to man the British navy with volunteers. For centuries, Britain had secured sailors for its navy by a legalized form of kidnaping known as impress- ment. Sailors might be not merely impressed in port, but even taken off merchant ships at sea. British sailors frequently deserted their country's service and signed on American vessels, where the conditions and pay were better. Some- times a British warship calling in an American port found it difficult to sail away because so many of the crew deserted. Therefore, Britain claimed the right to stop our ships, search for former British subjects, and force them back into service. The United States had protested about this practice ever since 1794, when John Jay had gone to England with instructions to persuade the British to give it up. No British government, however, would abandon impressment off American ships for fear it might become im- possible to man the Royal Navy. In the course of the Napoleonic Wars, it has been estimated that about 9,000 American citizens were forced to serve under the Union Jack; many of them lost their lives in the king's service. In June 1807, an American warship, the Chesapeake, was just leaving this country for a voyage to the Mediterranean when she was hailed by a British naval vessel, the Leopard. The commander of the Leopard demanded that he be allowed to search the Chesapeake for British deserters. When he was refused, the British ship fired three broadsides at the wholly unprepared Chesapeake, killing three Americans and wounding eighteen. After the American ship surrendered, the British carried off four sailors. Like the later sinkings of the Maine in 1898 and the Lusitania in 1915, the attack on the Chesapeake caused tremendous indignation in this country. Jefferson, however, delayed calling Congress until passion had time to cool. The President did not intend to accept humiliation at British hands, but sought some alternative to war. Embargo Act, 1807 Jefferson thought he had found a substitute for war in the use of an economic boycott. Be- fore the Revolutionary War, stopping trade with Great Britain had been successful in forcing repeal of the Stamp Act and modification of the Townshend acts. Now Jefferson assumed that both Britain and France were so dependent upon American exports that if the United States cut off trade with them, they would stop vio- lating American neutral rights. Under the Presi- dent's urging, Congress in December 1807 passed the Embargo Act which forbade Ameri- can ships to sail for foreign ports anywhere in the world. The Embargo Act proved to be a disastrous failure. It caused some suffering in Britain, but hurt France very little. Its worst results were in the United States. Thousands of sailors were put out of work and many had to beg. Ships rotted at the docks. Merchants were ruined. Stores of wheat, cotton, and tobacco piled up on the wharves while prices dropped.

In the epitaph he wrote for himself he asked to be remembered only as the author of the Declaration of Inde- pendence and the Virginia Bill for Religious Freedom, and as father of the University of Virginia. Jefferson's refusal to run for a third term as President helped to fix the two-term tradition that continued until Franklin D. Roosevelt's election for a third term in 1940, and that the Twenty-second Amendment made part of the Constitution in 1951. Jefferson used his in- fluence to pass the Republican nomination on to his close friend and Secretary of State, James Madison. Madison defeated his Federalist op- ponent, Charles C. Pinckney, by an electoral vote of 122 to 47.

In its place was substituted the Nonintercourse Act, which banned trade with ports under British or French control but al- lowed it with the rest of the world. Although less disastrous in its effects on American trade than the Embargo Act, the Nonintercourse Act was no more successful in forcing the warring countries to respect American rights. In 1810 it was replaced by a strange piece of legislation known as Macon's Bill No. 2. Macon's Bill temporarily dropped all restrictions on foreign trade, but provided that if France would aban- don her decrees, the United States would re- vive nonintercourse against Britain, and that if Britain would drop the Orders in Council, the United States would revive nonintercourse against France. Napoleon saw in Macon's Bill a chance to trick the United States into action against Britain. In August 1810, his foreign minister sent a letter to the United States min- ister to France offering to repeal the Napoleonic decrees if the United States forced England to respect American rights. Madison failed to see that the condition at- tached to the French offer made it worthless. Not even waiting for the actual repeal of the French decrees, Madison cut off trade with Great Britain in February 1811. Napoleon shortly revealed how little his offer meant when his officials continued to seize American ships trading from Britain to the Continent. Drifting Into War In May 1811, tension between the United States and Great Britain broke out into actual hostilities. An American frigate, the President, cruising off New York, attacked and defeated a small British warship, the Little Belt. American opinion applauded this action as a deserved revenge for the attack on the Chesapeake, while British opinion considered it an act of unpro- voked aggression. Popular feelings were re- flected in diplomacy. The American minister to England left London in disgust and returned to this country. A British minister to the United States continued to serve in Washington, but he was not empowered by his government to offer the United States the slightest concession. The two governments had reached the point where they were, in effect, no longer on speaking terms. Neither the British nor the Americans really wanted war. Hostilities with the United States would distract Britain from fighting its primary enemy. Napoleon, and Canada might be lost. The United States was almost wholly unpre- pared militarily, and in the process of carrying on an extended war, the federal government might go bankrupt. Why a useless and im- wanted war nevertheless broke out in 1812 is a matter of continuing debate among historians. In the nineteenth century the common view was that the \\\\'ar of 1812 was fought for \"sea- men's rights,\" brought on because the British Orders in Council and her impressment of American seamen were intolerable invasions of American rights on the high seas. The dif- ficulty with this interpretation was that the war was most strongly opposed in New Eng- land, where the shipping industry was concen- trated. The people who had suffered most at the hands of the British were the least anxious to retaliate. The most outright support for the war came from the agrarian West and South. This fact led to a theory that the nation was impelled toward war by Westerners eager to end the Indian menace in the Northwest and to satisfy their insatiable land hunger by an- nexing Canada, allied with Southerners anxious to drive the Spanish out of Florida. Those who called the most loudly for a showdown with Britain were a group of yoimg"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"208 Launching the Republic western and southern congressmen, nicknamed the \"War Hawks,\" led by Henry Clay of Ken- tucky and John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. But the \\^'estemers and Southerners together did not have enough votes in Congress to bring a declaration of war. The most votes in favor of war came from Pennsylvania, a state that had no fear of Indian raids and nothing to gain from annexing Canada or Florida. So recently the wheel has come full circle, and historians are coming back to the original idea that the War of 1812 was caused primarily by British im- pressment and by Orders in Council. Americans had become increasingly exasperated by the fact that British cruisers were taking young men off American coasting vessels and seizing ships in sight of our shores. The policy of commercial coercion had apparently failed, so there seemed to be just two choices left: submit or fight. Further submission would be galling to the sensitive pride of a new nation. It would also be confinnation of the opinion we have met before: that republics were by their nature too weak and vacillating to survive in the jungle world of international pohtics. If the United States continued to accept humiliation, there- fore, it would not only be a blot on the national honor, but it would hurt the cause of free gov- ernment everyAvhere. Led by the War Hawks, the Republican majority in Congress finally decided, rather hesitantly, that the country must accept the appalling risks of war rather than allow itself to be pushed around. Declaration of War, June 19, 1812 The War of 1812 would never have been fought had there existed any means of instan- taneous communication, such as the Atlantic cable or wireless. On June 23, 1812, the British government formally revoked the Orders in Council. British har\\ests had been bad and British manufacturers had bombarded Parlia- ment with statements that they faced utter ruin imless the American market was reopened. Jef- ferson's and Madison's policy of commercial coercion was at last effective— but too late. The United States had declared war four days earlier. The vote on the war resolution was 79 to 49 in the House of Representatives, 19 to 13 in the Senate. Thus in neither branch of Con- gress was the declaration supported by t\\vo- thirds of the mem- QUESTION .A Uco- ^ers.

Kno\\\\ledge that the British were even thinking of abandoning the Orders in Council would have held up the vote, and their revocation would have averted war. Tlie declaration of war against Great Britain did not suggest any sort of alliance with France. A proposal to include France in the declaration of war was defeated in the Senate by the close vote of 18 to 14. Madison's Re-election, 1812 In the presidential election of 1812, Madison was opposed by De Witt Clinton of New York, a Republican who broke the New York- Virginia alliance and gained support from the New Eng- land Federalists. Issues were confused because Clinton made appeals to both those who wanted to end the War of 1812 and those who wanted to prosecute it more vigorously. The voting, however, revealed the same pattern as that on the declaration of war itself. Clinton carried most of the northeastern states, but lost in the electoral college 89 to 128. Had he carried Pennsylvania, which he lost by a narrow mar- gin, he would have won the election."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"THE WAR OF 1812 American > British moves moves Bribish blockade. oF 1814 , 2 ) ( Number of ships) X Battle sibes ^ Quebec ^/ CXJ Montreal ' .a^iNt — '^- MICH.

Canada was sparsely populated, and the French Canadians were lukewarm toward their British rulers. The nar- row strip of settlement running up the St. Lawrence and north of Lake Ontario was so close to the United States that it was everywhere subject to attack. Montreal, the strategic center of Canada, was only thirty miles from New York State."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"210 Launching the Republic Yet Canada did not fall, principally because the mibtary forces of the United States were ahnost totally unprepared. The regular army of perhaps 6,000 men was scattered throughout the frontier posts. The top commanders, vet- erans of the Revolution, were too old for warfare. There was no single commanding general and no over-all plan as to how the war should be fought. To make up for the lack of regular troops, Madison called on the states to furnish militia. The result revealed how false was the idea that mihtia could be, as JeflFerson had called them in his First Inaugural Address, \"our best re- liance in peace and for the first moments of war, till regulars may reheve them.\" Some New England governors refused to furnish any troops at all, because they were opposed to \"Mr. Madison's War.\" New York's mihtia re- fused to cross the Niagara River into Canada, maintaining that they had enhsted only to de- fend their state from invasion. Once lured into battle, militiamen were apt to flee, because they lacked the discipline which comes from proper training. The results of this unpreparedness were seen at once. Small but ably led Canadian forces took Detroit and two forts on Lake Michigan. An American attack across the Niagara River was turned back. No serious attempt was made to take Montreal. In 1813 matters improved at the western end of the war zone. Commodore Ohver H. Perry built a small fleet on Lake Erie and won a bril- hant victory over a similar British squadron. This forced the British to abandon Detroit. A force of Kentucky volunteers under Wilham Henry Harrison then advanced into Canada and defeated a British army at the battle of the Thames. In the East, however, incompetent American commanders failed dismally in at- tempted invasions of Canada from Sackett Harbor and Lake Champlain. In 1814 Napoleon was defeated and forced into exile, so the British were able to send much stronger forces to America. From Montreal, in late summer, an army of over 10,000 British veterans advanced southward under Sir John Prevost. This was a stronger force than the Burgoyne expedition of 1777, and was three times as big as the American army barring its way at Plattsburg on Lake Champlain. By this time, however, the rehcs of the Revolutionary War had been weeded out of command posi- tions. In their place were yoimger men who had risen to the top by sheer ability. One of these, General Alexander Macomb, was at the head of the American land forces at Plattsburg, and another. Commodore Thomas Macdonough, commanded a small fleet. Both men handled their smaller forces so well that they repulsed British attacks, inflicting heavy losses. Prevost retreated to Montreal. Attacks on Washington, Baltimore, and New Orleans In 1814 the British sent two other expeditions to America: one to attack Washington and Baltimore, the other to take New Orleans. In August British transports landed an army of about 4,000 soldiers at Chesapeake Bay; it marched overland and took the capital with ease. Five thousand American militia, in a posi- tion to defend the city, ran away after only ten of their number had been killed. The British burned the public buildings of Washington in revenge for similar destruction by American troops at York (now Toronto) in a raid across Lake Ontario in 1813. From the capital the British went on to attack Baltimore, but were repulsed by the forts guarding the city. The British expedition to capture New Orleans did not reach the mouth of the Mississippi until December 1814.

The battle of New Orleans, greatest Ameri- can victory of the War of 1812, was a useless slaughter, for it occurred two weeks after peace had been signed. Again the lack of a trans- atlantic cable affected the course of history. The War at Sea The American navy had not been expected to take much part in the War of 1812. Only five ships were ready for service when hostilities began. Jefferson and Madison had no interest in the navy, and the only vessels built during their administrations were four small ships for the Tripolitan War, plus a number of small gunboats designed for coastal defense. These gunboats were so unseaworthy they had to stow their guns in the holds except in calm weather. The United States had no ships of the line, the counterparts of the modem battleship. In John Adams's administration, however, there had been completed half a dozen excellent frigates, such as the famous Constitution. A frigate was the sailing ship counterpart of the modem cruiser. The American frigates were specially designed to have more fire power than any European ships of the same class and to be fast enough to escape from ships of the line. The Tripolitan War had trained a number of excellent officers, and American crews were composed of volunteers rather than men im- pressed into service. They were especially skillful at gunnery. When war broke out, the American frigates put to sea and within a few months had won an uninterrupted series of '/ictories in duels with individual British vessels. These triumphs had no noticeable effect in weakening British sea power, because the British navy outnumbered that of the United States at least twenty to one. But the British had ruled the sea so long that even a few defeats came as a shock. After reporting one of the American victories, a British newspaper of the day lamented as follows: Can this be true? Will the English people read this unmoved? Any man who foretold such disasters this day last year would have been treated as a mad- man or a traitor. He would have been told that ere seven months had gone by the American flag would have been swept from the ocean. . . . Yet not one of the American frigates has struck. They leave their ports when they choose and return when it suits their convenience. . . . Nothing chases them; nothing interrupts them— nay— nothing engages them but to yield in triumph. On this side of the Atlantic, the naval victories helped to make up for the dismal failure of the war on the northem frontier. In addition to naval vessels, the United States sent to sea more than 500 privateers; they took 1,330 British vessels and made cap- tures within sight of the British coast. Like the frigate victories, their success served to raise American morale and alarm Britain. As the war went on, American success at sea diminished. The British rejoiced when one of their frigates, the Shannon, won a duel with an American frigate, the Chesapeake. What was even more important was that, with overwhelm- ingly superior numbers, the British fleet was able to lay a tight blockade on the entire At- lantic coast. American foreign trade ceased almost entirely, and the American navy was bottled up in port. While the war on land started with disaster and ended in success, the war at sea started with victories and ended in failure. The Hartford Convention, 1814 New England opposed the War of 1812 from the first. The opposition took the form of refusal to send militia to the Canadian borders, of failure to purchase United States bonds issued to cover the cost of the war, and of protests by individuals and public meetings.

Constitution and the British Guerriire (right) was one of the single- ship engagements that demonstrated the fighting ability of the American frigates and their superior gun- nery. This picture is by Thomas Chambers. the latter was a \"Memorial to the President of the United States\" issued by the town meeting of Brewster, Massachusetts, in July 1812. The people of Brewster, hoping that no \"suspicion of treason\" would fall upon them for exercising \"the privilege and duty of free citizens to inquire and judge of pubhck proceedings,\" declared that the war created an \"awful crisis.\" They saw no navy sufficient to protect them, and disliked fighting on the same side as \"the monster\" Napoleon. Above all, they foresaw that the war would be ruinous to themselves: We ask leave in conclusion to state that about three fourths of our townsmen depend on the sea for the means of subsistence for themselves and their families. By the recent declaration of war more than one half of that proportion is liable to fall into the hands of the enemy with a large part of their prop- 214 erty, and many of their \\vives and children may thereby be reduced to extreme poverty. . . . We feel it therefore most strongly incumbent upon us by all lawful and constitutional methods to seek for a speedy termination of the present w£ir. By 1814, prominent New England leaders were ready to discuss separation from the Union. Not only were trade and shipping at a stand- still, but a British force had invaded Maine and occupied several eastern coimties. In De- cember 1814, delegates from the New England states met at Hartford, Cormecticut, to confer on their grievances and recommended action. These sessions were secret.

The Convention insisted, for instance, that southern states no longer be allowed to count three-fifths of their slaves in determining representation in Congress. It urged a two-thirds vote of both houses of Con- gress for admitting new states and for declaring war. The resolutions passed by the Hartford Con- vention expressed the hope that the Union should be preserved \"if possible,\" but there was a strong suggestion that if the war continued and New England's demands were not met, the next step might be an attempt to secede. The Hartford Convention sent commis- sioners to Washington, D.C., to present its de- mands to the President and Congress in person. They arrived at the capital at exactly the time when word came that Jackson had won a great victory at New Orleans and that a peace treaty had been signed. Amidst the great cele- brations attending these events, the commis- sioners had no choice but to return to their homes. The Treaty of Ghent, 1814 A chrious fact about the War of 1812 was that almost from the moment it began, both sides tried to end it. Great Britain had no wish to be diverted from fighting Napoleon. The United States would have stopped fighting at once if Great Britain had agreed to stop impressment.

Ghent, Belgmm. fought, what would have . t i lo.i r™ been different in American ^^ J\"'y l^^^\" ^^ history? American dele- gation included three very able men— John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and Albert Gallatin. It was well that this was so because it was something of a diplomatic triumph for them to persuade the British to accept a peace treaty that simply restored the situation before the war. The Treaty of Ghent contained not a word about neutral rights or impressment. Not a square mile of territory changed hands. The warring nations simply agreed to stop fighting, to restore previous boundaries, and to put other problems off to future settlement. Signed on Christmas Eve, 1814, the treaty was imanimously ratified by the Senate when it reached Washington, D.C., in January 1815. On the face of it, the War of 1812 was a useless and foolhardy adventure. The Americans risked foreign invasion, loss of territory, bank- ruptcy, and disunion, but failed to gain any of the purposes for which they fought. Yet the war also brought benefits. When in 1816 Henry Clay was challenged in Congress to say what the United States had gained by it, he replied: What is our present situation? Respectability and character abroad— security and confidence at home. If we have not obtained in the opinion of some the full measure of retribution, our character and Constitution are placed on a solid basis, never to be shaken. The Americans had regained confidence and self-respect. They soon forgot their dissensions and defeats and remembered only their vic- tories. The disgraceful flight of the militia en- trusted to defend Washington was forgotten, while the successful defense of Baltimore is celebrated in our national anthem, \"The Star- Spangled Banner.\" Probably a hundred people know of \"Old Ironsides\" to one who knows of the successful British blockade. Perry's victory on Lake Erie and Jackson's at New Orleans were added to Bunker Hill, Saratoga, and Yorktown as stimulants to American patriotism. It is not surprising that the War of 1812 was followed by a period in which men con- sciously strove to strengthen the American nation."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Activities: Chapter 8 For Mastery and Review 1.

In American history, a generally accepted part of the fable has been that 1815 marked a turning point. But what, it may be asked, was so special about the year 1815? Did Americans suddenly and collectively turn their backs on Europe? Were they ever in fact \"free of foreign entanglements\"? Were they not still part of an At- lantic community being drawn ever closer together as steamships replaced sailing ships, as wheat from the Dakotas and pork from Indiana began to feed Liverpool and London, and as an ever-increasing flood of European Immigrants poured into American ports? And yet the fable that a great change had started in 1815 was itself a fact. Americans thought they were isolated from Europe; indeed, they congratulated themselves upon it. The millions of immigrants seeking a new life in America often strengthened American isolationism because they sought to escape from their past. It took two world wars in the twentieth century to shock Americans out of the belief that with the close of the Napoleonic Wars the United States had no further need to concern itself with European politics. Or consider the myth that men make history while women wash the dishes. History books have so consistently left half the human race out of account that Henry Adams remarked, \"History is useful to the historian by teaching him his ignorance of women.\" The very word \"pioneer\" conjures up the picture of a man in coonskin cap and leather jacket armed with a rifle. But as you trace the march of the frontier from the Appalachians to the Pacific, remember that there were women pioneers too. Left to himself, the man on the frontier often went savage — witness his treat- ment of the Indians. It was the women who turned cabins into homesteads, planted flowers outside the doors, and put curtains in the windows. It was usually the mothers and schoolteachers who transmitted to the next generation the heritage of the past. It was, nevertheless, a man's world Insofar as men could make it so. By law, the husband legally ruled the wife. Rigid taboos dictated women's clothing and freedom of action. Small wonder, then, that some brave women demanded equal rights with men and started a revolution that continues to the present (see p. 282). The embattled feminists who met at Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848 appealed to the principles and used the phrases of 1776. Thus, each generation must find new uses for the Declaration of Independence, or it too could become a fable."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 Forces for Union and Disunion In war we are one people.

Instead, it was a struggle between men and their environment— the conquest of eastern forests by the axe, of the prairies by the plow, of vast distances by canals, steamboats, and railroads. Lured by the promise of a better life, millions of Europeans came to America, and within America the people were on the move.

Most Americans traded wiih people of their own localities or with foreign nations. But during the nineteenth century, various developments growing out of the industrial revolution tended to tie the United States together economically.

At the time of the French Revolution, it inspired the French not only to resist foreign invaders, but to embark on a career of conquest that subsided only when Napoleon lost an army in the snows of Russia in 1812. In the nineteenth century, it was the spirit that turned Germany and Italy from geographical expressions into nations. In the twentie th century, nationalism has inspired s(^es _of colonie.s_ to_hreak the bonds of imper- ialism and to declare their independen ce. Nationalism is not easy to define, because it is a complex matter and its characteristics vary from country to country. More a matter of emotion than of reason, jt is a compound o f bp1if»fc Inyijltjes^ and traditions. It expresses itself in literature and song, as well as in sym- bols such as the Statue of Liberty and the Stars and Stripes. It expresses itself in action: 'To have done great things in the past and to wish to do more of them are the essential conditions of being a people.\" Nationalism in the United S,tatg s is bound up _with the beljef expr essed i n the De claration nf TpdffpRn'^p\"^^ that men can create for themselves a great society based on freedom, equality, and human brotherhood. The \"Era of Good Feelings\" The War of 1812 provided a stimulus to American nationalism. It revealed the dangers of disunion and at the same time promoted a sense of self-confidence and pride. Albert Gallatin, a former member of JeflFerson's cabinet who had been one of the commissioners at the Ghent peace conference, described the new spirit in a letter written only a few months after the close of hostihties: The war had renewed & reinstated the National feelings & character, which the Revolution had given, & which were daily lessened. The people . . . are more American: they feel & act more as a Na- tion, and I hope that the permanency of the Union is thereby better secured. For four or five years_afterj he JTreaty ofGhent, national sentiment was so much stronger than before that the period is commonly called the \"fira of Good Feelings.\" The leaders of the Federalist party had never overcome their scorn for the mass of people, and the people in turn were less and less disposed to choose Federahsts for public oflBce. Now the party was so discredited by its connection with the New England secession movement that it dis- appeared from the national scene. In 181 6 James Monroe, Republicancandidate for Presi- denl7 was elected over Rufus_King^ his Feder- alist opponent, by ^^3'''votes to 34.

NATIONALIST LEGISLATION Postwar nationalism was revealed not only in election results but in legislation. The war had shown that the Jefferso nian ideal of a ^ central government with strictly limited func- tioiis~failed~t5 meet the needs of the country in crisis. The result was that during the two years after the close of hostilities a Congress dominated by Jefferson's Republican party passed a series of laws that might have been ^written by Alexander Hamilton.

The notes of the B-UrSr-had-iieen-a^universally^aceepted^ia- tional currency. Now the country, lacking sufficient specie for metallic currency, had to fall back on notes issued by banks chartered by the different states. These, state bank notes were generally accepted only in the locality where they were issued. Thus it was almost impossible for a citizen of Kentucky, say, to send money to Boston. Meanwhile, himdreds of new banks were started, many of them without sufficient capital and some of them downright dishonest. With- out a .central bank, the federal government had a hard time borrowing during the War of 1812 and sometimes could not pay its troops. \"More than once the paymaster of the army was unable to meet demands for sums so triffing as thirty dollars.\" Under these circumstances the very men who in 1811 had opposed the rechart er of the ondJBank_o£-the-JInited States.

Once the war was over, goods from Britain flooded the American market at prices so low that they threatened to put American manufacturers out of business. Con- gressmen now reread Hamilton's \"Report on Manufactures\" and found its arguments more persuasive than they had been in 1791. Al- though protection would mean that American consumers would pay more for clothing, pots, pans, and plates, this seemed simply the price of securing economic independence from Great Britain. Although there was opposition to protection, especially from northeastern shipping interests and southern agriculturalists, support for higher tarifi^s came from all sections of the country. The tariff was expected to bind the country together, for the manufacturing sections would sell their goods to the agricultural sections and buy food from them. Also, every section still had hopes of becoming a manufacturing area. In 1816 a tariff law was p assed, levying duties averaging over 20 per cent on foreign manu- factvu'es. The War of 1812 had revealed the need for a better transportation system, since it had proved extremely diflBcult to move armies, with their baggage and cannon, from one place to another. There QUESTION • The gover- nor of Georgia in 1827 complained that wheat from central New York sold for less in Savannah than wheat from central Georgia. How could this be so? were many who felt it was the duty of the fed- eral government to improve trans- portation. In 1816 John C. Calhoun 'oF South carohna presented to the House of Representatives a bill to set aside for the building of roads and canals the $1,50 0,000 that the private owners of the Bank~ofthe United States had paid for their charter. In a speech in support of the so- called Bonus Bill, Calhoun said. Let it not be forgotten, let it be forever kept in mind, that the extent of our republic exposes us to the greatest of all calamities, next to the loss of liberty, and even to that in its consequences,— dis- union. We are . . . rapidly— I was about to say fear- fully—growing. . . . Let us, then, bind the republic together with a perfect system of roads and canals. Let us conquer space. The Bonus Bill passed both houses of Congress, but President Madison vetoed it. He argued that to spend money improving transportation was an unconstitutional extension of federal power. ROADS AND WATERWAYS Calhoun was undoubtedly correct when he argued that the United States had a crying need for better transportation.

The so-called turnpike-gra lasted from about 1790jQ_182Q, During this period, hundreds of miles of roads were constructed by state- chartered private companies that charged tolls. These toll roads were called turnpikes because they were barricaded at intervals by piked poles which held up the traveler until he paid his fee. They turned out to be^rofitable only in the East, where traffic was heavy, or on main routes such as that from Albany to Lake Erie. Western highways were therefore generally con- structed by the states themselves, at times with the aid of federal funds. Although by 1840 th e coimtrv wa.s criss- crossed~^wlth roads Jtiieywere in many ways an unsatisfactory means of transportation. Except in the East, few of them were surfaced or haH adequate bridges. In woods, the stimips were likely to be cut low to 12 or 18 inches but not removed. In swampy places, there was \"cor- duroy\" (logs laid sidewise), which hurt horses' legs and jolted wagons to pieces. Roads were^ vitally useful for men on horseback, for families traveling west with their belongings, and for 1 men who herded cattle and hogs to market. But i bulky goods could not be profitably transported long distances by land. Inland Waterways and Steamboats Far more important for moving products such as grain, coal, dressed beef, barrels of pork, and bales of cotton were inland water- ways. Throughout much of the nineteenth century, rivers were used for transporting goods to an extent which today seems almost unbe- lievable. This was true not merely on great rivers like the Ohio but on quite small streams.

Flat-bottomed steamboats were developed which, it was claimed, could navigate on a heavy dew. Actually, some of them drew less than two feet of water. Profits were high, but risks were great. The average life of a river steamboat has been variously es- timated as from three to six years. The high mortality is not surprising when one takes into account the danger from snags, ice, bursting boilers, collisions, fires, and sand bars. So great were these dangers that many boats were de- hberately built to last only a short time— which, of coiurse, increased the risks. Almost as important in their day as the river systems were the thousands of miles of canals built during the first part of the nine- teenth century.

He was inconsistent in his principles; he was overbearing in manner; he sometimes failed to show gratitude to his supporters; and he was an intriguer who often made the mistake of being found out. Yet he was also a great public servant. His principal claim to fame is that both as a private j^y t:^i' 1 citizen and as governor of New York he was the man most responsible for per- ^ -I , suading the people of his state to undertake the digging of the Erie Canal. Clinton had a true and prophetic vision of what the canal would mean to the nation and to his city. In 1825, as the great work was nearing completion, he wrote: As an organ of communication between the Hudson, the Mississippi, and the St. Lawrence, it will create the greatest inland trade ever witnessed. The most fertile and extensive regions of America will avail themselves of its facilities for a market. All their surplus productions, whether of the soil, the forest, the mines, or the water, their fabrics of art and their supplies of foreign commodities will concentrate in the city of New York, for transportation abroad and for consumption at home. . . . And, before the revolution of a century, the whole island of Manhattan, covered with habitations and replenished with a dense population, will constitute one vast city. Along the great waterway there developed other prosperous cities, although less huge than Manhattan; Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester, Albany, Utica, Rome. Life on the canal became the subject of many songs. The verse of one of them, sung in a minor key, gives a sense of the slow pace of the mules hauling the boats: I've got a mule and her name is Sal, Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal.

Running from Albany on the Hudson River to Buffal o on Xaice Erie, the canal was 3t)3 miles long. It averaged 40 feet wfde and 4 feet deep. In an age when concrete, dynamite, and structural steel had not yet been invented, the labor that went into the canal was prodigious. The 'l)ig ditch\" itself had to be dug entirely by men with shovels and scoops drawn by draft ani- mals. The stone to face the 83 locks had to be • cut and set by hand. At Rochester, the canal was carried across the Genesee River by an aqueduct over 800 feet long. Several reservoirs and many miles of feeder canals were needed to insure a steady supply of water. The Erie Canal was an immediate success. It lowered from $100 to $8 the cost of carrying a ton of goods from Buffalo to New York City. It made New York the_ greatest -porfr-tn ihe^ country and upstate New York for a time Amer- ica's~Tnosf prosperous agricultural region. The Erie Canal started a craze for canal- building. Faced with competition from New York, Pennsylvania completed in 1834 an ex- traordinary system of canals and portage rail- ways connecting Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. At the highest point in this route, canalboats were hauled over a ridge 2,326 feet above sea level! Ohio went deeply into debt to build over 500 miles of canals connecting the Ohio River and Lake Erie. Before the canal boom collapsed in the late 1830's, it saw at least 10,000 miles of canals either built or being built. ( See map, p. 229.) In ter ms of the n atjop, the most im portant effect of the Erie^ Canal was th at it connected the Northeast a nd the \"Old Northwest\" (see map, pp. 174^^75).

Later, this became a po- litical alliance. ' THE NATIONALIST DECISIONS OF JOHN MARSHALL The nationalism of the period after the War of 1812 was also revealed in a series of decisions by Chief Justice John Marshall interpreting the Constitution. Marshall, appointed by the last Federalist President, John Adams, had always stood for the basic Federalist ideas— defense of the rights of men of property, distrust of de- mocracy, and strengthening the power of the federal government. Although by 1815 the ma- jority of the Supreme Court justices had been appointed by Republican Presidents, Marshall still dominated the Supreme Court. He was a man not only of strong convictions but of such great friendliness and persuasiveness that, ac- cording to one historian, he \"moulded his fellow judges like putty.\" During his 34 years as Chief Justice, Marshall found himself in a minority on only one case. He composed the majority of the decisions, and they were written with such clarity that a layman could understand them. Marshall was a magnificent debater. Once admit his premises and you were lost. Jefferson once said that when conversing with Marshall he"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Boston Athenat'um John Marshall, through his judicial decisions, played a greater part in shaping American government than any other man, with the possible exceptions of Wash- ington and Madison.

I can't tell.'\" Implied Powers and Loose Construction McCulloch V. Man/land (1819) involved an attempt by Maryland to tax the Baltimore branch of the Bank of the United States. The case brought out basic questions about the or- igins and powers of the federal government. Was the Constitution created by the states or by the people of the United States? Marshall argued that \"the people\" acting collectively had created the federal government. It is, he wrote, \"the government of all; its powers are delegated by all; it represents all, and acts for all.\" It is thus a national government and in no way sub- ordinate to the states within its sphere. But what was its sphere? This brings up the next question: Was the federal government to be held strictly to its enumerated powers? In answering this question Marshall simply paraphrased Hamilton's argument in favor of the constitu- tionality of the first Bank of the United States (see p. 160). As long as the purposes of a law are constitutional, he wrote, it is the right of the federal government to choose any obvious means. The purposes of a central bank— to con- trol currency, to assist in borrowing money and collecting taxes— are stated in the Constitution. The Bank was clearly adapted to carry out these purposes. Therefore the Bank was con- stitutional. This was an eloquent statement of implied powers and loose construction (see pp. 121-123). Having established the constitutionality of the B.U.S., Marshall finally considered whether Maryland had the right to tax its operations. Arguing that \"the power to tax is the power to destroy,\" he said no. If a state could tax one agency of the federal government, it could tax any other— the mails, the courts, the custom houses— and so make it impossible to carry on government at all. This was the weakest part of the decision. The Chief Justice's comparison of the B.U.S. to the post ofiBce was not accurate. The former was a profit-making corporation, mostly owned by private individuals; the latter was part of the executive department. The true issue was not the fact that Maryland taxed the Bank, but the degree— was the tax so unreason- ably high as to put the Bank out of business? This part of the McCulloch v. Maryland decision has been overridden by the Supreme Court in the twentieth century."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Forces for Union and Disunion 233 Protection of Property Rights Dartmouth College v. Woodward (1819) was one of several cases in which Marshall laid down decisions protecting property rights from interference by state legislatures. In 1815 the New Hampshire legislature had attempted to alter a charter granted to Dartmouth College by George III in 1769. Under the new charter a new set of trustees was elected, and the college was put under stricter state control. The old trustees, however, did not resign, and the former oflScials refused to turn over the college records and funds. When the case came before the Su- preme Court, Marshall wrote a decision in which he supported the original charter. He argued that a charter was a contract with which a state had no right to interfere (see Article I, Section 10, clause 1, p. 122). Much of American business is carried on by corporations receiving charters from state legislatures. The Dartmouth College case, called the \"Magna Carta of the corporation,\" helped to free business from at- tempts by state legislatures to alter the terms under which it might operate. Expansion of Commerce Clause Gibbons v. Ogden (1824) involved an at- tempt by New York to grant Robert Fulton and men associated with him a monopoly of all steamboat trafiBc on the Hudson River and other New York State waters. Marshall declared this monopoly unconstitutional. He argued that in granting such a monopoly New York invaded the power of the federal government over inter- state commerce. In the course of this decision, he produced definitions of interstate commerce which have been of great importance in in- creasing federal power, especially in the twen- tieth century. Marshall said that interstate commerce was not just the exchange of goods Vut included a wide variety of interstate re- / lations. It is under this interpretation that the federal government has come to exert control over all sorts of activities which seem remote from com- merce—radio, television, kidnaping, the protec- tion of migratory birds, and so forth. MarshaU maintained that whatever affects interstate com- merce may come under federal control. Thus the federal government may exert control over a dam on a stream which runs into a navigable river which eventually crosses a state line. Criticism of Marsliall; His Influence In the three cases mentioned, and in a num- ber of others, the Supreme Court overrode the actions of state legislatures, and also the deci- sions of state courts. Thus the Court became a means whereby the federal government in- creased its power over the states. Marshall was naturally attacked by defenders of states' rights. He was also branded as an enemy of democ- racy. It was pointed out that the state legisla- tures which taxed the Bank of the United States, altered the Dartmouth College charter, and granted Fulton a monopoly were all elected by the people of their states and presumably acted in accordance with what the people wanted. Marshall had been appointed in 1801 by a Pres- ident already repudiated by the voters. When Andrew Jackson was President, he once simply refused to carry out one of Marshall's decisions. Yet in the long run Marshall triumphed. His great decisions became the law of the land. His nationalist, loose constructionist point of view, written into constitutional law, made the Con- stitution flexible enough to meet the ever- changing needs of a growing country in its passage from the horse-and-buggy age to the twentieth century.

There was a naval race on the Great Lakes. On Lake Ontario the British built a vessel carrying the amazing total of 112 guns, and in answer the United States started to build two ships of the line. From Maine to Oregon the boimdary between the United States and Canada was unsettled. Fortunately, there were influences that worked for peace. Each country was the other's best customer: industrial Britain provided a market for American raw materials, and agrar- ian America was an outlet for British manufac- tured goods. Xeither coimtry had anything to gain by renewed hostihties. The British foreign minister. Lord Castlereagh, was of the opinion that there were no two states \"whose friendly relations are of more practical value to each other, or whose hostilit>' so inevitably and so immediately entails upon both the most serious mischiefs.\" Under Castlereagh's leadership, Brit- ain again and again took action to smooth out Anglo-American relations. For instance, the British ended all assistance to Indian tribes in United States territory south of the Great Lakes, and they allowed Stephen Decatur to use Gi- braltar as a naval base for his ships operating against the Barbary pirates. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams It was fortu nate, tO Q, that John Oivmcy Adams served as United States minister to Brit- ain in 1815-1817 and as Secretary of State under President Monroe from 1817 to 1825. Son of John Adams, he had already spent eighteen years abroad in the diplomatic service. From the time he started his college studies at the Uni- versity of Leyden in Holland at the age of thirteen, he had shown great ability and an amazing capacity for work. He knew five foreign languages. An intense patriot and strong na- tionalist, Adams looked forward to the day when the United States would dominate the entire North American continent. As minister to England, Adams started nego- tiations leading to the famous Rush-Bagot Agreement of 1817.

On the other hand, foreign trade boomed when the goods of the United States, a neutral, were in demand in warring Europe. and Britain agreed to lay up all armed ships on the Great Lakes, built or building, except for a few small vessels to control smuggling. Its importance should not be overemphasized, since it did not end fortification of the border and either party could withdraw from the agreement at any time. It was, however, the first example of mutual naval disarmament in history, and eventually the United States and Canada removed all fortifications along the 3,000 mile boundary from the Bay of Fundy to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Cobvention of 1818 A year after the Rush-Bagot Agreement came the Con vention of 18 18, dealing with fish- eries, the northern boundary of the Louisiana Purchase, and Oregon (see map, p. 236). In regard to the St. Lawrence, this treaty tried to specify where United States fishermen might sink their lines and nets, and on what shores crews might land to dry and cure their catch. It fixed the northern boundary of the Louisiana Purchase by running the 49th parallel from the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains. Be- yond the Rockies, the treaty provided \"joint occupation\" of Oregon for ten years. This meant that each country was free to carry on the fur trade and make settlements without interference from the other. Thus the Oregon question was not settled but deferred for later decision. It was an achievement to make these treaties with Britain within three years of the close of the War of 1812, at a time when public opinion in each country was antagonistic to the other. The Rush-Bagot Agreement and Convention of 1818 did not settle all disputes. The Maine boundary, for instance, was still unclear.

With Great Britain he arranged the Convention of 1818, dealing with Oregon, the Canadian-U.S. boundary, and fishing rights. He also induced Russia to withdraw from Oregon to the 54° 40' line. The Florida Question and tiie \"Transcontinental Treaty,\" 1819 Florida had been a cause of friction between the United States and Spain ever since the purchase of Louisiana in 1803.

By 1813 the United States had seized the disputed territory. Buring the War of 1812, Spain was an ally of Great Britain. Florida therefore became a base of British and Indian operations against the United States. Even after the war, it re- mained a base for Creek and Seminole Indians who were on the warpath against the whites in Georgia and Tennessee.

(See pp. 32(K321.) Angry protests from Spain followed. The Spanish government demanded an indemnity for the \"outrage\" and punishment for Jackson. A majority of Monroe's cabinet at first thought Jackson should at least be censured, but John Quincy Adams defended him, saying his ac- tions were a result of Spanish failure to keep order in Florida. Spain must either govern it efficiently or cede it to the United States. Too weak to police or to defend Florida, Spain gave in. In 1819, by the Adams-Onis Treaty, the United States gained Florida and in return agreed to pay claims- of American citi- zens against Spain, up to $5,000,000. Also called the \"Transcontinental Treaty,\" this agreement fixed the \"step boundary\" from the Gulf of Mexico northwest to the 42nd parallel and along that line to the Pacific. This meant that the United States abandoned a shadowy claim to Texas, while Spain gave up a claim to Oregon as strong as our own. The Adams-Onis Treaty has been called with justice \"the greatest dip- lomatic \\ictor>' won by a single individual in the histor}' of the United States.\" THE MONROE DOCTRINE The last great event of John Quincy Adams's term as Secretary of State was the issuance of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823. This famous state- ment of foreign policy had a rather complex background. It involved events in Latin Amer- ica, in Europe, and on the Pacific coast of North America. Between 1814 and 1824, many of Spain's South American colonies declared independence under the leadership of two great heroes, Simon Bolivar, \"the Liberator of the North,\" and Jose de San Martin, \"the Liberator of the South.\" \"Spectacular as were George Rogers Clark's e.xpedition to the West and Washington's march to Yorktown,\" it has been observed, \"they rep- resent but short walks compared to Bolivar's slow advance to Peru through more than two thousand miles of towering mountains.\" Even more amazing was San Martin's expedition across the Andes from the Argentine, when he led an army of 5,000 across mountain passes over 12,000 feet high. By 1823 Mexico and Cen- tral America had also declared independence from Spain. The people of the United States were enthusiastically on the side of the revolu- tionaries, who declared their right to rule them- selves as Americans had done in 1776. Sympathy for the Spanish Americans was increased by events in Europe. After Napoleon had been finally defeated in 1815, Europe was dominated by the monarchs of Russia, Prussia, Austria, and France. Determined to \"make the world safe for monarchy,\" these rulers were tied together in the Quadruple Alliance, popularly although mistakenly called the \"Holy Alliance.\" One purpose of this alliance was to suppress democracy wherever it might appear. In the words of Klemens von Mettemich, the Austrian prime minister, democracy was \"the disease which must be cured, the volcano which must be extinguished, the gangrene which must be burned out with the hot iron.\" The rulers de- clared the right to intervene in other countries to suppress liberal revolutions. In 1821, Austrian soldiers put down revolutions in Italy. In 1823 a French army crossed the Pyrenees into Spain and quelled a rebellion there. Fear of European Intervention After their success in crushing democratic movements in Europe, some leaders of the Quadruple Alliance talked of attempting the same thing in the Western Hemisphere.

Once relieved of Spanish commercial restric- tions, the new Latin-American republics threw open their ports. This was an advantage to Britain, which had the largest merchant marine in the world and the cheapest manufactured goods. If the Quadruple Alliance returned these republics to Spanish rule, Britain would suffer loss. George Canning, successor to Castlereagh as British foreign minister, also feared that France might take advantage of an opportunity to re-establish a colonial empire in America. He therefore hoped to discourage intervention to suppress the young republics. He also desired to promote better relations between the United 'fj States and Britain. In August 1823, he suggested , to Richard Rush, United States minister in ^ London, that they issue a joint statement to the effect that they thought Spain could not recover NA,' her colonies, that they opposed acquisition of 1 them by any other power, and that the United States and Great Britain would not acquire any ,> portion for themselves. The extraordinary prop- osition almost amounted to setting up an Anglo- American alliance, and Rush referred the ques- tion to Washington for decision. ^ Greek Rebellion; l^ Russian Expansion in North America ^\\^ At the time of these events, there also arose two other situations that disturbed relations between the United States and European pow- ers. In 1821 the Greeks rebelled against their Turkish masters, demanding independence. For eight years they carried on a heroic war against their oppressors. The Greeks won great sym- pathy in this country, because they were Chris- tians and because they claimed descent from the heroes of classical times. Throughout the United States, churches collected money and arms for Greece. Some young Americans talked of raising a volunteer army to fight the Turks. There were demands that the federal govern- ment aid the rebels. This helped to promote popular enthusiasm for ancient Greece, with significant effect on American culture. This was seen in the Greek revival movement in American architecture, in the founding of Greek letter fraternities in colleges, and in literature (see Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"To Helen\"). In 1821 Russia, already in possession of Alaska, made an aggressive move on the Pa- cific coast. The czar proclaimed that his domin- ions extended south to the 51st parallel, far into Oregon. He warned all non-Russian ships to stay over a hundred miles away from the region he claimed. In the latter part of 1823, therefore, the United States was faced with a number of difficult decisions in foreign policy. Should the United States allow Russia to expand her hold- ings in North America? Should the United States aid the Greeks? How should the United States meet the threat of intervention in Amer- ica by the Quadruple Alliance? Should the United States accept Canning's offer of co- operation or act alone? Monroe discussed these questions with his cabinet and consulted his fellow Virginians, Jefferson and Madison. The former Presidents favored Canning's proposal for a joint state- ment with Britain. But John Quincy Adams remarked that it would look ridiculous for the United States \"to come in as a cock-boat in the wake of the British man-of-war.\" He urged that the United States act independently, and his .view prevailed. Principles of the Monroe Doctrine Out of these discussions came the Monroe Doctrine. This landmark in foreign policy was presented to the world in an undramatic way. It appeared in two widely separated passages in Monroe's annual message to Congress on De-"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Forces for Union and Disunion 239 cember 2, 1823. It contained four essential pro- visions—two warnings and two reassurances. (For the text of the Monroe Doctrine, see pp. 802-803): (1) Hands off the American republics. The political system of the allied powers is es- sentialh' different . . . from that of America. . . . We . . . should consider an\\' attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemi- sphere as dangerous to our peace and safety. \"The political system of the allied powers\" means the system whereby countries are domi- nated by kings and noblemen. \"That of America\" refers to self-governing repubUcs, like the United States and most of the new Latin- American countries. This statement denies to European countries any right of intervention in the Western Hemisphere. (2) No new colonization in the Americas. . . . the American continents . . . are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future coloniza- tion by any European powers. This was directed at Russian expansion into Oregon. This \"no colonization\" principle, as ap- plied to the whole Western Hemisphere, origi- nated with John Quincy Adams. It is now broadened, so that it forbids transfer of col- onies in the Western Hemisphere from one European power to another. \\\\'hen in 1940 Germany conquered Denmark, for instance, the principle was invoked to prevent the Danish territory of Greenland from coming under Ger- man rule. (3) Existing European colonies are in no danger from the United States. With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power we have not interfered and shall not interfere. While objecting to new colonization, the United States reassured European countries as to their existing colonies. This applied especially to the fertile island of Cuba, still under Spanish rule. Many Americans, with John Quincy Ad- ams, expected Cuba to fall into the hands of the United States eventually, \"like a ripe apple,\" but this statement was designed to allay British fears that immediate annexation was planned. (4) No participation by the United States in purely European affairs. In the wars of European powers in matters relating to themselves we have never taken any part, nor does it comport with our policy so to do. It is only when our rights are in\\'aded or seriously menaced that we resent injuries or make prepara- tions for our defense. . . . Our policy in regard to Europe, which was adopted at an early stage of the wars which have so long agitated that quarter of the globe, ... re- mains the same, which is not to interfere in the in- ternal concerns of any of its powers. This meant specifically that the United States would send no aid to the Greeks in their war with the Turks and that the United States would take no action to prevent intervention by the Quadruple Alliance in European countries. These sentences have a far wider significance, however, than their particular meaning in 1823. They are a restatement of the isolation and non- entanglement principles laid down in Washing- ton's Neutrality Proclamation of 1793 and in his Farewell Address, as well as in Jefferson's First Inaugural Address. Not until the t\\ventieth century, when the United States had become a world power, were these principles altered.

Obviously, then, the Monroe Doctrine owes its importance to later developments. Its bold warnings to European powers became important only when the United States was able to back them up without reliance on British sea power. Latin-American nations have never shown much enthusiasm for the Monroe Doctrine. This may seem odd when the doctrine was appar- ently designed to protect them. But in fact the doctrine was unilateral— it was a one-sided state- ment of the interests of the United States. While it asserted that Latin-American countries were to be protected from European aggression, they were not consulted. Furthermore, the doctrine did not protect our southern neighbors from intervention or expansion by the United States itself. V"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Forces for Union and Disunion 241 SECTIONALISM In most countries there are centrifugal or divisive forces working against the spirit of nationahsm. They take a variety of forms: tribahsm and language differences that handi- cap many African states; antagonism between classes, such as that between the bourgeoisie, the peasants, and the proletariat in nineteenth- century France; or religious strife, such as that between Hindus and Muslims in India, or be- tween Roman Catholics and Buddhists in Viet- nam. During the early years of the United States, the most obvious counter to nationalism was sectional rivalry. By the 1820's it was clear that the three major sections— the Northeast, the South, and the \"Old Northwest\"— were following different lines of development. Manufacturing plants were multiplying in the Northeast. The South was doubling its production of cotton every ten years. The Northwest was the home of inde- pendent farmers who raised crops on land they themselves cleared and put under the plow. Regional differences led to regional loyalties. A recent historian claims, perhaps with some exaggeration, that these loyalties were stronger than national patriotism: By the close of the 1830's every one-horse planter in the cotton belt, every coonskin-clad farmer along the western waters, every shopkeeper in the smoky mill towns of New England, was blindly loyal to the region where he lived. This spirit of sectional patriotism alone allowed Ameri- cans to place regional interests above those of the nation. Manufacturing in the Northeast In the long liistory of civilization from the building of the Egyptian pyramids three thou- sand years before the birth of Christ until the eighteenth century, there was little important change in men's tools or sources of power. Then came the industrial revolution. This has changed the way men live, especially in Europe and America, more in 200 years than it changed in the previous 5,000. Basically, the industrial rev- olution has consisted of three developments: ( I ) the substitjitiQn.--of~GOHij>licai£d_machines for sirnpkLJiaruLtOols; (2) the substitution- of arti- ficial sources of power, such as the steam engine andTelectric motor, for natural sources of power such as draft animals and falling water; and (3) the invention of faster, more efficient means of transportation and communication. The industrial revolution began in England. Between 1730 and 1800, new machines trans- formed the cotton industry. So great was the efficiency of mechanical means of spinning and weaving that cotton cloth, formerly a luxury, became the cheapest textile the world had ever seen. With the great improvements made by James Watt, the steam engine began to supply a tremendous new source of power for industry and transportation. For a time the industrial revolution was almost a British monopoly. Brit- ain enjoyed certain advantages over the rest of the world: among them were established markets, mechanical skills, and surplus capital to build factories. British laws, furthermore, forbade the export of textile machinery or the emigration of skilled workmen. The Textile Industry Tlie new technology reached America with the arrival of the Englishman Sarnuel_Slater in 1789. Before coming here. Slater had mem- orized the details of the best English textile machinery. Within a year he built machines that were set up in a factory in Pawiucket, Rhode Island.

In over two centuries of wresting a living from an unpromising environment in a harsh climate, New Englanders had developed traits that made the term 'Tankee\" a synonym for ingenuity, thrift, and hard work. Unable to meet the com- petition from newly cleared, more fertile farm regions in the West, many Yankees moved to factory towns. By 1840, some 700 cotton mills and 500 woolen mills in New England employed about 50,000 workers. There were also many small factories turning out products such as shoes, clocks, carriages, and paper. All this was, however, just a beginning. There were in the region as many people engaged in shipping as in manufacturing, and even more engaged in farming. In the Middle Atlantic states— Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York— manufacturing took hold even more than in New England. The new transportation system opened western markets, and European immigrants suppUed much cheap labor. There were textile factories in this region, although not as many as in New England. The area was the great center of the iron industry and of the manufacture of machinery. Early Effects of the Industrial Revolution The beginnings of the industrial revolution had several important effects: (1) Existing cities, such as New York and Philadelphia, grew rapidly; at power sites new cities appeared, such as LggeU and Lawrence at falls and rap- ids on the Merrimac River. (2) TTiere was a great demand for better transportation to carry food and raw materials to the cities and manu- factured goods to markets. (3) The cities pro- vided new markets for farm products. ( 4 ) There"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Forces for Union and Disunion 243 appeared two new classes of people— the indus- trial capitalists and the industrial laborers— those who built and ov\\'ned the factories and those who worked in them. In the handicraft age, the master worker who owTied a shop sat at the same bench as his journeymen and ap- prentices and dressed as they did. Now o\\vners and workers performed distinctly different func- tions; they no longer worked together daily; they led dissimilar lives. Their differences in dress became symbols that are still understood today: a top hat and frock coat designate a capitalist; a cap and overalls, a factory worker. (See also p. 286.) The profits from manufacturing and ship- ping in the Northeast were great. Much of the money went back into the businesses, but much of it also went into banks in the larger cities. The bankers of Boston, Philadelphia, and New York in turn made investments all over the country. They lent money to speculators in western lands, to companies building Mississippi River steamboats, and to Alabama cotton pro- ducers. Thus the country began to be tied to- gether by a web of credit. Cotton Culture in the South The British industrial revolution affected the South even more than New England, although in a different way. As British cotton mills pro- duced cheaper and cheaper goods for a world- wide market, they demanded more and more raw cotton, most of which came from the south- em states. It was the cotton_ginjnvented_by_Eli_Whit- ney in 1133, which made it possible to produce cotton cheaply in the South. In cotton as it is harvested from the fields, the fibers are so tightly fastened to the seeds that a hand laborer could get rid of the seeds in only one pound of cotton per day. Whitney's machine, operated by hand, could clean fift\\' pounds a day; unth water power, a thousand pounds. Change in the Southern Attitude Toward Slavery British demands for cotton and the inven- tion of the cotton gin changed the southern attitude toward slaver^'. In the late eighteenth century the only part of the South where slave labor paid its way was in the rice fields of South Carolina and Georgia. Elsewhere, planters were \"slave poor\" because they owned slaves but could make little profit from their labor. Slaves were usually less efficient than free laborers. Having no incentive to work hard, they re- quired continual supervision. They had to be fed and clothed in seasons when there was no \\\\ork to do. As we have seen, many Southerners, in- cluding Jefferson, Washington, and Patrick Henry, publicly condemned slavery. In 1787 Southerners supported the Northwest Ordi- nance, which prohibited slavery north of the Ohio River. In 1808 they supported the aboli- tion of the slave trade at the earliest date al- lowed by the Constitution. Southern planters were perplexed, however, as to what to do with slaves after they were freed. Many of the Negroes would be helpless, particularly if not given land, tools, and training in how to hve on their own. To meet this situa- tion, slaveowners in Virginia, Maryland, and Kentucky founded the American Colonization Society to send freed slaves back to Africa. Among the early members were James Mad- ison, Andrew Jackson, and Henry Clay. In 1819 Congress appropriated $100,000 to support the project, and in 1822 the society founded the republic of Liberia ('land of freedom\") on the west coast of Africa as a haven for American Negroes. But the society lacked funds to send more than a few thousand Negroes back to the continent from which their ancestors came.

Africa, and few had any desire to leave this country. Meanwhile, cotton culture proved ideally suited to the use of slave labor. The operations- planting, hoeing, picking, and ginning— were simple and required little training. Most of the work was done in gangs and so could be easily supervised. Cotton growing occupied the Ne- groes more continually than other crops, such as wheat or tobacco, so they did not have to be supported through any long periods of idleness. Thus slavery became profitable. South- erners began to change their attitude and to defend slavery. Criticism of the institution died out. In 1827 there were over a hundred anti- slavery societies in the South; ten years later all had disbanded. Since the cUmate of the upper South was unsuited to cotton growing (see map, p. 9), cotton first was a major crop in South Carolina and Georgia. Cotton plantations moved rapidly west into the fertile \"black belt\" of Mississippi and Alabama and then into the rich bottom lands along the Mississippi River and its tribu- taries. The admission into the Union of the states of Mississippi in 1817, Alabama in 1819, and Arkansas in 1836 revealed this migration. The rapid expansion of cotton culture was not merely the result of the increased demands of British mills. It also came from the fact that planters often sowed one cotton crop after an- other until they had \"mined\" the fertility from the soil and had to move on. It was cheaper to migrate than to restore fertihty."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Forces for Union and Disunion 245 Cotton was not the only important southern crop. Virginia, Kentucky, and North Carolina produced tobacco. Louisiana produced sugar. Everywhere farmers raised com, wheat, hogs, and cattle. Still, \"Cotton is king\" was a common southern saying; it was the greatest export, not only of the South, but of the nation. The institution of slavery, which had been abolished in the North, made southern society unique. The characteristics and effects of slav- ery in the South will be discussed in a later chapter ( see pp. 331-334 ) . SufiBce it to say now that the South developed something like a caste system. At the top were a few great planters, owning 50 to 200 or more slaves and cultivating the best land. Below the great owners was a class of small planters who generally made a rather poor living. Then there was a large group of small farmers raising diversified crops. This group often fared rather well, especially in regions unsuited to cotton growing. At the bottom of the white social scale was a class of impoverished white people, some of them on the move and others just managing to live on exhausted soils for which cotton growers had no use. At the bottom were the Negroes. All but a few were slaves, and nearly all performed heavy labor or menial tasks. There was little manufacturing in the South. There was no such readily available labor sup- ply as in the Northeast because whites disliked factory labor and Negroes were not thought to be fitted for it. Furthermore, the money and credit of wealthy men were tied up in land and slaves, so there was little surplus capital available for building factories or buying ex- pensive machinery. Rapid Settlement of the Northwest \"All America is moving westward,\" wrote a British traveler who passed through Pittsburgh in 1816. The census of 1820 revealed that one- quarter of the population of the United States bved west of the Appalachians. Even more rapid than the settlement of the Gulf states was that of the Northwest. Settlement of this region had been slowed up until after the War of 1812 because of the dan- ger from Indians. The result of the war had been to break up Tecumseh's Indian league and to put an end to British support of the northern tribes. After the defeat of the Sauk chieftain Black Hawk in 1832, the Indians were driven west of the Mississippi. Many who first came to the Northwest de- scribed it as a paradise on earth. The Ohio, they wrote, was truly \"the beautiful river\" if only because of the magnificent hardwood trees- oak, maple, ash, chestnut— along its shores. The forest was occasionally broken by clearings where the grass grew four and five feet high in the rich soil. The amount of game was almost unbelievable. There was an abundance of deer, bear, duck, turkey, goose, and partridge. A sin- gle flock of pigeons might take four or five hours to fly over a spot, and when they alighted they were so tame they could be slaughtered by men armed only with clubs. Fish were no less plenti- ful. A party fishing at a waterfall on the Mau- mee River in Ohio in the 1830's filled 850 barrels with walleyed pike and bass. Cheap Land But the greatest lure of the Northwest was vacant land. According to the English econ- omist and novelist Harriet Martineau, who made an extended tour of the United States in the years 1834 to 1836: The possession of land is the aim of all actions, generally speaking, and a cure for all social evils, among men in the United States. If a man is dis- appointed in politics or love, he goes and buys land. If he disgraces himself, he betakes himself to a lot in the West.

Land was everywhere cheap. Many settlers did not even bother about survey lines and \"squat- ted\" on whate\\er unoccupied acres they could find. So the settlers poured into the Northwest. From the South came independent farmers and impoverished whites anxious to get a\\\\'ay from slavery and the plantation system.

Eventually, Europe supplied a third stream of immigrants, who often landed at New York and traveled west by the Erie Canal.

Killing the trees by \"girdling\" ( cutting the bark all around at the base ) in order to let in the sun, he would plant a crop of com. He might also raise a few razorback hogs, which would be al- lowed to run practically wild in the woods. For the rest, he lived on game. In longer-settled areas, the farmer \\\\ould probably build a frame house. He would then raise more varied crops- wheat, cattle, vegetables, and fruit— and acquire cash by sending his products to market. Growth of Towns and Cities But the fanner alone did not develop the West. He could not prosper entirely by his own efforts. He needed sawmills for his lumber and flour mills for his grain. He needed barges and wagons to carry his produce to market, mer- chants to buy it, and storekeepers to pro\\dde the goods he could not make himself, such as glassware, shoes, lamps, and iron tools. Such people, as has been pointed out earUer (p. 86), gathered in towns usually situated at points of transshipment. Among these were Cincinnati (near where three tributaries pour into the Ohio River), Louisville (at the Falls of the Ohio), and Nashville (at the head of steam navigation on the Cumberland River). Manufacturing sprang up in such cities. The showpiece of Cincinnati at one time was a combined flour and textile mill run by a steam engine. This \"stupendous pile\" of stone and brick reached the then amazing height of nine stories. The largest manufacturing center, how- ever, was Pittsburgh. Here were glass factories, which in 1815 produced glassware worth $235,000. Even more important were Pitts- burgh's iron works. In western to\\\\'ns, men could often make money more rapidly than on the farms. Skilled workers such as masons and wheelwrights were so scarce that they demanded, and got, high wages. Manufacturers could charge high prices because the demand for their articles was al- ways increasing and because the cost of trans- porting goods across or around the Appalachians acted as a sort of tariff, raising the price of east- em goods. Western towns offered such prospects of wealth that selling lots in future cities became a standard way for speculators to fleece suckers. Glo\\\\'ing descriptions of towTi sites were satir- ized in a southern editor's imaginary prospectus of the \"Cit>' of Skunksburgh\": This charming place ... is situated . . . not far from the junction of Pitt's main branch, and a West- em fork called the Slough, which runs in the rainy season, and washes the confines of Famsworth's lower hog pens. ...

A man was judged by what he could do for himself— how well he could handle an a.xe, slaughter a hog, or plo\\\\' a fur- row. Equality was not a theory stated by philos- ophers, but a fact of life. \"Into all activities was carried the practice of democracy, whether politics, law, military, or religious life. The judge could leave his bench, and return to his plow; the preacher from pulpit to stable work.\" With equality went democracy. WTiereas in the original thirteen states voting rights had depended on ownership of a certain amount of property, in the QUESTION • Equality West this was re- and democracy— do they placed by man- necessarily go together? hood suffrage— the right of all adult males to vote. In the older states, voters had usually chosen for office their \"betters\"— men of wealth and social position; in the West, they elected men like themselves. When young Abe Lincoln started making his way in Illinois pol- itics in the 1830's, part of his success as a vote- getter was the result of his skill in wrestling, handling a scythe, and splitting rails. Points of Sectional Conflict Of the different sections here described, each had its own prevailing attitude on four major issues— public land policy, a protective tariff, in- ternal improvements at federal expense, and the extension of slavery into the territories. The questions involved in these issues and the at- titudes of the sections may be summarized as follows: ( 1 ) Public land policy. Should lands be offered to settlers at a low price or a high one? Should they be opened to settlement rapidly or slowly? Should \"squatters,\" who occupied lands before they were opened for sale, have any rights to the land they farmed? Western frontier farmers naturally favored cheap land, rapid settlement, and \"squatters' rights.\" Eastern man- ufacturers were opposed to such policies for fear the West would draw off their labor supply. Eastern farmers were often opposed to cheap western lands for fear of western competition. Southerners were divided on this issue. Planta- tion owners wanted lands opened rapidly to sale, but were opposed to \"squatters' rights\" because the squatters might get to the best lands first. ( 2 ) A protective tariff. Should there be high tariffs to protect United States industries? Or should there be a low tariff which would allow foreign goods to come in cheaply in exchange for American agricultural products? North- eastern manufacturers and laborers naturally favored protective tariffs that would keep out foreign goods, or at least raise the prices for the consumer, so that American factories could compete successfully in the American market. As Southerners came to realize that their section was not to become a manufacturing region, they turned more and more against the system of protection. The high tariff caused them to pay more for manufactured goods, but they received no benefit from it. Furthermore, they felt they would get a better price for their cotton from Britain if the British could sell more goods in this country. Surprisingly, the Northwest, a farming region, was the section most com- pletely in favor of protection. The explanation for this apparent contradiction is that the West- erners thought that the growth of industrial cities would increase the market for farm products. Protection might encourage manu- facturing west of the Appalachians, and revenue from the tariff might be used for building much- needed roads and canals. The American pro- tective system also included high tariffs on cer-"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"250 The Nation and the Sections tain staples grown in the West, such as wool from Ohio and hemp from Kentucky. ( 3 ) Internal improvements. Should the fed- eral government spend money to build roads and canals, or at least help states and private companies to build them? The Northwest was overwhelmingly in favor of using federal money for such purposes because it needed roads and canals to get its goods to market and yet had very httle cash. The South, with a fine river system, was opposed. Southerners also feared that such schemes would be used as an argu- ment to keep up tariffs in order to obtain more money for the federal government. The North- east generally favored internal improvements at federal expense, partly because the tariff might have to be kept high to pay for them. (4) Extension of slavery into territories. Should the territories be closed to slavery on the model of the Northwest Ordinance? Or should slaveowners have the right to take slaves with them into the territories, just as they might take cattle or horses? Since cotton culture demanded the expansion of the plantation system into new lands and apparently depended on slave labor, Southerners insisted that they be allowed to take their slaves with them anywhere but into the free states. Opposed to the southern attitude were northern convictions equally determined. Many Northerners felt that slavery was a moral wrong. While agreeing that southern states had a right to maintain slavery where it already existed, they felt it should not be allowed to expand. Another argmnent against extending slavery, especially strong in the Northwest, was that the territories should be reserved as an area where poor men could go and estabhsh farms for themselves. Wherever slavery existed, the free laborer and small farmer did not fare well. Plantation owners took the best lands, and manual labor was scorned as the occupation of slaves. These conflicting sectional interests became the major problem of national pohtics. It was the task of politicians to find means of compro- mise in order to save the Union.

But the area closed to the future expan- sion of slavery was far greater than the area that might be occupied by slaveowners (see map, p. 255). The free states had been allowed this advantage partly as a result of a mistaken notion that the prairie region west of the Miss- issippi was unfit for human settlement. When Southerners realized that this region was not \"the Great American Desert,\" they began to de- mand the annexation of Texas. The Missouri Compromise stood untouched for over thirty years.

Two of these \"favorite- sons,\" ' ^^ Henry_ dav of Kentucky and Andrew Jackson o f Tennessee ^ came from the West. John Quincy Adams found his strongest support in his native New England. William H. Crawford of Georgia represented the old South. A fifth candidate, John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, stood aside and ran for the vice-presidency.

The presidential campaign of 1828 was a dirty one, although neither Jackson nor .John Quincy Adams had any part in the mud slinging.

America n C o n gress_ £aUed by Bolivar, Congress delayed ^ctign_Jintilit was too late for tHe Unit ed States to be repre seate J While Adams's opponents were doing every- thing possible to discredit him, he refused to play politics on his own behalf. He could have strengthened his following by discharging Jackson supporters from federal jobs and filling their places with men faithful to him. This he scorned to do. He could not win support by personal charm, for it was a quality he lacked. He wrote of himself, \"I am a man of reserved, cold, and forbidding manners.\" Observers agreed with this estimate. Adams's strict Puritan code of propriety prevented his answering op- ponents publicly. He let off steam by confiding his exasperations to a voluminous diary, and by going for long swims in the Potomac River, accompanied only by his Negro servant.

Adams was strong only in New England, where he won all but one electoral vote. Jackson swept every southern and western state except Maryland and Dela- ware; he also carried Pennsylvania and gained a majority of the electors in New York. %i 4 257"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"258 The Nation and the Sections Although the campaign itself had been trivial and disgraceful, this election was one of the most important in American history.

There was a higher t\\am-out of voters in the presidential election of 1828 than in any since 1812, when people were much worked up over continuance of the war with Britain. Now the interest was apparently in two strong candi- dates. Since Jackson's presidency roughly coin- cided with various democratic reforms, such as manhood suffrage, his election became a sjTnbol of the growing power of the common man in pohtics. ANDREW JACKSON: THE MYTH AND THE MAN During his lifetime, Andrew Jackson was such a controversial figure that it was diffi cult to find the truth behind the slanders of his enemies and the extravagant praise of his admirers. Ac- cording to James Parton, his first important biographer, the evidence could be so inter- preted as to show Jackson to have been both \"a patriot and a traitor.\" \"He was,\" \\vrote Parton, \"one of the greatest of generals and wholly ig- norant of the art of war. A writer brilliant, elegant, eloquent, without being able to com- pose a correct sentence or spell words of foin syllables. ... A democratic autocrat. An urbane savage. An atrocious saint.\" Anti-Jackson car- toons generally showed him either as a profane yokel with an ungovernable temper or as \"King Andrew\"— 'Tdng\" then having the same impact as \"tyrant\" today. Jackson's friends emphasized his humble birth. Bom in a log cabin on the North Carohna frontier, he had lost both par- ents at an early age, and had made his way to fame by his own exertions. He thus became the visible evidence that American institutions threw open \"to the humblest individual the avenues of wealth and distinction.\" In his own time, indeed, Jackson became somewhat of a mythical figure. Thus George Bancroft, a New England historian who was also an ardent Democrat, wrote of Jackson's entrance into the presidential office: Behold, then, the unlettered man of the West, the nursling of the \\vilds, the farmer of the Hermit- age, little versed in books, unconnected by science* with the tradition of the past, raised by the will of the people to the highest pinnacle of honor, to the central post of republican freedom, to the station where all the nations of the earth would watch his actions— where his words would vibrate through the civilized world, and his spirit be the moving-star to guide the nations. \"A Gentleman and a Soldier\" The Jackson myth obscures many facts about him. His lack of education, for instance, has been much exaggerated. He could read at the age of five and by the age of eight had de- veloped a passion for maps. Possessed of as much legal training as John MarshaKr he had a successful career as a lawyer and judge in Tennessee-He^ought 28 schotafly' Dooks on various aspects of law on a single trip to Phila- delphia. He enjoyed reading history and sub- scribed to as many as twenty newspapers at one time. 1 \"Science\" here means knowledge of any kind obtained by- systematic study."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Jackson's early life had been notable for violent personal quarrels. He took part in five duels, killing a man in one of them. In such actions, however, he simply reflected the vio- lence of the frontier. As he grew older, both his temper and his actions became milder; by the time he reached the White House, he had be- come a person of dignity and natural courtesy. A visiting Englishwoman who saw him on the way to his inauguration wrote that \"in spite of his harsh, gaunt features, he looked like a gentleman and a soldier.\" Jackson regarded himself as a \"gentleman\" and was so regarded by his Tennessee neighbors. On the frontier only gentlemen, for instance, fought duels with pistols; others used fists or knives. Jackson dressed ejegantly, owned as many as 30,000 acres at one time, and kept a stable of fine horses.

On the Tennessee frontier, he was noted for his uprightness in business matters. There is no doubting his sincerity when he said of his actions as President, \"I do precisely what I think just and right.\" His sense of personal loyalty to family, friends, and followers was very strong. So was his loyalty to the Union. He had served the United States in the Revolu- tionary War at the age of thirteen and had successfully defended New Orleans against a British attack in the War of 1812. When as President he faced a threat of disimion, he was willing to take up arms again to save the nation. JACKSONIAN DEMOCRACY As the time for Jackson's inauguration ap- proached, his admirers poured into Washing- tcm. Men slept five or six in a bed; when no more beds were to be had, they spent the night on sofas, billiard tables, and floors. Seized vvith a fear approaching panic, conservatives thought of Rome being overrun by hordes of Goths and Vandals. John Quincy Adams left Washington rather than attend the ceremony that might mean the end of the repubhc. A typical reaction was that of Daniel Webster, senator from Massachusetts : Gen. J. will be here abt, 15 Feb.— Nobody knows what he will do when he does come. . . . My fear is stronger than my hope. Although it was feared that Jackson would try to make political capital out of his military career, he refused a military pageant. Instead, he followed Jefferson's precedent of walking to the inaugural ceremony. His hands shook as he read a rather cautious and colorless inaugural address. What happened later, however, seemed to justify those who had gloomily predicted that Jackson's election meant the reign of \"King Mob.\" From the Capitol he rode on horseback to the White House, surrounded by a cheering throng. There, a reception had been prepared for invited guests and important officials only. There was no means, however, to prevent the crowd from pushing in. Chairs and china were broken; women fainted. The press around Jackson was so great that he had to be helped to escape through a back window. The crowd was induced to leave the presidential mansion only when big bowls of punch were placed on the lawTi outside.

One way to make government re- spond more directly to popular will was to increase the number of elective offices. This development did not affect the federal govern- ment, but at the state and local level positions formerly appointive— such as judges, constables, and public surveyors— vv^ere thrown open to election.

His veto messages, worked over by able newspaper editors, were designed more to persuade voters than congressmen. His great power as President thus came principally from wholehearted sup- port by the majority of the people, who regarded him as one of their own. Unhappy Lot of Negroes and Indians Jackson jan democrac y had nothing to offer two alreadyo ppressed minor itiesj_the^Negrqe£ and the Indians. In^ the South, criticism of slavery became increasingly unusual, and those who made it suffered unpopularity and even physical danger. In the North, the Negro was now free, but usually as a second-class citizen. When states instituted manhood suffrage, the vote was often extended only to white men. The Missouri debates had shown that the slav- ery issue was so explosive that a pohcy was in- stituted that has been called \"the great silence.\" Serious discussion of slavery as a national po- litical issue was taboo. From 1836 to 1844 anti- slavery petitions to Congress were automatic- ally \"laid on the table\"— that is to say, ignored. Abolitionist literature was often barred from the mails. As tothelndians, the Jackson and Van Buren administrations ruthlessly pursued the policy begun by Jefferson: cemovalto territory west of the Mississippi. Twenty thousancT Cherokees, for example, were forced to move from their homes in Georgia to what is now Arkansas and Oklahoma. It is estimated that 4,000 of them died on the way because of starvation, disease, and exposure. By 1840 the few Indians still living east of the Mississippi had been herded into reservations, except for the Seminoles, some of whom managed to hold out in the swamps of Florida. TARIFF AND NULLIFICATION CONTROVERSIES The protective tariff of 1816 did n ot prove _ to be high enough to satisfy Am erican manu - facturers. In response totheir demands, duties orTTftiported manufactures (and on some raw materials as well) had been raised twice more, in 1824 and 1828. These laws aroused increas- ing resentment in the South, especially in South Carolina. That state was declining in prosperity as rich cotton lands farther west came into production. Instead of blaming natural causes, however, South Carolinians tended to attribute all their ills to the tariff. When the news of the Tari ff of 1828 (called by its enemies the \"Tariff ZjJ^^Sbominations\" ) reached Charleston, there was violent indignation. Flags were hung at half-mast; college students resolved to buy no northern goods; and there was talk of leaving the Union. But South Carolina held back from formal action against the TarifTof^Aboininations because John C. Calhoun, the leading politician of the state, had aligne d hi mself w ith Andrew Jackson and had run for Vice-President on tKe Democratic_ ^epublic arntcket~in 1828. It was hoped^hat CalhounV influence in the Jackson administration might result in tariff reduction. Calhoun's Theory of Nullification South Carolina did, Jiowever, make its op- position_toIlhe--proteGtiiie_,system known when in 1828 its legislature published a document known as the \"South Carolina Ex position . \" Al-"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"264 The Nation and the Sections though unsigned, it was generally known to have been written by Calhoun. As a strong nationalist, Calhoun had supported the Tariff of 1816, calling protection \"a new most power- ful cement\" to hold the Union together. By 1828 he had changed his point of view to that generally held in his native state: a protective tariff was \"unconstitutional, oppressive, and im- just.\" But what could a state do to defend itself against a law passed by Congress and signed by the President? Calhoun's answer to this problem was to revive the theory of nullification that had been first suggested in the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions \\\\Titten by Jefferson and Madison (see p. 185). He expanded the theory, however, to a degree that the original authors never dreamed of. Calhoun's argximent may be sutmmarized as follows: The federal government was created by a \"compact\" (contract) between the individual states, whereby each state gave up only such powers as were expressly granted in the Con- stitution (especially in Article I, Section 8). If the federal government exceeded these powers, it was no use to seek justice from the Supreme Court, because the court was itself a branch of the federal government. Instead, each individual state had the right to decide whether or not a federal law was constitutional. If the state decided in the negative, it might declare that law null and void within its own borders. Be- hind nullification lurked the threat to secede from the Union.

They hoped for sup- port not only in the South, but in the West, Scene in the Senate as \"Black Dan\" Webster made his famous speech in reply to Hayne of South Caro- lina.

Foot of Connecticut, representing eastern manufacturers worried about losing their labor supply, had suggested that a limit be put on land sales. When Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri angrily at- tacked Foot for promoting the interest of his section at the expense of the pioneer farmers of the \\\\'est, Hayne supported him. In a wide- ranging, confused debate covering several days, northwestern and southern senators attempted to win ^^'estemers to their side of various public questions. Eventually Hayne and Daniel Web- ster of Massachusetts engaged in a full scale dis- cussion of nullification, with Vice-President Cal- houn presiding. Webster's political career had followed a course exactly opposite to that of Calhoun. Cal- houn had been a W'ar Hawk who had helped to bring the United States into the War of 1812; Webster had reflected the feeling of New England against the war, even to the extent of flirting wiXh. nullification of federal laws calhng for raising troops.

A man of imposing presence (it was said no man could be as great as Webster looked!), the senator from Massachusetts was also the greatest orator of his day. In his \"Second Reply to Hayne,\" his greatest oration, he pointed out that in practice nullification could only mean the end of the Union. The Union, sai d Webst er, was not a creature of the~states: ifwas the peo- ple's government. \"We the people\" had forged a national government for oiu- own welfare and meant it to endure. The greatness of Web- ster's speech lay in his, use of American patriot- ism to support the idea of a Constitution flexible enough to meet the needs of a growing country'. His audience was not so much the Senate as the people at large. Thousands of copies of the speech were published, and hun- dreds of schoolboys for the next thirty years declaimed the closing paragraph depicting the blessings of union and horrors of disunion, with the famous final words: \"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!\" Jackson Versus Calhoun Which side would Jackson take in the argu- ment oyerjiullification?

One point of disagreement involved a ridiculous dispute in Washington society. Mrs. Calhoun was one of the leaders of a fem- inine plot to exclude from oflBcial parties the wife of the Secretary of War, John H. Eaton. Jackson, whose own wife had been the object of unfair gossip, took the side of Mrs. Eaton. The extraordinary result of this \"Peggy Eaton af- fair\" was the creation of a serious division in Jackson's administration, based on whether the cabinet members and their wives were for or against the lady involved. Another reason why Jackson turned against his Vice-President was his discovery that Calhovm, while Secretary of War in Monroe's cabinet, had wanted to have Ta ckson censured for his acti onsj n Florid a. Be- lieving Calhoun to be disloyal, Jackson broke with him entirely. The South Carolinian re- signed from the vice-presidency in 1832.

JACKSON'S WAR ON THE BANK At the time that the question of nullification was coming to a head, Jackson was also engaged in a dramatic struggle with the Bank of the United States. Chartered in 1816, the \"B.U.S.,\" as it was nicknamed, was a useful institution. Its functions were the same as those of the orig- inal Bank of the United States: it performed much of the financial business of the country and controlled the supply of currency. ( Be sure to refer back to pp. 160-161 for an explanation of these functions. ) Popular Feeling Against Banks and Monopolies In spite of its usefulness, the Bank had many enemies who called it such names as \"the Mon- ster,\" \"the Octopus,\" and \"the Mammoth of the East.\" Opposition to it came from many sources and was motivated^ fey^^xiifferent reasons. Banks chartered by '^tatelegislatures^ tended to be ^^n<it tKp jrf^sT kirnp1y\"Tieraii.<!e it was a pow- erful competitor and because it undertook to prevent state banks from lending too freely or issuing tOQ_many bank notes. Another group, mostly aarmers^ were against all banks. They thoughOhat the only 'Tionest\" currency was \"hard money\"— specie. It was the farmers, they felt, who created \"real\" wealth— com, hogs, grain, cotton, tobacco— and who were somehow made to pay tribute to those who controlled \"paper\" wealth, such as mortgages and bank notes. \"The hard earnings of the industrious farmer,\" said an Ohio newspaper, \"are arrested [wrested] from his hands by a horde of swin- dlers employed by the banks.\" Still another element in opposition to the Bank was a rising feeling against monopohes of every sort. Althoughthe_Bank of the United S tates was \"SO'p er-eenfr u wuei Pb y priv a te in di- viduals, it enjoyed a monopoly o£_alLgOYern-^ menFbuIinessrStafe legislatures granted some- what similar monopohes to state banks, and also made monopoly grants to companies run- ning toll bridges, steamship hnes, and turnpikes. Feehng against this sort of exclusive privilege was especially strong in the East among work- ingmen and businessmen. Monopolistic charters created, it was said, \"an artificial inequality of wealth\" and \"forced the great body of working people\" to \"give over hope of ever acquiring any property.\" It should be noted that there was no element here of opposition to capitalism or to"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"268 The Nation and the Sections free enterprise as such. It was just that no arti- ficial barrier should stand in the way of a man's chance to acquire wealth by his own efforts. It was part of the creed of Jacksonian democ- racy that Americans should be allowed to give free rein to their \"almost universal ambition to get forward.\" Jackson's Attitude Toward the B.U.S. Jackson's personal attitude toward the B.U.S. was typical of many Westerners. jJe was a \"hard money\" man who distrusted all banks anT ^TlljaTreniione ynfe-had^gnce lost afanost~ his entire fortune and had gone into debt for twenty years because notes accepted from a Philadelphia merchant turned out to be worth- less. The fact that the stock of the B.U.S. was mostly owned by wealthy men of the Northeast who had supported Adams for President surely did not endear the institution to Jackson. For the first three years of his presidency, however, he took no action against the Bank save to express the opinion that it had too much power. Friends of the Bank finally drove Jackson into action. In the summer of 1832, ^enfy.£lay jtrgsentedjii^Con gress aJ wti-tO-give the_Rant a flew charter, even though the old one did not run out until 1836. Clay, a candidate for the presidency, hoped to embarrass Jackson by forcing him either to sign a bill he disliked or to veto it, and so give Clay an issue for the coming presidential campaign. The Recharter Bill passed Congress and was sent to the Pres- ident. Shortly after it reached his desk, Jackson remarked to his closest advisor, \"The Bank, Mr. Van Buren, is trying to kill me; but I tvill kill it.\" He vetoed the recharter and with his veto sent to Congress a message which showed little knowledge of banking but great understanding of why many people disliked the B.U.S. The Bank, wrote Jackson, favored the few against the many; it made \"the rich richer and the potent more powerful.\" It was un-American, be- cause more than a quarter of its valuable stock had been purchased by foreigners. It was an overextension of federal power, because the Constitution nowhere exphcitly granted the fed- eral government the right to estabhsh a central bank. (For a discussion of the constitutional argument, see pp. 162-163.) lien.^M835 In the presidential election of 183 ^ Ja ckson' ran for a second term as the candidate oitner Democratic party, a label that has remained unchanged to the present, fila^an as a National Republican. There was also a strange third party in the field, the Anti-Masonic. This short- lived organization would now be forgotten ex- cept that it invented a new means of proposing candidates for the presidency. Prevaously, nom- inations had been made either by state legisla- tures or by a meeting of party members in Congress, the so-called caucus. In neither of these methods were the people consulted. The Anti-Masons conceived the idea of electing a Tiatioaak:: ^nven tion to choose their candidate. Theprocedure was immediately imitated by the Democrats and National Repubhcans, and has been followed ever since. As Clay had hoped, Jackson's veto of the Recharter Bill made the Bank the principal issue of the 1832 campaign. The National Re- publicans accused Jackson of \"appealing to the worst passions of the uninformed part of the people and endeavoring to stir up the poor against the rich.\" They produced sober argu- ments to show the value of the Bank to the nation's finances. But the bank issue boom- eranged. It hurt Clay and helped Jackson, whose veto message had appeared to place him on the side of the mass of the people against foreigners and wealthy Easterners. The Democrats in any case did not answer National Republican argu- ments but traded on Old Hickory's great popu- larity. When the returns were counted, they"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"showed that Jackson had won an overwhelming victory. He received 687,000 popular votes to Clay's 530,000, and carried the electoral college by 219 votes to 49. Destruction of the Bank Jack son took his re-election as a deman d frOi nTliepeople th at he destroy the power of th e B.U.S. at once, even though its charter did not run out until 1836. Although by law the funds of the federal government were deposited in the Bank, Jackson resolved to remove them. This required an order from the Secretary of the Treasury. Jackson had to ask two Secretaries of the Treasury to resign before he found a third who would give the order. Federal money was then gradually withdrawn from the vaults of the B.U.S. New-fiinds from taxation and land sales were - placed in strpng-sta^e banks, called by Jackson's enemies vpet_banksj\" The removal of the deposits caused a great outcry among Jackson's opponents, who branded the action as unconstitutional. It was, said one of them, the deed of \"a detestable, ignorant, restless, vain and malignant tyrant.\" Nicholas Biddle, president of the Bank, claimed that removal of the deposits forced him to call in its loans and stop lending. Putting this policy into eflFect, Biddle created such a scarcity of credit that hundreds of businessmen were driven into bankruptcy and scores of banks failed. Factories closed down and workmen were discharged. At first all this was blamed on Jackson. Business- men sent petitions urging him to save the country from depression. The President replied, \"Go to Nicholas Biddle!\" Eventually, Biddle's actions backfired: if one man at the head of a private institution could drive the country into depression, then Jackson was right in saying the Bank had too much power. Biddle backed down and started to lend freely again, and pros- perity returned. In 1836 the the Bank charter expired. Jackson had won. The Library of Congress Jackson was a rich source for cartoorts. Above, a car- toonist of the opposition shows him as a king, tram- pling on the Constitution and ruling by veto. Com- pare this cartoon with the cartoon on page 186. The immediate effects of destroying the Bank of the United States were unforttmate. It had provided the coimtry with a stable cur- rency and had kept state banks from lending too freely. With the B.U.S. out of power, there was no check on local banks. Hundreds of new ones were chartered by state legislatiires, and the number of bank notes quadrupled. The 1830's saw a period of feverish speculation in land. Land speculators had httle trouble in per- suading local banks to lend to them, and sales of public lands rose from 4 million acres in 1834 to 20 million acres in 1836. All this helped to cause a disastrous panic in 1837."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"270 The Nation and the Sections \"Free Banking\" On the other hand, Jackson's victory over the Bank turned out to be a victory for free com- petitive enterprise. Before this time, state legis- latures were in the habit of granting special charters to banks and business concerns, and these charters often carried with them monopoly rights and special privileges. Such arrangements denied opportunity to other businessmen. Jack- son's success in the war on the Bank encour- aged a movement toward \"'free banking that had begim in NewTYoj kJSt^^aii 1829.

The purpose~'was~to allow business concerns to get ahead on the basis of real eflBciency rather than on their ability to persuade legislators to grant them special favors. Looking at Jackson's presidency as a whole, it should be noted that although he was a man of great personal force and dynamism, and al- though he greatly increased the power of the presidency, his essential mission was a negative one: to reduce the sphere of the central gov- ernment. He put the \"American system\" in re- verse. During his administration the level of the protective tariff was reduced, less and less federal money was spent on internal improve- ments, and the central bank was destroyed. AH this reflected the laissez-faire philosophy that the Jacksonians inherited from Thomas Jeffer- son. The role of government was simply \"to restrain men from injuring each other\" and 'leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement.\" RISE OF THE WHIGS During Jackson's second term his opponents formed a new party called the W higs, a loose co ghtion of .R ational R epubljcans^nd a variety of other political factions_oppQsedjto_Andrew Jackson. \"Talang thelr~name from the English party that in the eighteenth century had re- sisted the power of the crown, they fought the extension of presidential power effected by \"King Andrew L\" ^Ilieit_^incipal leaders were Clay and Webster. Election of 1836 AsThe election of 1836 approached, Jackson used his dominating position in the Democratic party to pick his successor. His choice fell upon ^i artin Van Buren. a New.J^rk politician whom his enemies called \"the-Eox^because he had a reputation of craftiness. His followers empha- sized his humble birth in a small town by calling him \"Old Kinderhook.\" Abbreviated to \"O.K.,\" this nickname became part of American speech, meaning \"all right.\" The Whigs were so divided they could not agree on a candidate. Instead, they nominated three \"favorite sons\" in the hope that among them they would get enough support to prevent Van Buren from getting a majority in the electoral college. If this happened, the election would be thrown into the Whig-contioUed House of Representa- tives. But Jackson's continuing popularity and the general prosperity were enough to give the Democrats the election. Van Buren gained 170 electoral votes against 124 for all his opponents"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"combined, but his majority in the popular vote was small. Panic of 18^ raf3Tynad Van Buren taken office when the country was hit by one of the most severe depressions in American history, the Panic of -1837. Banks_and-busine ss house s_closed_their loors; thou sands of farmers lost their farms iroughjnortgageZfoScIosures; there~~was al- most total unemployment among eastern factory (workers; and work on canals and the new- fangled railroads almost ceased. The depression had various causes. As has already been shown, the 1830's saw tremendous land speculation. Once Jackson had crushed the Bank of the United States, there was no means to discourage banks from lending money to speculators. At the same time, the states borrowed money QUESTION • A curious feature of the Panic of 1837 was that so much money disappeared from circulation that it was al- most impossible to transact business except by barter. Why? through bond is- sues to build roads and canals. By 1835 the fed- eral government had paid off the national debt. In 1836 it started dis- tributing surplus funds to the states as loans. This encouraged still more reckless schemes for internal improvements. The indebtedness piled up by states and individual speculators outran the power of the country to produce wealth. The Specie Circular It was Jackson himself who pricked the speculative balloon by an executive order knovwi as the Specie Circular, issued in 1836.

To be sure of having specie on hand for depositors, stronger banks began to call in loans, and weaker banks faUed. Anotlier push toward the depression came from Great Britain, whose banks at this time were the world's greatest source of credit. At- tracted by high rates of interest in the United States, British investments in this country grew from $66,000,000 in 1835 to $174,000,000 in 1837. So much money was going abroad that the Brit- ish became alarmed and began to call back their loans. In this way a vicious spiral began. A London bank would call on a New York bank for repayment of a loan. The New York bank might then call upon a New Orleans cotton broker for money owed, and the broker in turn on a cotton planter. The cotton planter, along with hundreds of others, would dump his cot- ton and slaves on an already glutted market to get cash. This in turn drove down the prices of cotton and slaves."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"272 The Nation and the Sections Partly because of the lack of a telegraph system or an Atlantic cable, the depression took some time to develop. When at last it hit, it almost completely paralyzed business. So many banks had failed that bank notes were not trusted; those who had gold and silver hoarded them. Consequently, stores closed, crops were unsold, and workers fought over the meager relief which city governments provided. Independent Treasury System, 1840 Today, faced vdth such a crisis, the people would demand action by the federal govern- ment, and the federal government would take strong measures to try to pull the country out of the depression. In the 1830's, however, a de- pression was regarded as an act of nature like a drought or a hurricane. According to the pre- vailing laissez-faire philosophy, it was not the function of the federal government to do much about it. Van Buren emphasized this in his in- augural address in which he said that \"all com- munities are apt to look to government for too much.\" His one great legislative effort was to try to get the federal government entirely out of banking. He shared Jackson's horror of a great central bank like the B.U.S., but depos- iting federal funds in the \"pet banks\" had also proved a failure. The money had often been used to promote speculation, and some of the banks had gone bankrupt in the panic. Now Van Buren proposed the Independent Treasury System.

Jndepend ent Treas- ury Ac t was finally passed in 1840. \"Log^CabuT Campaign of 1840 le W higsNJooked forward to the election of 1840 with confidence, even though they were so divided on major issues that they did not even try to write a platform. JJieir campaign plan was simple: ^ininate a militaiy~h5rQ. and attack Van Buren. FortKeiTpfesidential candi- date they passed over the x?^ leaders of the party and chose General vVilham Hen7y~Har- '^soiv-^hose principal attractioiT^^S'as'that he had fought Indians at the battle of Tippecanoe. Harrison was not expected to make speeches. \"Let him,\" said Nicholas Biddle, \"say not one single word about his principles, or his creed- let him say nothing— promise nothing. Let no committee, no convention, no town meeting ever extract from him a single word about what he thinks nor what he will do hereafter. Let the use of pen and ink be wholly forbidden.\" When Democrats jeered that all Harrison was fit for was to sit in front of a log cabin, drink hard cider, and draw a pension, the Whigs found a means of turning the campaign into pure ballyhoo. Against Van Buren they used the very methods the Jacksonians had used against Adams in 1828. Harrison ( bom to wealth and social position) was pictured as a rude frontiersman, while Van Buren ( bom in humble circumstances) was portrayed as a champagne- drinking aristocrat with cologne-scented whisk- ers. There were 'log cabin\" campaign songs in honor of \"Tippecanoe and Tyler too,\" John Tyler being the vice-presidential candidate. Crowds of men and boys rolled a great ball from Kentucky to Baltimore as a symbol of the great majority that the Whigs were rolling up. Blaming Van Buren for the depression, the Whigs promised prosperity. They freely boasted that Van Buren's policy was \"fifty cents a day and French soup; our policy two dollars a day"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Jacksonian Democracy 273 and roast beef.\" The result of this rollicking campaign was a decisive victory for Harrison, who gained 234 electoral votes to Van Buren's 60, although the popular vote was quite close. The Effectiveness of Party Organizations The election of 1840 was the first to illustrate what became one of the commonplaces of Amer- ican politics: that when there is a depression, the party in power gets blamed and is likely to be punished at the polls. The election retiuns also revealed the effectiveness of the new or- ganizations run by professional politicians. Whereas twelve years before, when Jackson was elected President over Adams, only a httle more than 50 per cent of the eligible voters went to the polls, now the proportion was nearly 80 per cent and in some states almost reached 90 per cent. Such a high turnout revealed that the party organization had penetrated every county, village, and city precinct and had set up ma- chinery for informing the electorate and seeing that they came to the polling places. Another significant development was the way the parties, by avoiding or compromising dangerous issues and by forming truly national organizations, had managed to damp down sectionalism. There Robert J. Walker, Politician Robert J. Walker, governor of Mississippi, faced an unpleasant crisis. His state had issued bonds which were to have provided a network of toll roads. The bonds had been sold widely abroad, especially to English investors. Now, the roads were not built, the company set up to build them was bankrupt, the state treasury was empty, and the payment of the bonds was overdue. Walker's recommendation, which Mississippi followed, was to repudiate the bonds. Mississippi, although conspicuous, was not alone with her dilemma. The whole country had been ruined by the Panic of 1837. In the South, cotton growers who could not pay their debts took mules, wagons, plows, and slaves west to Texas, then an independent republic into which the debts could not follow them. Court foreclosures on abandoned mortgaged lands were so numerous that sheriffs no longer filed reports on fruitless collection attempts. They just scrawled G.T.T. — \"Gone to Texas\" — on the records. Walker's political career was not ruined by the bond fiasco. Elected to the United States Senate, he influenced tariff policies during the early 1840's. When James Polk became President, Walker joined his cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury. A believer in expansionism. Walker strongly supported the Mexican War and devised means for raising the monies necessary to conduct it. After a period of private law practice. Walker became governor of the territory of Kansas. When the Civil War broke out. Walker sided with the Union, even though much of his adult life had been spent in Mississippi. President Lincoln sent him to England on an assignment, unimportant in itself, which threw him into contact with wealthy Britishers. He constituted Lincoln's reminder to the British of their losses from the Mississippi repudiation, the President's way to cut down English investment in Confederate bonds.

Harrison gained 56 per cent of the popular vote in the Northwest, 55 per cent in the Northeast, and 54 per cent in the slave states. The Whig Split: John Tyler, President, 1841-1845 It was one thing for the Whigs to win an election and another for them to run the coun- try. While they could get into ofiBce simply by forgetting differences and attacking Van Buren, once in power they had to answer the demands of some of their followers and deny those of others. Henry Clay, now in the Senate, had worked out a program of legislation designed to appeal to as many different interests as possible.

In dis- gust at the President's actions, all the Whigs except Daniel Webster resigned from the cab- inet, and Clay resigned from the Senate. Split wide apart, without a program or leadership, the Whigs lost heavily in the congressional elec- tions of 1842. The Democrats now controlled the House, and the Whigs still controlled the Sen- ate, while President Tyler was a man without a party. The federal government was at dead center.

RALPH WALDO EMERSON The great democratic movement of which Jackson became a symbol expressed itself in demands for all sorts of reforms. Demo cracy implies that men can create a better society by fheir ownefforts. Perhaps never before or smce the Jacksonian period have Americans shown such optimistic faith in creating a better world. They thought themselves isolated once and for all from the troubles of Europe. They occupied an immense area, and had as yet hardly scratched its vast wealth. Foreign travelers re- marked that while other nations were proud of their past, Americans boasted of their future. Foreigners also noticed that Americans seemed always in a hurry. They never sat still; they bolted their food; and many of them could hardly wait to create a heaven on earth. While there were reform movements with a record of solid achievement, there were others of the type which Theodore Roosevelt later called \"the lunatic fringe.\" Ralp h Waldo _E mers on, called ,!|theSage of Concord,\" suggested the spirit of the age when he wrote: ' What a fertility of projects for the salvation of the world!

Noah Webster and the American Language Many AnieiiGan-leaders_sawm public schools a means oTt^ romoting national spirit the mos t in this dir ection was NoaJ Webster^author^f the famous dictiofTaTiesuiat bore his name. Webster, who began his career during the Revolutionary War as a school- teacher, devoted his life to creating a uniform American speech. \"A national language,\" he wrote, \"is a band of national union.\" Even more influential than his dictionary was his American Spelling Book. By 1837, sales of this book had reached the amazing total of 15,000,000 copies. In 1880 the pubhshers reported: It has the largest sale of any book in the world except the Bible. We sell a milhon copies a year, and we have been selling it at that rate for forty years. We sell them in cases of 72 dozen, and they are bought by all the large dry goods and supply houses, and furnished by them to every crossroads store. So it was that a New England storekeeper boasted that he sold: \"Everything: whiskey, molasses, calicoes, spelling books, and patent gridirons.\" The American brand of English has re- mained remarkably uniform. There are far greater differences between dialects spoken today in the British Isles than in the whole United States, which has more than thirty-five times the area. This uniformity of speech is in part a product of public education, but prob- ably results still more from the fact that the American population has been continuously on the move. There has not been time for people to settle down and develop extreme local pecu- liarities in ways of speaking. Higher Education Jefferson devoted his last years to the Uni- versity of Virginia, opened in 1825, where all students were free to take any course offered, and where the curriculum was broader than in other colleges. Virginia was not widely imitated, but during the Jacksonian period several pioneer institutions that greatly influenced American ed- ucation were founded.

They pro- vided libraries, small scientific museums, dis- cussion groups, and lectures. To their lecture platforms came the most eminent men of the dav. Elizabeth Peabody, Schoolteacher The Peabody sisters were at ttie center of the nineteenth-century educational scene. Mary married Horace Mann; Sophia, Nathaniel Hawthorne: but the third, Elizabeth, remained a spinster and a dedicated champion of every cause that excited intellectual New England during her long adult lifetime. An editor, publisher, bookseller, and confidante of the Concord literary group, she was the first woman lecturer in the United States. But she was, first, a schoolteacher. A child when she began to teach in her mother's home in Salem, Massachusetts, she started her own school at sixteen. These \"schools\" for small children spe- cialized in Latin, arithmetic, geography, and other \"first things.\" Uneven in quality, they were necessary in a day when publicly supported education had not yet become almost universal through the United States, Early in the 1830's Miss Pea- body could command about one hundred dollars per pupil per year, from which she had to pay schoolroom rent. She and her sister, Mary, could teach only a dozen or so pupils between them, however: and they could not hope to teach older boys, this being a matter for men. Later, in the mid-1830's in Boston, Elizabeth was an assistant in a school run by Bronson Alcott. The unique Temple School, preserved in her Record of a School (1835), was a failure, but it attracted a great deal of attention. Mr. Alcott (Louisa May Alcott's father) tried to teach his pupils by \"conversing with them\" in his own version of the Socratic method of questioning. He led them in examinations of their souls, their \"aspirations,\" and the discussion of such questions as, \"Is it worthwhile to try to bear the cold?\" Despite the topics of discussion, the Alcott method fore- shadowed the \"progressive\" school in its attempt to involve the students in learning by gearing the subject matter to their own immediate interests. Elizabeth Peabody and Mary Mann were primarily responsible for the kinder- garten movement in the United States. They started the first such English-speaking school in Boston in 1860, and Miss Peabody-the \"grandmother of kindergartens\"- continued to champion the movement until her death at ninety in 1894.

The Arts In the visual arts there was no such achieve- ment as in hterature and science, although American artists were eager to produce works which should rival those of Europe. Samuel F. B.

Bulfinch later worked for fourteen years in Washington and helped to complete the design of the national Capitol. He had wide influence, es- pecially in New England, but the style that most appealed to the American taste was known as \"Greek Revival.\" Inspired in part by the en- thusiasm for the Greeks' revolt against their Turkish oppressors, Greek Revival style was based on that of ancient temples, but was freely adapted to modem needs. It was used both in public buildings, of which the most famous is Jefferson's Virginia State Capitol, and in domestic architectiu-e. It was often successful. \"A Greek Revival town,\" remarks a historian of American architecture, \"is a fine and hand- some assembly of stately colonnades and well- turned building masses.\" ^^ By the middle of the_nineteenth cent 4merican architectsN unfortvmatelj^^bandone? mphcity— and^lean lines of tevivaTsiyies-^nd attempted to"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"During the Jacksonian period the \"Greek Revival\" style, shown above, was at the height of its popular- ity.

Except for the ill-paid occupation of teaching, professions were closed to women, as were most institutions of higher learning. Women were also bound by exaggerated standards of propriety, with rigid taboos about dress and behavior. The ill health and fainting spells that plagued the lives of many women were partly brought on by tight, heav\\' clothes. Yet foreigners noted the deference paid to women in America and their relative freedom as compared with European women. Particularly in the West, women had a high station. The life of a frontier woman was one of endless toil, but she was a full partner in the work of settle- ment. In frontier regions there was such a sur- plus of men that women had a high scarcity value. \"Guess my husband's got to look after me, and make himself agreeable to me,\" said a western girl. \"If he don't, there's plenty will.\" Meanwhile, in the East, the new careers for women as factory hands and schoolteachers helped to free them from restraints and de- pendence. Many women of wealthy or pro- fessional men's families became widely read in spite of lack of opportunity for formal edu- cation, and a women's magazine, Godey's Lady's Book, achieved a circulation of 150,000. Since American businessmen tended to immerse them- selves in work, wealthy women tended to dominate the culture of the large cities. A New York editor remarked: It is the women who regulate the style of living, dispense hospitalities, exclusively manage society, control clergymen and churches, regulate the schemes of benevolence, patronize and influence the Arts, and pronounce upon Operas, and it is the women . . . who exercise the ultimate control over the Press. Seneca Falls Convention, 1848 An obvious corollary to the Jacksonian urge to exalt the common man was a movement to raise the status of women. This reached nation- wide proportions. In 1848 a women's convention at Seneca Falls, New York, drew up a \"Declara- tion of Sentiments and Resolutions\" echoing the Declaration of Independence. Starting with the \"self-evident truth\" that \"all men and women are created equal,\" the Seneca Falls declaration went on to list grievances of women against men and to demand full equality in every as- pect of life. The women's rights movement was often re- ceived with anger and ridicule. Feminists were denied the right to speak in public and were denounced as shameless or irreligious. Most politicians were indifferent or hostile, one of the exceptions being a young Whig in the frontier state of Illinois^^^braham Lincoln^ The im- mediate results of\"~the femm'ist movement were slight.

Negro slavery. How could America claim to be \"the~land oflhe free\" when human beings were bought and sold like cattle? The question be- came increasingly acute by 1840, as most Latin- American countries had abolished slavery, and Great Britain had banned it in her West Indian possessions. It is not surprising that the up- surge of democratic feeling in the Jacksonian period was accompanied by an increase in anti- slavery agitation."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"284 The Nation and the Sections The organized mov ement to abolish slave: ^^-^egSraniong'Teftgious'ggap^.

Among its early leaders were Benjamin Limdy, a New Jersey man who spent most of his active career organizing antislavery so- cieties in southern communities, and James G. Bimey, an Alabama la\\\\'yer and cotton planter, who freed his own slaves and attempted to get other owners to do the same. As late as 1831 the Virginia legislature seriously debated a bill to abolish slavery in the state. Generally, however, the increasing profitability of cotton grov\\'ing and the fear of a Negro insurrection if slaves were freed tended to stifle abolitionism in the South. Garrison and Other Abolitionists On JanuarjLljl831, appeared the first edition of The Lwerator^an antislavery newspaper edited by Wilham Lloyd Garr ist»^and pub- lished in Boston. Garrison's views were extreme for the time and his language violent. He de- nounced both Northerners who refused to be shocked by slavery and Southerners who held slaves. He demanded immediate freedom for the Negroes without compensation for the owners, whom he regarded as \"not . . . within the pale of Christianity, of Republicanism, of humanity.\" He damned the Constitution as \"a league with death and a covenant with Hell\" because it protected slavery. Garrison and his followers made no attempt to win their way by political action and were willing to divide the Union to rid the free states of the shame of being tied to the slave states. Many abolitionists refused to follow Gar- rison, who had a talent for antagonizing^evea-. his own-supporters. A group who ,pr8pose£ -- arboUsh slave jo^'by ihe use of the founded, tb^^ibe rty partv?^ t- nominated James^ ^irney^or the presidency in 1840 anc winning only a few thousand votes. Another leader who favored political activity was Frederick Douglass, a self-educated former slave, who edited an abolitionist newspaper. The North Star. The title suggests an important abolitionist activity, the \"Underground Rail- road.\" This secret organization, which had sta- tions nmning through the northern states to Canada, brought slaves out of the South and set them free. Its agents not only took care of slaves after they had come North, but risked their hves to go into the slave states and lead Negroes to freedom. One of the most success- ful of these was Harriet Tubman, the \"Negro Moses,\" who had herself been bom in slavery. After making her own escape, she returned to the South again and again, hberating over three hundred of her people and always escaping ar- rest, even though eventually a reward of $40,000 was promised for her capture. Southern Reaction to the Abolition Movement It was almost certainly a mere coincidence that the first publication of The Liberator co- incided with a slave insurrection in Virginia in 1831, led by Nat Turner, a Negro preacher who believed himself divinely inspired to lead his people from bondage. Turner's rebellion was easily quelled after about sixty whites had been killed, but it caused panic in the South.

When he was absent one day, however, a mob seized his presses and sent them across the Ohio River to Cincinnati.

No prominent politician and neither major party proposed to endanger the Union by touching slavery where it was already protected by law. THE LABOR MOVEMENT Wherever it appeared, the industrial revolu- tion ultimately raised the standard of living of the mass of the people by creating cheaper and more abundant goods. In several ways, how- ever, an immediate result was to make life more difficult for vvorkingmen: (1) When machines took over the work of hand tools, manv skilled craftsmen lost their jobs or were reduced to the condition of un- skilled labor. (2) There was enjo>'ment in skilled work and pride in good handicraft. But tending ma- chines \\\\'as monotonous, and the worker gained little sense that the product was his own. Fur- thermore, the handicraftsman worked at his own pace, the factory worker at a speed set by the machine. ( 3 ) While the craftsman worked long hours, he was often at liberty to begin and end the day at the time he himself chose. If he had money in hand, and \\\\'anted to take a day off and go fishing, that was his affair. But in fac- tories the hours were rigidly fi.xed by the em- ployer, with fines or discharge as the penalty for lateness or absence. (4) In the small-community society before the industrial revolution, the laborer often owned his own cottage, with a garden to supple- ment his income and help tide him over periods of unemployment. In the big cities created by the industrial re\\olution, workers were crowded into dingy, rented tenements. Periods of unem- plo\\'ment were more frequent than before; when they came, workers had less to fall back on. (5) In the small shops of the earlier age, owner and employee labored side by side. They both wore homespun clothes and leather aprons. A laborer might set up in business for himself, or marry the employer's daughter. The industrial re\\olution broke down this face-to-face relation- ship between employers and \\\\orkers. Under the factory' system, an employer often knew none of his workmen, and dealt wdth them en- tirely through superintendents and foremen. Owners and workers now lived in different sections of town and moved in different social circles. In brief, workers lost security— security of employment, security of life in small com- munities, and security of personal contact with employers."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"The Spirit of Reform 287 Trade Societies In such circumstances workers every\\v'here have organized into labor unions. In the United States the most powerful of the early unions, however, were organizations not of factory workers but of sk Uled craftsmen— carpent ers, shoemakers, printers, and so forth. By 1830 rno5t-©f--tiie major crafts had formed what were known as ^|fradc__sQcieties^ in all the major northeastern cities. The dues collected by these trade societies paid for the funeral expenses of members and fed them and their families dur- ing strikes. The trade societies demanded higher wages, shorter hours, and the \"closed shop,\" which meant that the employer could hire only union members. The different crafts joineH together to form city-wide federations for combined action. In 1835 the Philadelphia trade societies called a city-wide strike to force the employers to grant them a 10-hour day. The slogan of the Phila- delphia workers was \"6 to 6\"— a working day running from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., with an hour out for breakfast and an hour out for lunch. The tra de societie s from six cities also formed a ^Catig nal Trades Unio B, which was designed to promote the organization of f'gIT~workersJ ^nd claimed a membership of 300,000. Factory workers were not so successful in forming unions as craftsmen. Since they were unskilled, strikes among them were not so effective as among craftsmen; the employers could break a strike simply by hiring other men. Many textile workers, especially in New Eng- l and. \\ve r£_couritry ^girIs who had no intention of remaining in the factories all their lives and so were less interested in forming permanent or- ganizations. To these youngwomen from rocky farms, where little money and long hours were the rule, $2 a week was good pay and a 12- or 13-hour day not unreasonable. Many of the early factory owners, furthermore, made a real effort to provide their working girls with edu- cational and recreational opportunities. In spite of all this, some of the girl workers organized. The first women's strike occurred in 1824 among the weavers of Pawtucket, Rhode Island. In 1833 there appeared a union of factory girls in Lynn, Massachusetts, followed shortly by a \" Factory' Girls' Association \" designej _ to bring in all women workers. Although these early unions were generally ineffective, they were the first attempts at large-scale women's organizations in American histor>'. Labor's Demands Not only did the unions make obvious de- mands regarding hours and wages, they also threw their weight behind many of the reforms of the-f^cksonian period. No peop]e_m ere m ore^ x^Bterested^n the founding ^ ^public schoo ls—- ^\"than th e trad e societies.

Another labor demand was for \"mechanics' lien laws,\" which would require that the unpaid wages of workingmen be the first claim on the assets of a bankrupt employer. Without such protection, workers were often left holding the bag. In order to obtain their demands, laborers went into pohtics. In 1829 a Workingmen 's party put up candidates for local offices in New York City and polled 6,000 out of 20,000 votes. This party and others like it did not last long. Radical reformers tried to use them to promote a re- dixasion of property ownership or to agitate for more liberal di\\orce laws, thus making the workingmen seem more revolutionary than they really were.

Collapse of the Labor Movement The early trade societies faced severe legal handicaps because state courts tended to apply the Enghsh common law doctrine that forbade conspiracies in restraint of trade. In a case against shoemakers in Philadelphia, a Penn- sylvania court ruled in 1806 that a combination of worldngmen to force employers to raise wages was a criminal conspiracy punishable by fines or imprisonment. This became a precedent followed in other states. Thus in 1835, employers successfully prosecuted another group of shoe- makers, this time in Geneva, New York. In de- ciding that the workers were guilty of con- spiracy because their trade society demanded that they be paid at least a dollar to make a pair of shoes, the coiut said: Competition is the life of trade.

But this rather cautious tolerance of trade societies through the principle of \"virtuous ends pursued by virtuous means\" came too late to help most of the early trade societies. The Panic of 1837 had already caused their collapse. Unemploy- ment was so widespread that in order to avoid star^'ation workers accepted whatever wages were offered. The closed shop could not be en- forced; union treasuries were emptied. It was nearly a generation before labor again tried to organize on a large scale.

Like other reform groups, temper- ance groups form ed a natio nal organization, the United State^'T'Temperancc UmPn, founded in 1833. They started newspapers and pubhshed hundreds of thousands of pamphlets. MilHons of heavy drinkers were persuaded to \"take the pledge,\" i.e., promise to give up drinking. Tem- perance propaganda even included a \"Cold Water Army\" of children with imiforms and marching songs. The revivalist spirit of the temperance movement is revealed by a stanza from one of its songs, entitled \"One More Drink\": Stay, mortal, stay! nor heedless thus Thy sure destruction seal; ^^'itllin that cup there lurks a curse. Which all who drink shall feel. Disease and death forever nigh. Stand ready at the door, And eager wait to hear the cry— \"O give me one glass morel\" In addition to trying to persuade people not to drink, temperance societies demanded laws to put an end to the sale of liquor, and were able to convince many poHticians of the justice of their cause. Abraham Lincoln, for in- stance, favored prohibition by state action. In urging it he argued that just as the American Revolution freed men from the tyranny of Britain, so prohibition would fre e in en from the tyranny of alcohol. In 1851<Maine^passed the |^[;st statetjprohibition lawVkTr^xample fol- lowed by~aDOut a^ dozen states. Other states passed 'local option\" laws, which allowed towns and villages to prohibit the sale of liquor within their boundaries. CARE FOR THE MENTALLY ILL A relatively little publicized reform, better treatment of the mentally ill, illustrates the ex- traordinary influence a single determined person may exert. One of the most cruel abuses of hu- man beings was the treatment of the mentally ill as criminals. The individual most responsible for improving this state of affairs was Dorothea Dix, a Massachusetts schoolteacher. Shocked at conditions she saw when she visited a jail in 184L Miss Dix proceeded, entirely on her own initiative, to visit nearly all the jails and alms- houses in her native state. In 1842 she wrote a report describing the conditions she found, and presented it to the legislature. \"I proceed, gentlemen,\" she \\vrote in her introduction, 'Tjriefly to call your attention to the present state of insane persons confined within this commonwealth, in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience. . . .\" Miss Dix's findings were at once so shocking and so accurate that Massachusetts passed a law establisliing asylums where the insane were to be treated as sick rather than guilty. After her success at home, Miss Dix traveled through- out the United States visiting over 800 jails and almshouses. Largely as a result of her influence, twenty states followed Massachusetts in found- ing insane asylums. Later she traveled abroad, helping to promote better treatment of the in- sane in every major European country. A friendship with a Japanese diplomat resulted in the first insane asylums in Japan. INTERNATIONAL PEACE While Dorothea Dix devoted herself to the sufferings of the small minority of the popula- tion who were insane, other reformers turned their attention to a problem affecting all man- kind—the abolition of war.

SOCIALISM From-EurQpe at this period_came-^ new idea-4yppialjsnOThis was a revolt agains^ the aovertyjindpinequali^ which socialTsts blamed on business competition and individual ovimer- ship of property. Socialists proposed to sub- stitute cooperation for competition and com- mon ownership for individual ownership. The early followers of the idea proposed to start small, voluntary communities where their ideas could be put into practice. Most of these experi- ments took place in the United States because land was so easy to acquire here. A famous English socialist, Robert Owen, started a co- operative venture at New Harmony, Indiana. Even more influential than he were the disciples of the Frenchman, Charles Fourier, who pro- posed to organize society into \"phalanxes\" of just 1,620 people, living in villages called \"phalan- steries.\" His converts included Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, the most widely readnewSpaper^nMhe Unit^d-Sjates. Since the labor movemgjM of thej^30>>had failed to get the workers better wages or more security, a few labor leaders were ready to try socialism. Many intellectuals, repelled by the ugly aspects of the factory system, were also interested. Eventually almost forty Fourierist communities were started, but most of them quickly collapsed. The \"phalanxes\" were too often composed of individuals without organ- izing ability or manual skills. There were quarrels about the division of labor. Without the profit motive, it was found difficult to get people to work hard enough to produce the goods on which life depends. Although socialism had aroused great fear among property owners, its first appearance in the United States turned out to be a failure. RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS The first half of the nineteenth century saw a great variety of religious movements in the United States. In New England the Unitarians revolted against the stem Puritanism of the Congregational Church. Instead of considering man totally depraved, the Unitarians insisted that he was by nature good. Throughout the country, the immense growth of Protestant de- nominations, especially the Baptists and the Methodists, was marked by great revival meet- ings, the building of thousands of new churches, and the founding of scores of colleges and universities. In the cities, the coming of thousands of European immigrants brought a corresponding growth of the religions they professed. In Boston and New York, for in- stance, the Roman Catholic Church provided not only places of worship, but also schools, orphanages, and charitable organizations. Alexis de Tocqueville, a French political scientist who made a close study of American institutions during the Jacksonian period, ob- served that American ministers of all faiths did \"not attempt to draw or to fix all the thoughts of man upon the life to come.\" Life on earth was no longer a mere preparation for the here- after; instead, men had the capacity and the duty to improve the environment in which God had placed them.

Some religious groups decided to cut them- selves oflF from the world and found Utopian communities of their own. Thus the Shakers, an offshoot of the Quakers, estabhshed scores of villages where everything was owned in common. The Shakers supported themselves by small industry, and today the furniture they made, with its fine workmanship and clean lines, is much prized by collectors. Another success- ful community that practiced a variety of Chris- tian socialism was the Oneida Community in central New York, which supported itself by manufacturing efficient game traps. The Mor- mons, another new sect, were driven by perse- cution to endure the hardships of pioneering in a trek that started in western New York in 1830 and ended with the founding of Salt Lake City in 1848. VARIETY OF REFORM; PERMANENT INFLUENCE There is not space in this chapter to de- scribe all the reforms advocated in the United States during the Jacksonian period. There were organizations to improve prisons, to persuade Congress to do away with flogging in the navy, to abohsh meat-eating, to make contact with departed spirits, to promote a \"science\" called phrenology through which character could sup- posedly be determined by the shape of the skull. Typical of the period were the \"come- outers\" who \"came out\" in favor of every re form. There was even a \"come-outer\" society called the Friends of Universal Reform. Although it may be easy to laugh at some of the \"come-outers\" and their odd notions, the great reform movements of the 1830's and 1840's left behind them much solid achievement. Their influence was seen especially in state legislation dealing with such problems as prisons, the in- sane, child labor, liquor, mechanics' hen laws, and public schools. This illustrates one of the virtues of the federal system: it allows for vigorous action at the local level. Some movements which had relatively little success at first, such as the feminists, formed permanent organizations which continued their agitation even into the twentieth century. The essential demands of the abolitionists, the fem- inists, the educational reformers, and the labor unions were all eventually fulfilled. The motto on the front page of Garrison's paper. The Liberator, was, \"Our Coimtry Is the World— Our Countrymen, All Mankind.\" The movements here described were by no means hmited to the United States. There was con- stant influence back and forth between Europe and the United States. The antislavery move- ment, for instance, achieved great strength in Great Britain before it had gone far in America. In 1833, at a time when the United States Con- gress would not even debate the slavery question, British abolitionists succeeded in per- suading Parliament to buy out the slaveowners in the British colonies and free the slaves. The Prussian system of public schools provided Horace Mann with several of the ideas which he put into effect in Massachusetts. One of the greatest temperance lecturers was Father Theobald Matthew, an Irish priest who had persuaded, over two milhon of his countrymen to \"take the pledge.\" Father Matthew came to New York in 1849 and was received with a great ovation. In the next two years he traveled through twenty-five states and persuaded 600,000 people to agree to give up liquor. In the other direction, the pressure of American reform on Europe, an outstanding example was Dorothea Dix. She was only one of many American reformers who had wide contacts and wide influence on both sides of the Atlantic."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Activities: Chapter 11 For Mastery and Review 1.

Whole battles were re-enacted, with men in antique uniforms banging away at each other with blank cartridges, like some huge game of cops and robbers. It seems strange, this celebration, because that long, hard-fought war was a terrible tragedy. The losses were much higher relative to the population of the country than in any war the United States ever fought with a foreign foe. Hundreds of thousands of young men were killed or maimed or allowed to rot in prison camps. To be sure, the Negroes of the South received the priceless gift of freedom, but one must won- der if it could not have been achieved at less cost in blood, treasure, and bitter feeling. Compromises and temporary truces for a time prevented the slavery issue from exploding. But in the end the flames of controversy between North and South were rekindled by the movement known as \"manifest destiny,\" and in 1861 the country plunged into war. On the eve of the Civil War, the parties ceased to serve the important function of damping down controversies before they endangered the Union. Both parties, Whigs and Democrats, broke apart. You can see the result in the map of the presidential election of 1860, on p. 341. Essentially, Southerners were demanding the right to take slaves into areas totally unsuited to slavery, and Republicans were insisting that slavery be forbidden in areas where climate and soil made its existence impossible. Some historians say that the Civil War was brought on by a \"blundering gen- eration\" of politicians too shortsighted or unskillful to arrange a compromise that would have saved the Union without bloodshed. Others suggest that the war was an \"irrepressible conflict,\" or even a divine punishment for the terrible wrong of slavery. Or was it perhaps an inevitable consequence of rivalry between the industrial interests of the North and the planter interests of the South? Was it caused by northern invasion of southern rights, as the Confederate leaders claimed? Would it have been better to allow the seceding states to \"depart in peace\"? We do not know how the tragedy could have been averted, but we can at least be thankful that there were elements that relieved the gloom: the songs, such as \"Dixie\" and \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\"; the cheerful heroism of the defenders of Vicksburg; the magnanimity of Grant and the dignity of Lee in the surrender at Appomattox Court House; the greatness of Abraham Lincoln, who hated slavery and disunion, but who never hated his fellow Americans fighting for the \"lost cause\" of the Confederacy. ,"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Chapter 12 Manifest Destiny The cowards never started and the weak died on the road. And all across the continent the endless campfires glowed. We'd taken land and settled — but a traveler passed by — And we're going West to-morrow — Lordy, never ask us why! STEPHEN VINCENT BENET At the time the United States acquired Florida by the Transcontinental Treaty in 1819, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams remarked at a cabinet meeting that the world should be \"familiarized with the idea of considering our proper dominion to be the continent of North America.\" This idea that the United States was bound to extend its boundaries to the Pacific Ocean, perhaps also northward to the Arctic Ocean and southward to the Isthmus of Panama, became known as \"manifest destiny.\" It found its greatest expression in the decade of the 1840's, when the United States acquired ter- ritories even more vast than the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. WESTWARD TO THE PACIFIC Various elements went into the manifest destiny movement. One of them was the ha- bitual ambition of American frontiersmen to move on to virgin land. This push westward was one of the great migrations of history. Historian James Truslow Adams described it as \"a movement involving tens of millions of individuals, unthinking, collective, immoral, akin, in all save its incredible swiftness, to the inevitable advance of a glacier.\" Yet, why should Americans move beyond the existing borders of the United States when most of their land was still thinly settled and most of the area be- tween the Mississippi and the Rocky Moun- tains was still completely unoccupied? The settlement of Texas was a natural west- ward expansion of cotton culture, which was prevented by climate from moving north. The trek to Oregon, however, was partly a result of the mistaken idea that the treeless plains from the 98th meridian to the Rockies (see map, p. 175) were unsuited to farming and would be forever the haunt of the Indian and the buffalo. It was, in fact, the pohcy of the federal gov- ernment to set apart portions of this \"Great American Desert\" for Indian tribes expelled from their homes in the East.

A \"Power Vacuum\" Since the expansion of the United States to the Pacific involved friction with the Indians, the threat of hostilities with Great Britain, and a war with Mexico, it had to be backed up by miUtar)' power.

Ashburton carried on his negotia- tions with Daniel Webster, then Secretary of State. Each diplomat was free of prejudice against the country of the other, Webster having traveled in England and Ashburton having married an American.

While the Webster- Ashburton Treaty did not remove all points of Anglo-American friction, it did clear the air and put an end to the danger of war. THE OPENING OF OREGON While Webster and Ashburton were settling the Maine boundary, the rivalry betvveen Great Britain and the United States over Oregon grew acute. Ever since 1818, the t\\vo coimtries had agreed to disagree about possession of the region, and had carried on the curious arrange- ment kno\\\\Ti as \"joint occupation\" ( see p. 235 ) . The interest of the United States in Oregon had started when in 1787 a Boston ship, the Columbia, made one of the greatest pioneer trading voyages in history. The ship left home with a supply of ginseng, the root of a common New England weed that happened to be highly prized by the Chinese as a medicine. Rounding the Horn, it sailed to the coast of Oregon to get sea otter furs, also in demand in China. After a voyage across the Pacific, the ginseng and otter furs were exchanged for Chinese tea and silk. These brought high prices when the vessel, having circumnavigated the globe, returned to the United States in 1790. The Columbia, which on a later voyage gave its name to Oregon's greatest river, inaugurated a regular trade. The profits were sometimes enormous: one trader got otter pelts worth $22,000 from the Indians in retimi for trinkets costing less than $2; another exchanged a rusty chisel for furs worth $8,000. Small wonder that in 1800, five years before the arrival of Lewis and Clark, no less than 15 New England ships cruised the coast of Oregon to get furs for the China trade.

By 1800, the eastern supply had been so much reduced that the discovery of beaver in the streams draining the Rockies was like a strike of gold. Fierce competition developed be- tween three great fur companies: the British Hudson's Bay Company, the American Fur Company, headed by John Jacob Astor of New York, and the Missouri Company, owned by men in St. Louis. The Hudson's Bay Company dominated the Oregon region itself, while the other two operated mostly at the headwaters of the streams running out of the Rockies into the Missouri River. The struggle between the fur companies was bitter to the verge of actual warfare. They played politics in the rivalries among the Indian tribes, bribed away each other's agents, and sometimes stole each other's furs. As accessible regions were trapped out, the \"mountain men,\" who carried on the dangerous business of trap- ping and trading in Indian country, penetrated farther and farther into the Rocky Mountain wilderness. It took the utmost in bravery, skill, and self-reliance to survive as a mountain man. As Bernard DeVoto \\\\TOte in The Year of De- cision, 1846: Woodcraft, forest craft, and river craft were his skill. To read the weather, the streams, the woods; to know the ways of animals and birds; to find food and shelter; to find the Indians when they were his customers or to battle them from stump to stump when they were on the warpath and to know which caprice was on them; to take comfort in flood or blizzard; to move safely through the wilderness, to make the wilderness his bed, his table and his tool— this was his vocation."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Manifest Destiny 305 Narcissa Whitman, Pioneer Many are the ornaments and statues \"in front of the courthouse\" throughout America.

Seeking to bring the Indians not only religion, but a whole new civilization, they taught their charges to hoe, to handle chickens, and to raise pigs and cows. They were interrupted by tragedy. First, Alice was drowned in the river. Then, in 1847, an epidemic of measles broke out. Whitman, who had had medical training, treated whites and Indians alike. The whites, who followed his instructions, re- covered; the Indians, who did not, died. The Cayuse, thinking he had planned this deliberately, struck back and murdered Marcus, Narcissa, and twelve others, a massacre long remembered. But their enthusiasm for Oregon had had its effect, for their letters home had already started the white settlement of that country. (Theme 5, see p. xii) The heyday of the mountain men lasted only about ten years, and they did not number more than a few hundred at any one time, but they played an important part in opening overland routes to Oregon and California. They dis- covered the best passes through the mountains and places where rivers could be forded. They served as guides to parties of settlers crossing the mountains by wagon train. Their whiskey, as well as the white man's diseases they carried with them, corrupted and weakened the Indian tribes so that they became less formidable en- emies of the whites who crossed their hunting lands. On to Oregon Until shortly before 1840 the joint occupa- tion of Oregon was almost entirely a British af- fair, with the Hudson's Bay Company acting as the government of the region. In the mid-1830's, however, American missionaries arrived to Christianize the Indians. They also began to"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"306 Division and Reunion farm and sent back glowing reports of the fertility of the country. The most famous and influential of these men was Reverend Marcus Whitman, the accounts of whose adventures were widely read. On a journey to Oregon in 1836, Whitman and another missionary took their wives— the first white women to cross the continent. If women could brave the perils of such a trip, the Oregon country could be set- tled. In 1838 a party of American pioneers arrived there by ship; most newcomers, how- ever, came by covered wagon over the famous Oregon Trail (see map, pp. 320-321). By 1842 there were perhaps 500 Americans in Oregon, and in the next year a single party of immi- grants numbered 900. The long, slow journey from the Missouri River to Oregon demanded courage and en- durance. The heavy Conestoga wagons were usually drawn by teams of six or eight oxen which, when the going was good, moved at a pace of about two miles an hour. The necessity of fording rivers involved the chance of tipping over the wagons or drowning the oxen. Through much of the journey there was ever-present danger from Indians. To meet such difficulties, parties of immigrants had to be thoroughly or- ganized. The members of a wagon train often chose their officers by election. One man would have charge of the cattle, another of posting sentries, another of leading the advance party which chose the way. Major decisions were reached by vote of the group as a whole. By 1843 so many Americans had arrived in Oregon that they set up a government of their own. Following a procedure going back to the Mayflower Compact, they drew up a constitu- tion for themselves. Its preamble, which re- veals its authors' familiarity with the United States Constitution, went as follows: We the people of Oregon territory, for the pur- pose of mutual protection and to secure peace and prosperity among ourselves, agree to adopt the fol- lowing laws and regulations until such time as the United States of America extend their jurisdiction over us. The last phrase shows that the Oregon settlers were determined that the United States and not Britain should rule them. A decision as to which country was to control the region could not be put off much longer. The Mormon Migration, 1847-1849 Experience gained by the Oregon settlers was put to good use by the Mormons, who in the years 1847-1849 carried out an amazingly successful migration to the shores of Salt Lake. The Mormons, a religious group who had suf- fered persecution in the United States, sought a haven where they could worship as they pleased. Their leade^TBri gham Young^ had a genius for organization, and the migration was carried out in well-planned stages. First, scouts sought out the best routes and found sites for sawmills, flour mills, and towns. Then came small parties who built houses and fortresses and planted crops which ripened in time for the main body of immigrants. Many of the latter had no draft animals, but carried their few possessions in handcarts, singing, as they trudged the long miles, a marching song with the chorus: Some must push and some must pull As we go marching up the hill. So merrily on our way we go Until we reach the Valley, O! In spite of hardship and disease, the Mormons soon established several flourishing settlements.

Texas was a vast, ill-defined area extending southwest from Louisiana to the Rio Grande and west to the foothills of the Rockies. It was a natural cotton-growing region, much of it being part of the fertile coastal plain that ex- tends across Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisi- ana. It had been on the northern fringe of the Spanish Empire, but Spain's hold had been limited to a few himdred settlers and a dozen Indian missions. Texan Independence Mexico inherited Texas after breaking away from Spain in 1821. At first the government of Mexico welcomed settlers from the United Yale University Art Gallery Mabel Brady Garvan Collection States.

But it was now too late to stop the flood of American settlers, and there was constant friction between the Texans and the Mexican government.

Thus manifest destiny became the principal issue of the campaign. To counter this unexpected challenge, the Whigs could offer only Henry Clay's great per- sonal popularity and the slogan, \"Who is James K.

Clay backed down from his earlier opposition to admitting Texas by issuing a cautious statement that he would be glad to see the region annexed, if the Amer- ican people so desired and if war with Mexico could be avoided. This hedging did not save the Whig leader. Polk won the election by a slim margin. The abolitionist Liberty party candidate, James M. Bimey, polled 62,000 votes and held the balance of power in Indiana, Ohio, and New York. If the Liberty party votes had been cast for Clay in New York, he would have carried the state and been elected President.

The acquisition of California and an Oregon settlement were much more diflBcult to achieve, but Polk was success- ful in these purposes too. The Question of California New Englanders had traded with California for fifty years and had described the region as \"the richest, most beautiful, the healthiest coim- try in the world.\" In the 1840's, it became ap- parent that the ultimate fate of the region might soon be decided. The native population had staged four rebellions against the Mexican government, which was too disorganized to govern the region effectively. As we have seen, there was fear that Great Britain, or possibly France, might annex California because of the great harbor of San Francisco, large enough to accommodate all the navies of the world. Polk hoped to purchase California from Mex- ico. Meanwhile, he took measures to promote annexation. In his annual message to Congress in December 1845, he warned off Great Britain and France by repeating the \"no colonization\" principle of the Monroe Doctrine. He also urged the United States consul in Monterey to \"arouse in the bosoms of the Cahfomians that love of liberty so natural to the American con- tinent\"— in other words, stir up a revolution.

So great was Mexican anger at the loss of Texas that any official who dared to talk with the American diplomat could have lost his position and possibly his life as well. With- out having been allowed to present his case, Shdell returned to Washington. Outbreak of War The immediate occasion for war between Mexico and the United States wasjh e southern bo undary of Texas, where the land betwee n th^Nueces River and the Rio Grande was in dispute. Both sides sent troops tlT~the region, but for a time they both kept out of the area. On hearing of the failure of Slidell's mission to Mexico City, Polk ordered General Zacharv Xa}^lot_commanding an American force guard- ing the border, to move south to the Rio Grande. Late in April 1846, Mexican soldiers crossed the river and attacked a small detachment of United States cavalry. When the news of this attack on Taylor's force reached Washington, the President asked Congress to declare war. Pointing out that his effort to negotiate peace- ably wdth Mexico had failed, Polk argued that war had been begun \"by the act of Mexico herself.\" On May 13, 1846, Congress declared war by overwhelming majorities in both houses. In spite of the vote in Congress, the Mexican War was widely and bitterly attacked as a war of aggression against a weaker neighbor. It was, wrote the New England author James Russell Lowell, simply a southern scheme to steal \"big- ger pens to cram in slaves.\" Whig members of Congress, including Abraham Lincoln, then a representative from Illinois, challenged Polk's statement that he had tried to avoid war, asking why he had insisted on sending Taylor to the Rio Grande. A northern senator said that if he were a Mexican he would tell the United States: \"Have you not room in your country to bury your dead men? If you come into mine, we will greet you with bloody hands and welcome you to hospitable graves.\" Although attacking Polk for starting the war, the Whigs nevertheless supported it by voting supphes and men.

Division of Oregon, 1846 The Mexican War was indirectly responsible for settlement of the Oregon boundary. It was one thing to shout, \"Fifty-four forty or fight!\" in an election campaign, and another to take on war with the greatest sea power in the world at the same time we were fighting Mexico. For- tunately a fair compromise was possible. While by 1846 the number of American settlers in Oregon had risen to 10,000, most of them were in thet ^fertil^ Willamette Valley south of the Columbia River. Neither by discovery nor by oc- cupation had the United States a valid claim to the entire region. The British government in turn was willing to relinquish the southern half of Oregon because the Hudson's Bay Company had trapped out the beaver there and had moved its principal base from the Columbia River to Vancouver Island. In 1846, therefore, the United States and Great Britain agreed to divide Oregon along the 49th parallel (see map, pp. 320-321). :;. THE UNION IN DANGER The Mexican War and the Treaty of Guad- elupe Hidalgo brought into the open the slavery issue that politicians had been trying to avoid ever since the bitter debates over the admission of Missouri to the Union. Once the United States acquired New Mexico and Cali- fornia, some decision had to be made regarding the status of the Negroes in the areas. Even before the war ended, the growth of antislavery sentiment in the North was revealed when the House of Representatives passed the Wilmot Proviso, an amendment to an army appropria- tion bill which said that all territory acquired from Mexico should be closed to slavery'. This aroused an outcry from the South, and southern senators attempted to prevent the organization of Oregon as a territory because, as the people of Oregon desired, slavery was to be forbidden there. Southerners now argued that Congress had no constitutional power to forbid slavery in the territories, on the ground that to deny o\\vners of Negroes the right to take their human property into land that belonged to the nation as a whole was to deny them their equal rights as citizens. There seemed to be no way of reconciUng these two points of view. When the Polk administration left oflBce in 1849, no steps had been taken to provide for civil government in the new territories. The Election o\\AS^ In the presidential election of 1848, both sides took elaborate precautions to soft-pedal discussion of slavery. The Democrats, although controlled by their southern wing, nominated a northern senator, Lewis Cass of Michigan.

This was a retvim to their tactics of the \"hard cider\" elec- tion of 1840: nominate a mihtary hero and avoid issues. The ingenious effort to keep slavery out of the campaign failed when a group of northern Democrats imited ^vvith the former Liberty party to form the(free ^oil party ^vdth former Presi- dent Van Buren as its nominee. The Free Soilers gained no electoral votes, but they polled a heavier popular vote than the Democrats in New York, Vermont, and Massachusetts. They drew enough Democratic votes from Cass in New York, again as in 1844 the pivotal state, so that Taylor was elected President by an elec- toral vote of 163 to 127.

Mingling together were Missouri farmers, Yankee sailors, Georgia crackers, English shop- keepers, French peasants, Australian sheepherders, Mexican peons, \"heathen Chinee,\" and a liberal sprinkling of \"assassins manufactured in Hell.\" Most of the population of California, however, were law-abiding and wanted to set up a regu- lar government; in December 1849, the Califor- nians appHed for admission as a free state. California's application for statehood touched oflF one of the longest and bitterest debates in the history of Congress. Some con- gressmen attended sessions armed with pistols and bowie knives. The feeling in the national legislatuj-e was a reflection of public opinion. The danger of disunion had never seemed so great. Already two of the four largest Protestant churches had split apart over the slavery issue. Every northern legislature except one had passed resolutions supporting the Wilmot Pro- viso that slavery should be excluded from the territories acquired from Mexico. Southerners threatened secession if such action were taken. The Compromise of 1850 To deal with this alarming situation, Henry Clay, who had been in retirement since his defeat in the presidential election of 1844, re- turned to the Senate. Clay, an artist at dis- covering just where people would stand firm and where they would give in, was at first the domi- nant figure ,in Congress as he tried to arrange his last great intersectional compromise. This was embodied in a series of measiues nicely calculated to balance northern and southern demands. The principal provisions favoring the North were that Cali forni a be admitted as a free s tate and thatthe slave~ ga(le, but ~not jilave^ZbeJorbidden in the District of Colum- bia. The South~in turn gained a stronger Fugi- tive Slave Law, designed to suppress the Underground Railroad. The New Mexico Ces- sion was divided into two territories, Utah and New Mexico, the question of slavery to be decided by popular sovereignty when the ter- ritories were organized with territorial legisla- tures, the fomiula Cass proposed in the 1848 campaign. The original size of the Republic of Texas was decreased by more than 100,000 square miles, for which Texas was paid by the federal government (see map, p. 320). Clay's measures, lumped together in an \"omnibus bill,\" at first failed to receive sufficient support to pass, and P^^dent Taylor was known to be cool to thern,-^aylor died, however, in t he su mmer of ^^50 and was succeeded by ''^illa rd Fillmq^ . who favor ed the compromise. Then, while Clay was on a vacation, legislative management of the compromise proposals passed to young Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois.

Shortly afterward Daniel Webster, who had QUESTION • // the slave played an impor- states had seceded in 1850, tant part in get- would the Union have ting the Compro- been permanently broken? niise of 1850 accepted, wrote a friend, \"I can now sleep of nights.

Unhappily, it turned out to be a truce rather than a permanent peace. Eleven years later the South seceded and the Civil War broke out.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN, 1858 TTie apparent settlement of the slavery is- sue by the Compromise of 1850 took place during a period of remarkable prosperity. Every great interest— cx)tton planting, wheat farming, manufacturing, transportation— was booming. Between 1849 and 1860, California produced over two thousand times as much gold as had been mined in the United States in the previous sixty years. This flood of precious metal paid for imports and served as a circulating mediimi within the coimtry. The rapid growth of the United States astonished the world: in the three decades from 1830 to 1860 the population more than doubled, climbing from 12,866,000 to 31,443,000. \"TAKE-OFF\" IN THE NORTH According to economist W. W.

Rapid and apparently self-sustaining growth becomes a dominant characteristic of the economy. In the United States, the take-off was the result of a combination of factors: new inventions, sufficient capital to build new fac- tories, a class of businessmen able and willing to start new enterprises, a mobile labor supply, an increase in agricultural productivity, and a transportation system to connect farms and fac- tories. Although in 1850 two-thirds of the American people were engaged in agriculture, industry was catching up, partly because of a flood of new inventions. Whereas in the early years of the Repubhc patents had been granted at a rate of less than 100 per year, by the turn of the nineteenth century 2,500 patents were issued annually. \"Would any but an American,\" asked an English newspaper, \"have ever invented a milking machine, or a machine to beat eggs, or machines to black boots, scour knives, pare apples, and do a hundred things that all other peoples have done \\vith their ten fingers from time immemorial?\" The _ sewing machine , in- vented by ^Eliar Howfe in 1846, reduced the time for making~a'~snirt from o\\er foiuteen hours to little more than an hour. When adapted for the purpose of sewing uppers to soles, it made possible the mass production of shoes. 322"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"Maritime Museum of San Diego The American clipper ships that slid down the ways of builders from Maine to Maryland were perhaps the finest sailing vessels ever built.

(See the pic- tures and map on pages 228-229.) The rotary press, introduced in the 1840's, al- lowed newspapers to publish far larger editions than ever before, so that such a paper as Horace Greeley's New York Tribune, with a circulation of 200,000, could exert national influence.

The techniques invented by EU Whitney and Simeon North of making inter- changeable parts and breaking douTi manu- facture into simple operations were now ap- phed to the mass production of clocks, watches, farm machinery, and sewing machines. In west- em Pennsylvania, Brady's Bend Iron Company combined all the operations from mining to shaping the finished product and produced 15,000 torfs of rails a year. For the first time, American manufactured goods invaded world markets. At the Crystal Palace Exhibition in London in 1851, crowds were fascinated by the ingenuity of American gadgets such as mechanical chiuns, r evolvers , and alarm clocks.

But the most striking new deYelapnaent was the first large- scale use offarm machi nery> prhere were special conditions iiTitnienca that made for this. As Jefferson had pointed out, \"In Europe the ob- ject is to make the most of their land, labor being abundant; here it is to make the most of our labor, land being abundant.\" The first great need was for plows that could cut through the roots of recently cleared forest land or turn the tough sod of the prairies. In 1825 Jethro Wood of Scipio, New York, started to manufacture an iron plow with replaceable parts that was more efficient than any before. A much improved version, made of steel instead of iron, was developed by John Deere of Mo- hne, Illinois; by 1850 the Deere works were turning out 10,000 plows per year. The new plows enabled farmers to plant more land than they could later reap. Many men tried to invent a mechanical reaper to deal with the situation; the most successful was Cyrus McCormick, a Virginia blacksmith. Tak- ing out his first patent in 1834, McCormick continually improved his machine. By 1860 over 100,000 mechanical reapers were in use. They were accompanied by still other inventions: mechanical drills to plant grain, threshing ma- chines, and horse-drawn hay rakes. TRANSPORTATION With rapidly expanding domestic and for- eign markets came great advances in transpor- ^tation. In the decade of the 1850's the United States built the largest merchant marine in the world; inland navigation on canals and rivers reached its highest point; and the new-fangled railroads more than tripled their mileage. Expansion of the Merchant Marine In 1849 Great Britain repealed the Naviga- tion Laws that had given special protection to British ships trading within her empire. The United States, however, continued to allow only its own ships to carry cargoes between American ports. Competing on even terms with British ships in British ports while enjoying an advantage in their own, American ships in- creased in total tonnage from 943,000 tons in 1846 to 2,226,000 tons in 1857. For a few years, vessels flying the Stars and Stripes carried more goods than those flying the Union Jack. The greatest American triumph at sea was the clipper ship, which enjoyed its brief heyday between about 1845 and 1860. The clippers were speciahzed ships, built to carry cargoes of high value and small volume. Characterized by very sharp bows, an immense spread of sail, masts 200 feet high, and QUESTION .

Alarmed by the superiority of American sailing ships, the British concentrated on the development of steamships. Betsveen 1850 and 1860, the proportion of ocean freight carried in steam vessels went from 14 to 28 per cent, and most of this increase was British. By 1860 American shipyards were closing down for want of orders. Inland Navigation During this decade inland navigation reached its peak. The Erie Canal had so much traffic that it had to be widened and deepened. The Great Lakes gained such importance as a water route that 6,000 ships sailed from Chi- cago in a single year. Above all, this was the great period of the Mississippi River traffic. Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi and Huckleberry Finn bear witness to the romance of the great river at this time. Remembering his boyhood in Illinois, Francis Grierson wrote as follows: There were days when I sat for hours on this bluflF [above the river]; the supreme moments came with the passing of boats, such as the War Eagle, the City of Louisiana, or the Post Boy. . . . When a boat made the return journey do%vn stream it put the last touch of enchantment to the face of the waters. It filled me with \\isions of distant worlds as it skimmed the smooth surface, the smoke from the chimneys leaving a long, scattered trail, the white steam puffing out of the \"scape-pipes in rhythmic movements, the paddle wheels throwing out thick showers as the beautiful apparition sped like a dream southward. 326"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"^>^^- J-tt •:i Metropolitan Mu The \"9:45 Accommodation\" by E.L.Henry (above) depicts a scene that was becoming commonplace in pre- Civil War America— the meeting of the horse and buggy and the iron horse. The water traffic on the Great Lakes in 1836 (below) moved east from Detroit to the Erie Canal, then to New York, and finally to Europe. Some of the passenger boats were 350 feel long, although drawing only 5 feet of water; they were described as \"magnificent floating palaces,\" with 60 or 70 staterooms and dining rooms lined with mirrors and hung with crystal chandeliers. But the great days of the river traflBc were numbered. By 1860 the railroad, hke the ocean-going steamship, was coming into its own and would soon make canal and river traflBc obsolete.

By the middle of the nineteenth century passenger and freight cars had assumed something like their mod- ern forms. come an important means of transportation immediately, partly because they aroused op- position. A typical canal man's speech con- tained this passage: Canals, sir, are God's own highway, operating on the soft bosom of the fluid that comes straight from nature. The railroad ... is the Devil's own invention, compounded of fire, smoke, and dirt, spreading its infernal poison throughout the fair countryside. It will set fire to houses along its slimy tracks. ... It will leave the land despoiled, ruined, a desert where only sable buzzards shall wing their loathsome way. Railro ads were ppposed on t he ground tha t such frightful speeds .aa , fifteen, twenty, a nd even thirty miles an hour were against natuj-e and co ntraryTo the^ gll of ' rfvH Early railroads were handicapped by nu- merous practical problems. It was difficult, for instance, to devise suitable rails— rails which would neither spread imder the weight of a train nor bend and come up through the floor of the car. A train was hard to stop: if the brake worked on the engine, the cars piled into it; if the cars were braked first, they dragged back so hard as to break the couplings. Almost everything one takes for granted on raihoads today— brakes, couphngs, headhghts, effective lubrication of the wheels, and safe bridges— had to be worked out by painful trial and error. Furthermore, railroads were extremely expen- sive to build and maintain. The Panic of 1837, caused partly by overcxpansion in canal and turnpike building, made both state governments and private investors wary of sinking money into a new form of transportation. By 1850 many of the technical problems of railroading had been met, and an era of great expansion began. Before 1853 it was impossible to make a continuous journey of as much as 500 miles on any American railroad. By 1860 the Atlantic seaboard and the Mississippi River system were connected by a number of through routes. The railroad network had increased in mileage from 9,000 in 1850 to o\\'er 30,000 in 1860. The new raihoads cost what then seemed colossal sums. The Jrie Railroad cost about $23,000,00 to build, half again as much as the United States paid for New Mexico and CaU- fomia. The raihoad corporations thus became the first outstanding examples of 'Ijig business.\" Linking the Middle West and the Northeast The through lines from fhe East to the Middle \\\\'est completed a development which the Erie Canal had begun: th e r'nn^np':!- of the ^A ppalac hian Mountain barrier. Becaiise of the Mississippi~Kiver system, the natural economic ties of the Middle West had at first been with the South.

Many AmeriCans^IaHTHese qualities, and their num- bers were supplemented by an increasing flood of immigrants. Until about 1800, immigrants to the United States were not numerous, aver- aging about 8,000 persons per year. But during the second quarter of the nineteenth century, a great migration began from Europe to Amer- ica. Between 1840 and 1860 an average of over 200,000 immigrants reached our shores yearly; by the latter date, one out of every eight Amer- icans was foreign-bom. Reasons for Flood of Immigration Most of the immigrants fled poverty or op- pression. In England and Germany the indus- trial revolution put thousands of skilled work- ers out of jobs. Rather than go into factories, Samuel Morse, Artist and Inventor On May 24, 1844, Samuel Finley Breese Morse sent a message over wires stretching 40 mites from Washington, DC, to Baltimore. His words, \"What hath God wrought!\" proved to all that the telegraph was worl<able. The speed of communication leaped forward. One of the first important uses of electricity, the telegraph introduced the electronic age. Morse, its inventor, was immensely honored in his day and earned a lasting place in history. Yet, untrained in science, often ignorant of the principles and theories of his field, he drew heavily on the worl< of others, sometimes without fitting acl<nowledgment. One of his biographers notes: \"Morse was almost blissfully unaware of his own ignorance. . . . He lacked the mechanical sl<ill to make his own materials with any professional finesse.\" It is not hard to understand. Morse was trained in the fine arts. Born in 1791 In a Massachusetts parsonage, he early persuaded his father to send him to Europe to study .painting. He wrote home that his ambition was \"to rival the genius of a Raphael, a Michelangelo, or a Titian.\" He did, in fact, become a highly skilled artist, but the American public would buy only his portraits. They earned him some respect and a fair income, but Morse considered them mere \"copying.\" Spectacularly improvident, he reluctantly took a job teaching sculpture and painting at New York University. There he abandoned brush and palette for batteries and magnets, turning his rooms into a maze of wires. From his experi- ments came the telegraph, and, with his life more than half over, he won success — in a field he never fully understood.

Some immigrants actually came to this coun- try against their will. The German city of Hambm-g, for instance, found it cheaper to ship its paupers to the United States than to keep them in poorhouses or in jails. PubUc and private rebef agencies in Britain provided money for the imemployed to take passage to America rather than go into the dreaded \"work- houses,\" where poverty was treated as though it were a crime. Most immigrants came here, however, in high hopes of a better life. Euro- pean agents of railroad companies and steam- ship lines described America as a land where riches could be had almost for the asking. Several states established immigration agencies to attract foreigners by such inducements as offering the right to vote to newcomers even before they became naturalized. But perhaps the most persuasive inducements to come to this country were the \"America letters\" written by recent immigrants to the folks back in their old homes. The poorest famihes,\" wrote one correspondent, \"adorn the tables three times a day like a wedding dinner— tea, coffee, beef, fowls, pies, eggs, pickles, good bread . . . Say, is it so in England?\" The letters praised not only the prosperity of .\\merica, but its freedom and equahty. Here, they said, there were no class distinctions. No farmer had to tip his hat to the local squire, and workmen could leave jobs if they did not like the boss. Women were not expected to do heavy work in the fields. \"If you wish to be happy and independent, then come here,\" wrote a German farmer from his new home in Missouri. Difficulties Faced by Immigrants The move to America was often diflBcult and dangerous. On the voyage over, immigrants were packed into the steerage under conditions httle better than those on board the ships that brought slaves from Africa. It is estimated that nearly 10 per cent of the steerage passengers died on the way over from malnutrition and disease. Once off the boat, their troubles were not over. They might become the prey of swindlers selUng bogus railroad tickets or \"farms\" that later turned out to be under water. So many people made a business of cheating recent arrivals that a Swedish minister re- marked, \"the American competes with the mosquitoes to bleed the emigrant.\" Even after they had foimd jobs and places to hve, inmii- grants had to deal with the settled prejudices of native Americans. Some pious folk disap- proved of the way German-Americans spent Sunday afternoons hstening to band concerts. American laborers resented the Irish who were often so used to poverty that they could be hired for low wages. Employers were sometimes forced to put signs at factory gates, \"No Irish need apply.\" Irishmen also faced reUgious prej- udice so strong that it frequendy broke out in mob violence. Immigrants met organized opposition from a nation-wide secret society, t he Order of_ ^e St ar-Spangled fa nner, fo unded in 1849.

This was reflected in the appearance of foreign-language newspapers. In New York City alone in 1851 there were seven such papers— four German, one French, one Italian, and one Spanish.

Irnmigrants made many valuable contributions to the_artsjn Amer- ica, to iaumaIisrnrT6~'g dTiC\"ation, a nd to jnveiv, tion. The children of foreign-bom parents were quickly Americanized in the public schools, where they were taught English and learned to get along with children of different backgrounds and upbringing from their own. Negroes in the North There was one group of people in the North whose status resembled the immigrants in that they faced prejudice and dislike, even though their ancestors had been here for several gen- erations—the Negroes. Although they had long since been freed, northern Ne groes ; were gen- erally denied the righ t to vo te and hold pubhc oflSce, Jo enfer the professions andslalle3_crafts , and to sendtfieir children to any but segregated schools^ They had to stand on the outside plat- form on streetcars and use only certain cars on railroad trains. Some states even forbade Ne- groes to enter their borders. Although the abolitionists fought these restrictions and won a few local successes, especially in New Eng- land, northern Negroes on the eve of the Civil War were second-class citizens. THE SOUTH: \"KING COTTON\" AND SLAVERY By the 1850's, British textile machinery had become so efficient that it produced cloth cheap enough to be sold profitably to the poverty- stricken millions of Asia and Africa. The re- sulting demand for raw cotton brought pros- perity to the deep South. In the decade of the 1850's cotton production broke all previous -records. As new plantations were cleared in Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, the yield rose from less than 2,000,000 bales in 1849 to 4,540,000 bales in 1859. Seven-eighths of the world's supply came from the United States, and raw cotton comprised three-fifths of the nation's exports. The 1850's also witnessed a revival of to- bacco^iowing. This resulted from the discovery b yStephen^ Negro overseer in North Carolina, of a new method of curing that greatly im- proved the product. This 'Tsright yellow\" to- bacco could be grown on lighter soils than had been worked formerly, and it was so much better that it sold for four times the former price. The result was a great increase in to- bacco acreage. Because it devoted most of its capital and labor force to the growing of staples, the South did not experience the industrial take-off of the North. It was also out of step with the North in other ways. On three important issues— a protective tariff, internal improvements at fed- eral expense, and the grant of free land to homesteaders— southern opinion was opposed to the dominant sentiment among Northerners. But what most set the South apart from the North— indeed, from most of the civihzed world —was its \"peculiar institution,\" Negro slavery."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"t^- .^ The New York Public Library \"The Peculiar institution\" The feature of slavery that even its defenders condemned vios the slave trade.

Criticism of the system had been silenced in the South. State legislatures made it increas- ingly difficult for an owner to emancipate his slaves, and the lot of free Negroes became worse. Some states went so far as to decree that free Negroes must either go somewhere else or be. sold back into slavery. Negro bondage assumed many forms. Be- tween house servants and their masters and mistresses there was generally a good deal of intimacy and mutual affection. Some slaves, especially in the cities, were skilled craftsmen who were hired out by their masters, and the working force of one of the most successful iron enterprises in the country, the Tredegar Works in Richmond, was entirely Negro. In Savarmah, the crack teams of firemen were Negroes, and their efficiency was a matter of local pride. The overseer of John C. Calhoun's plantation. Fort Hill, was a trusted slave. But most Negroes worked on plantations, and their life was marked by monotony, isolation, hard labor, and discipline. Everything in the plantation system was contrived to make the Negroes dependent and ignorant. They were not allowed to contract vahd marriages, and families could be broken up by sale. They could not leave home without permission or stay out at night after dark. It was forbidden by law to teach a Negro to read. Although the case might seem hopeless, the Negroes themselves never lost the idea of free- dom. As Abraham Lincoln once remarked, \"the most dumb and stupid slave that ever toiled for a master does constantly know that he is wronged.\" A favorite Biblical hero was Moses, who led his people from bondage, as can be seen in the chorus of the noble spiritual, \"Go Down, Moses\": Go down, Moses, Way down in Egypt's land. Tell old Pharaoh, \"Let my people gol\" The few men who owned Negroes in quan- tity apparently made money out of the slave system. The rise in the price of \"prime field hands\" from $300 in 1790 to $1,800 in 1860 was evidence that slave labor was a valuable com- modity. But the system was costly for the South as a whole. It lowered the dignity of work and drove down the wages of white workingmen. Europeans were so repelled by slavery that immigrants tended to shun the South. So great was the constant fear of insurrection that a good deal of energy was devoted simply to keeping slaves under observation. All Negroes, bond and free, had to be supphed with passes when away from their homes. At night there were patrols, equipped with dogs and guns, to see that Negroes were under cover. Southern Defense of Slavery More and more the South became isolated from world opinion, as slaves were emancipated in the British Empire and most of Latin Amer- ica, and as abolitionist sentiment grew in the North. Instead of backing down or apologizing, some of the best minds in the South developed an elaborate defense of slavery designed to prove the assertion of Calhoun that the insti- tution was \"instead of an evil, a good— a posi- tive good.\" They invented a pseudo-anthro- pology that asserted the Negro to be innately inferior, even a different species of man, and peculiarly adapted to bondage. They insisted that the plantation Negro was \"as happy as a human being can be.\" The master's interest prevents his reducing the slave's allowance or wages in infancy or sickness, for he might lose the slave by so doing.

The slaves are all well fed, well clad, have plenty of fuel and are happy. They have no dread of the future— no fear of want. Contrast this idyllic pictiire, said apologists for slavery, with unemployment, want, pauperism, and crime in industrial cities in the Northeast and in England. They also fovind warrant for slavery in the Bible: the Hebrews had been told to make slaves of the heathen in Palestine, and in the New Testament servants were ex- horted to obey their masters. The defenders of slavery were careful to appeal to the three-quarters of southern whites who owned no Negroes. In the South, according to Calhoun, \"the two great divisions of society are not the rich and poor, but white and black; and all the former, the poor as well as the rich, belong to the upper classes, and are respected and treated as such.\" And in fact the \"pecuhar institution\" gave every white man a certain status in that no matter how lowly he might be, he was above every Negro. NEW INTEREST IN THE CARIBBEAN AND THE FAR EAST After the Mexican War the spirit of manifest destiny subsided in the North, but continued in the South. The portion of the United States suitable for or legally open to slave labor was far smaller than the areas where it was banned either by law or by geography.

It was about the size of two football fields laid side by side. a special agent, Sir Henry Bulwer, to Washing- ton to confer with Secretary of State John M. Clayton. The result was the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, whereby the United States and Britain agreed to support jointly the building of an interocean canal that should not be fortified and should be open to the ships of all nations on equal terms. The Opening of China For centuries the prospect of trade with China had stirred men's imaginations. China produced valuable commodities, and its \"300,- 000,000 customers\" were the largest untapped market in the world. United States trade with China had increased ever since the late eight- eenth century, and by 1850 American chppers carried most of the Chinese tea exported to Europe. American missionaries had followed our traders; 88 of the 150 Protestant missionaries in China in 1851 were from this country. From 1839 to 1842, the British fought the First Opium War with China. When they won, they secured the cession of the port of Hong Kong and fhe grant of various privileges to British, merchants and missionaries, such as \"extraterritoriality\" (the right to be free of the operation of Chinese law). Later the British, aided by other European nations, forced China to grant special privileges to Christian mission- aries, to set aside sixteen \"treaty ports\" ad- ministered by Westerners, and to allow Chinese rivers to be patrolled by European gunboats.

In 1853, howe\\er, a small United States fleet under Commodore Matthew C. Perry appeared in Tokyo harbor. Perry stayed only ten days, but left a message for the Japa- nese government, urging it to open its ports to trade. Next year he appeared with more war- ships, and all guns were stripped for action. Perry used no actual violence. Instead, he brought elaborate presents for the ruler of Japan, including a miniature telegraph and steam railroad. By this mixture of courtesy with the threat of force, the Japanese were at last persuaded to open relations with the rest of the world. SLAVERY DISPUTE REOPENED For a few years the Compromise of 1850 seemed to justify the hope that it would provide a permanent solution of the slavfirjc^ontroversy. In the presidential election Or 1852 jboth major parties stood by its provisions. Democrat Franklin Pierce was elected over the Whig can- didate. General \\\\'infield Scott, partly because some northern Whigs were suspected of aboli- tionist tendencies. Leading businessmen, planta- tion owners, and congressmen joined in con- demning any attempt to \"rock the boat\" by discussion of slavery. But the issue would not stay down.

Most of the free state legisla- tures passed personal hbert>' laws that nullified the Fugitive Slave Law by forbidding state officials to assist in catching runaways. Antislavery feeling in the North was stimu- lated by the pubhcation in 1852 of _Hafriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, a novel portraying slavery atits \"worst, i'lleoook sold 300,000 copies in its first year of pubhcation; a stage version was seen by milhons. Kansas-Nebraska Act, 1854 In 1854 the poUtical truce over slavery ended with the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. This legislation originated with Senator Stephen A. Douglas, the hero of the Compromise of 1850. Douglas did not intend to reopen inter- sectional controversy, but simply to provide for rapid settlement of the trans-Missouri region as an encouragement to building a transcontinental railroad with terminals at St. Louis and Chicago. The law provided that the region west of Iowa and Missouri should be divided into two new territories, Nebraska and Kansas (see map, p. 342). The question of whether or not slavery should exist in the new territories was left to the future decision of the inhabitants, on the principle of popular sovereignty applied to New Mexico in the Compromise of 1850.

By inference this accorded with the southern contention that Congress had no right to legislate slavery out of the territories. The results of the Kansas-Nebraska Act were disastrous. Repeal of the Missouri Compromise was denounced in the North as the violation of a solemn compact and an attempt to extend 'legalized oppression and systematic injustice over a vast territory yet exempt from these ter- rible evils.\" The South continued to demand that the North recognize the rights of slave- holders in the territories of the United States. Settlers started at once to move into the Kansas Territory. It became a race to see wheth- er the majority would come from the slave or free states. Northern settlers were assisted by an abolitionist organization, the Emigrant Aid So- ciety, which supplied wagons, tools, hvestock, farm machinery— and rifles. Meanwhile a pro- slavery secret society, the Blue Lodge, sent armed men from Missouri into Kansas. The struggle between the proslavery and antislavery factions began to assume the proportions of a war. The Election of 1856 The violence in \"bleeding Kansas\" reached its height on the eve of the presidential election of 1856. In the t\\vo years since the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the Whig party had broken up because of friction between pro- slavery \"Cotton\" Whigs of the South and anti- slavery \"Conscience\" Whigs of the North. To fill the void, two new parties appeared— the Ameri- can and the RepubUcan. The American party, composed of Know Nothings plus some ex- Whigs, attempted to divert men's minds from the slavery issue by whipping up feeling against immigrants. Its candidate in 1856 was former President Fillmore. The basic principle of the Repubhcans (who took their name from the part)' of Thomas JeflFerson ) was \"free soil\"— keep slavery out of the territories. Free soil appealed both to abolitionists, who did not like slavery, and to many white farmers and laborers who feared that slavery would lower their standard of hving. Strongly organized in every free state, the Republicans nominated a popular hero, General John C. Fremont. Meanwhile, the Democrats followed the practice of dodging the slavery issue. To balance the fact that Southerners dominated the party, the nomination went to a Northerner, James Buchanan, of Pennsylvania. Though polling a minority of the popular vote, the Democrats won the election with 174 electoral votes for Buchanan against 114 for Fremont and 8 for Fillmore. The result of the election of 1856 was ominous in that the voting was clearly sectional. The Democrats swept the South and gained enough votes to win. Fremont won tvvo-thirds of the electoral votes of the free states. The Dred Scott Decision, 1857 In his inaugural address in March 1857, President Buchanan suggested that the question of the status of slavery in the territories be settled by the Supreme Court. Buchanan had foreknowledge that the Court was soon to de- liver an opinion on this question in the case of Dred Scott v. Sandford. Dred Scott was a slave taken by a former master from the state of Missouri into territory closed to slavery by the Missouri Compromise and then brought back. For over ten years, Scott, with the financial sup- port of abolitionists, sued for freedom on the ground that residence in free territory released him from slavery.

Dred Scott had no right to sue in a federal court, Taney claimed, because the founders of the United States did not intend Negroes to be citizens. The Missouri Compromise ban on slavery north of the 36° 30' line was unconstitu- tional since Congress had no right to prohibit slavery in the territories. Such a prohibition, argued Taney, denied slaveholders their equal rights in the pubUc domain. Instead of settling the slavery dispute, the Dred Scott decision made it more bitter.

THE LrNCOLN-DOUGLAS DEBATES The question of slavery in the territories was now in almost hopeless confusion. The Dred Scott decision, supported in the South, was flatly opposed by the Republicans, dominant in the North. But what about the principle of popular sovereignty? Did the Dred Scott decision forbid the peopjp of a terri iorv to decide whether the v wanted slavery ? This was the most important issue in the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858. Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln were rival candidates for senator from Illinois, Douglas having served in the Senate for twelve years. Known to his followers as \"the Little Giant\" because of his small stature and great force of character, Douglas had made a national reputation by his devotion to the principle of popular sovereignty. The most prominent Dem- ocrat in Congress, he hoped to be elected President in 1860. Abraham Lincoln, his Repub- lican opponent, was a comparative unknown. The height of his political career had been a single undistinguished term in the House of Representatives. A former Whig who had de- fended the Compromise of 1850, even to en- forcing the Fugitive Slave Law, Lincoln was late in joining the Repubhcan party. Yet he had a large local following and a reputation as a clever lawyer and keen debater. The personal contrast between the two men was striking. Douglas, \"a short, thick-set burly man, with a large round head, heavy hair, dark complexion, and a fierce bulldog look,\" radiated success. He dressed in southern plantation style, wearing a fine broadcloth suit, clean linen, and a broad-brimmed felt hat.

Helper attacked slavery above all because it enriched a few \"slaveocrats\" at the price of dooming non-slaveholding whites to \"galling poverty and ignorance.\" He called on small farmers to revolt against \"the lords of the lash,\" to tax slavery out of existence, and to send all the Negroes back to Africa. By its threat of internal disunion. The Impending Crisis alarmed leaders of the South even more than Uncle Tom's Cabin. Southern states banned the book from the mails, while the Republican party distributed 100,000 copies as a campaign document. The Election of 1860 As the election of 1860 approached, the Democrats split over the issue of slavery in the territories. A northern wing of the party nomi- nated Douglas for the presidency and backed popular sovereignty; a southern wing nominated John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky and sup- ported the Dred Scott decision. A third group, the Constitutional Union party, especially strong in the border states, nominated John Bell of Tennessee and attempted to avoid the slavery issue. This party was composed mostly of former southern Whigs. With such division among their opponents, the way was wide open for the Republicans. They made good use of their opportunity. Their platform was designed to attract votes from many quarters. Although continuing to demand exclusion of slavery from the territories, it an- Everett 39 lUI Johnson This is the momentous election over which the Union was divided. Note the severe sectional division: the North for Lincoln, the South for Breckinridge, the border states, hoping to avoid trouble, voting for Bell or for Douglas. gled for conservative support by denying any intention to disturb slavery in the southern states and by denouncing John Brown's raid as \"among the gravest of crimes.\" The degree to which former Whigs had moved into positions of leadership in the Repubhcan party was shown by the way the platform emphasized an updated version of Henry Clay's American System, including a protective tariff, free home- steads for actual settlers, and federal funds for internal improvements, including a railroad to the Pacific. It sought to attract recent immi- grants by denouncing Know-Nothing attempts to make naturalization more difficult. In choosing a candidate the Republicans passed over the more prominent William H. Seward, senator from New York, and nominated Lincoln. They tried to play down the slavery issue by imitating the \"Tippecanoe and Tyler too\" campaign of 1840. There were torchhght parades with boys carrying rails and singing about \"Honest Abe the Railsplitter,\" who was bom in a log cabin.

Although the campaign was one of the most important in om- history, pubhc attention, at least in the North, was diverted from politics by events that now seem of minor importance: the launching of the \"colossal\" steamship Great Eastern (would it break in two?); the visit of the Prince of Wales (would he marry an American girl? ) ; a delegation from Japan (would they leam American ways?). The election turned out to be a Republican \\ictory. Although receiving a minority of the popular vote, Lincoln gained a clear majority in the electoral college over the combined votes of all three of his opponents by carrying every free state except New Jersey, where the electoral vote was divided bet\\veen him and Douglas. Breckinridge carried the deep South, while Bell and Douglas divided the border states. Secession of the Deep South The Republican victory caused great alarm in the deep South, the realm of \"King Cotton.\" Leadership there passed to extremists, the so- called \"fire-eaters,\" some of whom had long been threatening secession. They looked on Lincoln"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"From Compromise to Conflict 343 as \"a baboon, a wild man from nowhere,\" and \"a daring and reckless leader of the abolition- ists.\" They predicted that his election meant abolition and slave insurrections. Albert Gallatin Brown, a Mississippi senator, told a southern audience: The North is accumulating power, and it means to use that power to emancipate your slaves. When that is done, no pen can describe, no tongue depict, no pencil paint the horrors that will overspread this country. . . . Disunion is a fearful thing, but emanci- pation is worse. Better leave the Union in the open face of day, than be lighted from it at midnight by the incendiary's torch. During the four-month interval between Lincoln's election in November 1860 and his inauguration in March 1861, the seven states of the deep South seceded. Their secession was based on the theory of states' rights: the Con- stitution was a contract between sovereign states; the free states had broken the contract by refusing to enforce the Fugitive Slave Law and by denying the southern states their equal rights in the territories; therefore the southern states were justified in resuming their \"separate and equal place among nations.\" They did not long remain separate, but formed a new union, the Confederate S_t ates j)f America, calling on the other slave states to join them. Uneasy Truce The seceding states were able to leave the Union and to form a new federation without interference. President Buchanan was an elderly man, and his party had been repudiated at the polls. In any case he was ill-equipped to deal with the crisis; hitherto he had always deferred to the southern point of view on national issues. He denied that the southern states had a right to secede, but saw no way in which the govern- ment could force a state back into the Union. Meanwhile there were last-minute attempts at compromise, of which the most promising was a proposal by Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky. The keystone of the Crittenden Compromise was the re-estabhshment of the 36° 30' hne in the territories, with slavery per- mitted south of it. Lincoln, perhaps mistakenly, refused to go along with this on the ground that he would be repudiating the most fimda- mental principle of the RepubHcan party, free soil, before he had even taken office. When Lincohi reached Washington in late February 1861, everything hung fire. While seven slave states had seceded, eight still re- mained in the Union (see map, p. 391). Al- though the North generally denied the right to leave the Union, there was apparently little desire to fight to force them back in. General Winfield Scott expressed widespread sentiment when he said, \"Wayward sisters, depart in peace.\" Few men had confidence in Lincoln's ability to deal with the secession crisis. Even his own followers regarded him as a \"crude, small-time politician.\" Seward, whom he ap- pointed Secretary of State, offered to write the inaugural address for him and apparently ex- pected to act as a sort of prime minister. Lincoln's First Inaugural Address set forth a policy which differed little from that of Bu- chanan. Secession, he said, was wrong; it was a blow at the basic democratic principle that the will of the majority should prevail. Yet Lincoln suggested no active measures to force the Con- federate States back into the Union. He pro- posed only to hold mifitary posts not yet taken by the Confederates, to enforce federal laws where federal agents were not \"obnoxious\" to the local population, and to deUver the mail \"unless repelled.\" Although refusing any con- cessions regarding slavery in the territories, Lincoln had no objection to a constitutional amendment forbidding federal interference with slavery in the southern states. He finally pleaded that North and South be \"not enemies, but friends.\""},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"344 Division and Reunion Outbreak of War The first problem that Lincohi faced was what to do about the two southern fortresses still in federal control— Fort Pickens, in Florida, and Fort Sumter, on an island in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. Fort Sumter was running short of supplies, and a relief ship sent by Buchanan in January had been turned back by gunfire from shore batteries. After agonizing discussions with his cabinet, Lincoln decided to send proNisions to the Fort Sumter garrison, this being in line with the policies laid down in his inaugural address. He let the Confederate authorities know in advance what he was going to do. Thus he put Jefferson Davis, the Presi- dent of the Confederacy, over a barrel. If Davis allowed the fort to be provisioned, he would appear to be giving in to Lincoln. If he ordered that Fort Sumter or the relieving ships be fired on, he would be judged guilty of starting war. Davis chose the latter course, and authorized the mihtary forces in Charleston to attack be- fore the rehef ships arrived. On April 12, 1861, shore batteries opened fire; after forty hours of bombardment Fort Sumter surrendered. When the news of the attack reached the North, there was httle more talk of letting the wayward sisters depart in peace. Instead, there was a spontaneous outbreak of patriotism such as the country had never before seen. \"I never knew what popular excitement could be,\" wrote a Bostonian to a friend in England. \"The whole population, men, women, and children, seem to be in the streets with Union flags and favors. . . . Nobody holds back.\" When Lincoln called for 75,000 men to suppress rebellion, many more volunteered than could be organized or equipped. There was a similar wave of feeling in the South. Faced \\vith the prospect of obeying Lin- coln's order and fighting their neighbors, many Southerners who disapproved of secession and disliked slavery nevertheless joined the Confed- eracy. On April 4, a Virginia convention called to consider secession had voted strongly against it, but now it reversed its decision. Virginia left the Union and joined the Confederacy, along with North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas (see map, p. 342). Why a Civil War? E\\'er since the Civil War broke out, men have debated why the South left the Union and embarked on the perilous experiment of war. The basic cause of the separation was probably that stated by Lincoln in his First Inaugxiral: \"One section of our country believes that slavery is right, and ought to be extended, while the other believes that it is wrong, and ought not to be extended.\" But if one looks closer, one wonders about this. The actual dispute was not over slavery as such, but over slavery in the territories, where geography made the slave system unprofitable. For the Republican party to insist that slavery be banned there was (as Daniel Webster said in 1850) to \"needlessly re- enact an ordinance of nature.\" For Southerners to demand that slavery be permitted there was to insist on a meaningless right: by secession they would probably lose all rights in the territories in any case. The fact is that both sides had come to the point where rational discussion was no longer possible. Agencies of communication had broken down with the sepa- ration of the major Protestant churches into northern and southern branches and, above all, with the disappearance of the \\\\'hig part>' and the spht among the Democrats. Heretofore, political parties had been the principal agency in compromising sectional disputes. Although slavery was probably the principal cause of secession, it was not the only one. The South was falling behind the North in wealth and population, and there was a tend- ency to blame this, as South Carolina had done at the time of the nullification crisis thirty years"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"From Compromise to Conflict 345 before, on the protective tarifF. Once outside the Union, the South would no longer have to pay \"tribute\" to northern industrialists and bankers. The alleged basis for secession was states' rights, as can be seen by the South's favorite name for the ensuing struggle, \"the War Be- tween the States.\" But the Confederacy had many aspects of a nation. Its national flag, the \"Stars and Bars,\" and its songs, \"Dixie\" and \"The Bonnie Blue Flag,\" inspired national patriotism. The 'lost cause\" was only oflBcially based on the legal abstraction of state sovereignty; in fact, it was the cause of a nation struggling to be free, and the war has been called with some justice \"the War for Southern Independence.\" In risking war against a much stronger foe, Southerners labored imder a series of miscon- ceptions. Many of them thought that the North would not fight, and the first Confederate Secretary of War predicted that he would be able to wipe up \\^'ith his pocket handkerchief every drop of blood spilled as a result of seces- sion. Even if war came, Southerners expected to win. They beheved that their men were superior to those of the North in martial virtues; they were defending their homes and every- thing that they held most dear; and they ex- pected foreign aid. In 1855 a South Carolina senator had explained why \"King Cotton\" would rescue the South: Should they make war on us, we could bring the whole world to our feet. What would happen if no cotton was furnished for three years? . . . Eng- land would topple headlong and carry the whole civilized world with her. No, you\" dare not make war on cotton. No power on earth dares make war on it. Cotton is king. Finally, as Lincoln's call for three-month volunteers indicates, no one foresaw the length and the bitterness of the war. If the North had reahzed that it was going to cost the hves of 360,000 of their young men to subdue the Confederacy, there might have been more ardent search for compromise or even accept- ance of peaceable secession. If the leaders of the Confederacy had foreseen that the war would bring utter defeat, devastation, and destruction of their entire social system, they would certainly have thought twdce before firing the first shot.

It is a struggle for maintaining in the world that form of government whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men . . . to afford all an unfettered start, and a fair chance in the race of life. ABRAHAM LINCOLN, 1861 The great struggle that began after the fall of Fort Sumter has been termed \"the last of the old wars and the first of the new.\" It was the last great war in which infantry was equipped with muzzle loaders and cavalry played a major role. It was the last great war in which chival- rous respect for the enemy was a commonplace. Many oflScers on both sides had been personally acquainted, often as West Point cadets, and they treated each other with courtesy even after hostihties began. This attitude often extended to the enlisted men. It proved almost impossible to prevent pickets from fraternizing. When Union and Confederate armies were in contact for any length of time, there was constant ex- change of \"Yankee\" coffee and sugar for \"Rebel\" tobacco. In other aspects the Civil War was the first modem war. It was the first in which railroad lines were vital, the first in which telegraph lines, ironclad ships, and observation balloons were used as a matter of course. It foreshadowed the First World War, since the armies often dug in, and sometimes fought from elaborate trenches. It also represented a step toward the modem concept of \"total war,\" with less and less distinction betsveen civilians and soldiers. This was especially true of the South. The Con- federacy became a \"nation in arms,\" with men from seventeen to fifty conscripted into the army, farmers told what to plant, and women bearing a large part of the burden of keeping the troops suppbed with clothing and medical supplies. In the latter years of the war, southern civihans suffered terribly as Union armies pur- sued a \"scorched earth\" policy and deliberately devastated areas through which they marched. Before the war, the United States Army numbered only 11,000 men, mostly stationed on the western frontier. Yet North and South eventually fielded armies numbering hundreds of thousands. Although these troops often lacked discipUne, no soldiers ever fought more stub- bornly on the field of battle.

HUtorical Society, Bermuda as Gettysburg and Chickamauga, 30 per cent of the soldiers were killed or wounded, yet the beaten army kept its organization. COMPARISON WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR In the Civil War the position of the Con- federacy was somewhat similar to that of the United States in the Revolution. The South- erners, fighting for independence on home soil, could win simply by holding out against north- em attacks. As an agricultural region with poor communications and few big cities, the South, like the United States in 1776, could not be paralyzed by a blow at a vital center. The North enjoyed certain advantages similar to those Britain enjoyed in the Revolution. It was supe- rior in resources of every sort— men, money, transportation facilities, food, and manufac- tiuing (study the chart, p. 356). The federal government, like the British, was a going con- cern, while the government of the Confederacy had to be created overnight. This parallel between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War is by no means complete. The Americans won the Revolutionary War partly because of aid from France, but the Confederacy had to fight alone. In the Revolu- tion, American civil and mihtary leadership was superior to that of Great Britain. In the Civil War, the South had better generals, especially at first, but as time passed the North found able commanders too. As to nonmilitary leadership, Lincoln proved himself more able than JeflFerson Davis. Finally, the northern chances of victory in 1861 were better than those of Britain in 1776 because in the earher struggle America had been protected by the Atlantic Ocean. The Con- federacy was open to attack by land, and its long coastline made it vulnerable by sea. STRATEGY: NAVAL OPERATIONS Hostilities in the Civil War extended from southern Pennsylvania to New Mexico. In scores of battles the forces engaged were more numer- ous than those that fought at Saratoga or York- town. In spite of its size, however, the basic strategy of the war was relatively simple. The Union forces set out to accomphsh three great objectives: (1) blockade Confederate ports; (2) cut the South apart— first by way of the Mississippi, and then again through Tennessee and Georgia; and (3) take Richmond, the Con- federate capital. The Union Blockade When Lincoln proclaimed a blockade of southern ports five days after Fort Sumter fell, he seemed guilty of ridiculous optimism. To patrol a coast 3,500 miles long, the United States had 40 wooden ships, manned by fewer than 1,500 men. But the North was the seafaring section of the coimtry; the American merchant marine was near its height; and Gideon WeUes, Secretary of the Navy, was one of the most energetic men in Lincoln's cabinet. Eventually the federal navy numbered over 700 ships, manned by 50,000 men. By the end of 1862, every major southern port was captiu-ed or blockaded. This reduced imports and exports"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"The Civil War and Reconstruction 349 to what could be carried in \"blockade runners\" —small, fast vessels, designed to sneak through openings in the sandbars that provide much of the South with a double coastline. Although some blockade runners were amazingly success- ful, they could not begin to replace the regular commerce of the South. Southern trade shrank to a fraction of what it had been before the war, and Confederate armies were deprived of ade- quate supplies of boots, clothing, and medicine. Furthermore, the great Union blockading fleet forced the Confederacy to keep thousands of men away from major battlefields to guard the coast. Even so, Union forces carried on success- ful amphibious operations against southern ports; the most notable were David Farragut's bold expeditions against New Orleans in 1862 and Mobile in 1864. To break the blockade became a major aim of the small Confederate navy. In March 1862, a strange craft emerged from the naval station at Norfolk, Virginia. On the hull of the Merri- mac, a former federal steam frigate now re- named the Virginia, the Confederates built an iron superstructure and affixed a ram. The Virginia easily sank two wooden ships of a Union naval squadron. While Lincoln and his cabinet were debating whether it might be necessary to evacuate Washington, Southerners predicted that the Virginia would \"sweep the Federal fleet from off the seas\" and \"levy toll on every northern seaport.\" When the Confederate ship reappeared, however, she was met by a new federal iron- clad, the Monitor. The Monitor was easier to handle than the Virginia, and her guns were mounted in a revolving turret. The two ships pounded each other for four hours without inflicting serious damage, but this first battle between ironclads may be regarded as a victory The Monitor was an uncomfort- able ship since its hold was hot and airless.

The Virginia retired, never to appear again, while northern shipyards started to turn out dozens, of Monitors. Attempts to Break the Blockade With few shipyards of its own, the Con- federacy tried to obtain warships abroad. EfiForts to buy powerful rams, designed to destroy the blockading fleet, were unsuccessful, but the Confederacy secretly purchased in England several cruisers that preyed on northern ship- ping. One of them, the Alabama, captured or destroyed 63 vessels. To avoid Confederate cruisers, hundreds of American ships were sold to foreign owners or registered under other flags. Thus the United States merchant marine suffered a blow from which it did not recover for over half a century. THE WAR IN THE WEST There were two major areas of land warfare: the territory west of the Appalachians, centering at first on the Mississippi, and the eastern front, centering on the area between the two capitals, Washington and Richmond. Although Union armies lost battles in the West, they won every major campaign. In little more than two years they cut the Confederacy in two, and by the end of the war had cut through it again. In 1861 the war in the West was devoted to a struggle for control of the border states. In spite of strong pro-Confederate minorities, both Kentucky and Missouri were cleared of Con- federate troops. The western counties of Vir- ginia, soon to become the state of West Virginia, were also detached from the Confederacy. Thus the South was deprived of a strong line of defense along the Ohio River. In the following year the Confederacy was squeezed from both north and south. The Union advance began when forces under General Ulysses S. Grant attacked Fort Henry on the Tennessee River and Fort Donelson on the Cumberland. (For the campaigns of the Civil War, study the maps on p. 352.) First taking Fort Henry, Grant surrounded Fort Donelson in February 1862. When asked on what terms he would accept surrender. Grant sent the famous answer: \"No terms except unconditional sur- render can be accepted. I propose to move immediately upon your works.\" When the for- tress fell, with 12,000 Confederates and 40 cannon captured, it opened the way for a Union advance southward toward Corinth, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee. This advance was marked by the bloody, two-day battle of Shiloh, or Pittsburg Landing, in April 1862. Grant's army was surprised by a Confederate force imder General Albert Sidney Johnston, but escaped disaster when the Confederate general was killed, and Grant managed to bring up rein- forcements. By the end of 1862, Union armies had occupied all of western Tennessee and were probing southward into the state of Mississippi. Meanwhile Admiral David Farragut had taken New Orleans, and Union armies prepared to advance northward from there. Fall of Vicksburg and Battle of Chattanooga, 1863 As the year 1863 commenced, the Union success on the Mississippi River front depended on taking the city of Vicksburg. This town was a natural fortress, protected by high bluffs to- ward the river and by a maze of watercourses and swamps to the north. In late 1862 and early 1863, forces under Grant made five unsuccessful attempts to approach it. Finally, in May 1863, Grant embarked on one of the most daring campaigns in military history. After transporting his forces down the Mississippi River to just below Vicksburg, he started inland. Against the established rules of military science and the unanimous advice of his staff, Grant cut loose from his base of supphes."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"\\x^ The Library of Congress Union soldiers wait it out in the trenches. The war began as a war of movement, but dwindling southern forces eventually dug in to hold their lines. Nine months in the trenches ensued when Lee's forces met the Union army outside Richmond. Such extensive trench warfare anticipated that of World War I. The Union soldiers were allowed only such food as they could carry or get along the way. Grant's personal baggage consisted of a tooth- brush. The Confederate commander of Vicksburg at first stayed behind his fortifications, thinking Grant was trying to trick him into taking to the open field; he then struck vainly at Grant's non- existent line of communication. The Union forces reached Jackson, the capital of Missis- sippi, almost without opposition. Finally, Grant turned back and fought his way to the outskirts of Vicksburg. In 18 days his troops marched 200 miles, fought five major battles, and de- feated forces larger than their own. Late in May, he laid siege to Vicksburg, and on July 4, the town fell. Five days later Port Hudson, the last Confederate post on the Mississippi River, also surrendered. Union forces attempted now to cut through the Confederacy again by way of eastern Ten- nessee and Georgia. Here the first key position was Chattanooga, where the Tennessee River runs near a gap southward toward Atlanta. In September 1863, General William S. Rosecrans, commanding a large Union force, maneuvered the Confederates out of the city. After Rosecrans suffered a severe defeat at the bloody battle of Chickamauga, Confederate troops besieged the Union army in Chattanooga and cut off its sup- plies. The Union cause was saved when Grant arrived in October. New supply routes were opened and the Confederate forces were driven from the heights around Chattanooga.

In November his army started southward and for nearly a month was cut off from communication with the North.

Sherman's report of the campaign said, \"I estimate the damage done to Georgia and its mihtary resources at $100,000,000, at least $20,000,000 of which has inured to our advan- tage and the remainder is simply waste and de- struction.\" On December 20, 1864, Union troops marched into Savannah. In February 1865, they started northward, treating South Carolina, the state which had led the secession movement, as harshly as Georgia. When southern resistance finally collapsed in April, Sherman's force was less than a hundred miles from the Union army that had driven Lee out of Richmond. THE WAR IN THE EAST When Virginia joined the Confederacy, the capital was moved to Richmond. From a mili- tary point of view this may have been a blunder. The city was close to the northern border of the Confederacy and vuhierable to attack, yet it was a matter of pride to defend it at all costs. The South poured out more blood in the defense of Richmond than may have been justified. On the other hand, the success of Confederate armies in this eastern theater of war was ex- traordinary. Repelling one Union advance after another, they prevented the fall of the Confed- erate capital imtil the very end of the war. Southern victories in the East were largely the result of the genius of General Robert E. Lee and his \"right arm,\" General Thomas J. \"Stone- wall\" Jackson. Through knowledge of the ter- rain, rapidity of movement, and the ability to inspire troops to feats of endurance and heroism, these two inflicted defeats on Union forces sometimes twice as numerous as their owm. Their tactics in such encouiiters as the second battle of Bull Run and Chancellorsville have become classic examples of brilliant general- ship. In the North African campaigns of World War II, both German General Erwin Rommel and his British opponent General Harold Alex- ander revealed that they had profitably studied the campaigns of Lee and Jackson. Confederate Failures: Antietam, 1862, and Gettysburg, 1863 Southern good fortune in the East did not include victories outside the Confederacy. Lee's two attempts to invade the North were both repulsed.

Caught with the Potomac at his back and facing much larger forces than his own, Lee did well to save his army. In June 1863, he again crossed the Potomac. As he moved into southern Pennsylvania, panic seized the North. As far pway as Massachusetts, governors declared a state of emergency and asked for the protection of federal troops. Lee was shadowed, however, by a Union army under General George G. Meade. An accidental clash between small units at Gettysburg developed into a great three-day battle. As it happened, Union soldiers occupied a position of great strength, the crest of a low ridge. Desperate Confederate attacks, reaching a peak in General George E.

Four previous generals— George McClel- lan, John Pope, Ambrose Bumside, and Joseph Hooker— had been put in command after vic- tories elsewhere, only to meet defeat at the hands of Lee. In May 1864, Grant, moving southward toward Richmond, was intercepted by the Confederate army, fighting from pre- pared positions. But Grant kept advancing, even though in a single month of fighting he lost as many men as there were in Lee's entire force. Eventually, he laid siege to Richmond from the south, and the two armies fought nine months of trench warfare. With superior numbers Grant gradually lengthened his lines, while Union armies cut off supplies to Richmond. Finally, Lee was forced to evacuate the Con- federate capital. Union troops barred his escape westward; his men were starving. Grant urged Lee to surrender in order to prevent \"further effusion of blood.\" The two men met at the village of Appomatto.x Court House in April 1865. Grant offered Lee generous terms: his soldiers might go home on giving their word not to fight again; the officers might keep their side arms and the cavalry their horses.

The general who ordered this mark of respect later wrote: Before us in proud humiliation stood the em- bodiment of manhood: men whom neither toils and suffering, nor the fact of death, nor disaster, nor hopelessness could bend from their resolve; stand- ing before us now, thin, worn, and famished, but erect, and with eyes looking level into ours . . . was not such manhood to be welcomed back info a Union so tested and so assured? Within a month after Appomatto.\\, General Joseph Johnston and the other Confederate armies surrendered. The long, bitter struggle was over. BEHIND THE LINES At first both North and South relied on volunteers to fill the ranks of their armies, but before long both resorted to conscription. The Confederacy, with less than a third the man- power of the North, started drafting men in April 1862. In March 1863, the United States Congress passed a Conscription Act that pro- vided for an incomplete and unfair use of the draft. A draftee was permitted to avoid military service by paying $300 or by hiring a substitute. Naturally, those without money to buy their way out resented this arrangement, which made it \"a rich man's war and a poor man's fight.\" Opposition to conscription caused the terrible draft riots in New York City in July 1863. For four days, mobs of men and boys terrorized the city, killing and plundering. Besides the draft, the North also used a system whereby enlistees were paid a lump sum when they joined the army. Bounties offered by federal, state, and municipal governments some- times totaled $1,500 for a single three-year en- listment. This led to the practice of \"bounty- jumping,\" whereby a man would enlist, collect his bounty, and then desert only to re-enlist elsewhere. Nevertheless, bounties proved an effective means of luring volunteers from north- em farms and factories and even from Europe. President Lincoln at first resisted appeals to open the ranks of the Union armies to Negroes, on the grounds that such a move would be resented in the border states and might promote a slave insurrection in the South. Later the policy was changed, and nearly 200,000 Negroes, both freemen from the North and former slaves from the South, enlisted for mili- tary service. In addition, 150,000 Negroes served in the quartermaster and engineering corps. Some regiments of the \"United States Colored Troops\" distinguished themselves in combat, and 22 Negroes won the Congressional Medal of Honor."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"resoOrces of the union and confederacy NATIONAL TOTAl in"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"The Civil War and Reconstruction 357 surpluses that were sold abroad. \"King Wheat,\" it was said, defeated \"King Cotton.\" Finances and Taxation The Confederacy was less able to finance a war than the North. It had intended to get money by selling cotton in Europe; when the Union blockade prevented this, bankruptcy was inevitable. The Confederate and southern state governments, hke the United States in the Rev- olution, simply ran the printing presses. They issued billions of dollars in paper money that eventually became worthless. The Confederate government was able to keep going only by forcing civilians to accept its worthless currency in exchange for goods, and by collecting ta.xes in produce instead of money. The North, with far greater resources of everv' kind— western mines, foreign markets, more capital to begin wdth— was far more suc- cessful in financing the war. About a quarter of the four billion dollars needed came from taxation, the rest from borrowing and issuing paper money. For the first time. Congress levied an income tax, which eventually amounted to 5 per cent on incomes from $600 to $5,000 and 10 per cent on incomes over that. In addition, excise taxes were le\\aed on almost every con- ceivable article, such as food, tobacco, clothing, alcoholic beverages, and railroad tickets. Fi- nally, there was a great increase in the protec- tive tariff. The Republican platform of 1S60 had promised higher duties; e\\en before the war started, the tariff was raised by the Morrill Act of 1861. Other acts pushed duties still higher until by 1864 they averaged 47 per cent, the highest level yet. Although the \\\\artime tariffs brought in revenue, their principal purpose was to encourage American manufacturers to greater production, so that the army would not be dependent on imports from other countries. During the war the federal government issued over tvvo and a half biUion dollars' worth of bonds. Like the Confederacy, it also inflated the currency, but not to the same degree. This was done by issuing about four hundred million dollars' worth of \"greenbacks\"— paper money not backed by gold and silver. These fluctuated in value according to the success or failure of the Union armies; at their lowest point they were worth about 35 cents in gold. Such inflation was in effect a forced loan from all people who used greenbacks as currency. To encourage the sale of bonds and provide a better currency, Con- gress in 1863 passed the National Banking Act. This law did not get into full operation during the war and will therefore be treated later. New Fields for Women The importance of activity behind the lines was sho\\\\-n by the entrance of women into new fields. In the South they often ran plantations after the owners and overseers left for the front. They produced goods for the army, especially clothing. \"Every household,\" wrote a southern girl, \"now became a miniature factory in itself, with its cotton, cards, spinning wheels, warping- frames, looms, and so on.\" In the North the mechanical reaper and the \"sulky\" plow (in which the plowman rode the plow itself) en- abled women to take the place of sons and husbands in the service. On both sides, women took over much of the nursing, a task formerly reserved for men. Dorothea Dix turned from her work with the insane to offer her serv-ices to the federal gov- ernment. As superintendent of female nurses, she fought red tape, corruption, and prejudice against her sex. Even more effective than Miss Dix in widening the sphere of women in hospital work was Clara Barton, later first president of the American Red Cross.

After duly feeling the bumps and depressions on Clara Barton's head, he gave this advice: \"Throw responsibility on her. As soon as her age will permit, give her a school to teach.\" So at the age of fifteen Clara was put to teaching school. The cure worked, and she was an im- mediate success. After teaching for twenty years, Clara Barton started working for the Patent Office in Washington. Shortly after the Civil War broke out, the Sixth Massachusetts Regiment had to fight its way through Baltimore (where Confederate sympathies were strong) on the way to the capital. They arrived without most of their baggage. Clara Barton saw to it that they were supplied, and this launched her on a new career. By advertising in the newspapers, by badgering officials, and by not taking no for an answer, this little woman with slight build, prominent nose, and flashing brown eyes saw to it that medical supplies and nursing were available to the wounded. She often nursed the men herself. Miss Barton's services to the suffering continued long after the Civil War. She alleviated the suffering of civilians in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. She persuaded a reluctant United States Senate, fearful of \"foreign entanglements,\" to ratify a treaty whereby the United States joined the International Red Cross. As president of the American branch, she saw that the organization helped not only victims of war, but also those of natural disasters, such as floods, epidemics, and famines. In all these activities she showed what a determined and selfless person could do, even in fields not considered \"ladylike\" at the time. (Themes 5 & 7, see p. xii) conditions of Union soldiers. Much of the money came from big sales, known as \"sanitary fairs,\" organized almost entirely by women. It is no wonder that after the war there was a renewed demand that women, along with Negroes, be given the right to vote. GOVERNMENT IN WARTIME During the Civil War the authority of the central governments in both North and South was beyond anything the country had yet seen. The two Presidents, Lincoln and Davis, exerted so much power that both were accused by their own people of acting as dictators. Although founded on the principle of states' rights, the Confederate government assumed immense au- thority, not only in drafting men for military service, but in forcing citizens to give up mules. slaves, wagons, and foodstuffs for the armies. The Union government controlled its people less than the Confederacy, but nevertheless exerted several new powers. Telegraph lines and railroads near the war zones, for instance, were sometimes taken over from private owners and run by the government. Lincoln's Use of Presidential Power Although devoted to the Constitution, Lin- coln extended the power of the presidency beyond anything ever dreamed of by \"King Andrew\" Jackson. During the three-month inter- val between the fall of Fort Sumter and the opening of a special session of Congress in July 1861, he performed actions normally re- served to Congress. He called out volunteers, expanded the regular anny, and spent money that had not yet been appropriated."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"The Civil War and Reconstruction 359 In 1861 there appeared to be a real danger that Mar>'land would secede from the Union and Washington would thereby be isolated in the midst of Confederate territory.

Hun- dreds of sus- pected Confederate sympathizers were jailed without trial and \\\\ithout the right of habeas corpus; opposition newspapers were denied the use of the mails or shut down by troops; the Mar>'land legislature was prevented from sitting. From 1862 on, such repression was less severe, but so-called \"Copperheads\" were sub- ject to arbitrary arrest and imprisonment. Form- ing a secret society, the Knights of the Golden Circle, the Copperheads hindered the war effort by discouraging enlistments and helping Union soldiers to desert. In dealing with alleged Cop- perheads, Lincoln authorized the trial of civil- ians by military courts and suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas where pro-Confederate sympathies were strong. Ex Parte Milligan, 1866 In deciding the case ex parte Milligan in 1866, the Supreme Court condemned Lincoln's use of military courts to try civilians. Milligan was a Copperhead condemned to death by a militar>' court in Indiana. The Supreme Court pointed out that MiUigan had been Hving in a peaceful area where regular courts were oper- ating and had been denied trial by jur>-. It denied that war justified the ignoring of rights guaranteed to the individual by the Constitu- tion: ... it is the birthright of every American citizen when charged with crime, to be tried and punished according to law. ... By the protection of law hu- man rights are secured; withdraw that protection, and they are at the mercy of wicked rulers, or the clamor of an excited people. Although Lincoln agonized over the fact that he denied citizens of the United States their rights and sometimes moderated the actions of overzealous subordinates, he defended his course of action. When federal law was being violated with the purpose of destroying the Union, the President thought that the law of survival overrode the Constitution. \"Are all the laws but one to go unexecuted,\" he asked, \"and the Government go to pieces lest that one be violated?\" Must he shoot a simple-minded sol- dier who deserted and not touch a hair of \"a wily agitator\" who persuaded him? He wrote a friend in 1864: By general law, a limb must be amputated to save a life, but a life is never wisely given to save a limb. I felt that measures, otherwise unconstitu- tional, might become lawful by becoming indispen- sable to the preservation of the Constitution through the preservation of the nation. Lincoln found a basis for acting indepen- dently of Congress and the federal courts be- cause, by the Constitution, the President is \"Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy.\" The constitutional procedures of Congress and the courts are slow, yet war demands quick action. Lincoln's tendency, therefore, was to act on his own authority, although he sometimes asked Congress to approve his actions later. It is still a matter for serious discussion as to whether it was wise or just for Lincoln to exceed his constitutional powers. He created dangerous precedents, but he certainly had no lust for power and no desire to make himself a dictator in the modem sense.

Most Presidents of the United States have felt the grueling pace of the demands of the office. militaristic organization of his followers. The Constitution was stretched,\" said the historian J. G. Randall, \"but not subverted.\" WARTIME DIPLOMACY In no field was Lincoln apparently less fitted for the job of President than in foreign affairs. He had never been abroad and knew no foreign language; there was every reason to agree with Lord Lyons, British minister to Washington, who predicted that Lincoln would be fatally handicapped by \"his ignorance of everything but Illinois village politics.\" Yet in diplomacy, as in other fields, he confounded those who ex- pected him to fail. Although the spoils system forced him to hand out diplomatic posts as political plums, Lincoln's major appointments were good. Seward was a brilliant Secretary of State, whose occasional tendency to rashness was tempered by Lincoln's sober judgment. The key position abroad, minister to England, was held by Charles Francis Adams, the son and grandson of Presidents of the United States, both of whom had also represented this country' in London. Adams knew how to be reasonable without conceding American rights, to be firm without giving offense. Understanding the importance of foreign public opinion, Lincoln sent abroad a number of unofficial \"good will ambassadors.\" An Episcopalian bishop from Ohio worked among British clergjTnen; a Catholic archbishop from New York presented the case of the Union in Catholic countries; Henr>' Ward Beecher, a famous American preacher, addressed large audiences in England; and a former Secretary of the Treasury used his friendships with Euro-"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"The Civil War and Reconstruction 361 pean financiers to create distrust of Confederate bonds. Above all, Lincoln succeeded in foreign affairs because he kept his head and understood how to present the cause of the Union in ways that had wide appeal. \"One war at a time!\" he used to say to followers who were so angry at Britain they were willing to risk hostilities. The principal task of United States diplo- macy during the Civil War was to prevent Britain from giving aid to the Confederacy. The South confidently expected such aid because of British need for her cotton. Furthermore, the British upper classes feared American democ- racy as a standing rebuke to their privileged position, and they would have been glad to see the disintegration of the world's largest republic. British manufacturers expected that an inde- pendent South would be a better market for their goods. Lacking industry, the new nation would be unlikely to levy protective tariffs; indeed, they were forbidden by the Confederate Constitution. The Trent Affair In November 186L an incident brought Great Britain and the United States to the verge of war. A United States warship, cruising the Caribbean, stopped a British steamer, the Trent, and took off two Confederate diplomats, James Mason and John Slidell. The action caused rejoicing in the victory-starved North, and Con- gress voted the captain of the vessel a gold medal. But American joy was matched by a wave of anger in Great Britain. The British government demanded the release of Mason and Slidell; it sent troops to Canada and ordered the British fleet to prepare to go to sea. Lincoln and Seward had to choose between facing a wave of indignation in America if they let the diplomats go or the disaster of war with the strongest naval power in the world if they refused. Fortunately, the recently laid Atlantic cable broke down at this moment and so slowed communications that popular clamor on both sides of the ocean died down. Seward released Mason and Slidell. He sweetened the bitter pill by remarking that he was glad to see Britain defending the rights of neutral ships as the United States had done in 1812. Britain and the Civil War Charles Francis Adams compared the Trent affair to a sharp storm that cleared the air. It became evident that forces pushing Britain to aid the South were balanced by others making for a policy of neutrality.

Upper-class sympathy for the South was bal- anced by the fact that the middle and lower classes favored the North. Many who wished to see England become more democratic agreed with Lincoln that the war was a test of democ- racy. They were not wholly on the Union side, however, until it was clear that the United States was fighting to abolish slavery. Once Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation (see p. 362) there was no further danger that the British government would help the South. A remaining source of friction between England and America arose from the efforts of Confederate agents to buy warships in Britain. Several cruisers were sold to the Confederate"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"362 Division and Reunion navy and left British ports for highly successful careers as commerce destroyers. An even greater threat were the \"Laird rams,\" built in a famous British shipyard and designed for the sole pinr- pose of breaking the Union blockade. Hearing that these ships were ready to sail, Charles Francis Adams bombarded Lord John Russell, British foreign minister, with protests, one of which contained the celebrated remark, \"I need not remind your Lordship that this is war.\" At the last moment the British government bought the rams for its own navy. Britain's refusal to give active aid to the Confederacy persuaded France to remain neu- tral. Napoleon III, the French emperor, was eager to aid the South, but not without British cooperation. Yet, as we shall see, he used the war as an opportunity to estabhsh a govern- ment under his control in Mexico. SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR When the Civil War began, there was sur- prisingly little opinion in the North that it would mean the end of slavery. Lincoln himself was, as we have seen, no abohtionist. He regarded slavery as a moral wrong and a disaster for both Negroes and whites, but as a lawyer he recog- nized the constitutional guarantees of the in- stitution. He was careful to reassure the South on this point, saying that he had \"no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery where it now exists.\" When Union generals freed slaves who had drifted into military posts, Lincoln overruled them. Had he not acted in this way, the northern tier of border states, especially Kentucky, might have joined the Confederacy. Lincoln declared again and again that his \"paramount object\" was \"to save the Union . . . not either to save or destroy slavery.\" But why pin the Union back together with bayonets at frightful cost in money and blood? One answer is easy: patriotism. In the eight\\-odd years since the Americans had declared themselves \"one people,\" preser\\'ation of the Union had become a cause for which men were willing to give their lives. Lincoln maintained also that the struggle to save the Union was of world-wide importance as a test of whether large-scale democracy could 'long endure.\" (Reread the quotation at the head of this chapter.) The Emancipation Proclamation, 1863 As time passed, Lincoln came under in- creasing pressure to turn the war into an aboli- tionist crusade. There was a strong desire to punish the slaveholders of the South and an increasing conviction that the war was worth fighting only if it destroyed an institution that was a complete Wolation of the principles that America was supposed to stand for. Another compelling reason for emancipation was the need to win foreign support. Public opinion in Europe was so strongly opposed to slavery that if the North was fighting to abolish it, no Euro- pean government would dare to aid the Con- federacy. After Lee's defeat at Antietam in 1862, Lincoln announced that he would free the slaves of the Confederacy at the start of the ne.xt year. On January 1, 1863, he issued the famous Emancipation Proclamation, acting un- der his authority as Commander in Chief. This document did not immediately free a single slave, since it applied only to those areas behind Confederate lines. An English editor remarked that the principle behind it \"is not that a human being cannot justly own another, but that he cannot own him unless he is loyal to the United States.\" Even so, the Emancipation Proclama- tion changed the entire character of the war. From that time on. Union armies were fighting to end human bondage. In a mysterious way the Negroes came to know of it, and whenever northern armies occupied southern territory, runaways poured into the Union lines."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"Scene in the House of Representatives, January 31, 1865, on the announcement of the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery in the United States.

[for] the most august and important event in American Legislation and American History since the Declaration of Independence. God Bless the XXXVIIIth Congress! . . .\" The Thirteenth Amendment, 1865 There still remained the problem of slavery in the areas where the Emancipation Proclama- tion did not apply— the border states and those portions of the Confederacy already conquered by Union armies. To deal with them, Lincoln recommended a policy of compensated emanci- pation—setting the slaves free, but paying their owners for them. This scheme was apphed only in the District of Columbia. Elsewhere slavery was abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1865. Thus a war begun simply to save the Union ended as a victory for the abolitionists. LINCOLN FACES THE PEACE In the presidential election of 1864, Lincoln was renominated by his party, which tem- porarily changed its name from Republican to Unionist to attract all who supported the war. The Democrats nominated George B. Mc- Clellan, a popular general who had twice been removed from command by Lincoln.

Second Inaugural Address In his Second Inaugural Address, Lincoln reviewed the causes of the war and looked for- ward to the peace. When he first took oflBce, \"all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert it.\" Yet war broke out. ^^'hy? Because, said the President, \"One side would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish.\" Behind these attitudes was slavery, which the South wished to \"strengthen, perpetuate, and extend,\" while the North \\\\'anted to restrict its spread. (See p. 804.) Although Lincoln believed slavery wrong, he never privately or pubbcly expressed hatred of the slaveholders themselves. In the Second Inaugural, he pointed out that both sides \"read the same Bible and pray to the same God.\""},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"The Civil War and Reconstruction 365 Sliweowners may seem to be violating man's God-given right to freedom, \"but let us judge not that we be not judged.\" It may be, said Lincoln, that the war was a divine vengeance on both North and South for two centuries of wrongs to the Negroes. Lincoln concluded his short address by urging that \"with malice to- ward none, with charity for all,\" Americans should work to \"bind up the nation's wounds,\" and \"do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\" Lincoln's charit)' extended to the defeated South. He directed his generals to offer Con- federate armies liberal terms of surrender. When a crowd with a brass band appeared to cheer him after the fall of Richmond, he asked the musicians to strike up \"Dixie,\" which, he said, was \"now contraband of war.\" He had already made plans to bring the Confederate states back into the Union as soon as possible. Lincoln's Assassination On the night of April 14, 1865, five days after Appomatto.x, Lincoln was assassinated by a fanatical Confederate s>Tnpathizer, John Wilkes Booth. Booth's deed was a tragedy for both North and South because it removed the man best fitted to \"bind up the nation's wounds.\" After Lincoln's death, many who had scorned and ridiculed him changed their minds. One of the most dramatic of these conversions was that of the British humor magazine Punch, which had published cartoons showing the American President as \"a bearded ruffian, vulgar charlatan, and repulsive beast.\" Yet after his assassination a poem in Punch paid him this tribute : Yes, he had lived to shame me from m>- sneer.

When Confederate veterans— tired, ragged, and hungry— went home at the end of the Civil War, they returned to a ruined land. The region through which Sherman had marched \"looked for many miles like a broad, black streak of ruin and desolation— the fences all gone; lonesome smoke stacks, surrounded by dark heaps of ashes and cinders, marking the spots where human habitations had stood.\" In addition to physical damage the South suffered profound dislocation of its economic life. Confederate money was worthless. Southern banks, which had done business in this currency and invested in Confederate bonds, were ruined, ^^'ith the freeing of the slaves the plantation system broke down. Thousands of freedmen were on the move, possessed with the natural idea that the end of slavery meant \"the day of jubilee\" and no more work. Some wandered west because they heard wonderful stories of easy living out there, with hogs lying around \"already baked with the knives and forks sticking in them and fritter ponds everywhere with fritters a-fryin' in them, ponds of grease and money trees.\" Even the many freedmen seeking work could often not find it, because landowners had no means to pay them, and the Negroes had no means to acquire land. The disorganization of southern agriculture was so great that in 1866 the produc- tion of cotton was only half that of 1860. Lincoln and Reconstruction The term \"reconstruction\" might logically be applied to the effort to deal with such south- em problems as war damage, lack of credit, and the changeover from slave labor to free.

He even supported an ill-starred attempt to colonize freedmen in Haiti. Mean\\\\'hile, he helped to push the Thirteenth Amendment through Con- gress so that all Negroes would be free. Beyond that he was willing to let Southerners work out the details of the transition from bondage to freedom, although he urged that hterate freed- men and those who had served in the Union army be granted the franchise. Lincoln's lenient pohcy toward the South was opposed by the so-called Radical Republi- cans, who had the support of the majority in Congress. The Radicals did not share Lincoln's belief that Southerners could immediately be trusted with defining the status of the Negroes or that effective, lo>'al state go\\'emments could be based on 10 per cent of the male population. In any case, they believed that it was for Con- gress rather than the President to determine reconstruction policies. They embodied their opinions in the Wade-Davis Bill of 1864, which provided for much more rigorous conditions for readmitting the rebellious states to the Union. When Lincoln killed the bill by a pocket veto, its authors attacked him in a widely published \"manifesto.\" Accusing the President of a \"studied outrage on the legislative authority of the people,\" the Wade-Da\\is Manifesto de- manded that he \"confine himself to his executive duties . . . and leave political organization to Congress.\" Had Lincoln lived. Congress might well have prevented him from arranging a peace based on \"malice toward none\" and \"charity for all.\" Andrew Johnson's Policies Andrew Johnson, who succeeded to the presidency on Lincoln's death, attempted to carry out his predecessor's policies so far as he understood them, but he was seriously handi- capped. As \"President by accident\" he com- manded little popular following, and as a former Democrat he could not command the support of the Republican majority in Congress. A Ten- nessean who had once owned slaves, he thought that Negroes were by nature inferior to whites. Although able and courageous, John- son was self-righteous, too apt to lose his tem- per, and stubborn where Lincoln had been flexible. In the summer of 1865, Johnson encouraged the southern states to form new state govern- ments. Each state was required to abolish slavery, repeal its ordinance of secession, and repudiate debts incurred in the war. There was general compliance with these terms. The South appeared to be heeding the advice of its most respected leader, Robert E. Lee, who said, \"The war being at an end ... I believe it the duty of every one to unite in the restoration of the country and the re-establishment of peace and harmony.\" When it came to the status of the Negro, however, the new governments acted on the principle stated by the governor of Mississippi: \"Ours is and ever shall be a government of white men.\" While Negroes were given the right"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"to own propert)', to marry within their own race, and to secure protection of the laws, they were nowhere allowed to serve on juries or to vote. No state made provision for Negro schools. In addition to denying the freedmen many of the rights of citizens, southern legislatures passed special laws known as \"Black Codes\" to keep them under control. These laws obliged Negroes to make long-term contracts with em- ployers; those without steady jobs might be arrested as vagrants and their labor sold to the highest bidder. Sometimes they were even bound over to work for their former masters. The new South apparently intended the Negro to be \"an illiterate, unskilled,- propertyless, agri- cultural worker.\" Even some Southerners thought it a blunder to go as far as did the new state constitutions and the Black Codes in placing Negroes in an inferior caste. President Johnson was at fault, too, in not making southern leaders realize that they must accept the fact of defeat and grant more than token rights to Negroes. How little the former Confederacy had \"repented\" seces- sion was revealed in the congressional elections, when most of the men chosen were former Confederate leaders. President Johnson ac- cepted these results, but when the Republican- dominated Congress met in December 1865, it refused to seat the men elected from the South. Insisting that Congress rather than the President had the right and duty to define the terms of readmission of the southern states, congressional leaders formed a Joint Committee on Recon- struction, composed of members of both houses. The Joint Committee drew up bills providing for economic assistance to the freedmen and for federal protection of their rights. These were duly passed and presented to Johnson for his signature. The President vetoed them. He thus antagonized moderate Republicans, and leader- ship in reconstruction passed to the Radicals. The Library of ConRrrs Richmond in ruins after Union capture.

RADICAL RECONSTRUCTION The Radical Republicans included men in- spired by both self-interest and idealism, by desire for partisan advantage, and by genuine concern for the Negroes. Certainly, one of their motives was to keep the Republican party in power. If the southern states were readmitted to the Union immediately, and with Negroes disfranchised, they would probably support the Democratic party, as in 1856 and 1860, and enable it to regain power. To prevent this, the Radicals insisted that Negroes be given the right to vote and that former Confederate leaders be barred from politics.

The cause of the Radicals was strong because they appealed to the principles of the Declaration of Independence: that men had a natural right to equality and that government must rest on consent of the governed. Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts said: [Congress] must see to it that the man made free by the Constitution is a freeman indeed; that he can go where he pleases, work when and for whom he pleases ... go into the schools and edu- cate himself and his children; that the rights and guarantees of the common law are his, and that he walks the earth proud and erect in tlie conscious dignity of a free man. Congressional Elections of 1866: The \"Bloody Shirt\" In the congressional elections of 1866, the President and the Radical Republicans cam- paigned against each other. Johnson hurt his cause by rambling, intemperate, bitter speeches. His opponents made effective use of a technique that came to be known as \"waving the bloody shirt.\" This consisted in deliberately stirring up war hatreds and appealing to bitter memories of carnage and of the suffering of Union pris- oners in southern prison camps. There were many Northerners who felt that the South should not be readmitted to the Union until it had been further punished and had shown it- self repentant for the sins of slavery and secession. \"Bloody shirt\" oratory equated Demo- crats and traitors: Every unregenerate rebel . . . every deserter, every sneak who ran awa\\- from the draft calls him- self a Democrat. . . . Every man who labored for the rebellion in the field, who murdered Union prisoners by cruelty and starvation . . . calls himself a Democrat. Every wolf in sheep's clothing who pretends to preach the gospel but proclaims the righteousness of man-selling and slavery . . . calls himself a Democrat. The elections of 1866 resulted in a sweeping victory for the Radicals, who could now claim that they had a mandate from the people to put through their own version of reconstruction. The principal Radical leader was Thaddeus Stevens, congressman from Pennsylvania, who insisted that the southern states were \"con- quered provinces.\" He was determined to punish the \"slaveocrats\" whom he held respon- sible for the Civil ^^'ar. He would not execute them all, he said, \"but surely some victims must propitiate the names of our starved, murdered, slaughtered martv'rs.\" Stevens proposed that the land of former slaveholders be confiscated and parceled out among the freedmen.

The former Confederacy, except for Ten- nessee, was divided into five military districts, each under command of a major general. The officers were given the duty of setting up new gONemments in which Negroes should be guaranteed the right to vote. Those who had held ofBce under the Confederacy or had \"given aid and comfort\" to enemies of the United States lost their suffrage. This meant that the majority of white southern males were dis- franchised. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, 1868, 1870 The Radical program was written into the Constitution by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, which southern states were now required to ratify as a condition of readmission to the Union. The most important portion of the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, is the first section. It specifically overrides the Dred Scott decision by making all persons bom in the United States citizens of the United States and of the states where they reside. It forbids any state to deprive its citizens of equal rights under law. (For the text of the Four- teenth Amendment and explanation of its provisions see pp. 144—146.) The Fifteenth Amendment, ratified in 1870, was designed to guarantee to Negroes the vote, by providing that no state might deprive any citizen of the franchise \"on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" (See pp. 146-147.) The two amendments reveal one of the most im- portant results of the Civil \\\\'ar— an immense gain in the power of the national government. Formerly, rights of citizenship and voting had been almost entirely determined by the states. Now the federal government laid down rules for the states to follow. Andrew Johnson, a \"political accident,\" became Vice-President because Lincoln hoped to win Dem- ocratic votes, and President because of Lincoln's death. In dealing with the Republican majority In Congress he displayed more courage than tact. In addition to pro\\iding permanent constitu- tional protection for the rights of Negroes, Con- gress made a temporary effort to provide for their economic and educational needs. This was done through the Freedmen's Bureau, set up in March 1865, to care for former slaves. The first great federal relief agency, the bureau did use- ful work in providing food, clothing, and medi- cal care. It also attempted to protect the civil rights of Negroes and to see that employers treated them fairly. It spent some $5,000,000 on Negro schools. Northern missionary organiza- tions also supported schools for the freedmen. The American Missionary Association, repre- senting former abolitionists, sent hundreds of schoolteachers to the South and established nearly a score of colleges and normal schools to train Negro teachers. 369"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"370 Division and Reunion Carpetbag Governments Some of the leaders of the new state govern- ments set up under the Radical program were Northerners whom the South called \"carpet- baggers\" ( men who allegedly came seeking their fortunes with no more possessions than could be carried in a carpetbag).

Whether they were corrupt or honest, most Southerners disliked them because at the height of Radical recon- struction 700,000 Negroes possessed the fran- chise in the South, as against 625,000 whites. Prompted by agents of the Freedmen's Bureau and the Union League, a secret fraternal or- ganization, Negroes mostly voted for Republi- can candidates. But the carpetbag governments were not in truth run by and for the Negro. E\\en when the Negroes held a majority of the legislative seats, they were subordinate to whites. In any case, the carpetbag governments were, as a recent historian says, \"an unfair test of the Negro's capacity' for self-government.\" The conditions under which the freedmen had lived in slavery had been deliberately designed to keep them illiterate, helpless, and dependent. They could not suddenly acquire the skills needed to carry on government successfully. Many of the carpetbag governments were corrupt. Votes in the legislatures were bought and sold like shares of stock. Most graft, how- ever, went not to Negroes but to the whites at the top and to businessmen who received legislative handouts in the form of railway franchises, public lands, and fat government contracts. But the carpetbag governments were not unique in being graft-ridden. Unfortunately, political corruption was characteristic of politics all over the United States in the period after the Civil War. The Tweed Ring, operating only in New York City, stole more than all the carpetbag governments put together. The period of caqietbag rule was not with- out achie\\'ement. The rights of \\\\'omen were increased, ta.xation was made fairer, and penal systems were reformed.

Had they had their way, they might ha\\'e destroyed the system of checks and balances and given Congress the omnipotent position enjoyed by the British Parliament. Fearing that the Supreme Court would apply the principles of ex parte Milligan to military courts in the South, Congress for- bade appeals to that body in any cases arising under the Reconstruction Acts of 1867. To prevent Johnson from appointing justices to the Supreme Court, Congress provided that when- ever a justice died or resigned he was not to be replaced. Thus the court gradually shrank from nine members to eight. Above all, the Radicals were determined to get rid of Johnson. In order to reduce the Presi- dent's power of appointment, Congress in 1867 passed the Tenure of Office Act. It provided that the President might not remove important civil ser\\ants from office without senatorial per- mission; if he did so, he was declared guilty of a \"high misdemeanor.\" Believing the law un- constitutional, Johnson demanded the resigna- tion of Edwin M.

They found such a person in General Grant. Before the war Grant had been a Demo- crat. After Appomattox he appeared to share the Lincoln-Johnson attitude toward the South, and joined forces with the Radicals only after a quarrel with Johnson. Opposing Grant as Democratic candidate was Horatio Seymour, former governor of New York.

Wear\\- from the war, they were preoccupied with the business of merely keeping alive amid the general poverty. But there were many \"unreconstructed rebels\" who were not disposed to follow General Lee's advice to let bygones be bygones. Instead, their attitude was that of a song of the period, \"Good Old Rebel,\" of which one verse went: I hate that Yankee nation, And all they say and do. I hate the Declaration Of Independence too. Unable to strike openly at the federal govern- ment, they organized secret, terrorist societies, of which the most important was the Ku Klux Klan. Hooded, white-robed Klansmen, riding in bands at night, intimidated carpetbaggers, teachers in the new Xegro schools, and above all the Negroes themselves. The Klan was quite willing to use violence to back up its threats. Although it was finally suppressed by federal authority, it and other similar organizations frightened many Negroes away from the polls and contributed to the re-establishment of gov- ernments opposed to the Radicals. The so-called \"Conservatives\" gained control of one southern state after another, until by 1876 only South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana had not been restored to \"home rule.\" One reason for these southern successes was that the North was becoming wear)' of Radical reconstruction. In 1872 a group called the \"Lib- eral Republicans,\" including some of the best men in the Republican party, refused to support Grant for re-election because they thought him unfit for the presidency (see p. 448), and be- cause they opposed Radical reconstruction policies. They nominated Horace Greeley for President and the Democrats ratified the nomi- nation. Although Grant was re-elected, the Liberal Republican attitude toward reconstruc- tion became more and more widespread. Disputed Election of 1876 and Compromise of 1877 The end of Radical reconstruction resulted from the presidential election of 1876. The Democratic candidate was Samuel J. Tilden, v.ho had gained fame as a reform governor of New York; that of the Republicans was Ruther- ford B. Hayes, governor of Ohio, noted for his personal honesty. The Republicans continued to wave the bloody shirt, but it was losing effectiveness. The Democrats, on the other hand, effectively attacked both Radical reconstruction and the corruption which characterized Grant's administration. As the first election returns came in, it ap- peared that Tilden had won. From the three states still under carpetbag rule, however, there were two sets of returns, one favoring the Democrats and the other the Republicans. One of Oregon's electoral votes was also disputed because of a technicality. If Hayes could get every sini^le one of the twenty disputed elec- toral votes, he would carrv- the election by 185 electoral votes to 184. There was nothing in the Constitution to show how to settle such a con- troversy. The Republicans were determined to retain the control of the presidency which they had enjoyed for si.xteen years. The Democrats were determined not to be defrauded. There were threats of civil war. Northern Democrats formed \"rifle clubs,\" and a Kentucky editor called for 100,000 Democrats to invade \\\\'ash- ington and prevent Hayes from \"usurping\" the presidency. In the end, Hayes was chosen President. The decision was left to an electoral commis- sion, chosen from the House, Senate, and Supreme Court, composed of eight Republicans"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"374 Division and Reunion and seven Democrats. By a strict party vote the commission awarded every disputed electoral vote to Hayes, and the Democrats peacefully accepted the result. The Democrats' willingness to allow Ha\\'es to be inaugurated was the result of a compromise betsveen Republican leaders and southern Democrats. It differed from previ- ous arrangements such as the Missouri Com- promise and the Compromise of 1S50 in that it was largely secret and was not embodied in law. Having suffered so much from war, South- erners were repelled by the northern Democrats' talk of using \\iolence to put Tilden in the White House. They were willing to let Hayes assume the presidency in return for concessions. The most striking of these was the end of Radical reconstruction. This came about easily when the federal troops which protected the remaining carpetbag governments were withdra\\%'n. With- out soldiers to guard thpm, these governments collapsed, and the South was restored to \"home rule.\" This meant the restoration of \"white supremacy.\" Negroes played less and less part in politics, and in some southern states, schools for them were closed down. Less important southern demands in the Compromise of 1877 were that Ha>-es appoint a Southerner to his cabinet as postmaster general; that more federal funds be appropriated for southern rivers, harbors, and railroads; and that the federal government help to finance a rail- road from New Orleans to the Pacific Coast. Hayes and his advisers were willing to agree to all these requests in order to get the presi- dency, but for reasons mostly beyond their control they were unable to carr>' through their bargain completely. The significance of the Compromise of 1877 was not simply that a threat of ci%il war had been averted, nor that the Republicans managed to stay in power by abandoning Radical recon- struction. The Compromise \\\\as also a tem- porary alliance between the conservative property interests of the North and South, somewhat like the former alliance of the proper- tied classes in the Federahst and Whig parties. Results of Radical Reconstruction The results of Radical reconstruction con- tinued for many years. One of the most obvious was the \"Solid South\"— a block of former slave states dominated by the Democratic party. This did not begin to break up for nearly a century. The Solid South was a reflection of the bitter- ness created by Radical reconstruction. South- em whites agreed with Joel Chandler Harris ( famous for his stories of \"Uncle Remus\" ) , who called it \"a policy of lawlessness, under the forms of law, of disfranchisement, robber>', op- pression, and fraud.\" Radical reconstruction was of only tem- porary help to the Negroes whose rights it pro- fessed to defend. Abolitionist idealism waned, and too many professed Radicals were more interested in Negro \\otes than in the welfare of the freedmen themselves. The Radicals took no long-range steps to provide what the freed- men needed most— education and the opportu- nity to acquire property. They closed down the Freedmen's Bureau after only five years of operation, and they failed to support or follow up promising experiments in teaching Negroes to manage cotton plantations for themselves. And yet, as the Black Codes revealed, \\\\'ith- out federal inter\\'ention emancipation for south- em Negroes meant merely a change from slaverv' to peonage. Although immediate efforts to aid the Negroes failed, the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments wrote the principle of equality' for all men into the Constitution of the United States. For many years they remained almost a dead letter, but in the twentieth cen- tury these constitutional pro\\isions provide the legal basis and part of the inspiration for posi- tive efforts to bring the Negro at long last into full enjoyment of his rights as a citizen."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"KAN B' Conservative.

It is often forgotten that the South was treated more leniently tlian the losers in any great internal struggle of modem times. After events such as the French, Russian, and Chinese revolutions, the winning side executed many of the losers, .\\fter the Civil War the only people executed were those connected with the plot to assassinate Lincoln and the Confederate officer who ran Andersonville prison, where many Union soldiers died. The fact that bloodshed ceased with the surrender helped to make it possible for con- ciUatory feehng to develop. In 1893 Woodrow Wilson, a Southerner, wrote, \"The day of inevi- table strife and permanent difference came to seem strangely remote.\" This reconciliation was promoted by a number of actions that had a profound effect on public opinion.

Of more permanent importance were the gifts of northern philanthropists to promote education in the South, both Negro and white. The largest of these was made by George Peabody, a wealthy financier, who set up a permanent fund to encourage elementary school education in the South. \"This I give to the suffering South,\" he said, \"for the good of the whole country'.\" Both General Grant and Admiral Farragut ser\\'ed as trustees of the Peabody Education Fund. Such acts of generosity' helped to reunite the sections.

Let me beseech you to lay aside all rancor, all bitter sectional feeling, and to make your place in the ranks of those who will bring about a consummation devoutly to be wished— a reunited country. \"THE NEW SOUTH\" While political reconstruction occupied the center of the stage, the South experienced an economic revolution— the transition from planta- tions and slave labor to small farms and free labor. Much of the damage of war was repaired, and the South turned again to raising cotton and tobacco. Sharecropping and Tenancy By 1870 the average size of southern farms was half what it had been in 1S60. The large plantations were split up for a number of rea- sons. Their owners no longer owned slaves and lacked the money to hire day labor. Further- more, the Negroes regarded working in gangs under any sort of continuous direction as a badge of slavery and preferred to be on their own. There were also many \\\\hites who wanted to own farms. Few Negroes or whites had the means to buy farms. Therefore many became tenants, paying for the use of the land either in cash or— more usually— by a share of the crop. This sys- tem of \"sharecropping\" had serious defects. The owTiers, often in debt themselves and an.xious to get the maximum cash income from the land, put pressure on tenants not to do the wise thing and plant different kinds of crops, but to plant only cotton or tobacco. This exhausted the soil. It made the tenants more dependent on the landowners or local merchants from whom they bought— on credit— seed, fertilizer, draft animals, and food. They often ended each year deeper in debt. In spite of its faults, tenant farming was perhaps an ine\\'itable result of southern condi- tions. \"Tenancy,\" wrote Paul H. Buck in The Road to Reunion, \"seemed the only way by which the inefficient elements of southern agriculture— an ignorant, unpropertied labor force and a landowning class without capital or authority— could be fused into a productive combination.\" Industrial Growth In the postwar years, northern capital was of real help to the South only in providing money to build railroads; even here the price was steep. The building was often wasteful, and was over-rewarded in bonds and lands given away by corrupt carpetbag legislatures. South- em freight rates were higher than those in other parts of the country. Nevertheless, by 1S90 the railroad mileage of the South was twice that of 1860, and the region had a better transportation s\\'stem than ever before. Other factors necessary for industrial \"take- off' also began to appear in the South. (See p. 322.) Thoughtful Southerners had long realized that one of the great weaknesses of their region was the lack of manufacturing.

Around Bir- mingham, Alabama, there developed a flourish- ing iron industry. In scores of small towns, especially along the \"fall line\" (see pp. 8-9), cotton mills appeared. The money for these factories was usually raised by Southerners themselves from their own slender resources of capital; such investment was often regarded as a public duty. Far from northern markets, paying high freight and interest rates, able to hire only unskilled labor, southern mills faced serious handicaps. The owners therefore felt forced to pay low wages, to hire child labor, and to work factory hands long hours. With these developments in agriculture, transportation, and industry, the South gradu- ally revived. By 1870 it was producing as much cotton as in 1860; by 1890 the yield had doubled again. By 1900 the manufactured products of the South were worth at least four times as much as in 1860. Great as these advances were, they did not match the agricultural and indus- trial growth elsewhere. The South remained the least prosperous section of the country. FOREIGN AFFAIRS Once the Confederacy had been defeated, the United States was brought face to face with problems in foreign affairs. Napoleon III had violated the principles of the Monroe Doctrine by setting up a monarchy in Mexico. How could he be forced out? Now that the slavery issue was buried, would the United States use its new military strength to expand its borders? The resentment which developed against Great Britain during the war remained intense. Could hostilities be avoided? It was fortunate that in meeting such problems the country had the services of two able Secretaries of State— Wil- liam H. Seward, whom Johnson inherited from Lincoln, and Hamilton Fish, who served under Grant. Their task was made easier by the respect abroad that the Union victory had gained for the United States. Napoleon Ill's Intervention in Mexico, 1861-1867 One of the most serious challenges the Mon- roe Doctrine ever faced was an effort by Napoleon III to overthrow the Mexican Re- public and replace it with a government under his influence. He desired not only to re-establish French power in the Western Hemisphere, but also to set up \"an insuperable barrier\" to the expansion of American democracy. French troops entered Mexico in 1861 as part of a joint expedition with Spain and Great Britain to collect debts that the Mexican government had refused to pay. The other countries withdrew, but a French army occupied Mexico City in 1863. The ne.xt year Maximilian, an Austrian prince, agreed at Napoleon's persuasion to be- come emperor of Mexico. American opinion was violently opposed to Napoleon's actions, but during the Civil War there was little to do but protest. In 1864 the House of Representatives passed a unanimous resolution stating that the United States refused to recognize \"any monarchical government erected on the ruins of any republican govern- ment in America under the auspices of a Euro- pean power.\" Once the South was defeated, the United States had military power to back up its warnings; at one time 50,000 federal troops were stationed on the Rio Grande border. With such force behind him, Seward had little diflB- culty persuading Napoleon III to withdraw French troops early in 1867.

The Mon- roe Doctrine gained new respect abroad and popularity at home. Alaska Purchase, 1867 Seward was a Secretary of State who be- lieved in a policy of manifest destiny. He wanted the United States to annex Canada, Hawaii, and several Caribbean islands. His only major achievement along this line was the purchase of Alaska in 1867. This undeveloped territory, twice the size of Texas, and inhabited by only 20,000 people, was held by Russia, but was too far from Moscow for the Russian government either to rule or to protect effectively. When in 1867 the Russian minister to the United States informed Seward that the czar wished to sell the territory, QUESTION .

Seward's action had little popular support, because, as has been re- marked, most Americans did not know whether Alaska was \"a city, an animal, or a new kind of drink.\" Newspapers called the area \"Seward's icebox.\" The treaty passed the Senate, but the House of Representatives balked at voting the necessary funds until the Russian ambassador acceded to the pecuniary demands of certain needy congressmen. Anglo-American Tension: Treaty of Washington, 1871 In the postwar period there was tension between the United States and Great Britain, as after the War of 1812 and at the time of the Aroostook War. Queen Victoria's diary reveals her fear of a war in which Britain would be Purchase of Alaska was ridiculed by many as \"Sew- ard's Folly.\" This contemporary newspaper drawing shows Seward wheeling a large chunk of Alaskan ice to cool off hot Senate tempers. almost certain to lose Canada. The strongest American grievance involved Confederate cruisers, such as the Alabama, that had been allowed to slip from British ports. In 1869 Chailes Sumner, chairman of the Senate Com- mittee on Foreign Relations, made a famous speech that whipped up ill feeling. Sumner claimed that Great Britain owed us more than $2,000,000,000 in \"direct\" and \"indirect\" dam- ages for allowing Confederate warships to sail. If the British would not pay, said the senator, the United States should take Canada. Fortunately there were more reasonable men than Sumner in both the British and American governments. In Britain there was a realization that it had been a blunder to aid the Con- federacy and \"thereby to risk losing Canada. It was also realized that if Britain should get in- volved in a war with a European power, the United States could build ships for Britain's foes and allow them to use our ports as they preyed on the British merchant marine. On the part of the United States, Hamilton Fish, Secre- tary of State under Grant, was willing to drop claims for indirect damages and to let an inter-"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"national court decide how much Britain owed in direct damages. In both governments there was a wilhngness to clear the books of outstanding disputes. This mutually conciliatory attitude resulted in the Treaty of Washington, 1871. This docu- ment, containing 43 separate articles, provided for the settlement of all sorts of questions, such as a disputed boundary between the United States and Canada in Puget Sound, the rights of Americans to fish in Canadian waters, and claims of British subjects against the United States. In regard to the Alabama claims, the treaty contained a clause expressing \"regret by Her Majesty's Government for the escape, un- der whatever circumstances, of the Alabama and other vessels from British ports.\" With the British practically admitting them- selves in the wrong, it did not prove too difficult to assess the amount of damages. This was done by an international court of arbitration, consist- ing of representatives from the United States, Great Britain, Italy, Brazil, and Switzerland. Called the Geneva Tribunal, because it met in Geneva, Switzerland, this body awarded the United States damages totaling $15,500,000, and Great Britain promptly paid. This was a remark- able victory for peace, and served to popularize the idea of arbitration instead of war to settle international disputes. On the whole, the relations of the United States with foreign nations during the post\\var years were handled with wisdom sadly lacking in the treatment of the South.

THEMES PART 4 The immense tide of immigration from Europe that began about 1840 and con- tinued well Into the twentieth century involved at least three of the themes of American history; \"economic opportunity,\" \"a mobile population,\" and \"toleration of differences,\" as can be seen by questions such as these: 1. Why did the immigrants come to these shores? 2. Where did they go when they got here? 3. How did they make a living? 4. How were they treated? See Jones, American Immigration, Chapters 4-6, or Wittke, We Who Built America: The Saga of the Immigrant, Part II. In dealing with the themes of American history as described in the Prologue, it is important to remember that they are only trends and that they were by no means an invariable pattern. Surely the outbreak of that tragic period of bloodshed, the Civil War, contradicts the statement that Americans agreed to settle disputes \"by ballots rather than bullets.\" The treatment of the free Negro of the North, let alone the Negro slave of the South, in the nineteenth century makes a mockery of the statement that all Americans have always been imbued with \"respect for the rights and abilities of the individual.\" To get a mature and balanced view of Amer- ican history it is necessary to look on the dark side as well as the bright. To see why intersectional differences led to war see Bedford, The Union Divides: Politics and Slavery, 1850-1861.

Mark Twain called it the Gilded Age; Lewis Mumford dubbed it the Brown Dec- ades; Vernon Parrlngton described it as \"a world of triumphant and unabashed vul- garity.\" Its immense wastefulness was symbolized by the extinction of the vast buffalo herds, its political mediocrity and corruption by the Tweed Ring in New York City. In Washington, congressmen took bribes to give away land grants to railroads, and President Grant placed seventy-five relatives on the federal pay- roll. In business, unabashed rascals made fortunes; Jim Fisk, after failing to corner the gold in the United States, cheerfully announced, \"Nothing is lost save honor\" As cities sprawled out like fungi, unplanned and ugly, pauperism, slums, and crime sprang up. In the arts, sham was everywhere, symbolized by the pop- ular \"jigsaw Gothic\" architecture. Why did all this happen? Look at the diagrams on pp. 470-471. In the period 1850-1900 manufacturing gained on agriculture, the urban population on the rural. Machinery, power, and rapid transportation were changing the environment more swiftly than ever before in history. The industrial revolution was creating brand- new political, social, economic, artistic, and moral problems faster than men could find solutions. The unattractive features of the Gilded Age can easily blind us to its achieve- ments. The material progress was astounding. In 1860 half the country — from Kansas to California — was practically empty of people. By 1890 this area had been so thoroughly settled that the census takers could no longer find a frontier line. Improved manufacturing processes had made scores of hitherto \"luxury\" products available to the ordinary consumer. In the cities there appeared such great monu- ments of engineering skill as the Brooklyn Bridge and such evidence of public spirit as The New York Public Library. Instruction in American universities and technical schools was on a par with that furnished by French and German univer- sities. A new generation of architects began to design buildings with taste and imagination. For all its faults, America, the \"land of opportunity,\" was a mecca for immi- grants. In 1886 the Statue of Liberty was dedicated, a gift of the French people in honor of the hundredth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The mes- sage inscribed on the base, written by poet Emma Lazarus, was addressed to the I nations of Europe: \"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free . . .

Laughing the stormy, husky, brawling laughter of Youth, halt-naked, sweating, proud to be Hog Butcher, Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat. Player with Railroads, and Freight Handler to the Illation. CARL SANDBURG The Civil War and Reconstruction mark a sort of \"great divide\" in American history. The war finally settled important issues that had agitated people for many years, such as nulhfi- cation and expansion of slavery, so that politics assumed quite a different character. But more important than political developments were changes in the way Americans lived. Before the Civil War the great majority of the people gained their living from agriculture and lived on isolated farms or in small towns. Although industry had begun a period of rapid growth, most manufacturing was on a small scale and was designed to supply local markets. In the thirty to forty years after the war, it expanded more rapidly in America than in any other countr)' in the world. In 1900 American indus- trial production was seven times that of 1865, and the United States rose from fourth place among industrial nations to first. Agriculture also expanded with amazing speed, and the farmer was brought into and subordinated to the indus- trial system. .According to W. W. Rostow, whose theory about stages of economic growth was mentioned in Chapter 13, the \"takeoff' of the I840's and 1850's was now followed by over half a centur>- of self-sustaining growth, centering on expansion of railways and of heavy in- dustry, such as the manufacture of steel. CAUSES OF RAPID INDUSTRIAL GROWTH It is a matter of debate whether the Civil War speeded up or slowed down the develop- ment of industry in the North. In any case, northern factories and railroads did not suffer the physical damage inflicted on those in the South. From the end of the war on there was a period of continued growth, interrupted by peri- ods of depression in 1873-1878, 1882-1884, and 1893-1896. Industrial production doubled about every twehe to fourteen years. Although eco- nomic historians differ as to the relative impor- tance of the causes for this explosive growth, they generally agree that the following factors were involved: ( 1 ) Inventions. A flood of important inven- tions served to increase productive capacity 387"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"Technological problems vexed railroads from the be- ginning. Braking, slack control, and coupling (shown above) were a few of the many problems that had to be solved before railroads could fulfill their potential. and to speed transportation and communication. Among these were the telephone, new methods of steel production, and the use of electricity as a source of light and power. (2) Vast natural resources. The immense xmderground wealth of the United States had scarcely been touched. The country contained in fantastic abundance the raw materials upon which industr>- depended, such as coal, iron, petroleum, and copper. (3) Railroad building. By 1900 the raihoad mileage of the United States was greater than that of all the rest of the world. Technical im- provements enabled trains to carry bulky prod- ucts long distances cheaply, tlius making it possible for businessmen to sell their goods in a nation-wide market. (4) Abundant capital. The great profits to be obtained from manufacturing and transporta- tion in the United States attracted investors. Much of the capital formerly invested in ship- ping was diverted to building factories and rail- roads. Billions of dollars came from abroad, especially from England. (5) A mobile labor supply. European capi- talists often had difficulty recruiting labor for new industries because workingmen had been brought up to traditional occupations and hated to leave their home villages. In the United States, labor was more mobile. The American tradition was to \"keep moving.\" Laborers came to new jobs in new cities the way pioneers moved into new lands. Furthermore, the flood of immigration continued; the newcomers, al- ready uprooted from their homes and traditions, supplied much of the \"floating\" labor force that industry demanded. The native American work- ers were noted for the ease with which they learned new processes, and the immigrants such as English textile workers, Welsh miners, and Italian fanners often brought \\\\ith them im- portant skills. (6) Government policies. The Constitution gave American industriahsts an advantage when it forbade the states to IcNy tariffs. This prohibi- tion resulted in an immense home market— the largest free trade area in the world. Compare this with western Europe, where nearly twenty nations were levying tariffs on each others' American capitalists demanded and received special favors from Congress. A high protective tariff encouraged \"infant industries\" and raised manufacturers' profits by keeping out foreign goods. Liberal immigration laws insured a steady supply of cheap labor. The federal gov- ernment bore about a third of the cost of build- ing the u-estem railroads and sold public lands containing \\ast mineral wealth for a small pro- portion of their true value. (7) American institutions and attitudes. In Europe it was often difficult to change industrial methods because of continuing traditions of hand craftsmanship and the feefing that a son should follow his father's trade. But in America no such restraints existed; both laborer and industrialist felt free to abandon old techniques and try new ones. In America more than in Europe business attracted and held men of high ability and"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"Industrial America 389 ambition. While European capitalists often re- tired from business when they had acquired enough money to buy their way into the upper classes, American capitalists regarded money- making as a laudable end in itself. They had no other ambition than to be \"captains of industry.\" At the other end of the scale Europe was plagued with an almost hereditary class of paupers who, with little hope of ever rising from poverty, lacked initiative. In the United States, on the other hand, laborers believed that hard work would be rewarded, if not by wealth for themselves, at least by wider opportunities for their children. American law encouraged the formation of business corporations, and this form of owner- ship had a number of advantages over partner- ships or individual proprietorships. It provided permanence of organization, so that its officers could plan far into the future. By selling bonds and stocks, a corporation could get the capital needed for its operations from the public at large, and small bits of capital could be pooled into large sums. Those with capital were at- tracted to corporate securities because by diver- sifying their investments they could spread their risks. A specialized form of corporation, the holding company, enabled capitabsts to combine The lure of freedom and higher wages drew an ever-increasing number of immigrants to America from Europe. The average influx of immigrants to the United States was over a third of a million per year between 1870 and 1900.

THE GROWTH OF BIG BUSINESS Along with the rapid industrial expansion of the United States came an immense increase in the size of the business units. By 1900 several major industries were dominated by gigantic concerns which owned scores of plants, sold products all over the country, and had hundreds of millions of dollars capital and credit behind them. Legitimate Advantages of Big Business Tlie growth of big business was a natural development. Big companies could take full advantage of the nation-wide markets. They lowered production costs and improved their products by installing the newest processes. They paid high salaries to obtain the best busi- ness brains. They reduced costs by combining operations formerly carried on by separate com- panies, and at the same time increased efficiency by establishing separate departments for spe- cialized functions such as purchasing, produc- tion, research, distribution, and sales. All this was shown dramatically by the de- velopment of large-scale meat-packing. For- merly fresh meat had been slaughtered locally, and every town had at least one slaughterhouse. When the refrigerator car made it possible to ship fresh meat long distances, there appeared gigantic concerns such as Swift and Armour selling their products all over the country. The big meat-packers made such efficient use of by- products that they were often able to sell the meat for less than they paid for the animal and still make a profit out of the rest of the carcass. The Chicago humorist \"Mr. Dooley\" (Finley Peter Dunne) \\\\as scarcely exaggerating when he said: A cow goes lo\\vin' softly into Armour's an' comes out glue, gelatin, fert>'lizer, celooloid, joolry, sofy cushions, hair restorer, washin' sody, soap, lithrachoor an' bed springs so quick that while aft she's still cow, for'ard she may be anything fr'm buttons to pannyma hats. Unfair Advantages of Big Business In addition to its natural efficiency, big business was sometimes in a position to take unfair advantage of competitors or the public. It could get special discounts from transporta- tion companies. It could sell its product in one locality at less than cost until local businesses were forced to close dowm or sell out. If able to get a monopoly, it could raise prices to con- sumers and lower those paid to producers of raw materials. It could bribe public officials to pass laws favorable to its interests or not to enforce regulations that hurt it. The great business concerns were created by men who saw the vast possibilities for wealth in America, who were willing to take risks, and who often had few scruples when it came to driving competitors out of business, bribing leg- islators, or breaking labor unions. Vernon L. Parrington says of them: These new Americans were primitive souls, ruth- less, predatory, capable, single-minded men; rogues and rascals often, but never feeble, never hindered by petty scruple, never given to puling or whin- ing Analyze the most talked-of men of the age and one is likely to find a splendid audacity coupled with immense wastefulness. A note of tough- mindedness marks them. They had stout nippers. They fought their way encased in rhinoceros hides. Horizontal and Vertical Consolidation Business consolidation took various forms. Sometimes there was \"horizontal\" consolidation of several finns engaged in a single process. Sometimes there was \"vertical\" consolidation of different processes all the way from extracting"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"Industrial America 391 raw materials to selling the finished product. A horizontal combination, once established, was able to expand vertically because of the control it could exert over both producers and distribu- tors. And a vertical combination could be so efficient that it expanded horizontally by buying out competitors or forcing them out of business. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER AND THE STANDARD OIL TRUST The most successful and dramatic example of horizontal consolidation was the Standard Oil Trust, a near-monopoly of oil refineries and pipelines. Its guiding genius was John D. Rocke- feller ( 1S39-1937 ), who in the course of his long hfetime amassed what was reputed to be the world's largest fortune— nearly a billion dollars. Rockefeller went to work at an early age, starting as a bookkeeper in a grocery in Cleve- land. Dominated by the idea that he was \"bound to be rich,\" he saved $800 in three years, on a salary of $15 per week. After going into business for himself, in only four years he in- creased his small capital until by 1865 he com- manded about $100,000. Then he sank all his money in a new industry— petroleum refining. Rise of the Oil Industry The production and use of petroleum, like that of steel, was increasing at an almost fan- tastic rate. Until the ISSO's, petroleum (called \"rock oil\") had been used only as a patent medicine. In 1855 it was discovered that when refined into kerosene it was better for lighting than whale oil and supplied a better lubricant than animal fats. The first oil well, drilled in^ 1859, set off a stampede to western Pennsylvania like the California gold rush of 1849. Land values in the region jumped from a few dollars an acre to hundreds of dollars a square foot. New towns appeared o\\emight. The demand for kerosene became world-wide. In spite of the Ci\\il W'iXT, the petroleum industry grew so fast that by 1865 petroleum had risen to fourth place among the exports of the United States. The petroleum business was highly specula- tive. Fortunes were made and lost o\\emight as the price of oil fluctuated wildly. Fraud was so prevalent that \"oil stock\" became as much a svinbol for worthlessness as the continental dol- lars of the Revolution. It was Rockefeller's re- markable achievement to impose order on this chaotic industry. By 1870 Rockefeller's firm, the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, with capital stock of a million dollars, was the largest of 26 refineries in Cleve- land, processing 2 or 3 per cent of the crude oil produced in the United States. In nine years Rockefeller and his associates gained control of about 90 per cent of the refining business of the country. Some of their methods were so ruthless that when they were revealed Rockefeller be- came one of the most hated men in the business world. Methods of Consolidation One of Standard Oil's principal weapons was the rebate ( a discount on railroad charges ) . In 1872 the company made a secret agreement with die railroads running out of Cleveland by which the rates on its products would be from 25 per cent to 50 per cent below those charged other companies. In order to see that the railroads were not tempted by higher rates into carrying its competitors' oil, Standard Oil had the rail- roads pay it a \"drawback\" on e\\ery barrel of competitors' oil shipped. Standard Oil was also furnished with the waybills telling the destina- tion of competitors' oil; this provided it with valuable information about its business dealings. This agreement ga\\e Standard Oil such an advantage over all other Cleveland refineries that within three months all but five of them were forced to sell out.

Rockefeller dominated the oil industry by means of the great horizontal trust he organized (see chart, page 396). rapidly toward a national monopoly. It did this by forming an alliance of the strongest com- panies and ablest men in the oil business, and by gaining control of the transportation of oil. In 1880 a committee of the New York legislature reported on Standard Oil as follows: It owns and controls the pipe lines of the pro- ducing regions that connect with the railroads. It controls both ends of these roads. It ships 95 per cent of all oil. ... It dictates terms and rates to the railroads. It has bought out and frozen out refiners all over the countr\\'. By means of the superior facilities for transportation which it thus possessed, it could overbid in the producing regions and undersell in the markets of the world. Many of the operations in this Napoleonic campaign to conquer an entire industr\\' were completely unknown even to Rockefeller's com- petitors. Companies controlled by Standard Oil continued, for instance, to do business under their former names, with \"dummy directors,\" who were sometimes mere office boys or stenog- raphers. In 1882, forty companies were put under one management by a secret agreement known as the Standard Oil Trust. The con- trolling interest in the stock of the companies was turned over to nine trustees headed by Rockefeller. This trust arrangement offered such vast possibilities for profit that it was imitated in other industries; the very word trust became a term applied to any big, monopolistic business. Once having achieved control of most of the refining and transportation of oil in the United States, Standard Oil expanded \"vertically.\" It gained control of oil fields, so as to have an independent source of supply, and also marketed natural gas. At the other end of the scale, it mo\\ed into the distribution of petroleum prod- ucts, both in America and abroad. Eventually it controlled a fleet of ocean-going tankers and door-to-door deliver)' wagons in Europe. It manufactured and sold cooking stoves to in- crease the demand for kerosene. Rockefeller, a devout churchgoer, never ad- mitted that his actions in what he referred to as \"systematizing\" the oil industry were wrong. He pointed out that railroads customarily granted rebates to big shippers, and that rebates were not illegal when he first used them to gain advantage over his rivals. When buying out competitors. Rockefeller offered to pay them in either cash or Standard Oil stock, advising them to take the latter. Those who took his adxice became rich.

Rockefeller plowed much of his fortune back into society by gifts which totaled over half a billion dollars. Standard Oil's spectacular success led to other attempts to establish horizontal combina- tions of companies in industries as varied as whi.skey, bituminous coal, and rope. Their pur- pose was principally to prevent overproduction and to keep up prices. But it was difficult to control an entire industry and to keep new firms out of the market. Furthermore, efforts to sup- press competition were much resented by small businessmen and consumers. They were also of questionable legality; thc>' ran afoul of the English common law doctrine that it is illegal to combine with others to restrain trade, a principle that was written into federal law by the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. Vertical consolidation, on the other hand, was not by its very nature monopolistic, and it resulted in large economies that were passed on to the consumer in the form of lower prices. It has become a common means of business combina- tion, and can be seen today in such giant organi- zations as General Motors and American Tele- phone and Telegraph Company. ANDREW CARNEGIE, MASTER OF STEEL The most remarkable example of the creation of a vertical trust was the giant steel business built up by Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919). Coming to this country from Scotland at the age of thirteen, Camegie went to work in a cotton factory, where he received $1.20 for a 72-hour week. His ability, energy, and driving ambition were so great that he rapidly worked his way upward as a telegraph operator and private secretary until by the age of twenty-two he was traffic superintendent of a branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad. By fortunate investments in a sleeping car company and in oil wells, he made a small fortune by the time he was thirty. In the demands of the railroads for rails, bridges, cars, and locomotives, Camegie foresaw a great future for the iron and steel industry. After seven years' e.xperience making iron bridges, he decided in 1873 to \"put all his eggs in one basket and watch the basket\"— that is, to concentrate entirely on iron and steel. Carnegie's decision followed closely on the dc\\e]opment of two new ways of making steel— the Bessemer process and the open-hearth process. These produced steel so cheaply that it could be used for girders and rails as well as for cutlery and precision machines."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"Andrew Carnegie, steel master. Carnegie's genius lay in his courage and in his ability to organize. His vertical empire in the steel industry (see chart, page 396) became the pattern for others to follow. After making a fortune in the early part of his life, he de- voted his later years to giving It away. Behveen 1866 and 1876, the production of American steel skyrocketed from 20,000 to 600,000 tons; by 1897 it was over 7,000,000 tons. Previously iron and steel had been manufactured at hundreds of small furnaces all over the coun- try. Now almost overnight the character of the industry changed. Bessemer converters and open-hearth furnaces demanded heavy invest- ment of capital, and needed huge amounts of coke and ore to keep them going. Small opera- tors were soon forced out by big concerns. Less than twenty years after Carnegie put all his eggs in one basket, he had become the greatest steel master in the world. There were a number of reasons for his success. (1) He took a great deal of the guesswork out of making iron and steel by getting the best scientific and technological advice he could find. His chemists found out how to use by-products previously thrown away, and how to smelt ores formerly thought to be worthless. (2) Carnegie wrote that he wanted as his epitaph: \"Here lies the man who was able to surround himself with men far cleverer than if*'?

Always on the watch for ability in his own companies, he gave rapid promotion to young men who made good. Common laborers fared less happily. In the Homestead lockout of 1892, Carnegie's partner, Henry C. Frick, broke the steelv\\orkers' union, driving wages down and hours up, so that the 12-hour day was standard in the indus- try for many years. (3) Carnegie was a master at pricing his goods so as to make the highest profit.

The Standard Oil Company, a horizontal form of consolidation, controlled both the refining and transport stages of oil production. It was thus able to dominate the oil industry, even though it did not at first try to monopolize raw materials or markets. (4) In time of depression, when competitors closed down and laid off their men, Carnegie rebuilt his factories and put in more efficient processes. He \"gambled on the future of Amer- ica,\" as he expressed it, \"and won.\" When busi- ness improved, he was able to sell his products at prices which \"meant vast profits for himself and absolute ruin for his competitors.\" ( 5 ) Carnegie combined all the processes in- volved in making steel into one great vertical consolidation. In addition to blast furnaces and steel mills, his company controlled rich ore de- posits near Lake Superior, fleets of ore ships on the Great Lakes, a railroad from Lake Erie to Pittsburgh, coal mines and coking ovens in Pennsylvania, plus factories for producing fin- ished products such as wire. Carnegie summa- rized the result of this achievement as follows: Two pounds of ironstone mined upon Lake Superior and transported nine hundred miles to Pittsburgli; one pound and one-half of coal, mined and manufactured into coke, and transported to Pittsburgh; one half-pound of lime, mined and transported to Pittsburgh; a small amount of manga- nese mined in Virginia and brought to Pittsburgh —and these four pounds of materials manufactured into one pound of steel, for which the consumer pays one cent."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"Indiistiial Aincriai 397 Carnegie and the Gospel of Wealth Eventually, Carnegie was making over $20,000,000 a year in a time when there was no income tax, while his workers received eight or nine dollars a week. He was producing steel so cheaply that his remaining competitors faced bankruptcy. Carnegie justified both his immense fortune and the ruthlessness of his business methods by an adaptation of the theory of evolution that had been propounded by the English naturalist Charles Dar^vin. Darwin maintained that in the constant struggle for existence certain species of plants and animals survive because they are more efficient, while others die out. Carnegie said that within the human race also there is a \"law of competition\" that decrees that only the fittest should survive. Organizing and managerial talents are so rare that men possessing them must rise to the top in a free society and must be abundantly rewarded. According to Carnegie: We of the capitalistic persuasion put trust in the individual man. We make him a part, according to his particular skill, of a great and far-reaching industrial organization. We demote him when his ability' fails, and discard him if we find a serious flaw in his character. . . . We have, then, a method, better than that of practical politics, for selecting the leaders of a democracy. By a process of pitiless testing we discover who are the strong and who are the weak. To the strong we give power in the form of the autocratic control of industry and of wealth with which the leader, who has risen by a process of natural selection, can and does do for the mass of the community what they could never do for themselves. But to Carnegie the achievement of great power and wealth was not enough. He preached that in the latter part of a businessman's career he should plow his wealth back into society, and that the man who dies rich dies disgraced.

THE GROWTH OF CITIES In the new industrial age, the city was \"the mighty heart of the body politic, sending its streams of life to the very fingertips of the whole land.\" Between 1860 and 1900 American urban areas grew twice as fast as the total population. Chicago, which in 1850 had been a frontier town of 30,000 people, doubled its population every ten years and became a vast metropolis approaching t\\vo million. New York became the second largest city in the world. Tlie day dreaded by Thomas Jefferson, when Americans should abandon farming life and be piled high up on one another in cities, was clearly on the way. Urbanization was a world-wide phenomenon associated with the industrial revolution. The new industrial cities were essentially the prod- uct of the mine, the factory, the steamship, and the railroad.

Once estabhshed, cities grew by a self- generating process. \\'arious facilities appeared to serve industry: banks and insurance com- panies, docks and warehouses. These in turn attracted more industr\\-. Immigrants, lacking agricultural skill or money to buy a farm, could often find employment only in urban areas. The recent arrivals often preferred the big cities where there were colonies of people who spoke their nati\\e language and tried to preser\\e old- world customs. An even greater source of supply for the growing urban population were Ameri- can rural areas. Thus not merely from the rocky hillsides of New Hampshire and Vermont, but even from rich lands in Iowa and Illinois, farm boys and girls, bored \\\\ith life in the countr>'. headed for the city lights to make their fortunes. \"A sort of natural selection,\" remarked a foreign traveler in America, \"carries the more ambitious and eager spirits into the towns, for the native American dislikes the monotony and isolation of farm life \\\\ith its slender prospect of wealth.\" Although the modem industrial city offered many people the opportunit>- for a higher stan- dard of living than they had known before, it also confronted them with a no\\cl and often unattractive en\\ironnient. Because of the pre- Thc Library of Congress vailing laissez fairc philosoph\\- and a lack of community sense, the new cities were built with less concern for the comforts of the inhabitants than for the profits of builders and real estate speculators. It suited the latter group to have the streets laid out in a rectangular gridiron. The result was that every street often became a dangerous thoroughfare and cities as a whole were monotonous. There was inadequate pro\\'i- sion for parks and playgrounds, the few open spaces too often being given over to dumps and to vacant lots where a scanty growth of grass and weeds competed with cinders and tin cans. Rivers and harbors were polluted by sewage and factor)' wastes, and the air was made foul by smoke from thousands of chimneys. In many ways the new environment seemed a sort of prison, cutting off men from sun. air, and natural beaut)-. Problems Created by Urbanization The grow th of cities created many technical and hiunan problems. There was, for instance, a demand for new sources of water, since wells and brooks pro\\ided too scanty a supply and were often polluted. New York City was the first to make a major effort to meet this problem by building the Croton Aqueduct, twenty-five miles outside the citv limits.

But while the wealthy spent their money for such splendid display, city workers often lived in slums where it was impossible to keep clean or stay healthy. Such extreme contrasts in living conditions caused angry social comment, and gave rise to protest movements. large in area that better means of transportation within them had to be devised. This need was first met by the horse car, later by the elevated railway, trolley car, and subway. The demand for space in preferred localities such as Wall Street in New York or the Loop in Chicago was answered by the skyscraper, which, in turn, added a vertical dimension to transportation in the form of the elevator. A sinister product of urban life was an increase in crime. Until the rise of the city, there had naturally been occasional violence and theft, but never on a scale demanding an organized police force. There was, in fact, noth- ing resembling modem police until the forma- tion of the Metropolitan Police of London, known as bobbies, about 1830.

All this was partly the result of a breakdown in traditional morality. Whether the new city dweller came from a Connecticut village or an Italian hill town, from a farm in upstate \\ew York or a nobleman's estate in Poland, he found it hard to follow the ways he had been brought up to consider right. It was even harder for him to train his children in the \"right\" \\\\'ay, since they found other stan- dards in the streets where they played with children of quite different backgrounds. Law- breaking was often simply a protest against disease and monotony, against unemplo\\ment and insecurity, or against life in slums so crowded that four thousand people might oc- cupy a single block. Idle Poor and Idle Rich There was probably no more po\\erty in the great industrial cities than in the former agricul- tural societies; indeed, there may have been less but poverty no\\\\' became more visible because poor people lived in their own districts where unscrupulous landlords crowded theni together in slums. Industrialism brought with it recurring periods of depression which threw millions of men out of wiJrk through no fault of their own. There also appeared a more or less permanent fringe of \"unemployables\"— beggars, paupers, and tramps. The new awareness of mass poverty was coupled with another phenomenon new to .American life— the appearance of a class of \"idle rich.\" Until the industrial era there had been few very wealthy people in .America. One esti- mate put the number of millionaires at three in 1860 as against nearly 4,000 in 1900. In the pre-industrial period, gentlemen not needing to work for a living generally took up some other occupation— politics, literature, farming. They had been trained in the tradition that wealth carries with it duties as well as privileges. But manv of the owners of new fortunes had no time to develop such a tradition; they were bent simply on enjoying and displaying their wealth. The newspapers of the period greedily re- ported the sensational doings of what was called \"high societ),\" a group of people whose one pur- pose in life, apparently, was pleasure. There was a dinner at Delmonico's, the finest New York restaurant, at which the guests were on horse- back and \"the fa\\orite steed was fed flowers and champagne.\" A complete orchestra was hired to serenade a newborn child, and a diamond neck- lace given by a millionaire to his daughter cost 8600,000. Widespread Prosperity The unpleasant aspects of industrialism and urbanization tend to obscure the fact that life was getting better for the mass of the people. \\\\'here\\er industrialism appears, it tends to bring a rapid increase in the population. Better transportation ends famine and nutritional diseases caused by local crop failures. Improved medical service, water supply, and sewage dis- posal reduce mortality. A higher proportion of the population lives above a bare subsistence level.

Pauperism already exists in some of the larger cities, . . . But outside one sees nothing but comfort. THE NEW LEISURE The industrial revolution provided new leisure not merely for the very rich, but for the middle class and workmen as well. As machines more and more took over the work of hands, the labor time necessary for producing a shirt, a bucket, a pin, or a length of chain was reduced to a small fraction of what it had been formerly. Hours of work, although still long by the stan- dards of the twentieth century, gradually responded to the fact that less labor time was now needed to meet human wants. As leisure time increased, new forms of amusement devel- oped or were introduced from abroad by recent immigrants. City dwellers needed such distrac- tion more than country people because their jobs were usually more monotonous. Many of the immigrants, furthermore, had a greater inclina- tion to enjoy themselves on hohdays than the older stock of Americans, for many of whom Sunday was a day of self-denial. Sports and Amusements To meet the new need for diversion many turned to sports. The more wealthy played golf, croquet, and lawn teimis, imported from Great Britain. College students brought in still other British sports— rowing, track, and rugby (from which the American game of football was derived). The American game of baseball was spread all over the country by college and club teams. Starting with the Cincinnati Red Stock- ings in 1869, more and more teams turned pro- fessional. In 1876 the National League was organized, followed shortly by others. Bo.xing— previously prohibited by law, Hke cockfighting today— began to attract pubhc interest and to assume respectability after John L. SulUvan won the world's heavyweight championship. The amusement which for a time outstripped all others was bicycling. After the modem safety bicycle was substituted for the dangerous \"high wheeler,\" bicycling became a craze. There were hundreds of bicycle clubs; special trains carried cychsts into the country on Sundays; and special bicycle paths were built in parks and suburbs. There was even a demand for a bicycle path from one ocean to the other. The cities— especially the great metropolitan centers such as New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Chicago— became centers of a much richer cultural life than had ever existed in America. In a day when the motion picture had not yet been invented, vaude\\iUe and the theater en- joyed their period of greatest prosperity. Opera companies and symphony orchestras were founded and halls were built to house them.

The Yellow Press and Dime Novels The increase in leisure and in hteracy en- couraged the development of a new form of journalism, devoted to amusing readers as well as informing them. Improvements in paper- making and printing made it possible to produce newspapers far more cheaply than ever before. At the same time there was such increased demand for advertising space that newspapers could derive support entirely from advertisers and sell copies at less than the printing cost. The pioneer among the new penny news- papers, designed to attract the largest possible number of readers, was the New York World, purchased by Joseph Pulitzer in 1883. In fifteen years its circulation rose from fifteen thousand to over a million. PuHtzer, dedicating his paper \"to the cause of the people rather than the purse-proud potentates,\" attacked unfair em- ployers and grafting politicians with vigor. His success came less from editorial pohcies, how- ever, than from new journalistic methods. Pu- litzer gave his readers a regular diet of sensa- tionahsm. He was the first to use the \"scare headline\": \"Baptized in Blood,\" \"Death Rides the Rails.\" He introduced the colored Sunday supplement and the seriahzed comic strip. If he could not find news, he made it, as when he sent a young woman off at four days' notice to travel around the globe in less time than the hero of Jules Verne's popular novel, Around the World in Eighty Days.

By the end of the century the \"yellow press,\" furnishing its readers with daily doses of scandal, violence, comics, and sports, had become well established. Another form of reading matter produced for a mass market was the dime novel, which was designed especially to interest boys.

ADVANCES IN EDUCATION One reason why newspapers could develop an immense circulation and dime novels could be published in editions of fifty thousand, was that more and better education had increased hteracy. By 1900 all but two states outside the South made education for all children compul- sory. The wealth of urban districts was so great that taxes could easily support the expense of better buildings, longer school terms, and graded schools that were far better than the one-room schoolhouses still prevailing in rural districts. Many cities also introduced free secondary education, and the number of public high schools increased from a few hundred in 1870 to over 6,000 in 1890. Yet pubUc education still left great room for improvement: in 1900 the average American child received only five years of schooling, and the average expenditm-e per pupil was only about $25 per year. The most striking development in American education in the latter nineteenth century was the improvement of higher education. At the start of this period, most American colleges and universities had poor equipment and hbraries, and ill-trained and over^^•o^ked faculties. Their fixed curriculum did not include training in modem languages, history, or science. There were no first-rate graduate schools, either in professions such as law and medicine or in the liberal arts. No American scientific school de- served to be mentioned in the same breath with the best in Europe. By 1900 these weaknesses had been vigor- ously attacked. Young American scholars trained in German universities, then the best in the world, brought back higher standards of scholar- ship. From Germany, too, came inspiration for better scientific schools, because much of the amazing advance of German industry could be credited to the superior training of German scientists. By 1900 a number of American tech- nical schools, such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, California Institute of Tech- nology, Purdue University, and SheflBeld Scien- tific School at Yale, had been founded. These institutions supplied highly trained graduates to answer the demands of American industry for engineers, metallurgists, and chemists. A great force for reform was a group of able college presidents, such as James McCosh of Princeton, Andrew White of Cornell, Daniel Gilman of Johns Hopkins, and William R. Harper of Chicago. The most famous of these was Charles W. Ehot, president of Harvard from 1869 to 1909. During this time Harvard's enrollment increased from 1,000 to 4,000, the teaching staff from 60 to 600, and the endow- ment from $2,000,000 to $20,000,000."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"Industrial America 405 Far more imp>ortant than material growth was the rise in standards, which can be illus- trated by the Harvard Medical School. When Eliot came into office, a student could get a medical degree after a few months' study by passing five out of nine oral examinations. Profiting by the fact that a graduate of the Harvard Medical School had unintentionally killed a woman by prescribing a poison, EUot insisted that the requirements for a diploma be stiffened. Eventually, the Harvard medical de- gree was given only to men who had completed three years' study and passed difficult written examinations. In other fields as well as medicine graduate instruction was so improved that by the time Eliot retired, standards at Harvard rivaled those of the best European universities. In under- graduate instruction Harvard broke away en- tirely from the rigid curriculum, and allowed students to take any subjects they desired, the only requirement for graduation being credit for a definite number of courses. This elective sys- tem was attacked on the ground that students had no real idea what was best for them, and simply shopped around for \"snap courses.\" Today no American college, not even Harvard, allows such freedom. Land Grants and Cow Colleges In 1857 Justin Morrill of Vermont introduced a bill in the House of Representa- tives providing tfiat some of the country's public lands be sold and the proceeds used to establish colleges. His measure was in line with the 1860 Republican platform: the liberal use of public lands to promote internal improvements. Usually, internal improvements meant roads, canals, and railroads. But schooling had a long history of public backing, too. The Land Ordinance of 1785 dedicated the sixteenth section of every township to school financing (see p. 86). The \"common man\" used his first ballots to demand free, tax-supported schools for his children (see pp. 277, 287). Now elementary schools were not enough; colleges were needed, and the church-supported \"fresh-water\" colleges were not meeting the need. Agriculture was changing; new methods had to be developed to meet new conditions in the western lands. Congressman l^orrill was interested in agriculture, and his measure provided for instruction in \"agriculture and the mechanic arts\" in the new colleges. Still, President Buchanan vetoed the bill, doubting that Congress had the right to make the land grants. Morrill persisted, and a new act was passed in 1862. Under it, each loyal state was allotted 30,000 acres per congressman, a^.^ the colleges taught not only agriculture but military science and tactics as well. .^ second bill, passed in 1890, added further benefits. By this time, Morrill was the \"grand old man of the Republi- can party,\" a senator interested chiefly in finance and the tariff. Some sixty-nine land-grant colleges were established under the terms of the two measures. No longer scorned as \"cow colleges,\" they include many of our leading universities.

A legacy left by Johns Hopkins of Baltimore made possible the first good graduate school for general studies and one of the world's finest medical schools. Bequests by John D. Rockefeller helped to make the University of Chicago a center of research in fields as varied as economics, biology, and Egyptology. The railroad magnate Leland Stan- ford estabbshed a great university in Palo Alto, Cahfomia. Along with the growth of privately endowed universities and technical schools went an ex- pansion of state universities. Such institutions owed a great deal to the passage of the Morrill Act in 1862. This law, a landmark in American education, granted the states public lands for the endowment of colleges to teach \"agriculture and the mechanic arts,\" but \"without excluding other scientific and classical studies.\" Eventually the land-grant colleges received the proceeds from thirteen million acres of land. By 1900 American college education was not only on a higher plane than ever before, but was more widely available than that provided in any other country, except possibly Scotland. Public Libraries For those who wished to continue their edu- cation, American cities provided opportunities which had never existed before. The most im- portant agencies promoting adult education were improved public libraries. In 1876 the American Library Association was founded to encourage \"the best reading for the largest number at the least expense.\" The pubhc library, receiving support both from taxes and private donors, was by 1900 coming \"to be recognized as no less important than the schoolhouse in the system of popular education.\" SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE While American universities were improving as agencies of teaching, they were also becoming centers of scientific research. Their faculties contained men whose discoveries were of world- wide importance. The Harvard faculty in Presi- dent Eliot's time included Asa Gray, a botanist who made a thorough study of American plants ( see p. 280 ) ; Edward Pickering, who as head of the university's astronomical laboratory directed the compilation of the first photographic record of the universe; and William James, who was equally eminent and thought-provoking as a psychologist and as a philosopher. On the Yale faculty at the same time were James Dwight Dana, one of the world's foremost geologists; Josiah Willard Gibbs, who as a mathematical physicist helped to revolutionize conceptions of matter and energy; and Othniel C. Marsh, whose studies of fossil remains resulted in the discovery of the evolution of the horse. Marsh invented the term dinosaur— from the Greek deinos (terri- ble) and sauros (lizard)— to describe a previ- ously unknown kind of animal whose remains he discovered in alluvial rocks in Colorado. Scientists of equal eminence were found in new private universities such as Johns Hopkins and Chicago, and state universities such as Illinois and California. The laboratory now stood with the library as a center of university life. The general public knew little of the uni- versity professors who extended the boundaries of pure science, but it was immensely impressed with inventors like Alexander Graham Bell. Bell, whose training was in elocution and \\\\-hose great interest was in teaching deaf children to speak, figured out the principles of an effective tele- phone before he taught himself enough about electricity to build one. In 1876 he sent the first telephonic communication to his laboratory as- sistant, \"Mr. Watson, come here; I want you.\" Only a year later he carried on telephonic con-"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"Industrial America 407 versation between Boston and New York, and his invention soon went into commercial production.

Edison actually made few original discoveries. His greatness lay in his abiHty to turn the inven- tions of others into practical use. Thus the in- candescent electric Hght had- been demonstrated in England in 1840, but it was Edison who worked out cheap methods of supplying power and v\\^^e, as well as filaments that lasted more than just a few minutes. Edison had a fantastic capacity for sustained work, and he surroimded himself with highly skilled technicians. The \"in- vention laboratory\" that he founded in Menlo Park, New Jersey, was the ancestor of the great industrial research laboratories of today. The growth of industry brought with it a host of new developments: a railroad net bind- ing all sections into one market and one nation, the largest business concerns the world had ever seen, vast cities some of whose populations were counted in milhons, great advances in human knowledge and technology. It also brought complex problems, some of which have been touched on in this chapter and some of which will be taken up later: large-scale un- employment, crime, slums, ugliness, fraudulent business practices, violent labor disputes, and corruption in politics. There was no possibility of turning back, however, and httle disposition to do so. As Franklin D. Roosevelt said later, \"So manifest were the advantages of the ma- chine age . . . that the United States fearlessly, cheerfully, and, I think, rightly accepted the bitter with the sweet. It was thought that no price was too high for the advantages we could draw from a finished industrial system.\" Activities: Chapter 15 For Mastery and Review 1.

WALT WHITMAN At the close of the Civil War, the Great Plains (see map, p. 9) were still thought to be forever barred to white settlement. The vast Rocky Mountain plateau was equally void of white men, save for a few mining towTis and Mormon communities. Yet in the ensuing twenty-five years these regions were developed with almost incredible speed. You could not tell the truth about the growth of the West, it was said, without lying. RAILROAD BUILDING AND CONSOLIDATION This rapid development was made possible by the railroad. As a Dakota editor wrote, \"With- out the railroad it would have required a century to accomplish what has been done in five years.\" The generation after the war saw both the great period of railroad building in the West and the consolidation of eastern lines. Steel produced by the Bessemer process (see p. 393) enabled the companies to lay heavier rails and build bridges which could carry bigger cars and more power- ful locomotives. Other technical problems were solved. The Westinghouse air brake at last made possible the simultaneous braking of the cars and the locomotive. The invention of the kerosene lamp and later of the electric light permitted better headlights for night running. In 1860 railroads carried less than half as much freight as inland waterways; in 1890 railroads carried five times as much. The large amounts of capital needed to build and equip railroads were obtained from various sources. The federal government gave western railroads money grants totaling over 700 million dollars and public lands whose acreage equaled that of Texas. Help came from states and mu- nicipalities and still more from private investors. The savings of New Englanders, accumulated from the West Indies and China trade, from clippers and whalers, from textile and shoe factories, helped to build thousands of miles of track across western prairies. An equally im- portant source of private capital, however, was Europe. The value of American railroad securi- ties owned by British investors in 1900 was tsvo 409"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"410 The Emergence of Modem America and a half billion dollars— over twice the national debt of the United States at that time. First Transcontinental Railroad, 1869 The most dramatic achievement in raihoad building was the completion of the first trans- continental line. Discussion of this project began with the discovery of gold in California in 1849. During the 1850's no less than ten routes were surveyed, and the Gadsden Purchase was ac- quired from Mexico principally because the Gila River Valley provided the lowest route across the western plateau. Nothing was decided be- fore the war, however, because of intense sec- tional rivalry, the South wanting the eastern terminal at New Orleans, the North preferring St. Louis or Chicago. In 1862, with the South temporarily out of the Union, Congress passed an act to encourage the building of a Pacific Railroad. From Omaha the Union Pacific Com- pany was to build westward, and from Sacra- mento, the Central Pacific Company was to run lines easbA'ard. The federal government lent money to those companies at the rate of $16,000, $32,000, or $48,000 per mile, according to the terrain. They also received land grants along the right of way averaging 6,400 acres per mile. Construction began in earnest shordy after the war and proceeded rapidly. The two rail- roads were competing to get more government money and public lands, as well as to secure a greater share of the trade of the interior. At the height of the struggle the Union Pacific builders employed 10,000 men. Crews of Irishmen work- ing for the Union Pacific and of Chinese work- ing for the Central Pacific sometimes laid as much as six miles of track a day. Once on a bet of $10,000, a Central Pacific crew laid ten miles of track between sunrise and sundown, an all- time world's record. \"It is a hteral fact that more ground was ironed in some days, by the two companies together, than the ox teams of 1849 averaged in a single day's journey.\" The steam shovel not yet having been in- vented, the digging and grading were done by men and teams. Holes for blasting had to be driven by men with sledge hammers. The Union Pacific building crews had to be protected from Indian attacks and bufl^alo stampedes. The Cen- tral Pacific had an even more difficult time with the Sierra Nevada ranges and with snow that sometimes collected in drifts sixty feet deep. All its heavy equipment was carried from the East 19,000 miles aroimd Cape Horn to California in a fleet of thirty ships. The two fines met at Promontory Point, Utah, and on May 10, 1869, the \"wedding of the rails\" took place. The whole country was able to Hsten as the transcontinental telegraph re- ported the blow of the silver sledge hammer driving the golden spike. A magnetic ball dropped from a pole on the top of the Capitol in Washington; in Chicago a seven-mile proces- sion paraded through the streets; everywhere the air rang with the bells of churches and fire- houses. The \"northwest passage\" from the At- lantic Ocean to the Pacific had at last been established. James J. Hill, Railroad Builder The first transcontinental line was followed shortly by others— the Northern Pacific; the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe; the Southern Pacific; and the Great Northern. Like other big businesses, these railroads needed at the top men of ability, imagination, and drive. The greatest of the western builders was James J. Hill ( 1838-1916 ), creator of the Great Northern. Hill was a small, short-tempered, red-bearded man of titanic energy. He foresaw that his line would tie together the whole northern tier of the United States from Lake Superior to Puget Sound. It would carry flour westward from the Dakotas and Minnesota for eventual shipment to Japan and China, and carry Pacific Coast lumber eastward for bams, silos, and homes in"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"The driving of the golden spike that linked the Union Pacific and Central Pacific Railroads was cele- brated all over the United States. The two companies had been competing to lay the most track, and sometimes as many as eight or ten miles were laid in a single day. the Great Plains. \"We consider ourselves and the people along our lines,\" he said, \"as co- partners in the prosperity of the country we both occupy.\" Believing passionately in the life of the Plains farmer, he wanted to promote maximum settlement. \"Population v\\'ithout the Prairie,\" Hill wrote, \"is a mob, and the Prairie without Population is a desert.\" Hill started to build the Great Northern in 1879. He had neither federal subsidies nor land grants to help him, and not too much private capital either. His railroad had to pay its own way from the first. The only way to do this was to encourage settlement as soon as the rails were laid. All sorts of inducements were offered to get farmers to settle along \"Jim HiU's main line\"— free transportation from eastern ports, credit. cheap tools, and farm machinery. Once estab- hshed, farmers were furnished with high quality cattle, given free advice on how to improve crops, and offered prizes for the best quahty produce. Hill saw to it that his bridges and embank- ments were well constructed, and his grades less steep than those of competitive lines. He was constantly with the construction gangs, some- times even seizing a pick or shovel himself. This careful construction kept maintenance costs down, enabling Hill to charge lower rates; this, in turn, meant lower prices and better markets for the grain, cattle, and lumber he shipped. Hill made mistakes, such as encouraging the planting of wheat in areas more suitable for grazing, but he showed greatness in keeping"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"412 The Emergence of Modem America fixedly to the idea that what was good for the Northwest was good for the Great Northern. Cornelius Vanderbilt, Railroad Consolidator Of as much importance in the development of the country as the building of lines to the Pacific was the consohdation of existing railroads in the Middle West, East, and South into a few great systems. A highly successful railroad con- solidator was Cornelius Vanderbilt ( 1794-1877 ) , who built up the New York Central system. A hard-bitten former ferryboat captain, Vander- bilt had assumed the unofficial title of \"commo- dore\" because he owned a small fleet of coastal trading vessels. He did not seriously enter rail- roading until his late sixties, when he acquired two short lines running into New York City from the north, and then managed to buy control of the New York Central which ran as far as Buffalo. Vanderbilt was a combination of shrewd speculator, ruthless competitor, and man of vision. Much of his huge fortune came from stock market operations. He was master of the tricks whereby insiders rigged the stock market in order to force prices down or up as they pleased. In business deals the Commodore sometimes showed scant respect for either law or the pubhc interest. On the other hand, he saw the great benefits which would come from tying the Great Lakes region to New York City by a water-level route. He extended his control over lines running all the way to Chicago, as well as stretching through Michigan and into southern Canada. In addition to bringing many fines under one management, Vanderbilt made great improvements in service. He built the Grand Central Terminal in New QUESTION -Why was it y^^^ City with difficult to stop a railroad ^, , .. i_ • .. -a iirL X ^L J tlie largest tram train/ What were the ad- , , . , ,, vantages of the air brake? ^^^^ ^\" *^ '^\"^^'^ -600 feet long and 200 wide. He was one of the first to use the Westinghouse air brake, and the very first to lay a four-track main line (two tracks for freight, two for pas- senger traffic). Consolidation proceeded rapidly in the pe- riod from the end of the Civil War to the turn of the century so that eventually most of the traffic was controlled by seven major systems with terminals in major cities and scores of branches reaching out into the countryside. A \"standard\" gauge (4 feet, 8'i inches) had been universally accepted and time zones estabfished. The big systems were able to put on better roll- ing stock, to shunt cars from one section to an- other according to seasonal needs, and to speed long distance transportation. They made so many economies in operation that the average rate per mile for a ton of freight dropped from 2 cents in 1860 to three-quarters of a cent in 1900. FATE OF THE BUFFALO AND THE INDIANS rhe railroads played a part in the extermina- tion of the buffalo which opened the western plains to cattle grazing. Buffalo formerly ranged eastward as far as Pennsylvania and the Caro- linas, but their natural habitat was the Great Plains, where their numbers defied counting. It was estimated that in 1865 the herds numbered twelve to fifteen million animals. The building of the Union Pacific Railroad cut the herds in half, as a period of ruthless butchery began. Vast numbers were killed for their hides alone. Many were slaughtered by \"sportsmen,\" who cut out the tongue or a steak to eat and left the rest of the animal for the wolves. Whole train loads of bones were shipped east for making fertilizer or charcoal. By 1883 the herds were wiped out and the buffalo was close to extinction. This wanton slaughter meant disaster for the Plains Indians. These master horsemen and skill- ful warriors had been, in the words of Walter P. Webb, \"the most effectual barrier ever set up by a native American population against Euro- pean invaders in the temperate zone. For bvo"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"\"The Cowboy,\" after a drawing by Frederic Reming- ton, who is best known for his depictions of the West. In addition to being colorful, each item of clothing and equipment shown here served a practical purpose. and a half centuries they maintained themselves with great fortitude against the Spanish, Eng- lish, French, Mexican, Texan, and American invaders, withstanding missionaries, whisky, disease, gunpowder and lead.\" To most of the tribes of the Great Plains, such as the Sioux, the Comanches, and the Cheyennes, fighting and horse-raiding were all-absorbing sports and prowess in battle the highest virtue. They put up such an amazing fight against troops sent against them that it has been estimated that each brave killed by the soldiers cost the federal government a million dollars. But the cause of the Indians was doomed in any case, since they were almost entirely dependent on the buffalo for food, clothing, fuel, and shelter. When the herds were wiped out, the tribes had the choice of starvation or virtual imprisonment in reserva- tions. In spite of a few victories, such as the defeat of General George Custer on the Little Big Horn in 1876, and heroic deeds, such as the 1,500-mile march of the Nez Perces under Chief Joseph in 1877, the result was a foregone con- clusion. Chief Joseph's speech at his surrender summarized the hopelessness of the Indian cause: Our chiefs are killed. . . . The little children are freezing to death. My people . . . have no blankets, no food. ... I want to have time to look for my children and see how many of them I can find. Maybe I shall find them among the dead. Hear me, my chiefs; I am tired; my heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever. Many Americans were ashamed of the in- justice done the Indians. The report of the Secretary of the Interior to Congress in 1868 called their treatment by the United States government \"revolting.\" In 1881 the attention of the country was focused on the matter by the pubhcation of Helen Hunt Jackson's A Century of Dishonor. Mrs. Jackson pleaded that the whites stop \"cheating, robbing, breaking prom- ises.\" Her book led to the founding of the Indian Rights Association, devoted to improving the lot of the red men. The early Indian reformers went on the prob- ably mistaken assumption that the best thing for the red man would be to make him as much as possible like the white. Their attitude was reflected in the Dawes Act of 1887, which broke down Indian tribal organizations and divided some Indian reservations into 160-acre home- steads. Although the law was well intentioned, it did the Indians little or no good. They usually had little skill at farming and almost no concep- tion of private ownership of land. They were too often at the mercy of greedy real estate speculators and grafting Indian Agents. Between 1887 and 1934, they lost an estimated 86,000,000 of 138,000,000 acres. Most of the land left in their control was almost worthless."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"The Opening of the Trans-Mississippi West 415 THE CATTLE KINGDOM The removal of the buffalo and the Indians, as well as the opening of eastern markets by the railroad, ushered in the great days of the cattle- men. The buffalo grass of the Great Plains provided free pasturage for millions of steers, and the meat packers of Chicago bought all steers deUvered at the railheads. The Open Range and the Long Drive The open-range cattle industry started in Texas in Spanish times, and the Spaniards developed most of its techniques— herding by mounted men, branding, roping, and the round- up. From the Spanish, too, came the distinctive dress and equipment of the cowboy— except for the six-shooter, which was so cumbersome that it was only worn occasionally. From the Texas plains came breeds of cattle able to shift for themselves, the most picturesque being the famous longhoms. In 1865 it was estimated that there were over three million cattle in Texas, but no one knew for sure because most of them were mavericks— without o\\Miers. In Texas, cattle cost $3 or $4 a head; in St. Louis or Chicago they could be sold for $30 or $40. The \"four-dollar cow\" was connected with the \"fort>'-dollar market\" by means of the \"long drive.\" As the spring turned the grasslands green, herds of steers were driven northwards to shipping centers on the railroads. The routes of the long drive were known as trails, such as the Chisholm Trail from near San Antonio to Abilene, a station on the Kansas Pacific Railroad (see map, p. 413). A single herd might number 2,500 and be attended by eight to ten cowbo\\'s, a trail boss, and wranglers to care for the horses. Cowboys had a rightful pride in their work, which demanded skill, intelHgence, quick judg- ment, and courage. It also demanded discipline, and it is not surprising that many cowboys were veterans of the Civil War. The profits obtained from a successful drive were enormous. On an investment of $15,000 a man might make $30,000 in less than a year. A 30 to 40 per cent return was normal. As the buffalo were cleared from the Plains, the Cattle Kingdom expanded northward until by 1885 it covered an area half as large as Europe, extend- ing from Texas to Montana. From the East, even from Great Britain and France, men with money to invest and a taste for adventure hastened to the Plains and bought cattle. Although offering vast profits, the industry was beset by diflBculties. Steers might go bUnd from drought, drowTi in flash floods, die in stampedes, or get infected by the dreaded Texas fever. They might be stolen by rustlers or shot by angry homesteaders trying to protect their crops. Eventually, the open-range cattle industry collapsed even more rapidly than it had risen. Too many animals were put on the ranges, and overgrazing resulted. Overproduction drove prices dowTi. Sheepherders and homesteaders competed with the cattlemen for available land. Then in 1885-1887 disaster struck. A cold winter v\\'as followed by a summer so dry that the grass withered and streams disappeared. In the ensuing winter, that of 1886-1887, terrible blizzards covered the ground so deep with snow that the steers could not paw down to grass. Then followed an unprecedented cold spell, with temperatures ranging as low as — 60°F. \"When spring finally came,\" wrote Ray Allen Billington, \"cattlemen saw a sight they spent the rest of their lives trying to forget. Carcass piled upon carcass in every ravine, gaunt skeletons stagger- ing about on frozen feet, trees stripped bare of their bark- those were left as monuments to the thoughtless greed of the ranchers.\" The cattle industry survived this terrible blow, but the day of the open range was ended. From then on herds were raised on fenced-in ranches; English Herefords replaced longhoms; the cowboy be- came a ranch hand."},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"BILLS LADING GIVEN BY THE NONTANA&MHO TRANSPORTATION LINE Virginia City, Bannock Citj, Deer Lodge The New York Historical Society When new mining stril<es were made in the West, advertisements of transportation were distributed in the East.

Here a wagon that started out bravely, with the slogan of \"Pike's Peak or Bust,\" returned home with the line, \"Busted, by Thunder.\" THE MINING FRONTIER Another element in the growth of the West was the advance of the mining frontier. The finding of gold in California inspired prospectors to explore the Rocky Mountain and Great Basin regions. They were first rewarded by a gold strike in Colorado in 1858, which set off a stampede to the region the next year: The first breath of spring started the hordes westward. Steamboats crowded to the rails poured throngs of immigrants ashore at every Missouri River town. . . . All through April, May, and June they left the jumping-off places in a regular parade of Conestoga wagons, hand carts, men on horseback, men on foot— each with \"Pike's Peak or Bust\" crudely printed on their packs and wagon canvas. ... By the end of June more than 100,000 \"fifty- niners\" were in the Pike's Peak country. Law and Order in the Mining Camps The Colorado strike was followed by many others; gold was discovered in the Black Hills of Dakota, copper in Montana, silver in many places, especially in the fabulous Comstock Lode at Virginia City, Nevada. Every discovery attracted a swarm of fortune seekers, and new mining towns appeared overnight. Human life was cheap in these communities of tents and crude houses, with their rows of saloons and gambUng houses. There was a vital need for law enforcement agencies to settle disputes over mining claims, and to punish or prevent crime. Law and order were sometimes provided by self-appointed vigilance commit- tees, sometimes by mass meetings which, follow- ing a tradition going back to the Mayflower Compact, drew up their own rules and elected their own officials.

The Wild West The Wild West captured the imagination of Americans at once. Dime novels and popular ballads spread the adventures of Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, and Jesse James. A Wild West Show became part of Bamum and Bailey's famous circus; QUESTION • Why was Annie Oakley, the the Wild West wild? girl sharpshooter, appeared on vau- deville stages everywhere. The Wild West period lasted little more than thirty years, yet its fascination continues, as shown by Wild West storybooks and comics, dude ranches, cowboy songs and costumes, and the \"West- ems\" produced by Hollywood and shown on television. The picturesqueness of the Wild West tends to hide its ugly features. The conquest of the Great Plains and the Rockies by the invading cattlemen, miners, and homesteaders was ap- pallingly destructive of natural resources, wild- life, and human beings. Something of the \"morn- ing after\" shock of this episode appeared in a speech that Charles Marion Russell, a frontier artist, made to \"forward looking citizens\" in Helena, Montana: I have been called a pioneer. In my book a pioneer is a man who comes to a virgin country. traps off all the fur, kills oflF all the wild meat, cuts down all the trees, grazes off all the grass, plows the roots up, and strings ten million miles of wire. A pioneer destroys things and calls it civilization. I wish to God this country was just like it was when I first saw it and that none of you folks were here at all. PEOPLING THE GREAT PLAINS For nearly forty years after cultivation ap- proached them, the Great Plains resisted settle- ment. Even allowing for the Indian menace, the most fundamental reason for farmers* unwill- ingness to venture into the great ocean of grass was that it was a wholly new environment. The frontiersman was used to getting water by dig- ging a well 10 or 20 feet into the ground. In the Plains few streams ran all year round, and underground water was 30 to 300 feet down. The American pioneer was a woods dweller, dependent on trees for fuel, buildings, and fences. On the Plains, trees were found only in the bottom lands near rivers. These conditions discouraged settlers. By 1880 the Indians no longer offered a hazard. Other diiBculties were overcome by the progress of the industrial revolution. Cheap iron and steel made possible the drilled well in a sheet-iron case and the iron windmill. Barbed wire made up for the lack of wooden fence rails. As has been noted, the most impor- tant factor in promoting settlement was the rail- road. \"You may,\" wrote a spectator of the Dakota boom of the early 1880's, \"stand ankle deep in the short grass of uninhabited wilder- ness; next month a mixed train will glide over the waste and stop at some point where the railroad has decided to locate a town. Men, women, and children will jump out of the cars, and their chattels will tumble out after them.

By 1880, two men and a team could harvest and bind 20 acres of wheat a day. The steam-driven threshing machine also came into general use. Other machines speeded the production of com and hay. In addition to solving technical problems, the industrial revo- lution speeded the expansion of agriculture by creating a vast new urban market for food, both in America and Europe. Homestead Act, 1862 Congress passed in 1862 the famous Home- stead Act whereby a \"head of a family\" who was a citizen or intending to become one might acquire a 160-acre farm for ten dollars. To in- sure that the land went to actual settlers it provided that the o\\vner must reside on or culti- vate the land for five years. The act was passed as a result of nearly half a century of agitation by western farmers and eastern laborers. The Homestead Act did not work out as planned. An immense amoimt of fraud in the operation of the law enabled speculators instead of actual settlers to get the land. Requirements that a would-be homesteader put up a home and culti- vate the land were met by laying down a few logs as a \"foundation,\" and scattering a few grains of com. People became \"heads of fami- hes\" by temporarily adopting neighbors' chil- dren. A more important reason for the ineffec- tiveness of the Homestead Act was that much of the most desirable land, near railroad lines, was usually controlled by the railroad companies themselves. Annie, Get Your Gun ^^ Annie Oakley was the last of one type of pioneer and the first of another. Born In 1860, she became famous only after the frontier had closed and the frontier skills of shooting, riding, and axemanship had been relegated mainly to profes- sional exhibitions. As a performer in such exhibitions, Annie bravely invaded a man's field. She more than held her own, setting the pace for later women in business and the professions. Too small for farm work as a child, Annie developed her marksmanship shooting rabbits and squirrels to feed her family. At fifteen, while visiting Cincinnati, she accepted the challenge of an exhibition rifleman. She shot down twenty-five glass balls to his twenty-four. Her bested opponent, Frank Butler, married her the next year. The Butlers joined the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show, and Annie became world famous. She met Queen Victoria in England, outfired the Grand Duke Michael in Russia, and neatly shot a cigarette from the lips of Prince Wilhelm in Germany. The highlights of this career form the basis for Irving Berlin's musical comedy Annie Get Your Gun. High skill with a rifle no longer commands world admiration, but Annie Oakley's name still recalls a woman who achieved perfection in a \"man's world.\" (Theme 5, see p. xii)"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"The Opening of the Trans-Mississippi West 419 \"Selling\" the West The ineffectiveness of the Homestead Act provided Westerners with a grievance, but probably did not discourage settlement. Al- though railroads sometimes discouraged the acquisition of free land, they actively promoted the sale of their own. They did not charge high prices because they wanted settlers to get the land into production. Land-grant railroads had \"Bureaus of Immigration\" to persuade farmers to settle along their lines. They maintained oflBces in the principal European cities, and agents in eastern seaports to meet immigrants as they left the boat. Steamship companies and western states joined the railroads in promoting the West. Advertisements described the region as so healthy that it cured all known diseases. The industrious man could expect to become wealthy; an $8,000 investment, it was claimed, might soon result in a steady income of $11,000 per year. The women were not forgotten, and the West was pictured as a happy hunting ground for unmarried ladies. \"When a daughter of the East is once beyond the Missouri,\" said one railroad advertisement, \"she rarely recrosses it except on a bridal tour.\" To offset the myth of the \"Great American Desert,\" a new myth was created to the effect that rainfall on the Great Plains would increase with cultivation; a Nebraska promoter summed it up in the catchy epigram, \"Rain follows the plow.\" The production of wheat, centering in Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Nebraska, quad- dupled. Nor did all this growth take place at the frontier. In the previously occupied \"corn-hog\" belt, extending from Ohio to Iowa, output in- creased as rapidly as in the new wheat lands. Wisconsin became a great center of cheese production. Near every great city, truck gardens were developed to provide vegetables, and a \"milkshed\" to supply fresh dairy products for the growing urban populations. Difficulties of Life on the Plains The life of a Great Plains farmer seldom ap- proached the glowing prophecies of railroad agents. The climate supposed to cure all known diseases turned out to be severe. In the summer the temperature might go over 100°F. for days on end. In winter there were periods of great cold, and terrible blizzards drove the snow through every chink in doors and windows. Prairie fires were a constant danger in the spring and fall. Sometimes there appeareo, as if from nowhere, huge swarms of grasshoppers which ate everything green, choked wells to the brim, broke the branches off fruit trees by their weight, and even devoured harnesses and tool handles. Worst of all disasters was drought. The rainfall of the Plains region is markedly less than that of the wooded East, dropping from about 30 to 40 inches along the 98th meridian to as little as 10 inches just east of the Rockies. Much of it was land suitable only for grazing that should never have been plowed. The greatest push westward into the Great Plains took place in the early 1880's, during a wet period which offered false promise of abundant crops. In the late 1880's drought drove thousands back east in despair. William Allen White, the famous editor of the Emporia Gazette, thus described a family he saw return- ing from western Kansas: There came through Emporia yesterday two old- fashioned mover wagons headed east. The stock in the caravan would invoice four horses, very poor and very tired, one mule more disheartened than the horses, and one sad-eyed dog. ... A few farm implements of the simpler sort had been loaded in the wagons, but. ... the rest of the impedimenta had been left upon the battlefield. . . . These mov- ers . . . had seen it stop raining for months at a time. They had heard the fury of the winter wind as it came whining across' the short burned grass. . . . They have tossed through hot nights, wild with worry, and have arisen only to find their worst"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"420 The Emergence of Modem America nightmares grazing in reality on the brown stubble in front of their sun-warped doors. White went on to say that the family's spirits revived amid the plenty of eastern Kansas and they were ready to try again. In spite of all diffi- culties, however, most settlers managed to con- quer their physical environment. Water from deep wells enabled them to plant gardens and trees around their homes. The railroads brought lumber and brick for houses to replace sod huts, and coal to replace cornstalks or hay as fuel. The Literature of the Sod House Frontier The struggle of the farmers with the Plains produced a hteratin-e quite unlike that of the Wild West. Cowboys and miners were usually young men; their Uves were adventurous; they were on the move. But the homesteader took on responsibilities difficult to shed; he often pledged himself to a bank, invested in tools and land, and started to raise a family. When misfortxme hit, he had to weather it out. It is natural to find, therefore, that the literature of the Plains was reaUstic, sometimes bitter. This can be seen in the stories of Hamlin Garland, \\\\'ho was bom on a Wisconsin farm in 1860. Garland's family moved west three times during his boyhood. In books such as Main-Travelled Roads and A Son of the Middle Border, he told \"a tale of toil that's never done.\" Although de- scribing moments of joy such as harvest time, or of beauty, as when the spring touched the Plains, Garland refused to say that \"butter was always golden and biscuits invariably hght and flaky.\" \"I will not He,\" he wrote, \"even to be a patriot. A proper proportion of the sweat, flies, heat, dirt, and drudgery shall go in.\" A principal source of settlers for the north- em portion of the Great Plains was Scandinavia. So many settlers came to the wheat country that by 1890 four hundred Minnesota towns bore Scandinavian names. Letters written to relatives back home described the wonders of the new land. \"Here it is not asked,\" wTOte one, \"what or who was your father, but the question is, what are you?\" Another wrote of the pleasure of eating white bread every day and pork three times a week. StiU another remarked that here was a country where there were no thieves or beggars. But they told of troubles too: Indian raids, prairie fires, locusts like drifts of snow. Such troubles provide the subject of the greatest novel of the Great Plains, O. E. Rolvaag's Giants in the Earth, wTitten in Norwegian. It describes the heroic efforts of Per Hansa and his wife Beret to estabfish a farm in South Dakota. They eventually triumph, but the human cost is terrible: Beret goes slowly mad, and Per dies in a blizzard. Frontier Women For women, the pioneering phase of life on the Plains often meant loneliness and drudgery in a sod house that could never be kept clean. \"Bom and scrubbed, suffered and died,\" is the epitaph given a farmer's wife in one of Hamlin Garland's poems. Yet the settlement of the West owed more to the endless toil of frontier women than to Indian fighters, cattlemen, and prospec- tors. A character in Edna FerbeT-'s novel Cimarron pays this tribute: You can't read the histor>' of the United States, my friends . . . without learning the great stor>' of those thousands of unnamed women . . . women in mud-caked boots and calico dresses and sunbonnets, crossing the prairie and the desert and the moun- tains enduring hardship and privation.

Willa Gather described Black Hawk, the locale of My Antonia, as \"a clean, well-planted little prairie to\\vn, with white fences, and good green yards about the dwellings, wide, dusty streets, and shapely httle trees growing along the wooden sidewalks.\" A prominent building mentioned in My Antonia in Black Hawk was a new brick high school. As soon as farmers began to make a sur- plus, they established churches and schools. The Morrill Act (see p. 405) helped the new states to establish universities. These were open to girls as well as boys; the pioneer women had earned for their sex a new position of equahty. Farmers' Loss of Independence The sorest trouble the farmer had to face was often not the struggle with his environment, but the fact that he was in the grip of economic forces beyond his control. Formerly he had been a subsistence farmer, producing almost every- thing he needed. Subsistence agriculture gave him little cash, but he was \"beholden\" to no- body. The independent farmer was a standard character in melodramas, especially when con- trasted with unhappy factory hands, purse- proud rich men, or dishonest \"city slickers.\" With the opening of great urban markets, farmers tended more and more to specialize on a single cash crop, such as wheat, milk, or cattle. Their income naturally went up, but so did their expenses, since QUESTION . Which man ^^ey now had to enjoyed more security: the buy agricultural isolated subsistence farmer machinery, store of the Kentucky frontier, or clothing, and even the wheat farmer of the food. The new DakotasP J^^Q^ for ^ash made farmers less independent. Their prosperity, their very pos- session of their farms, might depend on the unpredictable price of grain. A bumper wheat crop in the Russian Ukraine might mean a lean year in the Dakotas. The farmer became de- pendent on the railroad which carried his crop to market, on the commission merchant who marketed it, and on the owners of grain eleva- tors who stored it. The man who raised hogs or beef cattle was in a similar situation; he had little bargaining power, having to take what the packers paid him. The new type of cultivation demanded more capital investment than the old. While land itself was cheap, it cost money to drill wells, put up windmills, enclose fields in barbed wire, and buy machinery. Since few fanners could put up the cash outright, they had to borrow by mort- gaging their land. Then in order to pay interest on the mortgages, they were forced to concen- trate more than ever on raising cash crops. If prices dropped or a lean year came, they could not meet their payments and lost their land. By 1900 about one-third of the farms in the com and wheat areas were cultivated by tenants. Not surprisingly, farmers developed a strong sense of grievance. They fed the cities, sup- ported the railroads, supplied the commodities that paid for European investments, and yet somehow the wealth they created seemed to be siphoned off to others. Their attitude was well expressed by a Nebraska newspaper: There are three great crops raised in Nebraska. One is a crop of com, one a crop of freight rates, and one a crop of interest. One is produced by farmers, who sweat and toil, from the land. The other two are produced by men who sit in their offices and behind their bank counters and farm the fanners. End of a Dream Perhaps the cruelest blow to the farmer was loss of status. Until recently he had been held up as the most admirable and the happiest of men. Thus a congressman supporting free homesteads in 1851 had said:"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"CONQUERING THE PLAINS These pictures show the importance of new inventions to the farmers of the \"sodhouse frontier.\" Barbed wire, farra machinery, and steel plows all cost money, however, so that the farmers of the Great Plains were often burdened with debt before they started to wring a living from the soil.

The life of a fanner is peculiarly favorable to virtue; and both individuals and communities are generally happy in proportion as they are virtuous. His manners are simple, and his nature unsophisti- cated. . . . His life does not impose excessive toil, and yet it discourages idleness. The fanner lives in rustic plenty, remote from the contagion of popular vices, and enjoys, in their greatest fruition, the blessings of health and contentment. But now power and prestige had shifted from the rural areas to the cities; in the new urban America, country people were regarded not as the backbone of the nation, but as \"rubes,\" \"hicks,\" and \"hayseeds.\" Along with the farmer's loss of independence and status came an event that had a profound efiFect on the American psychology. In 1890 the census bureau reported that settlement had been so rapid \"that there can hardly be said to be a frontier line.\" Although in fact much land was still unoccupied and new settlement continued at a brisk pace until well into the twentieth century, the news that the frontier was closing encouraged prophets of doom, who saw the end of a \"safety-valve of social discontent.\" For- merly the existence of unoccupied land at the frontier had promoted the idea that Americans could always make a fresh start.

WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS The unpleasant aspects of the new industrial America drove many thoughtful men first to questioning, then to protest. The passage above is taken from a letter to Henry James from a fellow novelist, Wilham Dean Howells. The writer was not driven to any such critical atti- tude by failure to achieve wealth or reputation. On the contrary, Howells was a self-taught writer who rose from a poverty-stricken boy- hood in Ohio to the enviable position of editor of the Atlantic Monthly when he was still in his thirties. But he came to feel that he must protest against the moral confusions and the injustices of the new industrial age. In a novel. The Rise of Silas Lapham, he portrayed the erosion of character that a husband and his wife undergo because of social ambition and desire for easy wealth. In A Hazard of New Fortunes, Howells portrayed the unfeeHng attitude of the \"best people\" and the brutality of the police toward workers on strike against a streetcar company. An even more successful writer but no less disil- lusioned was Mark Twain ( pen name of Samuel L. Clemens). In The Gilded Age, he described the personal disasters brought on a family by greed and graft. His greatest novel, Huckleberry Finn, is on the face of it simply an adventure story— a prolonged \"chase\" set on the broad Mississippi. But by setting the natiu'al goodness of an illiterate Negro and a shiftless pauper boy against the cruelty and callousness of respect- able, pious folk, Clemens questioned the justice of middle-class society. One trouble was that the benefits of the immense new wealth created by the industrial revolution and the settling of millions of acres of virgin land were imequally divided. The rich seemed to be getting richer; the poor, poorer.

Although on the whole unsuccessful, these movements won a few victories, especially in promoting legislation based on a partial abandonment of the Jeffer- sonian principle that the government that governs best governs least. CURBING THE RAILROADS Although bringing immense benefits, the railroad corporations were guilty of a variety of abuses of the public interest. Even before lines were built, railroad oflBcials formed construc- tion companies, in which their participation was often secret, and then pocketed immense profits by overcharging their own railroads. Railroad companies bribed state legislators for favors such as land grants and tax exemptions. They evaded laws designed to make them give serv- ices in return for privileges. In a day when water trafBc was disappear- ing and automobile trucking not yet dreamed of, railroads more often than not enjoyed a \"natural monopoly.\" Railroads took advantage of this situation by charging more for short hauls, where they had a monopoly, than for long hauls, where they faced competition. Thus it cost shipp>ers more to send certain goods from Poughkeepsie, New York, to New York. City, where there was no choice but the New York Central Railroad, than all the way from Chicago, where the Pennsylvania and Erie railroads com- peted with it for the traffic. The New York Cen- tral also charged higher rates in winter, when the Erie Canal was frozen, than in summer, when it was open. Sometimes competing lines kept up rates artificially by a practice known as pooling, whereby companies made agreements to fix rates and divide the profits according to a prearranged formula. Still another abuse was the practice of favoring big shippers over small by granting rebates ( see p. 391 ) . Railroad Abuses Railroad financing was marked by a common abuse called \"stock watering.\" Getting its name from the scheme of feeding cattle salt and getting them to drink heavily just before being weighed for market, this was the practice of increasing the number of shares of a company without adding to its assets. When Jay Gould and James J. Fisk gained control of the Erie Railroad in 1868, they issued $71,000,000 of watered stock on a property worth $20,000,000. As insiders they profited by selling watered stock to a public still ignorant of its decrease in value. On another occasion Gould gained control of the Union Pacific Railroad and induced it to buy at inflated prices the stock of other railroads that he controlled. He made $10,000,000 on this deal alone. Such action swindled other stock- holders, and hurt the public because railroads that had inflated their stock issues had to keep rates high to pay dividends. The Grange Feeling against railroad abuses was ex- hibited all over the country, but was especially violent in the trans-Mississippi West, where there was practically no competition from other forms of transportation and where the lines had been favored by immense government subsidies in money and land. Although all major interests —businessmen, farmers, and laborers— believed themselves injured, it was a nation-wide farm organization that provided the driving force tov\\'ard attempts to end railroad abuses by legislation. The Patrons of Husbandry, com- monly called the Grange, was a secret organiza- tion founded in 1867. Reflecting the importance of women on the farm, it was the first fraternal organization to admit them on equal terms. Hamlin Garland remembered its rallies, with their brass bands, banners, and speechmaldng, as \"a most grateful relief from the sordid lone- liness of the farm.\" By 1874, Granger lodges"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"In the anti-railroad cartoon above, the farmer is say- ing of the Iron Horse that devours his produce: \"I can't afford this hired team; it takes every mite I can raise to feed him.\" Below, the Grange tries to arouse the sleepers. From such agitation came Granger laws, which attempted to regulate freight rates. ca3 contained a million and a half members and had become centers of political action. The Granger Laws The Patrons of Husbandry agitated so suc- cessfully that in the early 1870's several states passed legislation to end or prevent railroad misdoings. These \"Granger Laws\" attempted to fix maximum freight and passenger rates; they forbade discrimination between places or be- tween shippers; and they attempted to regulate other natural monopolies, such as grain elevators and warehouses. The railroads protested violently against the Granger laws. Their principal argument was the laissez-faire principle that government should not interfere with private enterprise. \"Can't I do what I want with my own?\" asked Commodore Vanderbilt. Railroad lawyers ar- gued that the Granger laws were unconstitu- tional because the Fourteenth Amendment forbade a state to \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" A railroad corporation was a legal \"per- son\"; if forced to charge lower rates it was deprived of \"property\"; regulatory laws were an \"undue\" extension of state legislative power. Defenders of the Granger laws pointed out that most railroads had received large favors from the federal and local governments. How could they now claim freedom from control in the public interest? Laissez-faire did not apply here. It postulates that an open market free of state control insures the public fair prices be- cause producers compete to produce cheaper goods for sale. But as a natural monopoly, the railroad had no competitors. Its rates must there- fore be controlled by government, representing the people at large. In 1876 and 1877 the Supreme Court decided several cases in favor of the Granger laws. In the most famous case, Miinn v. Illinois, the court supported by an 8 to 1 vote the right of an Illinois commission to fix rates for grain ele-"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"Protest Movements 429 vators. The court argued that since common carriers, such as railroads, and public utilities, such as grain elevators, \"stand in the very gate- way of commerce\" and \"take toll of all who pass,\" they exercise \"a sort of public oflBce.\" \"Property does indeed become clothed with a public interest,\" said the court, \"w^hen used in a manner to make it of public consequence, and affect the community at large.\" Therefore the warehouse companies \"must submit to being controlled by the public for the common good.\" Failure of the Granger Laws In spite of judicial support, the Granger laws were unsuccessful. The railroads fought them by cutting services or threatening to lay no more track until the acts were repealed. The laws also lost the backing of organized public opinion, as membership declined in the Grange. In attempting to reduce middlemen's profits, the Patrons of Husbandry had gone into busi- ness for themselves, setting up plow and reaper factories, grain elevators, packing plants, and banks. Bitterly fought by private companies and often inefficiently run, these businesses usually failed, and their collapse discredited the Grange. By 1880 its membership was less than a quarter of what it had been in 1874. This effort of the Grangers to undercut middlemen had one long- time result: the development of mail-order de- partment stores, selling direct to the consumer. The first mail-order house, Montgomery Ward & Co., of Chicago, was founded in 1872 espe- cially \"to meet the wants of the Patrons of Husbandry.\" Such Granger laws as remained were dealt a mortal blow in 1886. The Wabash Railway had charged shippers 25 cents a hundred pounds for carrying goods from Gilman, Illinois, to New York City, there being no other railroad into Gilman. It charged only 15 cents a hundred pounds from Peoria, Illinois, to New York; it was a longer distance, but there was competi- tion from other lines. This violated an Illinois statute forbidding the \"long and short haul\" abuse. The railroad appealed its case to the Supreme Court. While not directly attacking the principle laid down in Miinn v. Illinois, that public utilities must submit to government con- trol, the court held that states control only such traffic as lay entirely within their borders. Since most railroad traffic crossed the boundaries of states, the Wabash Railway decision practically wiped out state regulation of rates. Interstate Commerce Act, 1887 The Wabash decision led to such a demand for federal regulation of railroads that Congress passed the famous Interstate Commerce Act of 1887. This law declared that railroad charges must be \"reasonable and just\"; it forbade pool- ing, rebates, and higher rates for short hauls than long. The companies were required to pub- lish rates, give advance notice of all changes, and make annual financial reports to the federal government. Violations of these provisions were punishable by fines up to $5,000 for each offense. Enforcement of the law was placed imder the Interstate Commerce Commission, a group of five men appointed by the President. Regarding its immediate purpose, the Inter- state Commerce Act was a failure. The' Inter- state Commerce Commission lacked power to fix rates and could only make recommendations or bring suits in the federal courts. In sixteen cases that reached the Supreme Court— a pro- cess that took four years on an average— the court held for the railroads in fifteen. In 1892, Richard Olney, a corporation lawyer who later served as Attorney General under President Cleveland wrote a railroad official urging him not to advocate repeal of the Interstate Com- merce Act. \"It satisfies popular clamor for gov- ernment supervision of the railroads,\" observed Olney, \"at the same time that such supervision is almost entirely nominal.\" Nevertheless, the Interstate Commerce Act was one of the most important laws ever passed by Congress. It"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"430 The Emergence of Modern America established the precedent that the federal gov- ernment might control large-scale private enter- prise if the pubhc good seemed to require it. It also provided a model for regulatory commis- sions that today oversee activities as diverse as air lines, labor relations, and television. DEMAND FOR CHEAP MONEY If there was anything that farmers de- manded in the late nineteenth century more than the regulation of natural monopohes or the reduction of middlemen's profits, it was \"cheap money.\" To understand this, it is neces- sary to explore briefly the quantity theory of money, which was widely accepted at the time, although not thoroughly understood. According to the quantity theory, the value of money, hke that of any other commodity, changes according to the supply. Raise the number of dollars in circulation— in other words, inflate the currency —and the dollar buys less; prices go up. Restrict the amount of money in circulation— in other words, deflate the currency— and the dollar buys more; prices go down. This can be expressed in a simple mathematical equation: (1) Let P stand for prices. (2) Let M stand for amount of money in circu- lation. (3) Let T stand for the total amount of goods and personal services for sale. M_ T Then P = If the amount of money (M) is increased faster than the total production ( T ) , prices will go up. This is inflation. If the total amount of goods and services ( T ) increase faster than the money supply ( M ) , prices will go down. This is deflation. Actually, this simple form of the quantity theory of money is so incomplete as to be mis- leading. It leaves out two other factors: velocity —how fast money passes from hand to hand, and credit- which affects prices just as money and which is more abundant. But the simple equation given above is what the inflationists believed to be true in the late nineteenth cen- tury. It accorded closely with the facts of ag- ricultural life in the three decades after the Civil War. The production of agricultural staples such as wheat and cotton ( a large factor in T) nearly quadrupled, while the supply of money (M) increased very Uttle. The prices received by farmers (?) dropped by nearly two-thirds.^ Deflation and the Gold Standard The three decades after the close of the Civil War were a period of deflation. In 1865, with the currency inflated by the wartime issuance of greenbacks, there were $31 in circulation for every person in the country. By 1895, per capita circulation had sunk to $20. This was partly the result of a world-wide movement related to wide-spread adoption of the gold standard. When a country went on the gold standard, it made all its currency convertible into gold. Formerly most countries had been on a bi- metallic standard whereby the government coined both gold and silver and estabhshed the official value of each. In spite of official \"mint prices\" for gold and silver, their relative value often changed sharply. The California gold strike of 1849 so increased the amount of gold, for instance, that it became cheap in relation to silver. According to the tendency known as Gresham's Law, whereby dear money is hoarded while cheap money remains in circulation, silver went into hiding. This metal was so little used that the federal government issued 25-cent gold pieces and small bills, called \"shinplasters\" for denominations as low as 3 cents. The difficulty with the gold standard in the late nineteenth century was that world produc- 1 For a more thorough explanation of the quantity theorVt explaining the concepts of velocity and credit, see the definition of the Quantity Theory of Money in the glossary."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"Protest Movements 431 tion of gold did not increase as fast as the world production of goods. This restricted the currency supply and drove prices down. Deflation was hard on farmers, who bor- rowed money more heavily than ever before. When a wheat farmer borrowed $1,000 in 1880, with wheat at $1 a bushel, the principal of his loan equaled 1,000 bushels of wheat. But in 1890, with wheat at 75 cents a bushel, his debt equaled 1,333 bushels. To use a homely phrase, there was \"too much hog in the dollar.\" This state of affairs meant that thousands of farm owners lost their land and became tenants or hired men. Greenbacks and Free Silver As soon as greenbacks began to be called in during the late 1860's and prices began to drop, farmers started to demand inflation. They pro- tested that bankers and bondholders lent 50- cent dollars during the war, and now wanted to be repaid in 100-cent dollars. With the slogan, \"The same currency for the plowholders and the bondholder,\" western delegates to the Dem- ocratic Convention of 1868 were strong enough to force an inflationist plank into the party plat- form. In the mid-term election of 1878, a Green- back party polled over a million votes, electing fifteen congressmen. The Greenback movement dechned after 1880 as inflationists turned to free silver. In 1873, Congress decided to stop coining silver money and adopted the gold standard. Six years later, after building up a gold reserve of 200 million dollars, specie payments were resumed. These events caused a howl of protest from western silver miners because new mines, espe- cially the famous Comstock Lode, produced a flood of silver which would no longer be coined. Denouncing what tlic\\' called \"the Crime of \"73,\" siKer miners demanded a policy of \"free silver,\" meaning tliat the goxcmment should coin all siKer brought to the mint. They were joined by debtor farmers of the West and South, BLAND -ALLISON ACT VOTE ON PASSAGE OVER president's veto In this vote on a \"cheap money\" proposal, sectional interests completely overrode party lines, since debtor-agrarian sections favored inflation. who expected that free silver would mean a cheaper dollar and higher prices. The strength of the silver movement was showTi by the Bland-Allison Act of 1878, passed over President Hayes' veto. Starting as a free silver bill in the House, this law was amended in the Senate to require that the treasury buy from $2,000,000 to $4,000,000 worth of silver a month and issue currency against it. Although adding to the money supply, the Bland-Allison Act did not halt deflation. The increase in busi- ness far exceeded that in currency. Agitation for cheap money therefore continued, reaching a peak in events to be described in the next chapter. National Banks As in the time of Andrew Jackson, many western farmers distrusted banks. Needing credit as never before, they could obtain it only at high rates of interest. They were especially critical of the banks created under the National Banking Act of 1863. This law provided ( 1 ) that banking associations putting at least a third of their capital into federal bonds (but not less than $30,000) might issue national bank notes"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"432 The Emergence of Modern America up to 90 per cent of the value of the bonds; (2) that for most purposes national bank notes could be used as currency; and (3) that the national banks must submit to federal in- spection. The national bank notes were a great im- provement on the wild confusion of state bank notes, issued by over tv\\^o thousand institutions, many of them irresponsible and some dis- honest.

The agricultural South and West were poorly sened, ha\\ing only one-third of the national banks and less than one-quarter of the total capitahzation. The farmers' most fimdamental objection to the national banks, however, was a feeling that they made the rich richer. Since the banks drew interest on their federal bonds and could also lend against the bank notes issued with the bonds as security', it seemed as though the gov- ernment guaranteed them a double profit. Farm- ers' organizations therefore demanded that national banks be abolished and that the federal govemrnent pro\\ide them with cheaper credit. ATTEMPTED REGULATION OF TRUSTS AND MONOPOLIES In 1881 the Atlantic Monthly pubHshed an article entitled \"The Story of a Great Monop- oly,\" by Henry D. Lloyd, telling how the Stan- dard Oil Company had monopohzed the oil refining business. It caused such a sensation that the magazine had to print three times as many copies as usual. Throughout the ne.xt decade, as it was re\\\"ealed that industry after industry was in danger of being monopolized, demands for federal regulation came from many different groups— small businessmen, farmers, consiuners, and workingmen. E\\en officials of the great corporations themselves began to have qualms. Henr\\' O. Havemeyer, head of the American Sugar Refining Company, which produced over 90 per cent of the sugar used in American homes, urged that producers of commodities in general use should submit to federal regulation. In the election of 1888, both parties promised action, and in 1890, Congress passed the Sher- man Antitrust Act with only one dissenting vote. The Sherman Act wTOte into federal law an old principle of the English common law: that artificial restraints on trade and private monop- olies are forbidden. Its core is contained in these words: \"Ever\\' contract, combination, in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations, is hereby to be declared illegal.\" Any person who was found guilt}' of achie\\ing a monopoly, or even of attempting to do so, might be punished by fines and imprisonment. A private individual or corporation hurt by the monopolistic activi- ties of a ri\\'al might collect triple damages from the offender. Early Failure of the Sherman Antitrust Act For a number of reasons the Sherman Act was no more effective in pre\\-enting business consolidation than the Interstate Commerce Act in controlling railroad rates. It was not strictly enforced, and was so loosely worded that its meaning was doubtful. Did the act mean, for instance, that all mergers were un- lawful, that all business transactions must be open to the public, that any contract whereby"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"one company planned to take business from an- other was unlawful? Such decisions had to be left to the federal courts, which in the 1890's were probably more favorable to business in- terests than at any other time in American his- tory. Just as the courts whittled down the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission, they took the teeth out of the Sherman Act. In the E. C. Knight Company case of 1895 the Supreme Court ruled that an almost complete monopoly of sugar refining was not a violation of the Sherman Act, because sugar refining was manu- facturing, and manufacturing was not interstate commerce. The Supreme Court's decision that the Sher- man Act applied only to transportation and telegraph companies was followed by one of the greatest periods of consolidation in Amer- ican business history. In 1890 there had been 24 trusts with a total capitalization of $436 million. In 1900 there were 183 great consolida- tions with a capitalization of over three billion dollars. The new concentrations of power were effected through a new type of corporation known as the \"holding company.\" A holding company did not actually engage in production or in direct services to the public, but controlled the securities of many operating companies. This new device enabled men to establish con- trol of business concerns with less outlay of capital. Through owTiership of a majority of the shares of stock, and often much less, they could put their own men into the boards of directors of the operating companies. (See chart, p. 584. ) In spite of initial failure, the Sherman Anti- trust Act, like the Interstate Commerce Act, was a most important piece of legislation. It tended to make businessmen more careful not to offend the public or to antagonize competitors by un- fair practices. The law itself later became more effective under a less conservative Supreme Court, with more vigorous enforcement by the ttAM, aOCtUCII * CO., lNt«««pof«t»tf.

THE GROWTH OF LABOR UNIONS The Civil War encouraged the revival of labor unions, which had dwindled because of the Panic of 1837. Workmen needed higher wages to meet prices raised by the wartime inflation; with hundreds of thousands of men under arms, they were in a strong position to"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"434 The Emergence of Modem America demand them. In 1863 and 1864 the number of local unions rose from 79 to 270. There was also organization on a national scale, since a local union was often helpless in dealing with an industrial corporation doing business throughout the coimtry. Difficulties Facing the Unions In spite of rapid growth during the war and afterward, labor unions faced many difficulties: ( 1 ) American labor tvas mobile and diverse. It was difficult to organize workmen in this country because they would not \"stay hitched,\" but moved from job to job. Young men, who in other countries might have become labor lead- ers, went into business for themselves or worked up into executive positions. The inflow of im- migrants, averaging over a third of a milHon a year between 1870 and 1900, increased the dif- ficulties of organization. Ignorant of American wage scales and with few resources, the new- comers often accepted low pay. A Contract Labor Law, passed by Congress in 1864, al- lowed employers to hire foreign laborers, bring them to America, and have them work for a year to repay passage. Variety in language, re- ligion, and customs among the immigrants made it hard to weld them into an effective organization. To discourage tmionization, em- ployers dehberately mixed nationahties. Thus a steel mill superintendent wrote: We must be careful what class of men we collect. We must steer clear of the West, where men are accustomed to infernal high wages. We must steer clear as far as we can of Englishmen who are great sticklers for high wages, small production and strikes. My experience has shown that Germans and Irish, Swedes and what I denominate \"Buck- wheats'—young American country boys, judiciously mixed, make the most eflFective and tractable force you can find. (2) There was confusion of aims. Men who wanted to bring all workmen together and pro- mote widespread reforms were opposed by others who beUeved that imions should work only for the short-time benefit of workers in their particular craft or industry. A small but vocal group wanted to use the power of organ- ized labor to overthrow the capitabst system and establish sociahsm ( see pp. ddd 44 5 ) . Even more radical were anarchists who preached, \"All property is theft; all government is tyr- anny,\" and tried to create class hatred by bomb-throwing and assassination. Although never comp>osing more than a small fraction of the labor movement, sociahsts and anarchists aroused fear and dishke which were transferred to all worldngmen's organizations. (3) Unions faced strong opposition from employers. Workers were often required to take an iron-clad oath that they would not join a imion. If discharged for imion activity, a man often remained jobless, because employers com- bined to keep black Hsts of all \"troublemakers.\" Once black-listed, a laborer could get a job only by changing his residence, his trade, or his name. Once workers organized a plant, the employer could still fight back by a lockout (shutting the plant down) or by discharging imion men and hiring strikebreakers (ako kno^vn as \"scabs\"). In any strike or lockout the odds favored the employer because he had the longer purse; few imions could afford to sup- port their members through prolonged unem- ployment. (4) Public opinion was distrustful of labor unions. Laborers formed a minority group in America, and unions were an unfamihar type of organization. Fixing wages and hours by col- lective bargaining between union representa- tives and employers seemed to violate the right of the individual to deal with the employer himself. Occasionally pubhc opinion condemned employers when labor disputes resulted in vio- lence.

In city after city, strikers seized and sometimes destroyed rail- road property; in Pittsburgh alone the Penn- sylvania Railroad lost 2,000 cars, 25 locomotives, two roundhouses and a railroad station. Mihtia and workers fought pitched battles. In much of the violence railroad men themselves were less involved than teen-age boys who, unable to find employment, were on the loose. Although in fact the disorders were usually spontaneous, newspaper editors saw in them \"an insurrection, a revolution, an attempt of communists and vagabonds to coerce society, and endeavour to imdermine American institutions.\" In several cities order was restored only after President Hayes had sent federal troops, but Hayes him- self was disturbed. He felt that the railroad workers had much justice on their side, and that the railroad oflBcials had brought on the crisis by their own ruthless actions. The Pres- ident confided in his diary, \"Shall the railroads govern the country or shall the people govern the railroads?\" The railroad strike had complex results. There was such fear of violent revolution that state mihtias were reorganized and great arm- ories were built in cities as fortresses where troops could hold out. Union leaders learned from the strike that violence hurt labor's cause. A way to prevent it was to organize unions with sufficient discipline to discourage mob action. Employers were often more resolved than ever to discourage union organization, but many of them realized that to do this they must treat their workmen better. Indiscriminate wage cutting in times of depression became less common; a few companies began to take active steps to pro- mote their workers' welfare by making provi- sions for old age pensions and free hospital service. The Knights of Labor As business improved, a new national labor organization, the Noble Order of the Knights of Labor, grew in strength. Founded in 1869 as a secret society (partly to evade the black list), the Knights of Labor came into the open in 1878 and endeavored to bring all laboring men— skilled and unskilled, Negroes and whites, men and women, white collar and manual work- ers—into one big union. The only people ex- cluded belonged to occupations regarded as harmful or parasitic, such as saloon keepers, gamblers, lawyers, and bankers. At the head of the Order, with the title Grand Master Work- man, was Terence V. Powderly, an immigrant who rose from railway sv^itch tender to mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania. An eloquent speaker and tireless organizer, Powderly had great hopes for his union. \"We seek and intend,\" he said, \"to enlist the services of men of every society, of every party, and every religion, and every nation in the crusade we have inaugu- rated against those twin monsters, tyranny and monopoly.\" Powderly persuaded the Knights to support a great variety of reforms, such as equal pay for men and women, temperance, the abolition of child labor, and above all, the establishment of cooperatively owned industrial plants. A man of peace, he opposed strikes and \\\\'ished to submit labor disputes to arbitration by impartial third parties. Local assemblies of the Knights were less interested, however, in remaking so- ciety than in securing immediate gains; some- times they started strikes which Powderly had to support to preserve his organization. In 1885 the Knights gained tremendous prestige by winning a strike against the Wabash Railway, then owned by Jay Gould. Membership soared from 100,000 to 700,000 in less than a year. Conservative newspapers feared that Powderly, the 'labor czar,\" would become stronger than the President."},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"Protest Movements 437 Decline of the Knights of Labor The Knights of Labor were soon beset with troubles. Members called strikes before they had suflScient funds or discipline, and Powderly di- rected them badly. Like the Grangers, the Knights wasted their funds in unsuccessful at- tempts to set up cooperative businesses. The eflFort to bring all kinds of labor into one big imion failed. Laborers in different crafts and industries had httle interest in working for common goals. Unskilled laborers were too often undisciplined and too willing to use vio- lence; if a strike failed, or the men were black- hsted, they drifted into other jobs. Skilled workers, however, had more to lose and were more vulnerable to the blacklist. The dechne of the Knights was hastened by the Haymarket Square riot in Chicago on May 4, 1886. This event had its origin in a peaceful meeting of three thousand workers called to protest the shooting of striking workers by the police. Even the mayor of Chicago attended. As the meeting was beginning to disperse, someone threw a dynamite bomb into a com- pany of pohcemen. Although the identity of the bomb-thrower was never estabhshed, eight known anarchist leaders were arrested and found guilty of participation in the crime. Four were executed for murder. The Haymarket riot encouraged opponents of labor organization to pin the \"anarchist\" label on the Knights of Labor, even though the Knights condemned the attack on the poHce as the work of \"cow- ardly murderers.\" From 1886 on the Knights declined as rap- idly as they had grown. By 1893 their numbers had dwindled to 75,000. But their brief success was an immense stimulus to those who hoped to organize workers into an effective counter- force to the power of the corporations, and their failure taught lessons from which other labor organizations, such as the American Federation of Labor, benefited. The American Federation of Labor In 1886, the very year the Knights of Labor began to decline, the American Federation of Labor appeared. In principles and in structure the new organization differed greatly from the Knights. Its members were skilled laborers, organized into separate unions, each covering a particular craft. Each union managed its own affairs and fought QUESTION • // each un- its own battles, ion managed its own af- with only occa- fairs, of what use was the sional help from AFLP Why has it sur- the national or- vived? ganization. Initia- tion fees and dues were relatively high, in order to restrict mem- bership, build up strike fimds, and provide benefits to members and their famiHes in case of sickness, unemployment, or death. The new AFL owed much of its success to Samuel Gompers, its president for thirty- seven years. Bom in London, Gompers brought to America some of the ideas of British trade unions, the best estabhshed and least revolu- tionary in the world. Gompers, who prided him- self on being a practical man, repudiated ambitious reform schemes and was interested only in the day-to-day gains of federation members. He came to feel that sociaUsts and radicals hurt the labor movement by frighten- ing the public. His own personahty did much to allay popular fear of labor unions and their leaders. Dressed in a Prince Albert coat, he looked and behaved much hke a banker. Yet he devoted his life to the federation, and died a poor man. So effective was the organization and lead- ership of the American Federation of Labor that when hard times hit again in 1893, the vmions composing it not only survived but gained members, while other labor organiza- tions declined. Bet\\veen 1890 and 1900, AFL membership rose from 190,000 to 500,000."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"Under the moderate guidance of Samuel Gompers, the American Federation of Labor became strong enough to hold out during the Panic of 1893. At a trade meeting in 1905 (above), Gompers is addressing a large crowd of garment workers, including many women who had by then joined unions. He aimed to organize skilled workersinto horizontal unionsthatcould monopolize certain skills (see diagram, page 638). The American Railway Union and the Pullman Strike of 1894 The AFL failed to provide for unskilled and semi-skilled labor. To correct this and yet avoid the weakness of the \"one big union\" approach of the Knights, a new type of labor organization appeared. This was the indus- trial union, in which all classes of workers in a single industry are welded together. In some ways it resembles a vertical trust. Among those impressed by its advantages was Eugene V. Debs, an officer of the Brotherhood of Loco- motive Firemen, one of several railway unions representing different kinds of jobs. He felt that the division of railwaymen into different unions weakened their power. Conductors and engineers, the \"aristocracy of labor,\" looked down on less skilled and lower paid men, and the unskilled had no organization at all. Debs therefore started a new organization in 1893, the American Railway Union, with headquar- ters in Chicago. It was not an auspicious time to found a new organization because it was a panic year. Nevertheless, the new union grew rapidly; it included all types of railway work- ers—switchmen, firemen, conductors, engineers, telegraph operators, station clerks, brakemen. In 1894 it was powerful enough to force James J. Hill to restore wage cuts to employees of the Great Northern Railway. Hardly had the Great Northern strike ended than the Pullman strike began. This largest walkout the country had ever seen started in the pretty little tov\\Ti that George M. Pullman, the sleeping car manufacturer, had built for his workers. When the Panic of 1893 reduced de- mand for its cars, the Pullman Company laid off two-thirds of its employees and cut the"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"Protest Movements 439 wages of the rest. It did not reduce either its dividends or the rents charged to workers in the town of Pullman. When a delegation pro- tested the pay cuts, its members were fired. Most Pullman workers then struck, and Pull- man locked out the rest. Pullman workers who were members of the American Railway Union called on it for help. Debs proposed that the dispute be referred to arbitration, but Pullman replied, \"There is nothing to arbitrate.\" The American Railway Union thereupon declared a boycott, in which union members refused to work on any train which included a Pullman car. Pullman had an ally, however, in the Railway Managers Asso- ciation, made up of the heads, of all twenty-four railroads running into Chicago. The managers ran Pullman cars, even on trains that did not ordinarily include them. The result was that five days after the boycott began in late June 1894, 100,000 railwaymen had quit work, and railway traflBc west of Chicago was almost paralyzed. Debs warned his followers not to interfere with United States mails, and appealed to them to be \"orderly and law-abiding.\" Although a few mail trains were delayed, usually when combined with Pullman cars, there were few disturbances. Labor and the Injunction The Pullman strike was defeated by the federal government. Over the protests of the mayor of Chicago and governor of Illinois, who claimed they had matters in hand, President Cleveland sent federal troops to guard mail trains. Immediately rioting broke out as angry mobs, sympathetic to the strikers, taimted the soldiers. Members of the American Railway Union kept out of trouble, but nevertheless re- ceived the blame. Even before the troops ap- peared, the federal government also took judicial action. On appHcation of the U.S. Attorney General, a federal judge issued an injunction (court order) forbidding any interference with transportation in interstate commerce and any attempt to persuade railway workers to quit work. The judge held that the strike was a con- spiracy in restraint of trade and therefore a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. On re- fusing to obey. Debs was jailed for contempt of court. Deprived of his leadership, the Pull- man strike collapsed and with it the American Railway Union. From that time on, labor unions demanded that the use of the injimction in labor disputes be abohshed. Even outside labor circles there was strong feeling that putting Debs in jail was an unfair extension of judicial power. The Springfield Republican, one of the most influ- ential newspapers in the country, said, \"If Debs has been violating the law, let him be indicted, tried by a jury, and punished. Let him not be made the victim of an untenable court order and deprived of his Uberty entirely within the discretion of a judge.\" Gains of Labor Although labor unions lost more disputes than they won, and most workers remained en- tirely unorganized, laborers made genuine gains during the latter nineteenth century. Tlie de- flation, which hurt the farmer, helped working- men by lowering the cost of food. Improved technology produced better and cheaper goods. As we have seen, real wages increased, even though the average work day was reduced from 12 hours to 10 hours between 1830 and 1900. Federal and state legislation reflected the growing political influence of labor. To keep imported labor from depressing wages. Con- gress passed the first laws restricting immigra- tion. In 1882 Chinese laborers were excluded, and in 1885 it was forbidden to import workers under contract. Several states gave labor unions a new legal status by granting them the right"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"440 The Emergence of Modem America to incorporate. Nearly all states passed laws regulating working conditions and requiring minimum standards of health and safety. The gains won by legislation and by unions themselves were supplemented by the action of enlightened employers, motivated either by the desire to head oflF unionization or by genuine concern for their workers. The Standard Oil Company and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad pioneered in providing old age pensions, and the latter firm also provided benefits in case of injury. The Pillsbury Flour Company attempted to increase its employees' sense of participation in the business by sharing profits; its example was wddely copied. REFORMERS AND RADICALS Although commonly noted for other phe- nomena, such as industrial progress and agrar- ian discontent, the period after the Civil War, like the Jacksonian period, hatched \"a fertility John Peter Altgeld, Eagle Forgotten He pardoned three anarchists convicted of murder. He charged a President of the United States with the \"invasion of Illinois.\" And to many, he is known only through a poem by Vachel Lindsay. John Peter Altgeld, son of poor German immigrants and one-time railroad laborer, was elected reform governor of Illinois in 1892. A Democrat, one of the truly progressive leaders in the politics of the 1890's, he seldom agreed with Democratic President Grover Cleveland. His single term in office severely tested his convictions. In 1893 petitions for release of three notorious prisoners were submitted to him. Eight admitted anarchists had been convicted of murder following the Hay- market riot. Four had been hanged and one had committed suicide; only these three were still alive. In the language of Altgeld's pardon, no proof of their guilt had ever been established, so he set them free. His state and the nation heartily disagreed with him. In 1894, when the Pullman strike crisis gripped Chicago, President Cleveland sent federal troops into the city to guard the mail trains, thus effectively breaking the strike. Governor Altgeld sent a bitter message to Washington, denouncing the /'invasion\" without a prior request for troops from the state government. His position was legally correct, but the voters of Illinois did not support it. Despite his many reforms, among them the eight-hour day for women and the use of the secret ballot, they elected another man in 1897. But Altgeld remains a symbol of the courageous politicians who have advanced reform — slowly and haltingly — against heavy odds, as honored in Vachel Lindsay's lines: \"Sleep softly . . . eagle forgotten . . . under the stone. Time has its way with you there and the clay has its own. Sleep on, O brave-hearted, O wise man that kindled the flame — To live in mankind is far more than to live in a name.

Here, in a New York City office of the telephone company, many women were able to find employment and thus earn their own living. of projects for the salvation of the world.\" In- deed, several reform movements of the earlier period continued their agitation. The temper- ance movement, for instance, was never more active. Supporters of prohibition formed a political party, and from 1872 on they ran a presidential candidate. Much more effective in promoting temperance, however, were two na- tional organizations that waged a ceaseless cam- paign against the evils of liquor and the saloon: the Anti-Saloon League and the Women's Chris- tian Temperance Union. Women's Rights The WCTU revealed again what the U.S. Sanitary Commission had shown during the Civil War: that women were learning the tech- niques of large-scale organization. The indus- trial cities offered women new job opportunities. The invention of the typewriter and telephone, for instance, created a need for thousands of stenographers and switchboard operators. Added to the independence gained from earn- ing their own Hving was the fact that girls had the same pubhc school education as boys. Women gained more chance for higher edu- cation \\vith the opening of women's colleges, such as Vassar, Smith, Wellesley, and Bryn Mawr, and the advance of coeducation in state institutions. It was no wonder that women continued to demand the right to vote, and received support from the other sex. Wendell PhiUips, a former abohtionist, argued their case as follows: One of two things is true: either a woman is like a man— and if she is, then a ballot based on brains belongs to her as well as to him; or she is different, and then man does not know how to vote for her as well as she herseff does.

Grappling with New Problems: Jacob A. Riis and Jane Addams The most all-pervasive and difficult prob- lems to be faced were not those inherited from earlier periods, but those connected with in- dustrialism and urbanization. The suggested solutions were as various as the problems. Some people looked back to an earlier morality for answers. Thus some pious folk sought to enforce the Puritan Sabbath as a means of regenerating the city. As a result restaurants and amusement places were closed, and there were even efforts to forbid the running of trains and streetcars. The railway strike of 1877 and the Haymarket riot of 1886 greatly alarmed those who feared immigrants carrying dangerous foreign \"isms.\" A few politicians, notably Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, professed to see a menace to America in the \"new immigration\" from southern and eastern Europe and advo- cated legislation that would discriminate against \"alien races.\" A short-lived national organiza- tion, the American Protective Association, which had much the same philosophy as the Know Nothings of the 1850's, also sought to restrict immigration, and to bar Catholics from office as well. Such negative and defensive reactions did not grapple with the realities of life in factories, shops, and slums. One of those who did face these realities was Jacob A. Riis, a Danish- American police reporter for New York news- papers. In the course of his work, Riis had seen again and again the connection between slums and human degradation. In 1890 he focused public attention on the slum evil in a best- selling book, How the Other Half Lives. By appealing to public conscience, Riis secured legislation that reduced the worst slum con- ditions, along with other measures that im- proved the lives of city dwellers, such as playgrounds for schools. Among his close friends was a rising young Republican politi- cian, Theodore Roosevelt, whom he \"educated\" by taking him into tenements, sweatshops, and jails. In the year before Hoic the Other Half Lives was published, Jane Addams founded Hull House, the most famous American settle- ment house, in a Chicago slum. Inspired by a passionate desire to put her Christian faith to work, and modeling her endeavor on TovTibee Hall, a settlement house in England, Jane Addams was determined to improve the life of the \"other half.\" Hull House soon carried on activities as various as cooking classes, an art gallery, a gymnasium, hot lunches for factory workers, and classes in English. Above all, it was interested in children, on the principle that \"a fence at the top of a precipice is better than an ambulance at the bottom.\" Miss Addams soon surrounded herself with young people who were glad to enlist in a war against human suffering. (See biographical sketch, p. 539-) Religious couNiction and desire to serve humanity were also the motivating forces be- hind the foundation of other settlement houses, such as the Henry Street Settlement in New York City, the Santa Maria Institute in Cincin- nati, and South End House in Boston. In addi- tion to their immediate ser%'ices to the people in their neighborhoods, the settlement houses were schools where hundreds of men and women learned the conditions of life among the poor and then went into politics to promote reform legislation, either as lobbyists or as officeholders. \"Graduates\" of Hull House, for instance, were instrumental in securing the first playgrounds and public baths in Chicago, better garbage collection, and the first Illinois factor\\' inspec- tion law.

Beautifying the City Among the indictments against the sprawl- ing industrial cities were their ugliness and their lack of provision for rest and recreation. Arch- itects and landscape designers were among those who sought remedies. In 1876 New York City opened Central Park, designed by Freder- ick L. Olmstead as \"a great breathing space for the toiling masses.\" Many other cities followed New York's example. In 1893 Chicago cele- brated (a year late) the four hundredth anni- versary of the discovery of America by putting on a great exposition. The country was aston- ished as \"a rough, tangled stretch of bog and dune\" along Lake Michigan was changed to a gleaming \"White City,\" with buildings in classical style surrounded by lagoons and greenswards.

The firm of McKim, Mead, and White used Italian Renais- sance style in designing the Boston Public Li- brary. Henry Richardson adapted Romanesque style for churches, hbraries, warehouses, and department stores. The Transportation Building at the Chicago Exposition, designed by Louis Sullivan, did not imitate earlier st>'les. SuUivan preached a new concept: \"Form follows func- tion.\" He meant that the architect should rid himself of tradition and create buildings whose design should reveal their purposes and meth- ods of construction. SuUivan's influence, both direct and later through the work of his famous pupil Frank Lloyd Wright, was world-wide. The finest example of a structure whose form expressed its function was the Brooklyn Bridge, completed in 1883, some sixteen years after it was begun. Hung from great steel cables \\\\'ith a span half again as great as that of any previous bridge, it was designed and constructed by two German-Americans, John A. RoebHng and his son Washington Augustus Roebling. The Roeb- lings, one of whom was killed on the job and the other crippled, succeeded in their intention of making their bridge \"a great work of art,\" and \"a great example of advanced . . . engineering\" which should \"forever testify to the energy, enterprise, and wealth\" of New York City. Socialism: Karl Marx and Edward Bellamy Wherever industrialism appeared, it drove some people toward extreme solutions of the problems it created— especially toward social- ism. Something seemed wTong with a system which produced both idle rich living in palaces and unemployed paupers living in slums. Some were impelled toward socialism by imjust treat- ment: Eugene V. Debs, for instance, became a lifelong convert after his imprisonment in a Woodstock, 111., jail during the Pullman strike. There are many types of socialism, but those with the most impact on the modem world stem from the writings of Karl Marx, especially The Communist Manifesto (1847), and Capital (1867-1895). Marx, who WTOte with force and buttressed his opinions with great learning, pre- dicted that capitalism was doomed.

History, said Marx, had seen continuous class struggles, but that between industrial workers and capitalists would be the last. When the workers won, they would establish a classless society which would continue happily ever after. Marx called on proletarians everj'where to join his crusade: \"Workingmen of all countries, unite!\" Marxian socialism enlisted milhons of work- ers in the industrial countries of Europe. In America, however, it gained only a small follow- ing, mostly among immigrant groups in big cities. Although these people talked about \"the revolution\" as though it were just around the comer, and pubhshed violent little newspapers with titles like The Volcano, they were not much of a threat to American society. Marxian social- ism appeals less to the poor themselves than to intellectuals who are alienated for some reason or another from the society in which they live and who are looking for a new creed and cause. In any case, Marxism needs for its nurture widespread economic distress, which has ap-"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Protest Movements 445 peared in this country only briefly during pe- riods of severe depression. More widely read than any of Marx's works was a sociahst novel by Edward Bellamy called Looking Backward, 2000-1887. This told the story of a nineteenth century American who awoke from a prolonged hypnotic trance to find himself alive in a sociahst paradise in the year 2000. By that time all business had been merged into one big trust run by the people themselves. There was work and leisure for all— no poverty, no crime. Bellamy's vision of a sociahst Utopia made such an impact that his book sold nearly half a million copies, and numerous Nationalist Clubs were founded to advance his ideas. Bel- lamy had no real program for promoting his ideas, however, and his following drifted into other reform movements. Henry George and the Single Tax A third writer with a formula for remaking society was Henry George, whose major work, Progress and Poverty, was published in 1879. George attacked the central problem posed by the socialists: Why should the advance of the industrial revolution, with more and more ma- chinery for producing wealth, apparently result in more poverty? George found the answer in the tendency of men to monopolize land and hold it out of use while waiting for a rise in value. Since all wealth comes ultimately from the soil or from imder it, the degree to which land is not used is also the degree to which society is poorer than it should be. Also, since land is a 'limited commodity\"— there being just so much of it— monopolistic landlords can charge excessive rents and thereby drive down wages and business profits. A behever in private property, George did not propose socialism as a remedy. Instead, he urged what he called the \"single tax\" on land values. The rate of the single tax would be based not on existing value but on potential value if the land were used eflBciently. Thus there would be no profit in keeping land out of use and waiting for a rise; an owner would either have to develop it himself or sell it to someone else who would do so. George argued that this would cause prosperity by promoting maximum productivity and by plowing the profits of the land monopoly back into society. His ideas had great appeal at a time when the American people were beginning to realize that the frontier was closing and when they were dismayed by the growth of monopoly. Progress and Poverty for a time outsold all other books, including works of fiction. Henry George ran for mayor of New York City in 1886 and came close to wdnning, even without back- ing from the Republican or Democratic ma- chines. Single-tax clubs and magazines also spread his ideas. Although the single tax idea was too radical a change to get complete ac- ceptance, it influenced methods of taxation both in this country and abroad. Probably the basic reason why no radical formula for altering society gained wide support was that Americans were on the whole too prosperous to want change. Even those at the bottom often felt they were better off than formerly. A New England farm boy might prefer drawing wages of a dollar a day for a 60-hour week in a factory to working from dawn to dark trying to scrabble a living from a rocky farm. A Pohsh immigrant might be living with his family in a single room and working in a windowless sweatshop, but for the first time in his life he was wearing shoes; he had also escaped a six- year term of conscription in the Russian army. Furthermore, the United States was so large and had so many different interests that no one idea had universal appeal. Americans wanting to promote their interests worked habitually through political parties. These tried to appeal, by a process of bargaining and compromise, to as many groups as possible."},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"Activities: Chapter 17 For Mastery and Review 1.

HENRY ADAMS The generation following the Civil War saw American politics at their lowest ebb. The ablest men were no longer attracted to public service. It has been pointed out that if you draw up one list of Americans prominent before the war and another of those prominent after it, \"You will find that your first list is made up of men en- gaged in politics, your second of men engaged in business.\" Politics became, indeed, a business in which the first requirement was to get into office and stay there, and the principal purpose was too often private gain. POLITICAL CORRUPTION At every level of government— local, state, and national— corruption flourished. Many new obligations, such as pohce protection, water supply, and sewage disposal, were suddenly thrust on ill-paid city officials. At the same time businessmen were eager to get contracts for such services as paving streets, erecting public buildings, and constructing streetcar lines. The result was a corrupt alliance of business and politics.

Occasionally the looting of city treasuries became so flagrant that angry citizens became sufficiently aroused to \"throw the rascals out,\" and put in a reform administration. But the reformers usually did not stay long in office. They were amateurs up against professionals. Furthermore, the early municipal reformers were usually interested only in economy and honest administration. They did not grasp, as did the professional politicians, that in a large city there were thousands of people who needed help. The machines made it part of their business to take care of the poor and unfortunate. The loyalty and gratitude they 447"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"448 The Emergence of Modem America received in return was a large source of their strength. The Tweed Ring A most notorious example of municipal corruption was the Tweed Ring, which gained control of Tammany Hall, the Democratic ma- chine in New York City, in 1868 and managed in three years to steal an amount estimated to have been anywhere from $45,000,000 to $200,000,000. Typical of the methods of \"Boss\" William M. Tweed and his associates was the building of a county courthouse that should have cost $250,000 and actually cost $8,000,000. Contractors were compelled to add large sums to their bills and give the extra money to the ring. Businessmen who dared to protest were silenced by threat of higher taxes. The Tweed Ring was attacked by The New York Times and by Thomas Nast of Harper's Weekly. The Times, resisting threats and bribes, pubhshed overwhelming evidence of the ring's dishonesty, and Nast, a great cartoonist, held it up to ridicule. So effective was Nast's attack that Tweed remarked: \"I don't care a straw for your newspaper articles: my people don't know how to read, but they can't help seeing them . . . pictures.\" Aroused citizens, led by Samuel J. Tilden, finally dro\\'e the ring from power. Fleeing to Spain, Tweed was brought back and imprisoned. But Tammany Hall remained in power in New York, and graft continued, although prob- ably never again on quite such a scale as under Tweed. The \"best people\" held aloof from city hall because pohtics was \"a dirty game.\" Meanwhile, whatever their motives, the mem- bers of the machine were in direct touch with the people. From dawn to far into the night, local leaders were at the service of the people in their neighborhoods: By these means the Tammany district leader reaches out into the homes of his district, keeps watch not only on the men, but also on the women and children; knows their needs, their likes and dis- likes, their troubles and their hopes, and places himself in a position to use his knowledge for the benefit of his organization and himself. Is it any wonder that scandals do not permanendy disable Tammany and that it speedily recovers from what seems to be crushing defeat? Dishonesty on State and Federal Levels At the state level, poHtics were nearly as corrupt as in the cities. When Jay Gould con- trolled the Erie Railroad, he was reported to have spent $500,000 in bribes during a single session of the New York state legislature. Of the relations between the Standard Oil Company and the government of Pennsylvania an observer wTOte, \"The Standard has done everything with the Pennsylvania legislature except to refine it.\" National pohtics was less corrupt, on the whole, than local,, partly because pubHc atten- tion was focused on Washington. Nevertheless dishonesty was widespread. In 1872 it was re- vealed that officers of the Union Pacific Rail- road, built with federal aid, had formed their own construction company, the Credit Mobiher, and so overcharged the railroad that Credit Mobiher dividends ran as high as 350 per cent. To forestall investigation, the company distrib- uted shares of stock \"where it would do the most good\" among congressmen. Several prominent men in Congress were involved in this scandal. By far the worst misconduct occurred dur- ing President Grant's administration. Although Grant was personally honest, he seemed un- able to distinguish honest men from crooks. Dazzled by wealth, he pubficly associated with such men as James J. Fisk and Jay Gould, who reaped millions of dollars from their contacts with the President and his subordinates. People close to Grant— members of his family, his per- sonal staff, and his cabinet— peddled influence and jobs in return for cash.

Grant's brother at one time held four jobs at once, fanning out the duties to other men. When the graft in his administration was finally brought to hght, Grant wrote that he wanted to 'let no guilty man escape,\" but he later protected those accused of wrongdoing from both investigation and punishment. There was some improvement in pohtical honesty after the Grant administration, but the spoils system was a constant source of ineflB- ciency, and sometimes of graft. Disputes over patronage poisoned the relationship between the President and Congress and consumed an apn palling amount of time. Only the assassination of President Garfield by a disappointed oflBce seeker finally shocked Congress into taking steps to diminish the evil. THE MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES In The American Commonwealth, James Bryce had difiBculty explaining to Enghsh read- ers the characteristics of the major American parties. He could get no consistent answer as to how Democrats and Republicans stood on major issues such as the tariff and railroad regulation. \"Neither party has, as a party, any- thing to say on these issues; neither party has any clean-cut principles. . . . All has been lost, except oflBce or the hope of it.\" The hard core of each party was a group of professional poUti- cians whose business was winning elections. Their usual tendency was either to avoid issues entirely or to try to appear all things to all men. The humorist \"Mr. Dooley\" described the ideal presidential candidate as follows: Wanted: a good, active Dimmycrat, sthrong iv lung an' limb; must be ... a sympathizer with th'"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"450 The Emergence of Modem America crushed an' down throdden people but not be anny means hostile to vested inthrests; must advocate sthrikes, gover'mint be injunction, free silver, sound money, greenbacks, a single tax, a tariff fr rivinoo ... at home in Wall sthreet an' th' stock yards, in th' parlors iv th' r-rich an' th' kitchens iv th' poor. The Republican Party The Republican party had come into power in 1861 with the support of eastern businessmen and western farmers. Each group had its own demands, but they were united in opposition to the spread of slavery. Not only was slavery abolished as a result of the Civil War, but legislation passed during the war fulfilled east- em demands for a high tariflF and stronger banks, as well as western demands for free land and federal aid to railroads. Thus the Republi- cans enjoyed the support of several groups owing it gratitude: freedmen, manufacturers, oflBcers and stockholders of national banks, homesteaders, owners of western railroads. In addition, the Republicans could count on the support of the powerful organization of Union veterans called the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR for short). The Republicans had a patron saint in Abra- ham Lincoln, whose birthday they honored by banquets and oratory. Above all, they had im- mense prestige as the party that won the Givil War. \"The party that saved the nation must rule it,\" they proclaimed. This explains why Republi- cans kept ahve war hatreds by \"waxong the bloody shirt.\" It would not be fair, however, to dismiss the Republican party as nothing but a bundle of interest groups attempting to wdn elections by enmities better forgotten. Its strength came from genuine devotion to the idea of the United States as a nation rather than as a federation of states. A number of its mem- bers were inspired by the idealism that charac- terized the party in its early years; in 1872 and again in 1884, this reform element \"bolted\" to the Democrats in protest against pobtical corruption. The great problem of the Republican party was to keep together its eastern wing, dominated by bankers and industrialists, and its \"grass roots\" western wing, dominated by farmers. The two groups were likely to break into open warfare over such issues as greenbacks, free silver, tariffs, and banking. Usually, however, they managed to maintain an uneasy alliance for the purpose of winning elections. In general, the Middle West provided the presidential candidates, while the East provided the party funds. The Democratic Party The Democrats were so used to being out of oflBce, according to \"Mr. Dooley,\" that when writing their platform they forgot how to say \"we commend,\" but automatically began to \"denounce and deplore.\" The party strength centered in an alliance, formed in Jefferson's day, between Southerners and northern city machines, such as Tammany Hall. Both groups could \"dehver the vote.\" From the end of Radi- cal reconstruction until well into the twentieth century, the Solid South never wavered in its allegiance to the Democrats; New York City was almost as consistent. The Democrats had allies among western farmers, especially when prices were low, and among certain classes of business- men, such as international bankers and im- porters who favored a lower tariff. They also attracted men doing municipal business, such as contractors and owners of street railways. The Democratic party had two patron saints —Jefferson and Jackson. The Democrats claimed to be more concerned with the common man than their opponents, and tended to enlist more support from recent immigrants. However, the party labored under the handicap that wiped out the Federalists after the War of 1812: the charge of disloyalty. Although during the Civil"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"Parties and Politics 451 War most northern Democrats had supported the Union, the party had included a few \"Cop- perheads.\" It naturally became Democratic strategy to urge that war hatreds be forgotten. The Democratic party was perhaps more diflBcult to hold together than the Republican. The northern and southern wings were united in little save opposition to the Republicans. There was little in common between eastern city machines and southern farmers. At the time of the Hayes-Tilden election, conservative south- em Democrats abandoned their candidate and arranged with Republican leaders the Com- promise of 1877 (see pp. 373-374). Pressure Groups and Lobbies Although the Republican party held the upper hand, the Democrats were seldom far out of the running. In four of the eight presi- dential elections between 1868 and 1896, the difference in popular vote was less than 1 per cent of the total ballot. Hard times tend to hurt the party in power, and when there was a de- pression, Republican strength dropped. The Panic of 1873 helped to produce a \"tidal wave\" in the mid-term election of 1874, in which the Democrats wiped out a two-thirds Republican majority. With the major parties so evenly divided, small changes in voting strength might decide elections. This opened the way for well-organ- ized pressure groups. Lobbyists exerted such pressure that they were called \"the third House of Congress.\" The great corporations regularly contributed to campaign funds, often to those of both parties, regarding such payments as \"insurance\" against unfavorable legislation. But business groups were not always supreme. Pressure from southern and western inflationists pushed the Bland-Alhson Act through Congress in spite of opposition from bankers and bond- holders (see p. 431). Similarly the strength of organized labor was seen in immigration restriction acts, passed over the opposition of shipping companies and employers. On the whole, the different interests within each party were so evenly balanced that they canceled each other out. FLUCTUATING PARTY FORTUNES, 1877-1893 After the Reconstruction period came to an end, as a recent historian remarks, the federal government was \"the epitome of lethargy. It was astonishingly idle.\" While the country was agitated over such matters as railroad abuses, labor conflicts, and the growth of monopoly, the two major parties spent their time fighting sham battles over petty and often irrelevant issues. There were several reasons for this divorce between politics and reality. One was the re- markably even division of party strength; seldom was one party in control of the presidency and both houses of Congress. The power of the presidency itself was at a low ebb, so there was little opportunity for strong executive leader- ship. In Congress itself leadership was frag- mented among committee chairmen. But per- haps the most important reason for inaction was the prevailing laissez faire philosophy. The federal government did not act because it was supposed to leave things alone. The administration of President Rutherford B. Hayes ( 1877-1881 ) saw a slight but definite rise in both the tone of politics and the power of the presidency. Hayes put Carl Schurz, a noted reformer, in charge of the Department of the Interior, which heretofore had been the happy hunting ground of the spoilsmen. He also forbade the practice of \"shaking down\" officeholders for campaign contributions. Hayes defied congressional leaders in making major appointments and in refusing to allow Congress to use \"riders\" (irrelevant amendments) as a means of coercing him into accepting legislation"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"452 The Emergence of Modern America he disapproved of. He vetoed seven appropria- tion bills with riders attached, and finally won a clearcut victory. The Election of 1880 Hayes had won the resentment of a group of Repubhcan machine politicians, calling them- selves \"Stalwarts,\" who were strongly opposed to reforming the civil service. At the Repubh- can National Convention of 1880 an attempt by the Stalwarts to nominate Grant for a third term failed, partly because of the long-standing two-term tradition. After a prolonged deadlock, the nomination went to a \"dark horse,\" James A. Garfield, a former Union brigadier general. To blunt the old charge of disloyalty in wartime, the Democrats nominated General Winfield S. Hancock, a hero of the battle of Gettysburg. The intellectual level of the ensuing campaign may be judged by the following excerpt from the speech of a Repubhcan orator: I belong to a party that believes in good crops; that is glad when a fellow finds a gold mine; that rejoices when there are forty bushels of wheat to the acre. . . . The Democratic Party is a party of fam- ine; it is a good friend of an early frost; it believes in the Colorado beetle and in the weevil. Garfield won the election with 214 electoral votes to Hancock's 155, but in the popular vote the margin between the candidates was only 9,564 out of over 9,000,000 votes cast. Civil Service Reform After a few months in the White House Garfield was shot by a half-crazy ofiice seeker. This tragic event so excited public opinion against the spoils system that in 1883 Congress passed the Pendleton Act, which has been called (with some exaggeration) \"the Magna Carta of civil service reform.\" This law allowed the President to place on a \"classified hst\" federal oflSces that could then be filled only according to rules laid down by a bipartisan Civil Service Commission. Jobholders on the classified hst were to be chosen on the basis of examinations and were not to be asked to make contributions to party funds. They could no longer be re- moved for pohtical reasons. Although Presi- dent Chester Arthur, who succeeded Garfield, was a veteran of machine politics, he supported the Pendleton Act and placed 16,000 oflBce- holders (one-seventh of the total number) on the classified list. He thus initiated a shift from the spoils system to the so-called \"merit system.\" 1884: Honesty as a Political Issue The major theme of the presidential election of 1884 was honesty in pohtics. The Repubhcan nominee, James G. Blaine, was a man of great ability and personal charm, but he had never cleared himself of charges that he made money by seUing his influence in Congress on behalf of certain railroads. Blaine's nomination was such a defeat for some reformers in the Repubh- can party that they refused to support him. These \"Mugwumps\" included some of the most respected and influential men in the country, such as Charles W. Eliot, president of Harvard, and George W. Curtis, editor of Harper's Weekly. The Democrats won Mugwump sup- port by nominating Grover Cleveland, who as mayor of Buffalo and governor of New York had made a reputation for stubborn integrity. The campaign of 1884 developed into one of abuse. Blaine was portrayed as a \"tattooed <man,\" with railroad stocks and bonds indelibly engraved on his skin. Cleveland was attacked because of an indiscretion in his youth. At the close of this unpleasant campaign Cleveland won the election by an extremely narrow mar- gin. He was the first Democratic President since Buchanan. In the congressional elections the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives, but the RepubHcans retained control of the Senate."},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"Cleveland in Office Grover Cleveland was a man with little imagination and rather narrow horizons. Un- skillful in political maneuvering, he often met defeat in his relations with Congress. Neverthe- less, he did much to restore the prestige of the office of President. \"The presidency,\" he said, \"is the people's office.\" By this he meant that the chief executi\\'e alone is chosen by the whole country and can use his influence for the general good rather than for any special interest. Cleveland's first problem was to deal with Democratic office seekers who swarmed to Washington seeking the fruits of victory after a quarter of a century in the wilderness. If he made appointments on merit alone, he would split his party wide open. If he gave in to the spoilsmen, he would lose the support of the Mugwumps and other independents who played a decisive part in making him President. Cleve- land met this situation by compromise. While appointing so many \"deserving Democrats\" to office that two-thirds of 120,000 federal offices changed hands, Cleveland made every effort to see that the new appointees were qualified for their jobs. Once he wrote a Democrat who recommended an incompetent person for a federal judgeship that \"such treason to the peo- ple and to the party ought to be punished by imprisonment.\" Such a letter did not endear Cleveland to machine politicians, but it won him public esteem. Cleveland entered office ignorant of most national questions, but no President ever put in more study to determine what course to fol- low. His predecessors, for instance, had signed hundreds of private bills giving pensions to veterans unable to quaUfy under regular laws. E.xamining such bills with care, Cleveland found many of them fraudulent. One veteran asked a pension for an injury suffered while intending to enhst; the widow of another claimed that her husband died of apoplexy in 1882 as the result Grover Cleveland worked hard to restore dignity to the presidential office. Although he used the spoils system, he tried to give offices only to the capable. of a knee injury in 1863. Cleveland disapproved so many private pension bills that his vetoes totaled more than those of all previous Presi- dents. Seriously interested in saving the pubUc lands for future generations, he compelled cattlemen and lumber companies to return land illegally taken. He also forced land grant rail- roads to open milHons of acres to settlement or to retiuTi them to the federal government. Cleveland and the Tariff The public question that Cleveland studied most seriously was the tariff. During the Civil War, duties had been raised from an average of 19 per cent in 1861 to over 40 per cent in 1865. These high rates were constantly attacked by those who considered themselves hurt by them— farmers, consumers, shippers, and im- porters. They were joined by \"free traders\" who argued that a protective tariff was unwarrant- able government interference with normal laws of supply and demand, and was a subsidy paid"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"454 The Emergence of Modern America to the manufacturer out of the pocket of the consumer. Protection was defended, on the other hand, as a means of developing infant industries and protecting high wage standards of American laborers from competition with cheap foreign labor. Whenever proposals to lower the tariff appeared before Congress, they were thwarted by manufacturers' lobbies. Shortly after taking office, Carl Schurz asked Cleveland about his ideas on the tariff ques- tion. \"You know I really don't know anything about it,\" replied the President. \"In my political career as sheriff of Buffalo County, mayor of BuflFalo, and governor of New York it has, of course, not been an issue.\" Asking Schurz to recommend books, Cleveland investigated the problem. He became convinced that the exist- ing tariff system was wrong, and devoted his entire 1887 congressional message to the topic. The situation prompting action was a mounting surplus in the U.S. Treasury. It was thought inadvisable to use the extra revenues to pay off the national debt, because United States bonds were the basis for national bank notes. Offhand, one might think surplus govern- ment revenue, like business profits, a healthy sign. But, as Cleveland pointed out, the govern- ment is not in business to make money; a surplus is a sign of over-taxation. If kept in the treasury, the surplus deflated the currency by reducing the amount of money in circulation; if spent, it was an invitation to extravagance. The only cure, said the President, was to revise \"our present tariff laws, the vicious, inequitable, and illogical source of unnecessary taxation.\" Not a free trader, Cleveland did not propose to abandon protection, but simply to remove duties on goods not produced in this country and to reduce unnecessarily high rates. The President's dramatic effort to lower the tariff utterly failed. A bill embodying his recommendations passed the House, controlled by the Democrats, but the Republican Senate ignored it. Cleveland had presented his opponents with an issue for the presidential election of 1888. Openly avowing protection for the first time, the Republicans collected a record-breaking campaign fund. \"Put all the manufacturers of Pennsylvania under the fire,\" said a Republican campaign manager, \"and fry that fat out of them.\" The Republicans revived Henry Clay's name for the pro- QUESTION . How did tective tariff as Harrison win the election the \"American of 1888 with a minority of system.\" Renomi- the popular vote? nating the Presi- dent, the Demo- crats campaigned against unnecessary taxation. As in 1880 and 1884, the result was extremely close. Although winning fewer popular votes than Cleveland, the Republican candidate Ben- jamin Harrison, who was the grandson of the hero of Tippecanoe, gained a majority in the electoral college. The \"Billion Dollar Congress,\" 1889-1891 Once in office the Republicans removed the treasury surplus by spending it. In two years the so-called \"Billion-Dollar Congress\" created a deficit, mostly by handouts to special interest groups. The McKinley Tariff of 1890 dried up revenue at its source by levying prohibitive rates— so high that they kept some foreign products out of the country entirely. Admitting foreign sugar duty free, the McKinley Act gave a bounty of 2 cents a pound to domestic pro- ducers. Western support for the tariff measure was won by the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, whereby the federal government undertook to buy four and a half million ounces of silver a month— practically the entire output of the United States. Additional millions were spent on the im- provement of harbors and waterways, coastal defenses, federal buildings, and sorely needed steel ships for the navy. In addition to these"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"measures, Congress passed the Sherman Anti- trust Act (p. 432) and provided for admission to the Union of North and South Dakota, Mon- tana, Washington, Idaho, and \\\\'yoming. Democratic Landslides The tariff issue that helped the Repubhcans to v\\dn the election of 1888 proved a boomerang tv,'0 years later. A sharp rise in cost of hving accompanying the McKinley Tariff caused indignation which the Democrats exploited. The congressional elections of 1890 proved a landslide, the Democrats winning 235 seats in the House of Representatives to 88 for the Republicans. Resentment against the tariff continued in 1892. The Republican claim that high rates pro- tected American wage scales seemed to be refuted by the Homestead lockout ( see p. 434 ) . Steel was a highly protected industry and its profits were enormous; yet the labor dispute at the Homestead plant began when the Carnegie Steel Company announced a pay cut. Cleveland and Harrison were again the nominees of their parties, but the decision of 1888 was reversed. Cleveland was elected for a second term by the largest majority since Grant's victory over Gree- ley in 1872. The Democrats also won control of both houses of Congress. THE POPULiST PARTY The election of 1892 was notable because it saw the appearance of the first third party to win electoral votes since 1860. The new organi- zation, the People's or Populist party, was principally an expression of the grievances of the farmer. Ever since the Civil War federal policies had favored industry over agricultiu-e, the city over the country. In spite of clamor for a cheaper dollar, the United States remained on the gold standard, to the advantage of creditors. This cartoon of the 1890's ridiculed the way manu- facturing interests brazenly demanded protective tar- iffs from congressmen, shown prostrating themselves before the captains of industry. and farm prices went steadily down, to the ad- vantage of urban consumers. The protective tar- iff raised the price of the goods farmers bought, to the advantage of manufacturers, but Ameri- can agricultural staples were sold abroad in an unprotected market. Legislation that apparently favored the agrarian interests proved ineffec- tive. State and federal regulation of railroads had been hamstrung by adverse judicial deci- sions. The Homestead Act offered free farms to settlers, but the greater part of the public lands actually went to railroads and speculators. When drought hit the Great Plains region in the late 1880's, the farmers were in a rebellious mood and were ready to fight against the dis- crimination of which they had been victims. \"Those who could submit quietly to such out- rage,\" said a western editor, \"must be either more or less than men.\" According to historian Ray Ginger, \"t\\vo nations\" were coming into"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"456 The Emergence of Modern America being. One of them lay east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio, with outposts in urban areas elsewhere. Here was prosperity and growth, not only in the cities, but among the surrounding farmers who produced diversified crops for urban consumption. The other \"na- tion\" centered on the areas that produced cotton, wheat, and silver. There economic distress was widespread, and after the depres- sion of 1893 feeling became so bitter that many thoughtful citizens feared a revolution. The Populist party originated with two great farmers' organizations, formed after the decline of the Grange: the Southern AlUance, which covered the cotton and tobacco belt, and the Northwestern Alliance, especially strong in the Plains region. Although the two alliances failed to merge, they made similar demands— free silver, more paper money, cheaper credit, gov- ernment ownership of railroads, and the restora- tion of railroad bounty lands to the federal government. In the elections of 1890 the Ignatius Donnelly, Populist It was the Fourth of July, 1892, In Omaha, Nebraska. \"Cheers and yells rose . . . like a tornado from four thousand throats and raged without cessation for thirty- four minutes, during which women shrieked and wept, men embraced and kissed their neighbors . . . and leaped upon tables and chairs in the ecstasy of their delirium. . . .\" Ignatius Donnelly, the author of the Populist party platform which had aroused this response, was a short, \"plump, genial Irishman who sounded like a prophet out of the Old Testament.\" He was at the peak of his career. He liked to strike a Napoleonic pose — right hand thrust into his vest — but his dancing brown eyes destroyed the similarity to the stern French emperor. Born and educated in Philadelphia, Donnelly, at twenty- ve, had cone west in 1856. He made a paper fortune in land speculation n Minnesota and lost if in a year. After he left the Democratic party because hf hated slavery, he promptly joined the Republicans. They sent him to Congress for three terms. No reformer then, he sponsored grants to railroads in which he held stock \"presented to me without solicitation on my part by the Company. . . .\" Donnelly lost his seat in Congress in 1869, and turned to writing and lecturing as a career, although he never ceased to run for political office, usually without success. He edited a newspaper, the Anti-Monopolist, that aired the farmers' grievances and wrote books on subjects as various as the lost continent of Atlantis and the authorship of Shakespeare's plays. He successively joined the Greenback and Populist parties. At the Omaha convention, out of his political experience, literary talent, and sense of outrage, he produced the Populist platform almost single-handedly. He was badly defeated as Populist candidate for governor of Minnesota in 1892, but later sat in the state legislature. A biographer wrote of him, \"He never attacked a small problem if a larger one was at hand; he was happiest when attempting something his contemporaries were sure couldn't be done.\" (Theme 8, see p. xll)"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"Parties and Politics 457 Southern Alliance, working through the Demo- cratic party, gained control of five state legis- latures. In the Plains region the Northwestern AUiance organized local parties that elected six congressmen from Kansas and Nebraska. These successes encouraged the formation of a new national party. Aiter conferences at Cincinnati in 1S91 and St. Louis in February 1S92, the Peo- ple's (or Populist) Party held a national conven- tion at Omaha in July 1892. Although mostly from fami organizations, delegates also repre- sented the Knights of Labor and followers of Henry George and Edward Bellamy (see p. 445). Following the custom of the time, the conven- tion nominated for President a Ci\\il War vet- eran. General James B. Wea\\er. But there was veteran. General James B. Weaver. There was nothing customary, however, about the plat- form. Instead of the usual resounding double talk, the Populists made clear their position and presented specific demands. The Omaha Platform, 1892 The preamble of the Omaha platform ex- pressed indignation at the existing political and economic conditions, which were, it claimed, biinging the nation \"to the verge of moral, poHti- cal, and material ru,'\";.'\" In the exaggerated terms usual in Amerir- n party platforms, it condemned pohtical corruption, newspapers dominated by business interests, the mortgage burden, and the condition of labor. Echoing the Declaration of Independence, it referred to the 300 Pinkerton detectives employed by the Car- negie Steel Company in the Homestead lockout as \"a hireling army, unrecognized by our laws.\" The influence of Henry George was seen in the statements that \"the land is concentrating in the hands of the capitalists,\" and that governmental injustice breeds \"two great classes— tramps and millionaires.\" Turning to money and banking, the Popuhsts deplored the National Bank Act as a means whereby \"the national power to create money\" was \"appropriated to enrich bondholders.\" World-wide adoption of the gold standard was characterized as \"a vast conspiracy against mankind . . . organized on two continents.\" The older parties did nothing, said the Omaha plat- form, but carry on a \"sham battle over the tariff.\" The new party of the \"plain people\" would once and for all forget war hatreds (a criticism of RepubHcan use of the 'Tjloody shirt\"), and devote itself instead to the great task of finding means to cope with \"conditions for which there is no precedent in the history of mankind.\" The most radical statement in the preamble of the Omaha platform was this: \"We believe that the powers of government— in other words of the people,— should be expanded ... as rapid- ly and as far as the good sense of an inteUigent people and the teachings of experience shall justify. . . .\" In Jefferson's time it had been the agriculturalists who favored laissez faire and wanted to reduce the powers of the federal gov- ernment, while Hamilton, supported by bankers and merchants, wanted to increase the role of government in private business. Now in the late nineteenth century the commercial interests preached the Jeffersonian doctrine, while the farmers wanted to use the power of govern- ment to restrain trusts and monopoHes. Attempted Farmer-Labor Alliance The platform proper opened by declaring perpetual union of workers in field and factory. A farmer-labor alliance was diflBcult to main- tain, however, because the interests of the two groups were at variance. The farmer wanted high prices for food products, the laborer wanted them low. The laborer wanted high wages, while the farmer, who was often an employer, was interested in keeping them down.

Much of this section on \"The Emergence of Modern America\" deals with the unhappy phght of farmers in an age of industrialization and urbanization— an age when industiy was outstripping agriculture, in both productivity' and profits. In many farming commu- nities there was such a bitter sense of grie\\ance that there was fear of a revolution. For an understanding of the explosive situation and for explanations of why revolution did not occur. histor\\' can turn to the social sciences. The economist would note that farmers were increasingK- in the grip of economic forces beyond their control— middlemen, railroads, bankers, and the variable demands of a world market (see p. 422). The sociologist would note that farmers developed a strong consciousness of belonging to a separate and isolated group in society, as evidenced, for instance, by the formation of the nationwide organization, the Grange. Furthermore, farmers felt they were losing public esteem. As noted on pages 422-424: Perhaps the cruelest blow to the farmer was loss of status. ... In the new urban America, country people were regarded not as the backbone of the nation, but as \"rubes,\" \"hicks,\" and \"hayseeds.\" The political scientist would stress the fact that federal laws worked to the disad- vantage of the farmer (see the first paragraph of the section on the Populist party, p. 455) . The political scientist would also concern himself with the wa\\' the farmer organized to try to gain control of the state and federal governments through the Grange, the Populist part>'. and Br\\an's \"free silver\" campaign of 1896. He would also seek explanations for the failures of these movements (see pp. 427-429, 4.55-459, 460-461). UltimateK the farmer did not re\\olt. Why?

The political scientist would suggest that the farmers gave up the battle after the Grangers, the Popu- lists, and Bryan's free silver crusade failed; he might also note that giadually the federal government acceded to most of the demands made b>' farmers— thereb\\- dampening the potential re\\olutionar\\- ardor of this group.

The major planks— concerning land, trans- portation, money, and credit— all reflected the interests of the farmer. The demands of organ- ized labor, such as those for an 8-hour day on government contracts and for immigration re- striction, were given a subordinate position. Not included in the platform proper, they were placed among a miscellaneous list of resolutions entitled \"Expression of Sentiments.\" (See pp. 805-806 for text of Omaha platform.) The Omaha platform seems less radical in perspective than it did at the time. It ap- proached socialism only in proposing that the government take over railroad and telegraph lines, both natural monopolies; for such action the Erie and other canals pro.vided an American precedent. The Populists proposed not to over- throw the capitalist system, but simply to change the rules. They aimed to achieve their ends not through revolution, but through the orderly process of free elections. The Populist platform reveals an important function of American third parties— to bring to public at- tention measures that the major parties later adopt as their own. The majority of the Populist demands were later put into effect through either state or federal legislation. The Populists entered the campaign of 1892 with religious fervor. They adapted revival meeting hymns as party songs. Monster rallies were addressed not only by men, but also by \"women with skins tanned to parchment by the hot winds, with bony hands of toil and clad in faded calico.\" One of these orators, Mrs. Mary E. Lease, \"the Kansas Cassandra,\" achieved fame by urging farmers to \"raise less com and more Hell.\" The balloting revealed the sectional character of the People's party. All its 22 elec- toral votes came from states lying west of the Missouri River. In the South, sympathy with Populist aims was widespread, but there was fear that the new party might divide the Demo- cratic vote and let the Republicans back into power. Southern sympathizers therefore became \"Popocrats\"— Democrats with Populist princi- ples. SILVER VS. GOLD Cleveland's second term proved difficult. In- heriting a treasury deficit from the Harrison administration, he had scarcely taken office when the Panic of 1893 burst upon the country. Although Cleveland could not have prevented this disaster, he was held somehow to blame. Furthermore, he managed to antagonize almost every element in his party. Cleveland's Second Term Never popular with machine politicians, Cleveland angered them further by putting 120,000 civil service jobs on the merit system. The President's hope of lowering the prohibitive duties of the McKinley Tariff faded when a few Democratic senators joined QUESTION. A saying of ^^^ Repubhcans this time was, 1 he tanjj is . , . _„„ political dynamite.\" Why? ^ amendments on a new tariff^ bill, thereby keeping rates almost at former levels. Cleveland let the resulting Wilson-Gorman Tariff of 1894 become a law without his signa- ture, but denounced the action of the rebellious senators as \"a piece of party perfidy and dis- honor.\" Cleveland's use of troops in the Pullman strike was condemned by workingmen. Above all, he antagonized farmers by defending the gold standard. Fearful that the Sherman Silver Purchase Act would flood the U.S. Treasury with so much silver that it could not be re- deemed in gold, he called a special session of Congress in 1893 and forced repeal of the law. He was able to do this only with Republican support, since most western and southern"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"460 The Emergence of Modern America Democrats opposed him. Even after federal buying of silver ceased, the gold standard was endangered because of the difficulty of keeping an adequate gold reserve in the treasury. To obtain the precious metal, the Treasury Depart- ment sold United States bonds. In one trans- action J. Pierpont Morgan, the most powerful banker on Wall Street, obtained federal bonds so far below their market value that he and the bankers associated with him made $1,500,000. Western fury at the Morgan bond transaction was unbounded. The gold standard was bad enough, they thought, but to pay bankers to preserve it seemed almost treason- able. More and more, western Democrats turned against the President, became \"Popocrats,\" and demanded that the Democrats favor free silver. The Free Silver Election of 1896 Meanwhile the Repubficans had become more than ever identified with business in- terests. A dominant figure in the party was Mark Hanna, an Ohio businessman-politician. Big, bluif, low-browed Hanna became, perhaps vmjustly, a symbol of the alliance between cor- porate wealth and politics. Anti-Republican cartoons habitually portrayed him in a suit covered with dollar signs. In 1896 Hanna used his great organizing talents to secure the Re- publican nomination for his friend William McKinley, on a platform pledging high tariffs and maintenance of the gold standard. As the election of 1896 approached, the Republicans boasted that they could \"nominate a rag-baby or a yellow dog and elect it,\" because of divisions among their opponents. The Demo- cratic national convention opened with such a bitter fight between Gold Democrats and Silver Democrats that it was almost impossible to keep a semblance of order. Then with dramatic sud- denness, the party found a leader when a rather obscure presidential candidate, William Jen- nings Bryan of Nebraska, rose to speak. The unpopular income tax of 1894 was declared un- constitutional by the Supreme Court because it was a direct tax not apportioned according to represent- ative population. Bryan combined a romantic devotion to free silver with a personaHty, voice, and presence which made him hterally a spellbinder. He came before the convention, he said, to speak \"in defense of a cause as holy as the cause of liberty —the cause of humanity.\" The Gold Democrats had expressed the fear that abandonment of the gold standard would hurt business. Bryan ac- cused them of thinking only of big business; he wished to speak for a \"broader class of business- men\"— small storekeepers, country lawyers, miners, factory workers, and farmers. Brought up on the Plains, Bryan spoke especially for the farm against the city: You come to us and tell us that the great cities are in favor of the gold standard. We reply that the great cities rest upon our broad and fertile plains. Bum down your cities and leave our farms, and your"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"Parties and Politics 461 cities will spring up again as if by magic; but de- stroy our farms, and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country. He concluded with this famous passage: You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns— you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold! The Cross of Gold speech contained hardly a single factual argument for a bimetallic stan- dard, but was so charged with emotion that it made free silver a crusade, with Bryan as its peerless leader. Although only thirty-six years old, he received the Democratic nomination. The majority of the Populists also agreed to sup- port Bn,'an, although they nominated a separate vice-presidential candidate. As the Nebraskan traveled 18,000 miles on the most strenuous speaking tour a candidate had ever made, it almost seemed as though he might stampede the country, as he had the convention. At least five million people heard him. Twenty years later, poet Vachel Lindsay remembered the excitement of a Bryan rally: It was eighteen ninet>--six, and I was just sixteen And Altgeld ruled in Springfield, Illinois, When there came from the sunset Nebraska's shout of joy: In a coat like a deacon, with a black Stetson hat He scourged the elephant plutocrats With barbed wire from the Platte. Among conservatives in the East, \"the Boy Orator from the Platte\" inspired something ap- proaching terror; even from the pulpit he was denounced as \"a mouthing, slobbering dema- gogue.\" In spite of all his efforts, Bryan's cause was doomed. Most large Democratic newspapers abandoned him; the Gold Democrats deserted the party and ran a separate candidate. Collect- ing an immense campaign fund, Hanna hired thousands of speakers and issued an estimated i:j|j4dr.i.'».ijhi-:.i ELECTORAL VOTE 271 17fe POPULAR VOTE 7,102,246 6,-492,559 The Solid South, the wheat-growing areas of the Great Plains, and the Rocky Mountain mining states favored Bryan and free silver, while the more pros- perous farming states of the Midwest and the indus- trial states of the East and Midwest voted for McKin- ley, \"the advance agent of prosperity,\" and the gold standard. 200,000,000 pamphlets to counter the free silver arguments. McKinley, depicted as \"the advance agent of prosperity,\" was helped by the fact that prices of grain and cotton ad\\'anced on the eve of election day. The most serious weakness in Bryan's campaign was that free silver was a poor issue on which to base an entire campaign. No one knew what the result of free coinage of silver would be; it would not have ended fluctu- ation in the value of money, and might have caused a business panic. It had httle appeal for industrial laborers, with whose difficulties Hanna and McKinley had genuine sympathy. Bryan had httle sense of the complex problems of an industrial society, and regarded the East as \"the enemy's country.\" The Republicans won the election of 1896 by a decisive margin, carrying all the thickly populated states of the Northeast and Middle West. It was a victory for industry over agricul- ture, the city over the country, the North and East over the West and South. >\"i^W"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"(^WQ>^ This anti-Bryan cartoon suggests that \"the Boy Orator of the Platte\" was simply a puppet manipulated by silver mine owners, who would make fortunes out of \"free silver.\" McKinley in Office, 1897 The McKinley administration tCMsk office in 1897 under favorable circumstances. Prosperity was returning after three years of depression. The discovery of large gold deposits in Aus- tralia, South Africa, and the Yukon put an end to the world-wide specie famine that had been driving prices down. As an ardent believer in protection, McKinley's first important action was to call a special session of Congress to \"revise\" the tariff. The result was the Dingley Tariff that levied rates even higher than those of the McKinley Act of 1890. American steel companies received additional protection though they were already able to compete successfully in world markets. Duties were put on foreign paintings and sculpture, although American artists protested that they did not want to be \"protected.\" But the American people did not react as unfavorably to the Dingley Tariff as to that of 1890, perhaps because their attention was drawn from domestic issues to foreign affairs. FOREIGN AFFAIRS \"Our relations with foreign nations today,\" wrote Henry Cabot Lodge in 1889, \"fill but a slight place in American poHtics, and excite generally only a languid interest. We have separated ourselves so completely from the affairs of other people that it is difficult to realize how large a place they occupied when the government was foimded.\" At the time of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, the very survival of the young American repubhc depended on wise foreign poHcy. Elec- tions turned on serious disputes over foreign affairs, and diplomacy was in the hands of the ablest men of the country. During the long period of isolation that began about 1815, however, relations with other countries were considered so unimportant that American diplomacy was at the mercy of party politics. State Department jobs were under the spoils system, and few Secretaries of State had diplomatic experience. Foreign relations were apt to be conducted with an eye to the voters, especially in election years. A favorite maneu- ver, known as \"twisting the lion's tail,\" was to appeal to the Irish vote by gestures against Great Britain. In 1888, for instance. Republican senators, trying to discredit Cleveland as pro-English, rejected a treaty with Great Britain concerning American fishing rights in Canadian waters. To counter this move, Cleveland sent Congress a 462"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"Parties and Politics 463 message urging strong measures against Canada unless the demands of the United States were complied with, treaty or no treaty. The Presi- dent neither expected nor desired that his rec- ommendations be carried out, but he had to appear as anti-British as his opponents. James G. Blaine, Secretary of State As the United States became a great indus- trial nation with world-wide trade, foreign rela- tions were bound to assume more importance. James G. Blaine was one of the first men to grasp the new situation. Blaine, Secretary of State under Garfield in 1881 and under Harrison from 1889 to 1892, was especially interested in making closer commercial ties with Latin Amer- ica. He presided over a Pan-American Congress, held in Washington in 1889, which set up a permanent organization that eventually became the Pan American Union. Blaine wanted to in- crease inter-American commerce by \"reci- procity\"— mutual lowering of tariff barriers. He labored without much success to get reciprocity provisions into the McKinley Tariff of 1890. Outside the sphere of Pan-Americanism, Blaine's \"spirited\" diplomacy was characterized less by wisdom than by the ability to create headlines through belligerent notes to foreign nations. He engaged in a series of hot disputes with Great Britain over the protection of seals in the Bering Sea (1889), with Germany over rights in the Samoan Islands (1889), and with Chile over ill-treatment of American sailors on leave in Santiago (1891). While unimportant in themselves, these incidents dramatized the fact that American interests were expanding far be- yond our borders. Attempt to Annex Hawaiian Islands, 1893 Now that the frontier was closing, would the United States again expand its territory? This question seemed about to be answered in the aflBrmative when in January 1893, Americans in the Hawaiian Islands, assisted by the crew of a United States warship, overthrew the native ruler. Queen Liliuokalani. Proclaiming an inde- pendent state, they asked to be annexed. The American minister to Hawaii wrote the Depart- ment of State: \"The Hawaiian pear is now fully ripe, and this is the golden hour for the United States to pluck it.\" President Harrison promptly sent an annexation treaty to the Senate, which did not act before Cleveland came into oflBce in March. Cleveland immediately withdrew the Ha- waiian treaty for re-examination. Eventually he reached the conclusion that the use of American military forces to overthrow the native govern- ment as a step toward annexation was a viola- tion of \"national honesty.\" Braving criticism for hauling down the QUESTION • Was Cleve- Stars and Stripes land right in refusing to and \"turning back annex Hawaii? the hands of civi- lization,\" Cleve- land withdrew American troops from Hawaii and attempted, without success, to restore Queen Liliuokalani to her throne. The Venezuela Boundary Crisis, 1895-1896 Cleveland's withdrawal from Hawaii im- plied, however, no unwillingness to assert what he considered legitimate American rights. This was revealed by the Venezuela boundary crisis of 1895-1896. The boundary between British Guiana and Venezuela had been disputed for over half a century. In 1887 and again in 1894, Cleveland suggested submitting the matter to arbitration. Great Britain, with the stronger claim to most of the disputed area, refused these requests. Finally, in July 1895, Secretary of State Richard Olney sent to London a stiff note arguing that British refusal to arbitrate was a violation of the Monroe Doctrine, and warning that \"the United States is practically sovereign on this continent. . . .\" After an irritating delay"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"'lOO- 464 The Emergence of Modern America of several months. Lord Salisbury, British for- eign minister, replied that the Monroe Doctrine had no standing in international law, and in any event it had no reference to the Venezuela situation. Cleveland later confessed that Sahsbury's note made him \"mad clean through.\" In Decem- ber 1895, he sent a vigorous message to Congress asking for $100,000 to appoint a commission to fix the Venezuela-British Guiana boundary with- out consulting Britain. The President \\vrote that he was \"fully ahve\" to the possibihty that such a course might mean war. His action met with enthusiastic support in this country while on the other side of the Atlantic it was regarded as \"monstrous and insulting.\" For a few days war seemed imminent. The British fleet was made ready to sail, and American coastal defenses were put under repair. There was talk of in- vading Canada. It was not long, however, before \"sober second thought\" began to prevail. In both America and Britain there was renewed con- sciousness of the bonds of language, trade, and common inheritance. Furthermore, Guiana was of far less importance to the British Empire than other areas, and early in January 1896, Enghsh attention was diverted from Venezuela by a dispute with Germany involving South Africa. Late in the same month Joseph Cham- berlain, an Enghsh statesman, made a memora- ble speech in which he asserted that war between England and the United States \"would be an absvudity as well as a crime.\" He hoped the Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack would some day float together \"in defense of a common cause sanctioned by humanity and justice.\" The British government then agreed to arbitrate the Venezuela boimdary, on terms that made it probable the verdict would favor them, as it did. Although Alaska and a few Pacific Islands had been annexed earlier, the main imperialistic thrust of the United States in the Pacific and Caribbean occurred in 1898.

The Monroe Doctrine, which once owed its effectiveness to the British fleet, had now been successfully asserted against Britain herself. The crisis served indeed to clear the air as regards Anglo-American relations. A new realization of common traditions and common interests came to outweigh memories of the American Revolu- tion and the War of 1812. It was apparent that protection of the Western Hemisphere under the Monroe Doc- trine demanded sea power, and the Venezuela crisis publicized the fact that the United States had only three modem battleships to pit against the vast British fleet. The crisis popularized the writings of an American naval officer. Captain Alfred T. Mahan, whose best-known work. The Influence of Sea Power on History, 1660-1783, was published in 1890. In this and other works Mahan argued that sea power was necessary for national greatness, and that a state which neglected its navy was courting disaster. At first Mahan had more influence abroad than in his own country. Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany \"devoured\" his books and instructed his naval officers to read them. In England Mahan was showered mth honors. Then he was heeded in the United States. In 1896 Congress voted to add thirteen new ships to the navy. The United States was to become a major naval power. The new fleet was shortly to go into action, not against Great Britain but against Spain. Activities: Chapter 18 For Mastery and Review 1.

Most of these are either explicit or im- plicit in each of the nine Parts into which this text is divided. It is useful, however, to select particular themes for illustration, emphasis, and study at the end of each Part. Surely the immense industrial progress of the period covered in this Part, along with the incredible saga of the opening of the trans-Mississippi West, suggests two themes: \"economic opportunity\" and \"a mobile population\" (see pp. xi-xii). Ques- tions for investigation involving these themes might be: 1. What was the connection between cheap steel and the economic develop- ment of the trans-Mississippi West? See Webb, The Great Plains. 2. Who settled the Rocky Mountain region, and why?

The year 1898 was a great watershed in United States history. With almost no one foreseeing what was going to happen, this country acquired an overseas empire. It started as \"the War for Cuban Independence.\" It ended with the United States expanding into the Caribbean, extending its frontier six thousand miles across the Pacific to the Philippines, picking up Hawaii and Guam along the way. With its new possessions, the United States also acquired \"commitments.\" Our foothold in Puerto Rico and Cuba brought a commitment to keep order in the entire Caribbean region. Possession of the Philippines gave us a new interest In the affairs of China. Eventually, we committed ourselves to defending equal trading rights in China — the Open Door — and the integrity of China itself. And this commitment ultimately led us to fight Japan in World War II. Unquestionably, then, the Spanish-American War started a process that tremen- dously extended the interests and influence of the United States abroad. Was the process inevitable? Was it a new version of manifest destiny? At the time, some thought it the right and duty of the United States to expand overseas. Some his- torians since then have argued that a great industrial nation was bound to extend its political power to protect its growing trade and overseas investments. There have also been those who argued that 1898 marked a great aberration — a deviation from proper American foreign policy. It was one thing to free Cuba, but it was a flat violation of the great principles of the Declaration of Independence to gain dominion over other people. And if the purpose of the Spanish-American War was to promote the economic interests of the United States, why in 1897 and 1898 were businessmen so opposed to our getting involved in hostilities that every war scare sent the stock market down? And what business did the United States have meddling in the politics of Asia, in the hope of future markets, with Insufficient military power to back up its policies? Examine the events of 1898 in detail. It may seem that the United States did not need to fight Spain in order to free Cuba and that once we were at war the annexation of the Philippines was no part of our declared purposes and was unnecessary to our military strategy. Suppose the war had not occurred and Cuba had achieved her freedom peacefully. Would that have kept United States political influence out of the Caribbean area? We doubt it. If Dewey's fleet had not been ordered to Manila Bay, would the United States have defended the Open Door and the integrity of China? Perhaps not."},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"Chapter 19 Imperialism The Philippines are ours forever: \"territory belonging to the United States,\" as the Constitution calls them.

We will not renounce our part in the mission of our race, trustees under God of the civilization of the world. ALBERT J. BEVERIDGE No man is good enough to govern another without that man's consent. ABRAHAM LINCOLN The last quarter of the nineteenth century saw a great expansion of the power of the major European nations over \"backward\" areas. A principal force behind this imperialist move- ment was the industrial revolution. As factories increased, they produced more goods than were consumed at home and demanded raw materials obtainable only abroad. Imperialism offered new markets and new sources of raw materials. New weapons made easier the subjection of native peoples. Steamships and ocean cables tightened control over distant colonies; they also led to a race to acquire coaUng stations and cable bases. The economic elements behind nineteenth- century imperialism were combined with na- tional patriotism and ideaUsm. Young men were urged to \"throw themselves against cannons' mouths for love of England.\" Many who sup- ported imperialism held to the now-exploded notion that the white race was superior to others and therefore had a \"civiUzing mission.\" In a celebrated poem Rudyard Kipling urged the Anglo-Saxon countries to \"Take up the White Man's burden.\" Once launched in the 1870's, the imperialist movement resulted in a mad \"scramble for em- pire.\" In the continent of Africa alone, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium established claims totaling twice the area of the United States. The United States was late in joining the race for empire. With an abundance of raw materials, an immense home market, and httle surplus capital available for foreign investment, this country lacked the economic motives which operated in Europe. The tradition of isolation tended to keep America within its borders. Furthermore, the conquest of \"subject\" peoples seemed at variance with the fundamental idea of the Declaration of Independence— that people have the right to rule themselves. When the United States did acquire an overseas empire, most of its citizens, including the President, had no premonition of what was coming. 475"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"y»se'^'^?'W9i?^^^^^mik',-^!^AA—\\^*J.--'^,'.'^-n^ BtWimD— WHO 'DEStROYED THE AAlIlt NEW YORK JOURNAL AND AOVCRTISER.

But when news of the sinking reached New York, newspapers that rivaled each other in their imaginative recreations of Spanish atrocities laid the blame on Spain. Although it may appear as though the American adventuj-e into imperiahsm occurred almost by chance, voices had already been raised in favor of expansion overseas. Thus Alfred Mahan demanded not only the building of a great fleet, but the acquisition of coaling stations and strategic harbors in the Pacific and the Caribbean. A clergyman, Josiah Strong, in a book entitled Our Country, wrote that it was the mission of the United States to spread Chris- tianity and civil liberty by estabhshing colonies. Strong, like other imperialists, borrowed the language of Darwinism to support his argu- ments: he maintained that the Anglo-Saxons were the \"fittest to survive\" in the great com- petition between races for the control of the globe. People of Enghsh stock, he wrote, were \"destined to dispossess many weaker races, as- similate others, and mold the remainder,\" until they had \"Anglo-Saxonized mankind.\" Such pseudo-Darwinian notions were preached by influential historians and pohtical scientists. They were also held by a few important pohti- cians, notably Senator Heruy Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts and his close friend, Theodore Roosevelt, President McKinley's Assistant Secre- tary of the Navy. While the business community was in general opposed to foreign adventiu-es, some American corporations were actively seek- ing foreign markets. If businessmen could be shown that by acquiring colonies the United States could expand its markets, they could be converted to imperiahsm. For many business- men this conversion took place during the Spanish-American War. THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR, 1898 The Spanish-American War had its origins in Cuba. This last important remnant of the great Spanish empire in ^\\merica had long been in a chronic state of unrest. Violent rebelhon broke 476"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"out in 1895 and developed into \"one of those dreadful, tragic, hopeless situations that mark the decline or exhaustion of a colonial relation- ship.\" The insurgents were not strong enough to take the cities, but carried on bitter guerrilla warfare. They dehberately attempted to devas- tate the island so that the Spaniards would be glad to withdraw. Spanish attempts at sup- pression were inefficient and harsh. On both sides there were atrocities. President Cleveland's annual messages to Congress in 1895 and 1896 reveal the difficulties that the Cuban war caused the United States. The rebels were supphed with arms illegally sent from the United States, and it was the task of the executive department to stop this traffic. Leaders of the Cuban independence move- ment were often naturalized American citizens who, when captured by Spanish authorities, de- manded protection by the United States. Ameri- can capitalists who had invested between 30 million and 50 million dollars in Cuba, mostly in sugar plantations, wanted the war to end. The plantation owners, doubting the capacity of the Cubans for self-government, often favored the restoration of Spanish rule, but American public opinion was overwhelmingly on the side of the right of the islanders to independence. Although Cleveland preserved strict neutrality in the Cuban struggle, he warned that if \"the useless sacrifice of human life\" went on, the United States might have to abandon the policy of \"patient waiting.\" \"Remember the Maine!\" McKinley attempted to follow Cleveland's policies. He strictly enforced the neutrality laws and used his influence to prevent Congress from passing a joint resolution recognizing the bel- ligerent rights of the Cuban rebels. The Spanish government, most unwisely, rejected McKinley 's eflForts to bring hostiUties to an end. Meanwhile the yellow press, led by William Randolph a». asss. The Battle of Manila Bay, as idealized by an artist from descriptions received by telegraph from Manila. The ships were certainly not so close together, but otherwise it is a good picture of the fleet in action. Hearst's New York Journal and Joseph Pulitzers New York World, filled the front pages with exaggerated and sometimes fabricated stories of Spanish atrocities in Cuba. Finally an event occurred that led to war. On February 15, 1898, the United States battleship Maine, at anchor in the harbor of Havana, the capital of Cuba, was destroyed by a terrible explosion that killed 260 of her crew. To this day the cause of the disaster is unknown. It is highly improbable that the Spanish were responsible, since the last thing they wanted was American intervention. But the yellow press had no doubts. The New York Journal ran a headline \"THE WARSHIP MAINE WAS SPLIT IN TWO BY AN ENE- MY'S SECRET INFERNAL MACHINE,\" and published fake diagrams showing just how the deed was done. \"Remember the Maine!\" became the slogan of the day.

Al- though at the last moment Spain ofiFered to make almost all the concessions that McKinley asked, on April 11 the President sent a message to Congress requesting that he be empowered to use the armed forces of the United States to pacify Cuba. After a week of debate, Congress by overwhelming majorities demanded that Spain evacuate QUESTION . If the Teller the island. When Amendment had not been no reply to this passed, would Cuba be ultimatum was re- Communist-ruled today? ceived, the so- called \"War for Cuban Independence\" was declared on April 25. By the Teller Amendment, which was included in the ultimatum to Spain, Congress unani- mously denied any designs on Cuba and promised as soon as peace was accomphshed \"to leave the government and control of the Island to the people.\" Hostilities in the Caribbean Once hostilities started, McKinley called for 125,000 volunteers to supplement the regular army, which numbered only 28,000. In answer- ing this call for national service, the South responded as enthusiastically as the North, and three of the four civihans appointed as major- generals were Confederate veterans. Thus the Spanish-American War revealed that \"if the war cloud hovered . . . above the country, the former boys in gray would rally as proudly in defense of the Stars and Stripes as did the wearers of the blue.\" In spite of incredible ineflSciency, 47,000 -vohinteers and regulars were made ready to sail from Tampa, Florida, by the middle of June. For a campaign in the tropics they were issued heavy woolen uniforms, left over from the Indian wars; their cartridges were of an out- of-date type; and their rations included inedible meat which the soldiers nicknamed \"embalmed beef.\" After landing on the south coast of Cuba, the American force advanced on the city of Santiago. Even with poor equipment and con- fused leadership, the spirit of the American troops was much higher than that of the Spanish force barring their way. The fighting produced a popular hero in the person of Theodore Roosevelt, who had resigned from the Navy Department to serve in a volunteer regiment that he recruited himself. Against heavy fire Roosevelt personally led his \"Rough Riders\" in a frontal assault on San Juan Hill on the out- skirts of Santiago. Meanwhile, the American navy had not been idle. At the outbreak of hostihties, a squadron of the new White Fleet under Admiral William T. Sampson was given the task of inter- cepting a Spanish squadron under Admiral Pascual Cervera that was known to have left the Cape Verde Islands in April. There was such fear that Cervera would attack the undefended • Atlantic Coast of the United States that eastern seaports demanded naval protection, and there was wholesale cancellation of hotel reservations at seaside resorts. Cer\\'era's ships were finally discovered in Santiago harbor, which was im- mediately blockaded by Sampson's superior force. Once the .-American army took the heights overlooking Santiago, Cervera had the choice of surrendering or trying to break the blockade. To save the honor of Spain he took the latter course, and on July 3 his ships steamed out of Santiago harbor. In the ensuing battle all the Spanish vessels were sunk, while American losses were only one man killed and one wounded. Effective Spanish resistance in Cuba ceased with the sur- render of Santiago two weeks later. American troops immediately went on to occupy another Spanish possession, the island of Puerto Rico. <y~ .ri-^ \\ 'v).\\i^v^- ^^^xS^ ^"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"The Library of Congress \"That splendid little war.\" Col.

The Campaign in the Philippines Meanwhile American forces won victories on the other side of the globe. When the war started, the McKinley administration had no notion of expanding the territories of the United States. But while he had served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Theodore Roosevelt had been one of a small group of influential men who favored war with Spain as a means whereby the United States might acquire an overseas empire. When- ever John D. Long, Secretary of the Navy, left Washington, Roosevelt took over. In February 1898, he ordered a Pacific squadron stationed in Hong Kong under the command of Com- modore George Dewey to sail for the Philippine Islands in case war with Spain broke out. Dewey was expected to prevent a Spanish fleet in Manila Bay from going to sea. As soon as war was declared, Dewey's fleet set sail; it pene- trated Manila Bay on May 1 and soon destroyed an inferior Spanish fleet. During the battle, the cable from Manila to Hong Kong had been cut, so that at first the outside world received only a Spanish report that Dewey had been repulsed. When the truth reached the United States a week later, there was wild rejoicing. Troops were immediately dispatched to Manila, and the city was captured on August 13, a few hours after Spain had agreed on an arm istice. Representatives of the United States and Spain met to arrange peace at Paris on October 1, 1898. The only real dispute at the conference table concerned the Philippines, which Spain was unwilling to relinquish on the groimd that"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"480 New Horizons the United States had won only the city of Manila, and that after an agreement to cease hostilities had been made. To Annex or Not to Annex? The decisive dispute about the future of the Philippines occurred, however, not at Paris, but in the United States. On entering the War for Cuban Independence, the American people had no idea of annexing territory, particularly a territory six thousand miles from the Pacific coast. McKinley confessed that before Dewey's victory he could not have come \\\\'ithin two thousand miles of placing the PhiUppine Islands on a map. Once he said, \"If old Dewey had just sailed away when he smashed that Spanish fleet, what a lot of trouble he would have saved us.\" Strong feeling developed against acquiring the islands. Bryan and Cleveland, the two lead- ing Democrats, were opposed, as were many influential private citizens, among them Charles W. Eliot and Andrew Carnegie. Prominent Re- publicans, including Speaker of the House Thomas B. Reed and several senators, fought the annexation as a \\ioIation of American tradition. Eventually sentiment for annexation out- weighed opposition. Business interests were won over by the hope of new markets for American goods and new fields of investment.

Pa- triotism was also involved: there was strong feeling against haul- ing down the Stars and Stripes,- especially since some other power, such as Japan or Germany, was likely to step in and take the PhiUppines as soon as we left. Finally, McKinley decided that the United States must \"take up the White Man's burden.\" As he later told a delegation of clergymen: I walked the floor of the White House night after night until midnight. . . . And one night late it came to me this way— ... ( 1 ) That we could not give them [the Philippines] back to Spain— that would be cowardly and dishonorable; (2) that we could not turn them over to . . . our commercial rivals in the Orient— that would be bad business and discredit- able . . . ; (3) that we could not leave them to them- selves—they were unfit for self-government— and . . . ; (4) that there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them. . . . And then I went to bed . . . and slept soundly. New Responsibilities and Commitments Once the McKinley administration decided to acquire the Phihppines, it offered to pay for them. Therefore by the Treaty of Paris, signed in December 1898, the United States gave $20,000,000 for the islands. Spain evacuated Cuba and ceded Puerto Rico, which had been hastily occupied by .A.merican troops at the close of hostilities, and Guam, which \\\\as important as a way station to the Philippines. Anti- imperialist feeling in the Senate was so strong that the treaty was ratified by only a t^\\•o-vote margin. A Senate resolution promising the Fili- pinos eventual independence was defeated only by the tie-breaking vote of the Vice-President. The new sense of manifest destiny resulted in a change of policy regarding the Hawaiian Islands. As we have seen, Cleveland had op- posed a move to annex them in 1893, and in 1897 the Senate rejected an annexation treaty presented by McKinley. But after Dewey won the battle of Manila Bay, the islands acquired a new importance as a stepping-stone to the Far East. They were annexed in July 1898 by a joint resolution of Congress. (See U.S. and Posses- sions in 1900, pp. 464-465)."},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"Imperialism 481 The events of 1898 marked a turning point in American history. The United States was suddenly faced with the responsibility of ruling alien peoples who could not be \"Americanized\" by the usual process of living in the United States. It now held a commanding position in the Caribbean which soon led to a commitment to police the entire area. Possession of the Philip- pines in turn led to another commitment, the defense of China from external aggression. PROBLEMS OF AN OVERSEAS EMPIRE The new possessions acquired in 1898 posed difficult questions. How were they to be gov- erned? Were their inhabitants American citi- zens? Did colonial goods enter the United States duty free? In addition to such over-all questions, each colony presented its own special problem. The colony that had the least difficulty in attaching itself to tiie United States was Hawaii. Liliuokalani, Last Queen of Hawaii It was a shame. They had already lived through twelve years of irresponsible monarchy, and the queen had .seemed to be different — anxious to reform her playboy brother's kingdom, regal, devoted to duty. But she was about to promul- gate a constitution that would put Hawaii back into the mid-nineteenth century. And what could the responsible members of society do but stop her? Liliuokalani lived amid the faithfully reproduced splendors of the Victorian era. Her throne was red and gold; her throne room was crowded with portraits of earlier Hawaiian rulers, whose gorgeous royal feather standards lined the walls. Her home, lolani Palace, was a remarkable structure, echoing earlier Hawaiian history. Between its windows on the outside walls were mirrors, reminders of the gifts brought by missionaries to earlier islanders, who were entranced with their own reflections in the \"magic glass.\" Descendants of these missionaries had become prosperous businessmen who now saw their livelihood threatened by the strong-willed queen. The situation was serious. Hawaii depended on its sugar industry, and the queen was unwilling to allow the planters to retain their voice in the government. Although a reciprocity treaty with the United States had brought them prosperity, the recent McKinley Tariff had made it impossible to compete with Cuban sugar in United States markets. Annexation to the United States would save the sugar industry. But the queen was interested only in restoring the authority of the monarchy. In 1893 a Committee of Safety, secretly committed to annexation, drove Liliuokalani off the throne. President Cleveland tried to re-establish the kingdom, but the Provisional Government refused to disband, and in 1894 a republic was formed. The queen, accused of complicity in a counterrevolution in 1895, was arrested and confined to her palace. Pardoned later, she went to the mainland, where she lived on an annual pension of four thousand dollars and the income from one of her sugar plantations. Hawaii was finally annexed in 1898; in 1959 It became the fiftieth state admitted to the United States. (Theme 1, see p. xl)"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"482 Neio Horizons Between 1893 and 1898 Hawaii had been an independent republic dominated by Americans. Although the inhabitants came from many coun- tries, especially Japan and China, English was becoming the common language. In 1900 Hawaii was made a territory, and the former president of the republic, Sanford B. Dole, was appointed its first governor. The opening of the American market to Hawaiian products such as sugar and pineapples brought great prosperity to the islands. By 1928 trade with the United States had reached the amazing total of $584 for each inhabitant of the islands. The change of sovereignty caused more difficulties in Puerto Rico than in Hawaii. The transition from producing for the Spanish mar- ket to producing for that of the United States was difficult, and the cultural ties of Puerto Ricans were with Spain and Latin America, not with the English-speaking United States. After a brief period of military rule, Puerto Rico was given an increasing degree of self-government until by 1917 it was granted territorial status and its people were made citizens of the United States. Improved public sanitation cut the death rate in half, and public schools raised the literacy rate. The rapid increase in population, however, tended to outrun the available food supply, and Puerto Rico was far less prosperous than Hawaii. The inhabitants demanded either independence or complete self-rule under the American flag. The Philippine Insurrection, 1899-1902 The Philippines provided the most difficult problem in colonial administration. The 7,100 islands supported a population of 7,500,000 people, divided into 43 ethnic groups, speaking 87 different languages and dialects. Culturally the Filipinos ranged from primitive peoples in the jungles to highly hterate inhabitants in the cities. When Dewey reached Manila Bay, an uprising against Spain had just begun, and Fih- pino patriots, besieging Manila assisted the American forces. Once it became apparent, however, that the United States intended to annex the Philippines, a new uprising broke out, led by the able guerrilla chieftain Emilio Aguinaldo. It required over 60,000 troops— four times the number sent to Cuba— and three years of fighting to suppress the Filipino patriots. Many Americans were distressed to find their country in the same position as Spain in 1895 and England in 1776— at war with a native in- dependence movement. Former Speaker Thomas B. Reed abandoned politics in protest against imperialism and taunted a pro-expansionist by asking how much it had cost to buy Filipinos \"in the bush.\" The poet William Vaughn Moody wrote bitter verses about expending the blood of American boys to subdue a people struggling to be free. In 1901, even before the insurrection was suppressed. President McKinley announced that American policy toward the islands would be directed toward the good of the Filipinos. \"The Philippines are ours,\" said the President, \"not to exploit but to develop, to civilize, to educate, to train in the science of self-govern- ment.\" In pursuit of this ideal the President sent two commissions, composed of able and well- meaning men, to investigate the condition of the Philippines and set up a civil government. William Howard Taft, later President of the United States, headed the second commission. Genuinely devoted to the interests of the \"little brown brothers,\" as he called them, Taft started a program to prepare tlie Filipinos for self- government and protect them from foreign ex- ploitation. American teachers were brought in to establish public schools. The United States bought out large foreign landowners, and intro- duced laws designed to keep property in the hands of the natives. Qualified Filipinos were soon brought into the governments; in 1907 an elective legislature was established; and in 1916 the United States promised the Phihppines eventual independence."},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"^Vi:%;sl Public schools were established by American teachers in the Philippines as part of a program of educating the Filipinos in the art of self-government. Spanish-speaking children are shown being taught English. Did the Constitution Follow the Flag? The new overseas possessions posed con- stitutional problems that were summarized in the question, \"Does the Constitution follow the flag?\" Congress, according to the Constitution, may not levy duties on goods carried from one part of the United States to another. Did this mean that no tariff duties might be laid on goods from American colonies? The Constitution guar- antees to all American citizens certain civil rights. Did this guarantee extend to the inhabit- ants of the new colonies who had no conception of the principles or practices of Anglo-Saxon justice? Did the head-hunting Igorots of the Philippine rain-forest, for instance, have the right to trial by a jury of their peers? Such questions were appealed to the Su- preme Court, which in the \"insular cases\" decided that the Constitution did not com- pletely apply to overseas possessions. In a con- fused 5 to 4 decision ( Downes v. Bidwell, 1901 ), the court ruled that Puerto Rico was not strictly speaking part of the United States, but was a dependency; therefore Congress might levy tariffs on Puerto Rican products. Other deci- sions held that inhabitants of dependencies en- joyed full civil rights only if granted them by congressional legislation. Since 1903, however, Congress has granted independence to the Philippines, as well as free trade and an increas- ing measure of civil rights to other dependen- cies. Today, therefore, the problem of whether or not the Constitution follows the flag is no longer an important issue. Cuba and the Piatt Amendment By the Teller Amendment, passed on the eve of the Spanish-American War, the United States pledged itself to withdraw from Cuba as soon as order was restored. After three years of civil war, however, the island was in terrible condi- tion. For the sake of the Cuban people them- selves, the United States felt duty-bound to remain and help in reconstruction. For nearly four years Cuba was under military rule directed by General Leonard Wood. The most dramatic achievement of Wood's able and energetic ad- ministration was the suppression of yellow fever. An American medical mission under Dr. Walter Reed proved the accuracy of the theory held by a Cuban physician, Carlos J. Finlay: that yel- low fever was transmitted by tlie stegomyia mosquito. In the course of the investigation, American doctors and volunteers deliberately allowed themselves to be bitten by mosquitoes, and some of them died as martyrs to medical progress. A successful campaign to eliminate mosquitoes from Havana was carried on under the direction of Major William C. Gorgas, an army medical oflBcer. By 1901, for the first time"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"484 New Horizons in centuries, there was no yellow fever in the Cuban capital. Meanwhile the Cubans made progress to- ward self-government. They held mimicipal elections in 1900, and in 1901 adopted a con- stitution modeled on that of the United States. In 1902 American miUtary authority came to an end. Cuban independence was not complete, but was limited by the so-called Piatt Amend- ment which Congress tacked on to an army appropriation bill in 1901. The Piatt Amend- ment governed the relations bet\\veen Cuba and the United States for thirty-three years. Its most important provisions were: (1) Cuba should not make any treaty with a foreign nation which weakened its independence; (2) it should allow the United States the right to buy or lease naval stations; (3) its pubHc debt should not exceed its capacity to pay; and (4) the United States should have the right to intervene to protect Cuban independence and keep order. These provisions, written into the Cuban constitution and into a treaty with the United States, made Cuba an American protectorate. In 1903 the United States granted Cuba special tariff favors, especially a 20 per cent reduction of the duty on sugar imported by the United States. This so encoiu-aged sugar production that by 1920 Americans had invested over a billion dollars in the island. NEW COMMITMENTS IN CHINA Although American missionary enterprise in China had continued, Chinese-American com- merce had slackened since the great days of the tea clippers; in 1898 only 2 per cent of China's trade was with the United States. The acquisi- tion of the Phihppines revived interest in busi- ness opportunities in China. Manila, it was predicted, would become as important a center for commerce with China as the great British port of Hong Kong. At the close of the nineteenth century, it looked as though the \"Celestial Empire\" was to go the way of Africa and be partitioned among stronger powers.

Secretary of State John Hay later tried to prevent China's division among foreign powers. in 1895 when the recently Westernized Japanese easily defeated the Chinese, annexing Formosa and the Pescadores Islands (see map, p. 715). In 1898 and 1899, Russia, Germany, France, and Great Britain \"leased\" Chinese ports, some of them for ninety-nine years. It was expected that each \"leasehold\" would become the center of a \"sphere of influence\" so that through holding Port Arthur, Russia would dominate Manchuria; through Kiaochow, Germany would control the Shantung Peninsula, and so forth. Two powers were opposed to parceling out Chinese territory— the United States and Great Britain. The United States feared that it would be unable to cash in on the possession of Manila by enlarging its share of China trade. Great Britain, controlling 80 per cent of the trade, feared that some of her profits would be di- verted to other countries. Early in 1898 the British government sounded out the United States on a joint declaration in favor of the \"Open Door\"— the preservation of equal trading opportunities in China for all foreign nations. At that time the United States was cool to the idea, but the annexation of the Philippines changed the American attitude. John Hay's \"Open Door\" Notes, 1899 John Hay, Secretary of State, was one of the first well-qualified men to hold the position since Hamilton Fish had served under Grant. Hay, who had begun his pobtical career as one of Lincoln's private secretaries, was aware of the importance of foreign policy, and thought"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"486 New Horizons that the days of isolationism must end. He favored a policy of cooperation with Great Britain, and defended the acquisition of an overseas empire. It was therefore natural that he should become interested in defending the Open Door. In September 1899, he sent notes to the major countries having leaseholds in China asking that they keep the ports open to the vessels of all nations on equal terms, levy equal tariffs on imports, and charge equal rail- road rates within their spheres of influence. Since none of the nations in\\ol\\ed wished to state publicly that it intended to discriminate against the trade of other countries, none chose to dispute these points. Hay immediately an- nounced that the Open Door had been \"guar- anteed.\" He was credited in the United States with having achieved a great diplomatic victory. Hay's achievement was less important than it seemed at the time. His request was 'Tike asking all persons in a room who were not thieves to stand up.\" The polite but evasive re- plies to Hay's notes hardly amounted to a guar- antee. Furthermore, the notes did not protect China from being carved into spheres of in- fluence where foreign powers had exclusive rights to build railroads and exploit natural resources. Hay's skillful and well-pubhcized actions were principally designed to popularize the expansionist policies of the McKinley ad- ministration; in this they were successful. The Boxer Rebellion and Second Open Door Notes, 1900 In 1900 a group of Chinese patriots, calling themselves \"Fists of Universal Harmony,\" were so bitterly resentful of foreign interference that they started an uprising with the intention of wiping out the \"foreign devils\" and their Chris- tian converts. The Chinese government lent secret aid to what came to be called the Boxer movement. The Boxers killed over two hundred foreigners, mostly missionaries and their fami- lies, and attempted to slaughter the foreign diplomats in Peking. For seven weeks nine hundred foreigners, cut off from the outside world, held out in the Chinese capital. They were rescued by a joint military ex-pedition to which the United States contributed 2,500 troops. During this crisis. Hay labored successfully to prevent full-scale war against China and to persuade the powers not to use the Bo.xer Rebelhon as an excuse to partition the unhappy country. In July 1900, he again sent identical notes to countries with important interests in China. In these second Open Door notes, Hay went far beyond the first in that he not only urged equal com- QUESTION • Were the mercial opportu- actions of the Boxers de- nity, but declared fensible? it to be the pohcy of the United States to seek a solution that would \"preserve Chinese territorial and administrative entity.\" Hay did not ask the other powers to commit themselves, and he gave no guarantee that the United States would back up the policy with force. But later the idea developed that the United States was committed both morally and mihtarily to defending Chinese integrity-, and this ultimateh' led to war with Japan forty-odd years later. Hay also used his influence toward scaUng dowTi the large indemnity that the Chinese government was forced to pay as punishment for encouraging the Boxers. The American share of the $333,000,000 that China paid foreign countries was 25 million dollars, an amount that proved more than enough to satisfy all Amer- icans who claimed to have suffered in the rebel- hon. In 1907, the United States as a gesture of good will toward China returned $11,000,000, and in 1924, $6,000,000 more. The Chinese gov- ernment used the money to educate Chinese youths at American imiversities."},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"^^\\ \\^ 'j m -•-i r .ijjt^ vs^^^ The Roosevelt Memorial Association Roosevelt, rushing back from a camping trip, arrived at McKinley's bedside too late to see him alive.

IMPERIALISM AS A POLITICAL ISSUE For a few years after the Spanish-American War, imperialism was one of the major issues of national politics. In October 1899, an anti- imperialist congress met at Chicago, attended by delegates from all over the country. The anti-imperialists drew up a platform denouncing the attempt to subdue the Philippines as \"open disloyalty to the distinctive principles of our government.\" They quoted what Abraham Lin- coln said about slavery: \"No man is good enough to govern another man without that man's consent. When the white man governs himself, that is self-government, but when he governs himself and also governs another man, that is more than self-government— that is despotism.\" The Election of 1900 So widespread was opposition to imperialism that in 1900 Bryan, again the Democratic candi-"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"488 New Horizons date, attempted to make it \"the paramount issue\" of the presidential campaign. He weakened his case, however, by continuing to demand free silver, which had become a dead issue. The RepubHcans renominated McKinley for Presi- dent and for Vice-President proposed Theodore Roosevelt, who, since leading the Rough Riders, had become governor of New York. As far as possible, the Republicans avoided discussion of imperialism, a question on which they them- selves were divided. Adopting for their slogan \"the full dinner pail,\" they claimed credit for the prosperity the country had enjoyed during McKinley's administration, and predicted a depression if Bryan were elected. The result of the election was a more decisive Republican victory than that of 1896. McKinley's Last Speech In September 1901, si.x months after his second inauguration, McKinley attended an exposition in Buffalo and made a speech which revealed an intense awareness of America's new position in the world. Heretofore, the President had been considered the \"high priest of protec- tive tariffs,\" but at Buffalo he announced a change of heart, saying: Isolation is no longer possible or desirable. God and man have linked the nations together. No nation can longer be indifferent to any other. . . . Our capacity to produce has developed so enor- mously, and our products have so multiplied, that the problem of more markets requires our urgent and immediate attention. . . . We must not repose in fancied security that we can forever sell everything and buy little or nothing. If such a thing were possible, it would not be best for us or for those with whom we deal. We must take from our customers such of their products as we can use without harm to our industry and labor. To meet the new situation the President pro- posed reciprocity treaties with foreign nations, providing for mutual lowering of tariffs. McKinley did not live to put his new pohcy into effect. The day after delivering his speech on reciprocity he was shot by an anarchist, and died a week later. In the newspaper headlines the news of the President's death had to com- pete with the Vice-President's efforts to reach his bedside. When it was known that the President was dying, Roosevelt was summoned to Buffalo. He was on a camping trip deep in the Adirondack wilderness, and a guide had to be sent out to find him. In order to reach a railroad, Roosevelt drove thirty miles at night by wagon over rough and dangerous roads. When he reached the station, he learned that McKinley was already dead. Just short of forty-three years old, he was the youngest President who had ever entered the White House. Activities: Chapter 19 For Mastery and Review 1.

He preached what he called \"the strenuous life.\" He told young men, \"Don't flinch, don't foul, hit the hne hardi\" He practiced what he preached. Theodore Roosevelt's interests seemed uni- versal, his energy inexhaustible. Even as Presi- dent he found time to read prodigiously in many different fields; to play tennis, box, hunt grizzlies, ride horseback, and go on rugged hikes through the woods; to engage in public discussion of such diverse matters as \"race suicide\" (the declining birth rate), \"nature fakers\" ( writers who told improbable tales about wild animals), simplified spelling (he was a poor speller himself), and changes in the foot- ball rules. He continued to be a devoted father to his six children, quite willing to hold up a state dinner for a pillow fight with his sons. Roosevelt had the magnetism of the true leader. One of his Rough Riders said of him, \"If he and I were crossing Brooklyn Bridge and he ordered me to jump over, I'd do it without asking why.\" An author who had been to lunch at the White House wrote of his experience: \"You go into Roosevelt's presence, you feel his eyes upon you, you listen to him, and you go home and wring the personality out of your clothes.\" He was the darling of reporters be- cause everything he did was news, and of car- toonists because his big teeth, eyeglasses, moustache, and Rough Rider uniform made him easy to caricature. Roosevelt's public nickname, 'Teddy,\" sug- gested a certain childlike quality, and it was true that he had a childish desire not to miss anything, a childish enjoyment of shovvdng off, and sometimes a childish insistence on having his own way. \"You must always remember,\" wrote a friend, \"that the President is about six.\" ROOSEVELT: THE MAN AND HIS CAREER The picturesque and sometimes ridiculous aspects of Roosevelt's character tend to obscure his genuine abilities and solid achievement. Al- though sickly and timid as a small boy, he courageously overcame his handicaps, at first through hunting trips in the Maine woods, later 490"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"Theodore Roosevelt and Foreign Affairs 491 by boxing, playing polo, and riding the cattle ranges in North Dakota. He started to collect birds and animals as a child, and became a serious naturalist who contributed to scientific journals. His vigorous outdoor life did not prevent him from writing several books and scores of magazine articles on a variety of sub- jects. Inspired by Francis Parkman (see p. 33), he produced a six-volume work. The Winning of the West, which glorified \"the hard, energetic, practical men who do the pioneer work of civilization.\" His eagerness for experience brought him into contact with all kinds of peo- ple. Although bom to a wealthy and socially prominent New York family, he learned to ap- preciate and make friends with- persons in every walk of life. Less than a year after he graduated from col- lege, Roosevelt announced that he intended to join the local Republican club and run for oflBce. His friends were shocked and warned that he would have to rub shoulders with his social infe- riors, with \"saloon-keepers, horse-car conductors, and the like.\" Roosevelt replied that the people he knew did not belong to the governing class, and the others did; he intended to be one of the governing class. In 1881 he was elected to the New York legislature, and was twice re-elected. In ensuing years he was Republican candidate for mayor of New York City, a member of the United States Civil Service Commission under Harrison and Cleveland, and a New York City police commissioner. McKinley appointed him Assistant Secretary of the Navy. He resigned from this position to help organize the Rough Riders. His popularity as a military hero made him governor of New York in 1898. Throughout his political career, Roosevelt steered a course somewhat between being a \"Muldoon\" (straight party man) on the one hand, and a \"Mugwump\" (an independent) on the other. In the New York legislature he op- posed machine politicians and cooperated with governor Grover Cleveland to promote civil service reform, even though Cleveland was a Democrat. In the 1884 presidential campaign, however, he refused to desert the Republican party, even though he thoroughly disapproved of its candidate, James G. Blaine. \"A man can- not act without and within the party,\" Roosevelt said at the time. \"He can do either, but he can- not possibly do both. ... It is impossible to combine the functions of a guerrilla chief with those of a colonel in the regular army; one has greater independence of action, the other is able to make what action he does vastly more effec- tive.\" This remark also illustrates Roosevelt's attitude toward reform. He wanted clean government that QUESTION • Have we a should be respon- lunatic fringe today? If so, sive to the peo- who composes it? pie's needs, but distrusted what he called the \"lunatic fringe\" of reformers who were impatient to make over society at once. He could do good, he felt, only by not attempt- ing the impossible. Use of Presidential Power Such was the force of Roosevelt's personality that, although faced with no great crisis, he much increased the scope and power of the office of President. Acting on what he called the Jackson-Lincoln theory of the presidency, he claimed the right to do practically anything he thought would benefit the people. \"I did not usurp power,\" he said in his autobiography, \"but I did greatly broaden the use of executive power. I . . . caused to be done many things not previously done by the President and head of the departments. In other words, I acted for the public welfare . . . whenever and in whatever manner was necessary, unless prevented by di- rect constitutional or legislative prohibition. . . .\" There was hardly any method of exerting power that Roosevelt did not attempt.

His speeches, letters, and off-the-cuff remarks to newspapermen made headlines, partly because he was a talented phrase-maker who talked of \"race suicide,\" \"the big stick,\" and \"malefactors of great wealth.\" He made any cause in which he was engaged as dramatic as storming San Juan Hill. \"Roosevelt,\" ruefully admitted one of his critics, \"has the knack of doing things, and doing them noisily, clamorously; while he is in the neighborhood the public can no more look the other way than the small boy can turn his head away from a circus parade followed by a steam calliope.\" When Roosevelt could not get Congress to act, he often went ahead on his own. When he wanted to send a fleet around the world and Congress would not vote fimds, he pointed out that as commander in chief he had the power to order the fleet anywhere on the globe. If Con- gress wanted to get it back home, it would have to appropriate the money. When the Senate re- fused to ratify a treaty with the Dominican Republic, Roosevelt simply continued the ar- rangement as an \"executive agreement.\" Al- though unable to persuade Congress to pass legislation to put trusts under new controls, Roosevelt made a name for himself as \"Teddy the Trust Buster\" by reviving and enforcing the Sherman Act. Prestige and Politics ^^'hen existing powers of the presidency were inadequate, Roosevelt often achieved his ends by using the great prestige of the oflSce. He forced a settlement of the great coal strike of 1902 by persuading miners and owners to arbitrate their differences. He had no legal right to intervene in the strike, but neither owners nor workers could ultimately refuse to heed the President's plea that the pubhc welfare de- manded a settlement. To promote cooperation between the federal government and the states in the field of conservation, Roose\\'elt called a Conference of Governors at the \\\\'hite House in 1908. The governors were under no compul- sion to come, but few persons turn down a presidential invitation, so the governors of all the states either came themselves or sent repre- sentatives. Roosevelt owed much of his power to his mastery of practical politics. In the opinion of Grover Cleveland, he was \"the most perfectly equipped and the most effective politician thus far seen in the presidency.\" He did not make Cleveland's mistake of breaking mth his party followers. Although sometimes he pushed legis- lation through Congress by enlisting public opinion, at other times he achieved his ends by personal conferences or logrolling. While he promoted civil service reform, he also consulted"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"Theodore Roosevelt and Foreign Affairs 493 party leaders about many appointments and used patronage to promote both his own pobti- cal fortunes and measures he favored. Finally, Roosevelt could rightly ascribe his eflFectiveness and his immense popularity to the fact that he was doing his best to promote \"the common welfare of all our people.\" His great activity sometimes produced small results, and he sometimes seemed to be charging up the wrong hill, but Teddy won the people's love because they felt he was fighting on their side. Roosevelt and Foreign Affairs Although not a trained diplomat, Roosevelt had more knowledge of the outside world than any President since John Quincy Adams. He had crossed the Atlantic several times, spoke French and German, and was informed about foreign countries and their politics. He had nimierous acquaintances and friends abroad. Above all, Roosevelt had what he called 'large ideas\" about the position of the United States in the world. He was resolved that the United The Battle of Santiago de Cuba saw the end of Spanish naval power in the Americas.

His actions were sometimes impul- sive, sometimes unwise, but he firmly believed that power imposed responsibility. In the West- em Hemisphere, he enlarged the scope of the Monroe Doctrine and secured United States domination of the Caribbean. In the Pacific and Far East, he attempted to keep a balance of power and restrain first Russian, then Japanese, ambitions. He was the first President to interest himself in the peace of Europe. THE \"BIG STICK\" IN THE CARIBBEAN One of Roosevelt's mottoes in foreign policy was, \"Speak softly and carry a big stick.\" The Big Stick was most in evidence in the Carib- bean. The acquisition of Puerto Rico and the establishment of a protectorate over Cuba gave the United States new interest in this region. The Spanish-American War revealed the need for a canal through Panama or Nicaragua to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. As Alfred Mahan had foreseen, the building of an isthmian canal would change the Caribbean from\\a \"comparatively deserted nook of the oceanV to one of great strategic importance. Seconq Venezuelan Affair, 1902 Roosevelt, like Cleveland, defended Vene- zuela from possible European aggression and strengthened the Monroe Doctrine in doing so. ( See p. 463. ) In 1901 Venezuela owed money to citizens of several European countries, and Cipriajio Castro, the dictator-president, refused either' to pay the debts or submit them to arbitration. Roosevelt had fittle sympathy for Castro. In his annual message of 1901, the President said the Monroe Doctrine did not protect American nations against punishment for misbehavior, but only against loss of terri- tory. Acting on this, Great Britain and Germany, the two principal creditors, blockaded Vene- zuelan ports in an effort to force payment. This action had been taken after consultation with the State Department, and there was no threat of annexing territory. Nevertheless, the blockade became intensely unpopular in the United States, because the Monroe Doctrine seemed in danger of violation. Feeling was intensified when Venezuelan gunboats were sunk and Venezuelan ports bombarded. The pubhc re- action prompted Roosevelt to urge an end of the blockade and the submission of the dispute to arbitration. Great Britain was quicker to heed the President's warning than Germany. Roose- velt's personal letters reveal that he distrusted the rising German empire, which had the best army in the world and was building a modem navy. The saber rattling utterances of Kaiser (Emperor) Wilfiam II made German pohcy ap- pear more bellicose than it was in fact, and Roosevelt had written his friend Senator Lodge that the Germans might take some step in the West Indies or South America \"which will make us either put up or shut up on the Monroe Doctrine.\" Several years later, Roosevelt told a pictur- esque story of how he had deUvered an ulti- matum to the German government in regard to Venezuela: either the emperor accepted arbitra- tion at once or an American fleet under Admiral Dewey would attack the German blockading force. Later research fails to support this dramatic account, which has been called \"a product of the Rough Rider's imagination rather than his memory,\" but apparently Roosevelt did dehver some kind of informal waming. In any case, both the British and the Germans with- drew their fleets.

This so-called Drago Doctrine posed a problem for the United States. If the United States opposed Drago and allowed foreign nations to blockade the coasts and bombard the cities of defaulting Latin- American nations, the door was left ajar to further aggression. If the United States followed Drago and forbade forcible collection of debts, it might be pushed into defending financial dis- honesty. The United States' reply to the Drago Doctrine was the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. Whenever, said the President in 1904, an American republic was guilty of \"chronic wrongdoing,\" the United States might have to assume an \"international police power.\" To put the Corollary in another way: if the United States forbade European nations the right to collect debts by force, it might have to intervene itself. The Roosevelt Corollary was first appHed in the Dominican Republic. The country was in debt to both European and American creditors, but governmental inefficiency and corruption prevented payment. In 1905, the United States took over the collection of Dominican customs, paying 45 per cent of the proceeds to the"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"496 New Horizons Dominican government and 55 per cent to foreign bondholders. In answer to the charge of imperiahsm, Roosevelt formally renounced aggressive designs on the island republic. The United States had no more desire for Dominican territory, he remarked, than \"a gorged boa con- strictor might have to swallow a porcupine wrong-end-to.\" According to the Piatt Amendment (pp. 483- 484), the United States already had the right to intervene in Cuba in order to protect that comi- try from foreign aggression or to preserve life, liberty, and property. In 1906 bitter party rivalry in Cuba threatened to erupt into civil war. In contrast to his attitude in 1898, Roose- velt had little wish to get involved, but was persuaded to intervene by the threat of anarchy. He established a provisional government under William Howard Taft, with American troops to back him, but urged that interference with Cuban rights of self-government be as gentle as possible. After re-establishing order, the United States withdrew early in 1909. The Panama Canal Zone, 1903 Roosevelt's most dramatic and debated action in the Caribbean was his acquisition of the Panama Canal Zone in 1903. The United Gorgas Defeats the Mosquito Even though they hired Ferdinand de Lesseps, the great engineer of Suez, the French failed to dig a canal across the Isthmus of Panama. Yellow fever and malaria made it impossible. The Americans had learned a lesson. One of the first major assignments went to William C. Gorgas, who was named chief sanitary officer in 1904. He had taken part in the successful Havana battle against yellow fever waged by Carlos Finlay and Walter Reed (see p. 483). Gorgas fought inertia, bureaucratic inefficiency, and confused control among his superiors for three years. Not until 1907 did he get the full support he needed, when George W. Goethals became chief engineer of the entire Panama Canal project. With Goethals' help. Dr. Gorgas provided a complete health program for a great community of workers, nearly all of whom had to acclimate themselves to the foods, habits, and insect threats of the tropics. Immune himself to yellow fever because he had once had it in Texas, Gorgas threw himself into a fight against three diseases: the plague, yellow fever, and malaria. With quarantine, fumigation, and extermination of rats and fleas, he defeated the plague. He attacked yellow fever and malaria with a war on mosquitoes. All buildings, houses, and tents were screened. Stricken patients were segregated. Cities, villages, and farms were cleaned up; streets were paved, sewage systems installed, and drinking-water cisterns covered. All standing water, whether in swamps or gutters, was sprayed with an oil containing carbolic acid, resin, and alkali. The statistics tell of Gorgas' victory. In 1906, 82.1 per cent of all employees in the Canal Zone were hospitalized for malaria at some time during the year. By 1913, the percentage had dropped to 7.6. The lesson taught by Finlay and Reed had been welHearned. (Theme 7, p. xil)"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"Theodore Roosevelt and Foreign Affairs 497 States and Great Britain had become interested in an isthmian canal in the mid-nineteenth cen- tury, as shown by the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty (see pp. 334-335). No move was made to dig a canal, however, until the 1880's, when a French company made a vain and costly effort to cut through Panama. Early in the 1890's, an Ameri- can company started to dig a canal through Nicaragua, but they soon abandoned the attempt. An incident in the Spanish-American War made Americans aware of the strategic need for a canal for shuttling warships between the At- lantic and Pacific. The battleship Oregon, ordered from Puget Sound to Cuban waters, was forced to steam 14,000 miles around Cape Horn —three times as far as if there had been a short- cut. If an isthmian canal were to be useful to the American navy, the United States would have to fortify it, but the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty stood in the way. In 1901 the British government agreed to the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty whereby the United States might build, control, and fortify a canal, so long as ships of all nations were charged equal tolls. Immediately, Secretary of State John Hay negotiated a treaty with Colombia for a canal through the Isthmus of Panama. The resulting Hay-Herran Treaty provided for the lease of a zone six miles wide at the cost of a down pay- ment of $10,000,000 and rent of $250,000 a year. In August 1903, however, the Colombian Senate unanimously refused to ratify this agree- ment. The Colombians argued with justification that the payment offered them was too small, since the bankrupt French canal company was to receive $40,000,000 for a temporary lease and some rusting machinery. Roosevelt was furious at what he called an attempt by \"ineflBcient bandits\" to extort money from the United States. He even considered seizing Panama without a treaty, but that proved unnecessary. On November 3, 1903, a revolution (financed by agents of the French canal com- pany) broke out on the isthmus, and an inde- pendent Republic of Panama was proclaimed. The United States cruiser Nashville, which had appeared on the scene the previous day, aided the revolutionaries. On November 6 the United States recognized Panamanian independence. Less than two weeks later the United States and Panama signed the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty, which was similar to the previous Hay- Herran Treaty except that in the new treaty the Canal Zone was enlarged. Roosevelt defended his Big Stick diplomacy in Panama on the ground that he advanced \"the needs of collective civilization\" by hastening the building of an inter-ocean canal. But he also said on one occa- QUESTION • If the Canal sion, \"I took the had been dug across Nica- canal zone and let ragua instead of Panama, Congress debate.\" what would be the differ- His action was ence today? quite widely con- demned in the United States as a piece of unjustifiable aggres- sion. In Latin America it aroused dislike and distrust of the \"Colossus of the North.\" There was no reason to insist on the Panama route in any case, since it would have been possible to cut a sea-level canal through Nicaragua that would have provided a shorter route between the Atlantic and Pacific ports of the United States. Building the Canal: Goethals and Gorgas Once the Canal Zone was acquired, Roose- velt was determined, as he expressed it, \"to make the dirt fly.\" The engineering difficulties involved in cutting through the Isthmus of Panama were enormous, and the public health problem even greater. In 1885 an Englishman wrote of Panama: \"In all the world there is not perhaps now con- centrated in any single spot so much foul disease."},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"498 New Horizons such . . . physical and moral abomination. The Isthmus is a damp, tropical jungle, intensely hot, swarming with mosquitoes . . . the home, even as Nature made it, of yellow fever, typhus, and dysentery.\" Roosevelt eventually put the digging of the canal under the direction of George W. Goe- thals, a colonel in the Corps of Engineers, and the direction of public health under the same Dr. Gorgas who had cleaned up Havana. Both men succeeded brilUantly. The canal was com- pleted in 1914, by which time Gorgas had made the Canal Zone one of the most healthful places in the world. In the United States at that time the death rate was 14.1 per thousand; in the Canal Zone, the rate was 6 per thousand. \"Dollar Diplomacy\" Roosevelt's successor. President William Howard Taft (1909-1913), continued his policies, but with a shift of emphasis. Taft's Secretary of State, Philander C. Knox, was in- terested in active promotion of American busi- ness interests abroad, with the slogan, \"Every diplomat a salesman.\" In Latin America this so-called \"dollar diplomacy\" resulted in in- creased promotion of United States manufac- tures (including warships), and in active efforts to increase the investments of American finan- ciers in the area. In furtherance of this policy the United States intervened in Nicaragua in 1911 to put in a government acceptable to the United States, to force it to accept a loan from New York bankers, and to put the customs oflBce under a former United States colonel. Kno.x declared that the United States did not co\\et an inch of territory south of the Rio Grande and wished only to exercise \"a measure of benevolent supervision over Latin American countries.\" But the economic imperialism and armed intervention that he fostered increased the unpopularity of the United States in Latin America. BALANCE OF POWER IN THE FAR EAST Roosevelt's most perplexing problems in for- eign affairs concerned the Far East, an area out of reach of the Big Stick. In the Caribbean his diplomacy was supported by overwhelming force, but the position of the United States in the Far East was weak. Roosevelt called the Philippines the \"Achilles heel\" of American defense; they were easily vulnerable to attack by Japan. In China, the United States lacked sufficient military power to back up the policies set forth in Hay's Open Door notes of 1899 and 1900. The only real defense of equal trading opportunities in China or of Chinese integrity lay in keeping a \"balance of power\" between the nations with territorial ambitions in the Far East. \"The Open Door Policy,\" wrote Roosevelt, \"completely disappears as soon as a powerful nation determines to disregard it, and is willing to run the risk of war rather than forego its intention.\" The Russo-Japanese War, 1904-1905 China's t\\vo closest neighbors were especially threatening. The Japanese, already in possession of the string of islands off China's north coast, thought it their manifest destiny to e.xpand on the Asian mainland. They estabhshed a protectorate over the independent kingdom of Korea and had designs on the rich Chinese province of Manchuria. Russia was already established in Manchuria, with a leasehold at Port Arthur and control over Manchurian rail- roads. The Russians also hoped to move into Korea. (See map, p. 46-5.) This clash of interests led to the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. In this contest American opinion was at first over- whelmingly pro-Japanese. The czarist govern- ment was unpopular here because of its tyranny and persecution of subject peoples. America regarded the Japanese with an almost paternal air because of Commodore Perry's exploits, and"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"Theodore Roosevelt and Foreign Affairs 499 it admired their rapid westernization. Roosevelt himself thought a Japanese victory would keep the balance of power in the Orient. \"Japan,\" he wrote his son, \"is playing our game.\" To the astonishment of the world, Japan won overwhelming victories over Russia both on land and sea. By the summer of 1905 both countries were ready to make peace, Japan because she was nearing the end of her resources, Russia because of fear of revolution at home. Neither country wished to approach the other directly, but the Japanese secretly asked Roosevelt if he would serve as go-between. After consulting the czar, Roosevelt formally ofiFered to help the warring nations make peace. They accepted the President's proposals, and sent diplomats to a peace conference which met at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in August 1905. Roosevelt, as he expressed it, had brought the horses to water, but was not sure he could make them drink. Although not present at the peace table, the President indirectly affected the negotiations by persuading the powers to withdraw extreme demands. He induced Japan to give up claims for a money indemnity and Russia to give up the southern half of the island of Sakhalin. By the Treaty of Portsmouth, Japan also took over Russian interests in south- em Manchuria. Difficulties with Japan Although Roosevelt won a personal triumph and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his success in bringing hostilities to an end, the Treaty of Portsmouth had unhappy results. By siding with the Russians on the indemnity question, he caused such ill feeling in Japan that anti-American riots broke out in Tokyo and the American embassy had to be guarded with troops. The ease of the Japanese victory caused fear in America and Europe that the \"white race\" would be overwhelmed by the \"yellow race\"; this notion of the \"yellow peril\" was played up by the yellow press. On the Pacific Coast, feeling began to rise against Japanese immigration, resulting in discrimina- tion against Japanese children in the pubUc schools. Japan regarded this as an insult. More significant than the tide of ill will, which sub- sided, was the fact that the recent war altered the balance of power in the Orient. Now it was no longer Russian expansion that was most to be feared, but Japanese. Roosevelt himself feared that there was serious danger of war. In a rather complicated series of maneuvers, Roosevelt attempted at the same time to soothe Japanese anger, satisfy Japanese ambition, save the Philippines from Japanese aggression, and show the Japa- nese that he was QUESTION .

Japan in turn agreed to halt the emigra- tion of laborers to America. This compromise, arranged in 1907 and 1908, was known as the Gentlemen's Agreement. Regarding the balance of power in the Far East, Roosevelt attempted to avert danger of Japanese expansion toward the Philippines by agreeing to recognize the predominant position of Japan in Korea and Manchuria. At least this is what seems to be the substance of two rather vaguely worded executive agreements, the Taft- Katsura \"agreed memorandum\" of 1905, and the Root-Takahira Agreement of 1908. At the same time, in a truly Rooseveltian gesture, the Presi- dent attempted to impress Japan with American naval power by sending an American fleet to Tokyo during its journey around the world in 1908."},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"^ €gM"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"Theodore Roosevelt and Foreign Affairs 501 international conference on Morocco; the em- peror even agreed in advance to accept what- ever solution Roosevelt thought fair. Roosevelt vi'as hesitant to break a precedent going back to George Washington's time in order to engage in diplomacy that dealt with a purely European aflFair. He decided, howe\\'er, that as a great power the United States had an interest in pre- serving the peace so long as it did not involve commitment to the use of military power. At the resulting Algeciras Conference of 1906, the United States, represented by the able diplomat Henry White, proposed an arrange- ment which was agreed upon by the powers gnd which possibly averted war. Although the Sen- ate ratified the Algeciras agreement regarding Morocco, it expressed distrust of Roosevelt's ra- ther risky involvement in European politics. The senators passed a resolution saying that ratifica- tion was \"without purpose to depart from the traditional American foreign poHcy which for- bids participation by the United States in the settlement of poUtical questions which are en- tirely European. . . .\" International Arbitration In spite of his reputation for belligerency, Roosevelt supported arbitration as a peaceful means of settUng international controversies. In- ternational conferences in 1899 and 1907 at The Hague in the Netherlands established a permanent arbitration court and defined the means whereby nations could appeal to it to settle disputes. The United States, which had previously arbitrated more questions than any other nation except Great Britain, was ably represented at both Hague Conferences. During Roosevelt's presidency, two disputes with Can- ada, one over the Alaskan boundary and the other over .\\merican fishing rights at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River, were successfully submitted to arbitration. In the Alaskan matter, however, the President aroused Canadian ill will by making it clear that he would accept no judgment that did not coincide with the claims of the United States, and by appointing as United States representatives to the arbitration commission two noted expansionists, one of whom had often proposed that Canada be an- nexed. In 1908 Secretary of State EHhu Root negoti- ated treaties with twenty-five nations whereby both sides agreed in advance to arbitrate dis- putes. These agreements were less important than they might have been because either na- tion could refuse the way of peace if it thought its vital interests, independence, or honor were involved. The Senate also insisted, over Roose- velt's protest, that it must agree in advance whether or not a dispute should be referred to arbitration. Improvement of the Army and Navy Military affairs were one of Roosevelt's main interests; one of his friends called him \"a per- petual volunteer.\" Roosevelt argued that diplo- macy, even with peaceful purpose, had to be backed by force. On no matter did he press Con- gress harder than in demanding appropriations for annual additions to our fleet, and he per- sonally directed how the money was spent. Learning that the gunnery methods of the navy were obsolete, he saw to it that the whole sys- tem of training was changed. He later claimed that, gun for gun, the fleet was three times as eflBcient when he left office as when he came in. There appeared to be less reason to enlarge the army than the navy. It was reduced in size by a quarter between 1901 and 1909, but its eflBciency was greatly increased. Elihu Root, who served both McKinley and Roosevelt as Secretar}- of War, was among the ablest cabinet members in the history of the United States. Under his leadership many weaknesses revealed in the Spanish-American War were removed. Root centralized authority, improved promo-"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"502 New Horizons tions, and tried to arrange for better army-navy cooperation. He introduced the General Staff for over-all planning and the Army War College to provide officers with further training. Newton D. Baker, Secretary of War in World War I, called Root the best Secretary of War in Amer- ican history, and said that without his work \"the participation of the United States in the World War would necessarily have been a con- fused, ineffective and discreditable episode.\" A Better Foreign Service Throughout his pobtical career, Roosevelt had favored civil service reform, and as Presi- dent he greatly advanced the efficiency of the executive department. He was especially inter- ested in improving the diplomatic corps. Dur- ing the long period of nineteenth century isola- tion, the State Department had become a happy hunting ground of the spoilsmen. Diplomatic posts were given as a reward for party service, and wholesale removals followed every change of party fortunes. The foreign service was in such low repute that in 1889 the New York Sun- suggested it be abolished. But when foreign af- fairs assumed increasing importance, the United States could not afford such an inefficient system. On the death of John Hay in 1905, Roosevelt appointed Elihu Root Secretary of State, and Root attempted to improve the efficiency of the State Department as he had improved that of the army. Root had to fight an attitude toward the foreign service that was reflected in a letter he received from a friend: \"If there are any nice berths like the Consulate at Bordeau.x, France, or at Buenos Aires lying around loose, I might make application for one. I need a rest.\" Work- ing in cooperation, Roosevelt and Root pro- vided that future appointments to the lower ranks of the diplomatic service be based on ex- aminations set by the Civil Service Commission. Regular promotion was established. Although salaries were low, and the top posts were still under the spoils system, the groundwork was laid for a professional, nonpolitical foreign service. Roosevelt's unprecedented and sometimes highhanded actions in the fields of foreign rela- tions have often been criticized. Nevertheless, as Walter Lippmann wrote, Roosevelt \"grasped the elements of a genuine foreign policy.\" He tried to make American military power and foreign service adequate for its position in the world, and used diplomacy to advance peace and discourage aggression.

WOODROW WILSON. 1912 Theodore Roosevelt's entrance into the pres- idential office roughly coincided with the beginning of a ferment of reform known as progressivism, or the progressive movement. We will defer until the next chapter an attempt to define this development in detail. Suffice it for now to explain that progressivism operated at both the local and the national level, and that —like Populism— it proposed government con- trol of business in the public interest. Two Presidents were outstanding progressive lead- ers: Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. ROOSEVELT'S DOMESTIC POLICIES When Roosevelt was imder consideration as Repubhcan candidate for Vice-President in 1900, Mark Hanna warned that there was only one life between \"that cowboy\" and the White House. McKinley's death made the cowboy President, and there was fear in conservative business circles as to how he would behave. Roosevelt began to fulfill their worst expecta- tions in his first message to Congress. He urged federal legislation to deal with the \"tremendous and highly complex industrial developments which went on with ever accelerated rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenth cen- tury.\" In a speaking tour in 1902, he said that he stood for such regulation of business as would insure a \"square deal\" for capital, labor, and the public at large. Roosevelt thought that the Re- publican party must move with the times or popular feebng would destroy it, as it destroyed 504"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"^%>tx^ The Square Deal and the New Freedom 505 the Whig party in the 1850's. He argued that the only way to preserve the capitahst system, with which he had no fundamental quarrel, was the way of \"conservative reform.\" For a time, however, Roosevelt pursued a rather cautious course. He had promised \"to continue absolutely unbroken the policy of President McKinley,\" and he was warned by Mark Hanna to \"go slow.\" As \"President by accident\" he felt he had no call to push a gen- eral program of reform. But even before being elected President in his own right, Roosevelt showed his hand by attempting to enforce the Sherman Antitrust Act and by intervening in the coal strike of 1902. The Trust Buster Roosevelt was disturbed by the power of \"the mighty industrial overlords\" and their im- munity from government control. As we have seen (see p. 432), the Sherman Antitrust Law was a dead letter. A period of rapid concentra- tion of industry reached a climax with the formation of the United States Steel Corpora- tion in 1901. This vast holding company was formed when a syndicate of bankers, headed by J. Pierpont Morgan, bought out Andrew Carnegie at a price of $250 million and then combined the Carnegie iron and steel proper- ties with others they controlled. Capitalized at nearly one and a half billion dollars, United States Steel controlled more than half the steel production of the United States and was by far the biggest industrial combination the world had ever seen. The American public was ap- palled by the size of the new venture and by the power that it put in the hands of one man. \"Mr. Dooley\" e.xpressed the attitude of the times when he described Morgan's ordering an office boy to take some change out of the cash register and run over and buy Europe for him. Roosevelt was not opposed to big business as such, since he thought it was an inevitable de- velopment, but he wanted to put it under law. He repeatedly urged Congress to pass laws reg- ulating trusts more strictly. He favored legisla- tion, for instance, that would require full disclosure of corporate financing, with a view especially to preventing stock watering. In response to his pleading, Congress did establish a Department of Commerce and Labor in 1903, but with little power, and an Expedition Act to give precedence in the courts to cases involving the Interstate Commerce Act or the Sherman Antitrust Act; but that was all. Roosevelt made a reputation as a trust buster by reviving the Sherman Act. In 1902 his attor- ney general brought suit to dissolve the North- em Securities Corporation, a holding company (see chart, p. 584) formed by railroad magnates and bankers (including J. Pierpont Morgan) to control the three railroad systems of the Northwest. In 1904 the Supreme Court decided that the Northern Securities Corporation vio- lated the Sherman Act and ordered it dissolved. After this success the Department of Justice started more trust-busting suits against corpora- tions than had been brought under the three previous Presidents. In most of these cases the government won. Although trust busting was popular with the pubhc, Roosevelt himself recognized that it was not a particularly effec- tive means of regulating business. It did not prevent monopolies, but only attempted to break them up after they had already been formed. The President was actually less in- terested in the economic effects of enforcing anti-monopoly laws than in the symbolic effect of making even the most powerful businessmen publicly obey the law. The Coal Strike of 1902 One of the most prolonged strikes in Ameri- can history started iii May 1902, when nearly 150,000 men walked out of the anthracite mines of eastern Pennsylvania. The strikers had such"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"506 New Horizons real grievances that public opinion tended to be on their side. Wages were low and layoffs frequent; average earnings were less than $300 per year. Living in cheaply built company towns, the miners were obliged to trade at com- pany stores that charged high prices. They had been organized into an industrial union, the United Mine Workers, by John Mitchell, who had started work in the mines as a boy of twelve. Opposed to revolutionary violence, Mitchell had worked with Mark Hanna, Samuel Gompers, and Grover Cleveland to found the National Civic Federation, an organization devoted to promoting peaceful labor relations. In the strike of 1902, Mitchell offered to submit to two prominent clergymen and a third man of their choice the question of whether the miners' wages were \"suflBcient to enable them to hve, maintain and educate their famihes in a manner conformable to estabhshed American standards and consistent with American citizen- ship.\" The coal operators hurt their case by extreme unwillingness even to discuss the miners' de- mands. George F. Baer, principal spokesman for the employers, answered Mitchell's sugges- tion that religious leaders decide miners' wages by pointing out that \"anthracite mining is a business and not a religious, sentimental or academic proposition.\" Since the operators held such an attitude and the miners were almost 100 per cent behind Mitchell, the strike dragged on with no prospect of settlement. By October the retail price of anthracite had risen from $5 John Mitchell, Miner Most labor leaders come up through the ranks, bringing to their office firsthand l<nowledge of worl< in mines and factories. Modern leaders have the help of staffs of technical advisers, economists, and statisticians. Unseen, but sitting with the union group at every bargaining session, is the history of labor's defeats: strikes lost through violence and by court injunction, families starving, men killed by lack of safety measures. John Mitchell took this history with him to the White House in 1902. Against him were all the well-organized anthracite-mine operators. Their mines were located in a small area in Pennsylvania. Relatively few, they had been able to set up agreements on quotas of coal to be mined by each, on wages to be paid, and on prices to be charged the public. Their cozy arrangement benefited from the monopoly on coal transportation maintained by a half-dozen railroads, which also owned coal lands in the area. They believed, as one of them said: \"The rights of laboring men would be protected, not by agitators, but by the Christian men to whom God in His infinite wisdom had given control of the property interests in this country.\" To such a man, a coal mine was property. To John Mitchell, coal mining was a way of life. He knew the mines. Tall, brawny from backbreaking work with pick and shovel, Mitchell had developed patience. His self-control could resist bitter provocation. Of the angry scene in the White House, President Roosevelt said: \"There was only one man who behaved like a gentleman, and it wasn't I..\" (Theme 3, see p. xii)"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"to $30 a ton. With the threat of a coal famine during the winter months, the public interest demanded that the strike be ended. Appeals for action poured in to the President. Roosevelt had no power, either by law or by precedent, for forcing the operators and miners to come to an agreement, but he resolved to use the influence of his oflBce to the full. As he later wrote his sister, I could no mbre see misery and death come to the great masses of the people in our large cities and sit by idly, because under ordinary conditions, a strike is not a subject of interference by the Presi- dent, than I could sit by idly and see one man kill another without interference because there is no statutory duty imposed upon the President to inter- fere in such cases. On October 1, Roosevelt invited representa- tives of the operators to meet Mitchell at the White House. In a stormy session nothing was accomplished, but pubhc opinion turned even more against the employers, who called Mitchell an \"outlaw\" and denounced the President for not using the Sherman Antitrust Act against the union. At this point, Roosevelt considered a questionably legal seizure of the mines by federal troops. Before he took such drastic action, a compromise was reached. Elihu Root, the President's representative, and J. Pierpont Morgan, whose banking firm indirectly con- trolled most of the anthracite mines, held a conference. After it, Morgan put enough pres- sure on the operators to force them to back down. Morgan's action was apparently prompted by the fear that the unreasonable- ness of the coal operators, added to the sufferings of a coal-less win- ter, would create popular hostility to business in general. The operators finally QUESTION • What should be the powers of govern- ment in labor-management disputes where the public interest is affected?

Roosevelt's action in using the prestige of his office and his personal influence on Morgan to settle the strike was recognized in this country and abroad as an important precedent. The London Times commented that \"the President has done a very big and entirely new thing. We are witnessing not merely the ending of the coal strike, but the definite entry of a powerful government on a novel sphere of operation.\" Roosevelt Re-elected, 1904 As the presidential election of 1904 ap- proached, the conservative \"Old Guard\" of the Republican party was unhappy at the prospect of four more years of the Rough Rider in the White House.

Meanwhile the Democrats turned a somer- sault. They cast Bryan aside and angled for conservative votes by nominating Alton B. Parker, a wealthy New York judge. Parker had no popular following, and antagonized former Bryan followers by defending the gold standard. Roosevelt won by the largest margin since the Civil War.

Although failing to pass the more severe antitrust law which Roosevelt demanded, Congress in 1906 enacted the Hep- bum Act which provided stricter control of raiboads. Popular demand for more efifective regulation than that provided by the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 was almost universal. William Allen White expressed prevailing senti- ment in a letter to a railroad oflBcial: \"The rail- roads cannot name senators,, pack state conven- tions, run legislatures and boss politics generally . . . and then successfully maintain that they are private carriers doing a private business.\" Some prominent men, including Bryan, proposed that the railroads be owned and operated by the government. Thinking such a step would lead to far-reaching disaster, Roosevelt urged tighter regulation as an alternative. In 1905 the House of Representatives, by a vote of 346 to 7, passed a bill going beyond the President's recommendations. The Senate, how- ever, was dominated by a cUque of wealthy men who were frankly the representatives of the great corporations. On the other hand, Roose- velt also had allies in the Senate, of whom the most well-knovvTi was Robert La Follette, a former reform governor of Wisconsin. Many Democrats, under the leadership of \"Pitchfork Ben\" Tillman, a former \"Popocrat\" (see p. 458), also favored stricter railroad regulation. As a result of popular support, clever politics, and wilUngness to compromise, Roosevelt was able to push the Hepburn bill through the Senate 18 months after he urged Congress to act. The Hepburn Act strengthened the Inter- state Commerce Act of 1887 in several ways. It aboUshed the \"free pass,\" which railroads granted to politicians and other influential peo- ple such as newspaper editors. It widened the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Com- mission to include express companies, pipe lines, ferries, and sleeping-car companies. Railroad corporations were restrained from operating other businesses (such as coal mining). Most important of all, the Interstate Commerce Com- mission was granted power to fix rates, although its decisions might be appealed to the courts. Complaints to the commission soon multiplied fort>' times and a great many rates were low- ered. In 1906, at Roosevelt's urging. Congress passed two laws that protected consumers— the Pure Food and Drug Act and an act providing for federal inspection of meat. The public agi- tation that was behind this legislation will be described in the next chapter (see p. 533). Where Roosevelt Failed to Act In spite of such laws, the legislative achieve- ment of Congress under Roosevelt's leadership was so unimpressive that he was accused of pro- ducing \"more noise than accompHshment.\" Al- though he favored revision of the tariff, he regarded the issue as \"political dynamite.\" He never tried to force action on it, although he occasionally threatened to bring it up unless congressional leaders would agree to support legislative measures in which he had a special interest. With little knowledge of money and banking, Roosevelt never seriously supported long-overdue efforts to make the banking sys- tem more stable and the currency system more flexible. One reason for the failure to produce much- needed reform legislation was Roosevelt's feel- ing that pohtics was \"the art of the possible.\" His philosophy of reform was one of gradual- ism; he was willing to accept half a loaf if he could not get the whole. Furthermore, the Re- publican leaders in Congress, carry-overs from"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"510 New Horizons the McKinley-Hanna period, were unsympa- thetic to progressive legislation. The President could persuade them to act only when he had overwhelming public opinion behind him. Although Roosevelt accomplished less than he seemed to promise, he restored the people's faith in the power of the federal government to serve their interests. By preaching the Square Deal, he promoted the idea that the cure for the evils of unrestrained indi\\idualism was not so- cialism, but moderate reform. Above all, he cre- ated a demand for reform. According to a recent historian, \"Roosevelt was the best publicity man progressi\\ism ever had.\" Roosevelt and Conservation \\o cause was nearer Roosevelt's heart than the effort to conserve natiu-al resources. Perhaps his earliest and deepest enthusiasm was for the wilderness. The former national policy, based on the idea that natural resources were inex- haustible, had resulted in colossal waste. For- ests had been cut without thought of erosion or future timber needs; cattlemen and sheep- herders had been allowed to overgraze grass- lands; homesteaders had plowed land that should have remained in grass. \\\\'ild life had suffered from such slaughter as wiped out the buffalo herds and the passenger pigeon. Existing laws designed to preserve the pub- lic lands, forests, and mineral deposits were usu- ally not strictly enforced. Nevertheless, a policy of conservation instead of exploitation had be- gun long before Roosevelt took office. It can be seen in such measures as the establishment of Yellowstone Park in 1872 and in the act passed during Benjamin Harrison's administration giv- ing the President power to withdraw lands from sale and make them National Forests. But no one did as much for conservation as Roosevelt. He encouraged legislation such as the Newlands Act of 1902 which provided for federal aid to irrigation projects. He enforced laws against illegal occupation of public lands. He more than tripled the area of the National Forests, and his able chief forester, Gifford Pinchot, saw that they were honestly and efficiently administered. Above all, Roosevelt made conservation pop- ular. He stimulated interest by his writings, by his vacations in the West, by his constant de- mand for better conservation laws, and by will- ingness to use the power and prestige of the presidential office. When Congress blocked his efforts, Roosevelt enlisted private individuals and promoted state action. In May 1908, he called a national con- ference on conservation at the \\\\'hite House. It included the governors of all states or their rep- resentatives, government foresters, congressmen (including some who opposed the President), and the officers of private associations of nat- uralists and sportsmen. Results of this confer- ence included the creation of over forty state conservation commissions and of a National Conservation Commission which prepared an inventory of the natutral resources of the United States. Just before leaving office Roosevelt held a North American Conservation Conference, and he even contemplated a world conference. Sen- ator La FoUette, often critical of Roosevelt, paid tribute to the \"high statesmanship\" the President showed in \"dinning into the Nation\" the idea of conservation. La Follette predicted that future historians would say that Roosevelt's greatest achievement was not the Square Deal, but his leadership in the movement to preserve natural resources for the benefit of the people at large. The Election of 1908 Like Andrew Jackson (see p. 270), Roosevelt named his successor: His choice fell upon his intimate friend \\\\'illiam Howard Taft, who had a distinguished public career as a federal judge, governor of the Philippines, and Secretary of War. With his control of the party machinery"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"The Square Deal and the New Freedom 511 and his mastery of publicity, Roosevelt easily headed off other candidates and arranged for Taft to receive the Republican nomination in 1908. The Democrats, who had fared badly in 1904 with the conservative Parker, went back to Bryan. The Nebraskan made little headway against the man who had Roosevelt's endorse- ment; he ruefully complained that the Square Deal had stolen his thunder. Taft had little diffi- culty in winning, although he did not defeat Bry- an as decisively as Roosevelt had beaten Parker. TAFT IN OFFICE, 1909-1913 While Roosevelt set off for a year's hunting trip in Africa, Taft called a special session of Congress to deal with the tariff. This was an issue Roosevelt had avoided, but the Republi- can platform of 1908 had pledged \"revision\" of the tariff, and Taft said that this meant revi- sion downwards. Since passage of the Dingley Tariff of 1897, prices had advanced more rap- idly than wages, and the resulting \"HCL\" ( high cost of living ) was blamed on unduly high rates. There was a common idea, shared by Taft, that high rates encouraged monopoly and increased the profits of monopolistic trusts. The Payne- Aldrich Tariff, 1909 Congress met in March 1909, and within less than a month the House of Representatives passed a measure providing for substantial re- ductions in the tariff, without abandoning the principle of protection. Twice before, in 1888 and 1894, the Senate had killed attempts to lower the tariff, and in 1909 it did it again. Under the leadership of Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, over 600 amendments were tacked on to the House bill. Many of these amendments contained jokers designed to conceal higher rates, such as changing a duty on certain small articles from so much \"per hundred-weight\" to so much \"per hundred.\" \"Taft has the most lovable personality,\" Roosevelt once said, \"I have ever come in contact with . . .\" But their beautiful friendship was wrecked on the realities of politics and ambition. When Aldrich attempted to railroad the amended bill through the Senate, he was met by revolt in his own party. Several Republican senators, nicknamed the \"insurgents,\" used their privilege of unlimited debate to reveal the way Aldrich and his allies carried out the demands of high-tariff lobbyists instead of the popular will. Too late, Taft attempted to persuade the Old Guard leaders to reduce the rates, but they made only slight concessions. The average level of the Payne-Aldrich TarifiF was actually higher than that of the Dingley Tariff, but Taft signed the bill. He feared a spht in his party, and"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"When he wrote this light-hearted note to his hand-picked successor, Roosevelt had little inkling of the difficulties Taft would face as President, and still less any thought that he and Taft would one day become political and personal enemies. thought the new tariff an improvement. It con- tained a corporation tax, established a tariff commission to make a scientific study of rates, and provided for some fle.idbility in rates at the discretion of the President. Taft's action, how- ever, was widely regarded as a betrayal of his campaign promise, especially in the Middle West. Taft in Difficulty Taft lost popularity still more after the BaUinger-Pinchot controversy. The Secretary of the Interior, Richard A. Ballinger, had reopened to private purchase certain waterpower sites and coal land that had been withdrawn while Roosevelt was President. His action was pro- tested by Chief Forester Pinchot, who gave his charges to the press. Ballinger was publicly accused of fraud, but Taft was convinced of his innocence (which has since been estab- hshed). When he dismissed Pinchot for insub- ordination, the President was thought an en- emy of conservation. Immediately following the Ballinger-Pinchot controversy came an outbreak of insurgent Re- publicanism in the House of Representatives; it took the form of an attack on the speaker of the House, \"Uncle Joe\" Cannon. The speaker had come to enjoy a power over legislation greater in some ways than that of the President. He appointed all committees; he decided what bills should be referred to which committees; by almost absolute control over debate he could push some measures through without discussion and see that others never reached the floor. Can- non had used these powers to hold up progres- sive legislation. He had cooperated with Aldrich to raise the tariff rates in 1909, and had long been an opponent of conservation. With the motto \"Not one cent for scenery,\" he had pre- vented the creation of National Parks and Forests. Finally, in March 1910, a coalition of Democrats and insurgents forced a change in the rules of the House that stripped the Speaker of much of his power. The attack on Caimon hurt Taft, who in order to keep party harmony had been almost forced to align himself \\\\ath the Speaker. By signing the Payne-Aldrich Tariff, supporting BaUinger against Pinchot, and backing Cannon, Taft gave the impression that he had \"sold the Square Deal down the river.\" He was described"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"^m^m^^.^^"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"514 New Horizons who had started to call themselves \"Progressive Republicans\" or simply \"Progressives.\" In a speech at Osawatomie, Kansas, during the con- gressional election of 1910, he preached what he called the \"New Nationahsm.\" In words that recalled the Populist platform of the ISQCys and foreshadowed the New Deal of the 1930's, Roosevelt said: We are face to face with new conceptions of the relations of property to human welfare. . . . The man who wrongly holds that every human right is secondary to his profit must now give way to the advocate of human welfare, who rightly maintains that ever>- man holds his property subject to the general right of the community to regulate its use to whatever degree the public welfare may require it. In the New Nationahsm speech, Roosevelt outhned a much more radical program of ac- tion than he had ever proposed as President. He favored both state and federal legislation which would actively promote hmnan welfare. Attacking the courts for declaring progressive legislation unconstitutional, he suggested that state judges be subject to recall (see p. 530), and that Supreme Court decisions be subject to reversal by popular vote. Expressing distrust of legislative bodies, he said he regarded \"the executive as the steward of human welfare.\" By taking such a stand, Roosevelt became al- most in spite of himself the natural leader of the Progressive Repubhcans. The Election of 1912 The great question in American pohtics on the eve of the election of 1912 was whether Roosevelt would run for the presidency. He had said he was out of pohtics, and this was re- enforced by his no-third-term pledge of 1904. On the other hand, he had convinced himself that Taft was unfit; and it was against his nature to sit on the side lines. Senator La Follette, a man of great ability and courage, had the sup- port of many Progressive Repubhcans, but when he suffered a temporary nervous collapse, scores of progressives beat a path to Roosevelt's door. In February 1912, on the prearranged petition of seven progressive governors, the former Pres- ident announced his candidacy. \"My hat is in the ring,\" he said, explaining that his promise not to run for a third term referred to a third consecutive term. There followed a struggle for control of the Repubhcan party that reached its climax at the national convention in June. Conservatives and most of the professional pohticians ralhed be- hind Taft. So did many former supporters of the Square Deal who thought Roosevelt too radical or who disliked his running for a third term. Except for some devoted followers of La FoUette, the Progressive Repubhcans lined up for Roosevelt. In states where convention dele- gates were chosen or instructed in primary elec- tions, Roosevelt was generally the choice of the voters. The Taft forces had the immense advantage of controlling the party machinery. Of 241 con- vention seats disputed by Taft and Roosevelt, the convention's Credentials Committee gave 233 to Taft. Elihu Root, chairman of the con- vention, kept such a tight hold on proceedings that he was accused of driving a steam roller over the Roosevelt forces. When Taft was chosen on the first ballot, Roosevelt charged the Repubhcan party leaders with stealing the nomination. He stood ready, he said, to carry on the battle for progressive principles outside the party. Formation of the Progressive Party In August a convention met in Chicago to found a new party, which took the name Pro- gressive. The delegates were a curious mixture —college professors, social workers, newspaper editors, former Rough Riders, wealthy men pricked with social conscience, and a few pro- fessional politicians who were \"getting on the"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"ELECTION OF 1912 bandwagon\" for their own purposes. The pre- vailing mood was one of exaltation; the dele- gates chanted \"Onward, Christian Soldiers\" and \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\" Senator Albert J. Beveridge, who had followed Roose- velt out of the Republican party, made the keynote address which has been compared to Bryan's Cross of Gold speech (see p. 459). He called on the new party, sprung from the grass roon, to work for a nobler America. The Pro- gressives, said Beveridge, stood for social broth- erhood as against \"savage individualism,\" for \"a representative government that represents the people,\" as against invisible government by the corrupt boss and the \"robber interest.\" The Progressive platform -demanded reforms typical of the period— more direct democracy through such means as the initiative and refer- endum; conservation of natural resources for the general welfare; woman suffrage and the pro- hibition of child labor; a revised currency sys- tem and the introduction of an inheritance tax; and protection of wage workers through safety laws, limitation of hours of labor, and work- men's compensation. The party nominated Roosevelt for the presidency. It immediately acquired a symbol when the former President announced that he felt like a \"bull moose.\" The Progressive party had ample enthusi- asm and a presidential candidate who was the most popular man in public life since Andrew Jackson. It also had abundant campaign funds, supplied by wealthy businessmen who believed that capitalism could survive only if it reformed. But the Bull Moose crusade was a forlorn hope. Most of the Progressives were amateurs with little or no knowledge of practical politics. Party machinery could not be set up in thousands of election districts overnight. All that Roose- velt accomplished by bolting his party was to turn control of the RepubUcan party over to the Old Guard and to insure the election of a Democratic President.

Although disclaim- ing any desire for a fourth nomination, Bryan was influential in seeing that the Democratic platform was as progressive as that of the BuU Moose party itself. After a protracted struggle, Woodrow Wilson, who had won national fame as a reform governor of New Jersey, was nom- inated on the 46th ballot, partly through the help of Bryan. In the ensuing campaign Taft was not active, privately expressing the opinion that Wilson was sure to win. The real battle was between Roosevelt and Wilson. Both men sup- ported progressivism, although under different labels. Wilson countered Roosevelt's New Na- tionahsm with what he called the \"New Free- dom.\" Although it was remarked that there was as much distinction between the philosophies of the two candidates as between Tweedledum and Tweedledee, they did in fact differ. The"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"Both in informal speeches, such as this one under a willow tree in New Jersey, and in more formal ad- dresses, Wilson was able to impress listeners with his sincerity and eloquence. It was said of him that although he could not establish easy communication with individuals, he could be \"confidential in a crowd.\" New Nationalism was consciously Hamiltonian in outlook. It accepted big business as a fact of life and proposed a more powerful federal government and a strong executive to keep it under control. It proposed to extend federal power in the direction of human welfare. The New Freedom was Jeffersonian in that it advo- cated use of federal power simply to insure equal opportunities, but not to provide active assistance to individuals. Roosevelt and Wilson The personal contrast between the twamen was striking. Roosevelt had long been the most prominent poUtical figure in the country. Wil- son had been in active politics only three years. Roosevelt, the former Rough Rider, was typed in the popular mind as a fighter, who called on men to enlist in a war on privilege. Wilson, the former professor, appealed to cool reason. Roosevelt enjoyed mixing with all sorts of peo- ple. Wilson was aloof; he once confessed that he would as soon slap a man in the face as slap him on the back. Someone likened Roose- velt to a great national spectacle, like Niagara Falls; people jammed the halls where he spoke, but it is not certain that they came so much to listen as to gape. While lacking his rival's per- sonal magnetism, Wilson proved a most effec- tive campaigner. On the platform his tall, angular figure displayed an ease of manner and his homely face exhibited a warmth frequently lacking in personal relations. From his early teens he had dreamed of swaying men to great purposes by the power of eloquence, and even his enemies admitted that once on his feet he"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"could be irresistibly persuasive. He somehow knew how to both touch men's conscience and appeal to their reason. An attempt to assassinate Roosevelt gave him an opportunity to demonstrate extraordinary courage and self-possession. On his way to give a speech in Milwaukee he was shot in the chest by a no-third-term fanatic. Pausing long enough to make sure that his assailant received police protection, Roosevelt insisted on delivering his speech before receiving medical attention. Not seriously wounded, he was later able to resume his vigorous campaigning. The result of the election fulfilled Taft's pre- diction.

Roosevelt's popu- larity and the great demand for reform put him ahead of Taft. Even Debs, the Socialist, polled more than a quarter as many votes as the Re- pubhcan candidate. Wilson's Previous Career Woodrow Wilson had gained national prom- inence as a foe of privilege and as a person with extraordinary powers of leadership. Dur- ing eight years as president of Princeton Uni- versity, he not only raised standards and im- proved teaching, but also fought social privi- lege as represented by snobbish undergraduate clubs. As governor of New Jersey he success- fully fought the bosses who represented special interests, not the interest of the people as a whole. Under his leadership, the New Jersey legislature enacted an elaborate program of progressive measures. The extraordinary successes gained by the \"scholar in politics\" can be explained partly by C^ / ^'Trhe Square Deal and the New Freedom 517 the fact that from boyhood he had been ambi- tious to hold high ofiBce. Not only had he trained himself in pubhc speaking, but he had also devoted much of his life to studying the tech- niques of effective political leadership. A long- time admirer of the British government, he developed the theory that the President, like the British prime minister, should take the initiative in guiding and promoting legislation. The Pres- ident alone, in his opinion, stood for the interests of the whole nation. In addition to books on government, Wilson had written a history of the United States and innumerable articles, mostly on political topics. He was well informed on domestic issues, espe- cially the tariff. A Southerner who had lived most of his Ufe in the North, a Democrat who admired Hamilton as well as Jefferson, a scholar who knew the past as well as the present, Wilson was able to see public questions in per- spective. As befitted the son and grandson of clergymen, he approached public questions with high idealism. Wilson's inauguration, like that of Jefferson and Jackson, represented a peaceful revolution on behalf of the common people. As the Presi- dent rose to deliver his inaugural address, the audience broke through fencing which had been set up to keep them away from the rostrum. Wilson forbade the pohce to drive them back, saying, \"Let the people come forward.\" Wilson's First Inaugural Wilson's First Inaugural Address was one of the shortest and most eloquent ever delivered. No previous President except Lincoln had been more a master of English prose. (See pp. SOS- SOS). Wilson began by asking the meaning of the Democratic triumph at the polls. His answer was that it was \"much more than the mere success of a party. The success of a party means little except when the Nation is using that party"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"518 New Horizons for a large and definite purpose.\" This purpose was clear: it was to do away with the e\\'ils which, along with many blessings, industrial- ism had brought. These evils the President listed as follows: \"inexcusable waste\" of natural re- sources, the \"human cost\" of unrestrained in- dividualism, and the use of government \"for private and selfish purposes.\" Wilson made clear that he would concen- trate on three major reforms: a lower tariflF, a new system of banking and credit, and better regulation of business. He also proposed better credit facilities for agriculture, increased con- servation, greater protection of the consumer, and social legislation as a matter of \"justice, not pity.\" The President revealed himself as \"a pro- gressive with the brakes on\" by warning that property and personal rights must be respected. Ridiculing extremists who could take \"excur- sions whither they cannot tell,\" he said that economic problems would be approached cau- tiously, \"in the spirit of those who question their own wisdom.\" Wilson closed by repudiating partisanship and calhng on all Americans to join him in bringing about reform: This is not a day of triumph: it is a day of dedi- cation. Here muster, not the forces of party, but the forces of humanity. ... I summon all honest men, all patriotic, all forward-looking men to my side. God helping me, I will not fail them, if they will but counsel and sustain mel Wilson and Congress The new President entered oflBce under handicaps. He was a minority President, chosen by only 42 per cent of the voters. Without ex- perience in national politics, he had so little acquaintance with party leaders that he had not met some of the members of his cabinet until he came to Washington for the inaugu- ration. The Democratic party was a loose alli- ance of local interests not expected to work well in harness; long out of oflBce, the Demo- crats lacked men with experience in government. On the other hand, Wilson enjoyed certain advantages. The election of 1912 showed that most of the people demanded progressive legis- lation. If the Democrats did not support the President, warned a Congressman, they would \"be turned into the wilderness for forty years more.\" No prominent Democratic leaders op- posed Wilson, as Cannon and Aldrich had thwarted Taft. On the contrary, Wilson enjoyed the loyal support of Bryan, the most influential man in the Democratic party, whom he ap- pointed Secretary of State. Above all, Wilson provided consistent, effective leadership. No President before or after him entered office \"with clearer ideas of what he wished to do, and how he proposed to do it.\" He told his cabinet, \"Having been chosen the leader of my party, I feel it my duty to lead.\" REFORMS IN TARIFFS, BANKING, AND TRUST BUSTING The President lost no time in embarking on his reform program. Like Taft, Wilson at once called Congress into special session. Breaking a precedent which had stood since Jefferson's time, he appeared in person before Congress and delivered a special message on the tariff. This dramatic action was an example of Wil- son's long-standing belief that the President's greatest power lay in focusing public attention on important issues. This \"speech from the throne\" made the headlines. As Wilson and his wife drove back to the White House, she re- marked that Roosevelt probably wished he had thought of it. 'Tes,\" he replied, \"I think I put one over on Teddy.\" Wilson's message charged that high tariffs had built up \"a set of privileges and exemptions from competition behind which it was easy . . . to organize monopoly.\" Lower rates, he claimed,"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"Sociology, Economics ^ HISTORY AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES In attempting to assess the relative influence of economics on the decisions of political leaders and on the policies of nations, the historian must use data and hypoth- eses made available by the research of economists and political scientists.

Wilson warned, howe\\'er, against undue haste, making clear that he did not favor re- moving protective duties entirely. The Underwood-Simmons Tariff, 1913 The House of Representatives soon passed > a biD^mbod>'ing the President's recommenda- tions. The real fight took place in the Senate, where pre\\'ious attempts to lower the tarifi^ had foundered (see pp. 453—454, 459, 511), and \\ where the Democrats had only a three-vote ma- jority. Lobbyists swarmed to Washington, and \\ senators were bombarded with letters and tele- igrams from their home states. Before senatorial opposition had time to cr>'stallize, Wilson made another appeal to the people. In a statement to the press he denounced the \"insidious\" lobbyists who attempted \"to overcome the interests of the public for their private profit.\" He asked an aroused public opinion to insist that Congress put an end to \"this unbearable situation.\" The President followed this by personal con- ferences with Democratic senators and by let- ters to those who threatened to oppose him. Wilson had once WTitten that the use of pa- tronage to influence Congressmen was \"im- moral,\" but he now allowed Br>'an and Albert S. Burleson, his Postmaster General, to satisfy congressmen's demands that federal jobs be filled by \"deserving Democrats.\" OflBce seekers recommended by senators who voted against tariff reduction obviously would not be \"de- serving.\" Under such varied pressure from the executive the Senate voted to accept the House bill with little change. The Underwood-Simmons Tariff was the first substantial lowering of import duties since 1857. It attempted to fix duties at a level where costs of production in the United States and abroad would be equalized. It removed pro- tection entirely from industries no longer need- ing it. Thus steel ingots and barbed wire were put on the free list, since American steel com- panies had long competed successfully with foreign producers. A most important section of the Underwood- Simmons Act was the pro\\'ision for levying an income tax, now legalized by the Sixteenth Amendment. Rates varied from 1 per cent on incomes over QUESTION .

Weaknesses of the Banl(ing System \\\\'hile the tariff debate was at its height, Wilson appeared before Congress to introduce the second major item in his reform program: a re\\ision of the banking and currency system designed to provide businessmen with more abundant and more available credit. Like the tariff message, ^^'iIson's speech was so brief and readable that many newspapers published the entire text. In 1907 a sharp panic had revealed that the American banking and currency system needed overhauling. The collapse of a few business houses and a sudden calling in of loans caused money to \"go into hiding\" and banks to stop lending. In 1908 Congress set up a National Monetar\\' Commission, headed by conser\\'ative Senator .\\ldrich, to investigate the situation and propose change. After four years of study, the Aldrich Commission reported that the financial organization of the United States was faulty in the following respects:"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"A short, sharp panic in 1907 caused widespread bank failures and unemployment In the cities.

(1) American banking lacked stability in time of crisis. There were insufficient monetary reserves and insufficient cooperation between banks. (2) The currency was inflexible. The amount of money in circulation was based on the amount of gold and silver in the treasury, plus the bonds held by the national banks. There was no means of increasing or decreas- ing the supply of money according to the needs of the country. ( 3 ) There was no over-all, central control of hanking practices. In other modem, industrial- ized countries there were central banks, such as the Bank of England and the Bank of France, which directed banking policy. The United States had had nothing of the sort since Jack- son destroyed the second Bank of the United States. (4) There was too much concentration of bank capital in New York City. A dispropor- tionate amount of bank capital was centered in Wall Street. Meanwhile other parts of the country, especially isolated rural districts, often suffered from a lack of adequate banking fa- cilities and credit."},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"FEDERAL RESERVE DISTRICTS Federal Reserve Bank Cities By the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the country was divided into twelve districts, each served by a single \"bank for bankers\". This arrangement made the banking system more responsive to local needs and less dominated by Wall Street. The Federal Reserve system was designed to check deflation and infla- tion, by so adjusting the rediscount rate that credit is made cheaper or more costly. Another major function of the reserve banks is to expand and contract the amount of currency in circulation. When a businessman borrows from a bank, the bank rediscounts his note at the district Federal Reserve Bank, which in turn issues new currency backed by the businessman's note. Similarly, when the note is paid off, the currency is withdrawn from circulation. By what criteria do you think the twelve districts were chosen? The Federal Reserve Act, 1913 While there was httle doubt about the ills of the banking and currency system, there was dispute about the cure. Wilson himself com- plained, \"There are almost as many judgments as there are men.\" Bankers favored a great cen- tral bank, privately controlled, hke the first and second Banks of the United States. Many pro- gressives, especially Bryan, feared that this would make the \"money trust\" (as they called it) even stronger. They wanted strict federal control of banking and credit. The bankers, in turn, intensely distrusted Br>'an as a \"wild man.\" It was Wilson's diflBcult task to select a plan which would work and at the same time vdn support from both bankers and Bryanites. The plan finally developed by several able congress- men, with Wilson's backing, was called the Federal Reserve Act. Under constant pressure from the President, Congress enacted this into law in December 1913. It was one of the most important and useful pieces of legislation in the history of the United States. The new system provided for twelve Fed- eral Reserve Banks situated throughout the coimtry (see map, above ). All national banks were required to join them and other banks might also do so. The Federal Reserve Banks did not deal directly with individuals but in- stead serviced member banks. These \"banks for"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"The Square Deal and the New Freedom 523 bankers\" concentrated reserves, so that indi- vidual banks could be supported in time of tem- porary difficulty such as a \"run.\" They provided for local needs and made it easier to move funds from one part of the country to another. Local banks had frequently lacked funds to provide for perfectly sound loans to business- men and farmers. Stores and factories had closed, and crops had rotted for lack of funds to pay for han'esting. The Federal Reserve Act greatly improved this situation by providing for a new form of \"flexible\" currency known as Federal Reserve notes, issued in response to business needs. The new money was put into circulation when local banks needing cash brought businessmen's promissory notes to Federal Reserve Banks and received Federal Reserve notes in return. For this service the Federal Reserve Banks charged a small fee called a \"rediscount.\" When a Federal Reserve Bank thus bought promissory notes, it could print and issue more paper money, with those notes as part of the security, or collateral, protecting the value of the currency. When the notes were paid up and the money came back to the Bank, it would retire the currency. The amount of money in circulation was also controlled by raising or lowering the rediscount rate. Raising the rate discouraged banks from lending and \"con- tracted\" the currency; lowering the rate en- couraged lending and \"expanded\" the currency. Thus currency and credit in any Federal Re- serve district expanded or contracted according to the economic needs of each region. The Federal Resene Act pro\\'ided for a com- promise between private and public control. The Federal Resen'e Banks themseh'es were privately owned, and a majority of their direc- tors were elected by the member banks. Over-all control of the Federal Reserve Banks was in the hands, ho\\\\'ever, of a seven-man Federal Resen'e Board appointed by the President. Thus the center of financial power was moved from Wall Street to Washington. On the whole, the Federal Reserve Act was successful in providing the United States with a banking system responsive to the needs of a great industrial nation. It succeeded in its first great test during World War I when it assisted industry to expand and helped the federal gov- ernment to finance the war effort. The Clayton Act, 1914 Less than a month after signing the Federal Reserve Act, Wilson asked Congress to pass a more effective antitrust law than the Sherman Act. Denying any desire to interfere with legiti- mate business activities, the message proposed various methods of preventing \"the indefensible and intolerable\" abuses of private monopoly. Late in 1914 Congress passed the Clayton Act which forbade the following practices that de- stroyed competition or closed the door to new business concerns: ( 1 ) Ruinous price-cutting, such as when a large company deliberately sold goods at a loss to drive v\\'eaker competitors out of business. ( 2 ) \"Tying' contracts, whereby a purchaser of goods from a particular company had to agree not to trade with its competitors. (3) Inter-corporate investment, by which a company bought part ownership in a rival con- cern. ( 4 ) \"Interlocking' directorates between large corporations and banks, whereby the same men acted as directors in many different companies. (In 1913 a congressional investigation revealed that the eleven partners of the firm of J. Pier- pont Morgan held over sixty directorships in banks and business concerns.) The Clayton Act contained two sections ap- parently favorable to trade unions. As has been noted, the Sherman Act, by forbidding conspira- cies in restraint of trade, had proved more effec- tive against labor unions than against business"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"524 New Horizons monopolies. In the Danbury Hatters' case, fought out in the federal courts from 1903 to 1915, a union had been ruined financially by being forced to pay triple damages to a business concern whose product had been boycotted. To discourage such use of antitrust laws the Clay- ton Act stated that \"nothing in the antitrust laws shall be construed to forbid the existence and operation of labor . . . organizations.\" Ever since Debs had been jailed for contempt in the Pull- man strike (see p. 439), labor vmions had protested the use of court injunctions forbidding strikes and boycotts. In answer to their protests, the Clayton Act forbade federal courts to issue injunctions against peaceful strikes, picketing, boycotts, or union meetings. Because of loose wording and unfavorable interpretation by the federal courts the Clay- ton Act was not effective. Thus the protection of labor unions from suits under the Sherman Act was limited only to unions when pursuing their \"legitimate\" purposes. It was up to the courts to define 'legitimate.\" And injunctions might still be issued when \"necessary to prevent irreparable damage to property or to a property right,\" which again left a large loophole for consers'ative judges. Wilson's Changing Pliilosophy With the passage of the Clayton Act the legislative program that Wilson had originally promoted was complete. In accordance witli the principles of the New Freedom, he had changed the rules and attempted to see that the rules of competition were made more fair. He had resisted such efforts to go farther as the passage of a federal child labor law or the estabhsliment of federal credit agencies to pro\\dde farmers with cheap loans. But after the passage of the Clayton Act, Wilson approved a law that revealed that he was being pushed toward more active inter- vention of government in the economy. This was an act establishing a Federal Trade Com- mission to investigate and regulate business practices. The commission was given power to order companies to \"cease and desist\" from un- fair conduct. Although in practice the activities of the commission were mild, the idea of estab- lishing such a regulatory commission was borrowed from Roosevelt's New Nationalism. Other legislation reveaUng a shift toward the more active role for government that Roosevelt had advocated was passed during the latter part of ^^'ilson's first term. Twelve regional Federal Farm Loan Banks were established and en- dowed with public funds in order to provide loans for agriculture at rates not to exceed 6 per cent. A Federal Highways Act gave federal funds to states for road building; the law, which revealed the growing importance of the auto- mobile, was designed to help farmers get their produce to market. Reversing his earlier stand, Wilson supported the Keating-Owen Child Labor Act that prohibited the employment of children under fourteen in factories producing goods for interstate commerce. The Adamson Act, passed under threat of a nation-wide tie-up in transportation, established an 8-hour day for railroad workers. Not since Hamilton's financial program in the opening years of the Republic had so much constructive legislation been passed so quickly. Sometimes keeping Congress in session through hot summer months, Wilson had supplied a skillful and dynamic leadership not previously surpassed by any iTesident in time of peace. Chauncey Depew, a noted conservative Re- publican, said that for a man regarded as a mere theorist, Wilson had accomplished \"the most astonishing practical results.\" Wilson's achievement as an architect and promoter of progressive legislation was later all but forgotten. It was obscured by adventures in foreign affairs that ended in tragedy for him and for the world."},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"Activities: Chapter 21 For Mastery and Review 1.

The lirst is found in the insistence by the best men in all political parties that special, minority, and corrupt influence in government — national, state, and city — be removed; the second tendency is found in the demand that the structure or machinery of government, which has hitherto been admirably adapted to control by the few, be so changed and modified that it will be more difficult for the few, and easier for the many, to control; and, finally, the third tendency is found in the rapidly growing conviction that the functions of government at present are too restricted and that they must be increased and extended to relieve social and economic distress. BENJAMIN PARKE DE WITT. 1915 The reform legislation passed during the Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson administrations was a manifestation at the national le\\'el of a widespread feeling that many aspects of Amer- ican society' were in crv'ing need of impro\\'e- ment. For all of America's wealth and progress, many thoughtful obser\\'ers saw much that alarmed them. CAUSES FOR ALARM Millions of American laborers were imder- paid and overworked. Wages of industrial workers averaged $10 to $12 for a 60-hour week, with recurring periods of unemplojTnent. Women garment workers sometimes received as little as 50 cents for a twelve-hour day. The accident rate in factories and on the railroads was appalhng, and there was no pro\\'ision for compensating the men, women, and children who were injured. According to an estimate made in 1904, 10 million people were \"under- fed, underclothed, and poorly housed.\" Systems of relief for the poor were meager and un- systematic. At the other end of the scale were men rich beyond the dreams of avarice, who thought nothing of asking fort>' guests to a dinner that cost $250 per plate, men who o\\\\'ned great yachts, baronial palaces, private railroad cars, and summer retreats covering thousands of acres. But it was not so much the wealth of the new plutocrats that was alarming as their power. Not only were the great corporations be- 526"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"The Progressive Movement 527 yond the reach of government, but they dom- inated it. At every level— federal, state, and municipal— could be seen what the Kansas editor, William Allen White, called \"the alli- ance between government and business to the benefit of business.\" The spectacle of insolent wealth at one ex- treme and sullen poverty at the other made many men fear revolution. This feeling was dramatized by one of the most widely read poems ever written by an American, \"The Man with the Hoe,\" by Edwin Markham, published in 1899. In describing Jean Frangois Millet's famous painting of a desperately tired peasant resting on his hoe in the fields, Markham ut- tered a bitter protest against those who brutal- ized men by exploiting them. By asking two rhetorical questions the poet issued a solemn warning: O masters, lords and rulers in all lands, How will the Future reckon with this Man? How answer his brute question in that hour When whirlwinds of rebellion shake the world? SOURCES OF THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT As if in answer to Markham's warning, much that was wrong with American society was righted by the progressive movement ' that was at its height during the first fifteen years of the twentieth century. This was misnamed because there was not one movement, but many. Pro- gressivism had so many sources and ran through so many channels that there was hardly an aspect of American life not touched by it. Its leaders included former Populists and Grangers, labor union officials, settlement house workers, crusading authors and editors, prohibitionists, naturaUsts and foresters, municipal and civil service reformers, and pofiticians. Some were enhghtened businessmen, including two part- ners of J. Pierpont Morgan. In general, pro- gressivism, like the earher JefFersonian and Jacksonian agitation, was inspired by the basic principle of the Declaration of Independence: the preservation or creation of equal opportu- nity. The progressives aimed to destroy privi- lege, by which they were apt to mean the corrupt partnership of private interests and political bosses. Relation to Populism Progressivism owed a good deal to the Populist movement; indeed, William Allen White said that the progressives \"caught the Populists in swimming and stole all their clothes except the frayed undergarments of free silver.\" Most of the demands found in the Omaha plat- form of 1892 (see Appendix, pp. 805-806) were enacted into law during the progressive period. But Populism had been an agrarian movement that rather ineffectively sought alhes in the cities. The Populists had not asked for active help from government (except in regard to regulation of railroads and telegraph lines) so much as for changes in the rules to give farmers an even break. But now in the cities there was a strong sense that government must play a more active role: A philosophy that called for \"leaving things alone\" . . . seemed either unreal or hypocritical in the cities. . . . The wage earner had to look to the government to make sure that the milk bought for his baby was not watered or tubercular; he had to look to government to regulate the construction of tenements so all sunhght was not blocked out. If only God could make a tree, only the government could make a park. The progressive leadership was diflFerent from that of the Populists, in that it was not drawn so much from victims of existing condi- tions as from men in comfortable circumstances 1 Note that \"progressive\" and \"progressive movement\" are not capitalized here. \"Progressive\" with a capital \"P\" refers to several minor political parties that have taken this label, espe- cially to the Progressive party that nominated Theodore Roose- velt for the presidency in 1912."},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"528 New Horizons who sympathized with the sufferings, of others. This could be seen in the way many Catholic priests, Jewish rabbis, and Protestant ministers preached the new \"social gospel\": that religious bodies should devote themselves to improving society as well as to ministering to the spiritual needs of their congregations. As was pointed out (see p. 442), men and women of various rehgious faiths had started settlement houses in city slums. In the progressive period they were pioneers in such activities as slum clearance and agitation for legislation limiting hours of employment and QUESTION .

The Na- tive, militant part in reform tional Council of movements? the Churches of Christ, represent- ing 32 denominations, was founded in 1905 and pledged itself to support a program of social re- form. In every large city the Salvation Army, which had been founded in England, provided food, lodging, and hope for the despairing and destitute. How broad was the appeal of the social gospel was shown by the success of In His Steps, written by Charles M. Sheldon, a Kansas minister. This novel, which in dramatic terms asks the question, \"What would Jesus have done about it?\", was published in 1896 and eventually sold over 20 million copies. Pragmatism The universities provided another breeding ground for reformers. Many men, both in and out of academic life, were profoundly influenced by the philosophy known as pragmatism, espe- cially connected with the name of William James of Harvard. Pragmatism can perhaps be summarized as follows: \"For human purposes, whatever promotes human welfare is true enough.\" It was in the spirit of pragmatism that men in the social sciences such as economics, sociology, and pubhc law studied human insti- tutions with the idea that they might be im- proved. Henry B. Adams, head of the famous department of history, politics, and economics at Johns Hopkins University, told his graduate students, \"By the instrumentality of scholars great improvement of society is to be made.\" From Johns Hopkins came such notable men as Woodrow Wilson and Newton D. Baker, a reform mayor of Cleveland, who later served as Wilson's Secretary of War. An academic figure who attained great influ- ence and high position was Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., son of a well-known hterary figure and a veteran of the Civil War. Early in his career, while a lecturer at the Harvard Law School, Holmes applied the pragmatic method in a book entitled The Common Law. Human law, he claimed, was not a sacred set of princi- ples, never to be changed, but a social instru- ment that must be adapted to changing needs. Wlien Theodore Roosevelt later appointed him to the Supreme Court, Holmes helped to write his legal views into the Constitution, often by his famous dissenting opinions which were fol- lowed by a majority of the justices only after he had retired. During the progressive era the greatest victory for the view that in deciding a case justices should consult present facts as well as ancient precedents was that of Muller v. Oregon (1908), involving an Oregon law hmiting the number of hours women might be employed. Previously the Supreme Court had declared similar legislation to be unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, on the ground that it interfered with workers' \"liberty\" (see p. 144). Louis D. Brandeis won the case for the state by preparing a brief that produced abundant evidence that long hours had evil effects on women's health. During Wilson's ad- ministration, Brandeis joined Holmes on the Supreme Court. The famous phrase \"Brandeis and Holmes dissenting\" often revealed their"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"'^S^^t^ differences of opinion with their more conserva- tive colleagues. The Muckrakers Victories over \"the system,\" or \"invisible government,\" as progressives called the busi^ ness-boss alliance, were possible only because an indignant public insisted, and continued to insist, that it was \"time for a change.\" A group of authors whom Roosevelt nicknamed \"muck- rakers\" helped to inspire this indignation and to keep it alive. Although the muckrakers wrote for popular magazines with very wide circula- tion, they were usually not hack writers, but intelligent men and women profoundly dis- turbed by the abuses they discovered. In her I History of the Standard Oil Company, Ida Tarbell described how that company obtained special favors from railroad companies and poli- ticians. In following the Color Line, Ray Stan- nard Baker revealed the patterns of discrimina- tion in both the North and the South. Lincoln Steffens revealed shocking graft in city after city. Steffens decided that the people most responsible for corruption in politics were not the politicians themselves, but those who wanted special favors from government. These favors might be franchises, persuading enforce- ment officers to \"look the other way,\" or \"pull\" with judges or police; they all involved the idea of privilege for \"insiders.\" Some muckrakers were novelists who put their criticisms of existing conditions into fic- tional form. In The Octopus, Frank Norris told how railroads lorded it over wheat farmers in a rich western \\alley. ^oniston and Mr. Crewe's Career by Winston Churchill (the American novelist) described political cojruption in New England. Booth Tarkington's' T/ie Gentleman from Indiana recounted an honest man's struggle with a political boss and with organized crime.

Articles in\"^ The Ladies' Home Journal and Collier's Weekly revealed that so-called patent medicines were generally useless and sometimes contained dangerous drugs. The American Medical Association joined the crusade against such preparations, as well as against the adulteration of food by preser\\'a- tive chemicals. Federal regulation was opposed by some senators, who declared it unconstitu- tional to interfere with the \"liberty\" of a citizen to poison himself. Nevertheless, a combination of presidential pressure and widespread demand proved irresistible, and the Pure Food and Drug Law was enacted. A similar law was inspired by the best-selling novel The Jungle, by Upton Sin- clair, which portrayed horribly unsanitary con- ditions in slaughterhouses. When Roosevelt learned that many of Sinclair's charges were true, he became, as Mark Sulli\\'an has written, \"all act.\" He overwhelmed opposition to federal inspection of meat by threatening to publish the most sensational findings of a committee which had secretly investigated the abuses. Within a"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"530 New Horizons short time Congress passed a Meatjnspection Act. The findings of the muckrakers were borne out by sober investigations. The most famous of these occurred in 1905 when Charles Evans Hughes, a brilhant young lawyer, probed hfe insurance companies in New York. Hughes revealed that officers and directors of some of the largest insurance companies in the coun- try ran a sort of spoils system, voting themselves huge salaries, appointing members of their own families to well-paid positions, buying securities from firms in which they had an interest, paying a United States senator (who was also a direc- tor) $20,000 a year for 'legal services,\" and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to influence state legislators. As a result of this investigation. New York passed laws to control the activities of insurance company oflBcials and to protect the interests of the policy- holders. Hughes gained such popularity that he was elected governor of New York and was launched on a distinguished political career. DIRECT DEMOCRACY The achievements of progressivism at the national level that were described in the last chapter were less far-reaching than those at the local level. It was more difiBcult to create nation- wide demands for reform than to organize ef- fective campaigns on a smaller scale. The federal go\\'emment was also difficult to prod into action. The Senate, chosen by boss-dom- inated state legislatures imtil 1913, was a highly conser\\'ative body. In the House of Representa- ti\\'es the dominating figures such as the com- mittee chairmen and the speaker were usually men highly resistant to change. The Supreme Court was somewhat less conservative than in the 1890's, but it was usually suspicious of the extension of federal power into new areas, as it demonstrated when it declared unconstitu- tional a federal law providing workmen's com- pensation for raihoad workers in 1908 and a federal child labor law in 1918. Partly because of the attitude of the courts, rriost of the evils described by the muckrakers-child labor, mu- nicipal corruption, and industrial accidents, for instance— were outside the constitutional sphere of the federal go\\'emment. At the local level the variety of reform dur- ing the progressive period was so extraordinary that we can only indicate its general character. The progressives had an optimistic faith in the intelligence and good will of the people at large. \"The cure for the evils of democracy,\" they said, \"is more democracy.\" A number of arrangements were introduced to reduce the power of poHtical bosses and provide for direct democracy. ( 1 ) The direct primary. Progressives claimed that the prevailing system of nominating candi- dates for ofiBce by boss-ridden party conventions allowed voters only to choose between Tweedle- dum and Tweedledee. The direct primary, first used in Wisconsin, took the nomination of party candidates away from conventions and gave it to the voters in a special election held in ad- vance of the regular election. (2) The initiative, referendum, and recall. The initiative and referendum, which originated in Switzerland, were both designed to give the people a direct voice in legislation. The initiative permitted a certain proportion of the voters, say 15 per cent, to force action on a particular issue. The referendum was a means of submitting po- htical issues to a yes-or-no vote of the people. By the recall, voters gained the right to remove from ofiice an elected ofiBcial who no longer enjoyed their confidence by holding a special election. (3) Corrupt practices laws. These laws limited the amount of money that candidates and their supporters might spend in elections, and also regulated campaign contributions."},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"Two suffragettes demon- strate before an audience of indifferent males in New York City. The Nineteenth Amendment, passed in 1920, gave all women the right to vote. It was a reward for the many services women had performed In World War I. especially by corporations. Elihu Root, who himself had made a fortune as a Wall Street lawyer, explained the need for such legislation in a speech to a New York State Constitutional Convention: Great moneyed interests are becoming more and more necessary to the support of political parties, and political parties are every year contracting greater debts to the men who can furnish the money to perform the necessary functions of party warfare . . . [we must] prevent . . . the great aggregations of wealth from using their corporate funds, directly or indirectly, to send members of the legislature to these halls in order to vote for their protection and the advancement of their interests as against those of the public. (4) New types of municipal government. In many cities, elective oflBces were so numerous that the voter could not exercise intelligent choice, nor could he fix responsibility for graft, extravagance, and ineflBciency. The structure of municipal government was often so unwieldy that it required a boss to provide unified direc- tion. A flood that nearly wiped out Galveston, Texas, in 1900 helped to start a new type of city government. In the crisis the citizens of Galves- ton gave the job QUESTION • Do more of running the elective offices and more city to a commis- frequent elections mean sion of five men, more real democracy? elected by the voters at large. This commission plan proved so successful that it was widely copied. From it developed the city-manager plan, whereby an elected city council employs a trained manager to run the government, just as in private industry company directors hire a superintendent to run a factory. The early city managers were often engineers, because much of the business of running a mod- em city— such as sewage disposal, water supply, and paving streets— was technical in nature. By 1912 over two hundred cities had adopted com- mission or city-manager plans. (5) Women's suffrage. The progressive movement advanced the cause of women's suf- frage.

Later building codes regulated the size of rooms, required that all rooms be lighted and ventilated, and made provision for running water and fire escapes. The building at right is not good, but it did represent a great advance over previous conditions they were senators. Chosen by state legislatures for six-year terms, the senators could often ignore public opinion. The constitutional ar- rangement often handicapped local government, because whenever there was a senatorial elec- tion coming up, state legislators were apt to be chosen on the basis of which candidate they favored rather than on how they stood on local issues. As early as 1892 the Populists demanded election of senators by direct popular vote. During the progressive period the demand be- came so great that in 1913 the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution provided for direct election of senators (see pp. 146-147). not count women as people, especially since they were taking more and more jobs in indus- try, oflBce work, and education, as well as play- ing a prominent role in reform movements. By 1914 eleven states, all west of the Mississippi, had granted women full suffrage. In the East the suffragettes were successful in publicizing their cause by holding dramatic parades and circulating monster petitions. ( 6 ) Direct election of senators. The United States Senate had long been known as a \"rich men's club.\" James Bryce remarked in the 1880's that some men became senators because they were rich, while a few were rich because CONTROL OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE As Theodore Roosevelt's career as a \"trust- buster\" revealed, progressives were resolved to put business under the law and to regulate it for the public welfare. At all levels of govern- ment they pushed through legislation toward this end. Equalization of Taxation Through their control over la\\vmaking agencies, great corporations had often been able to evade their share of taxation. Robert La Follette, governor of Wisconsin from 1900 to 1905, found that, in terms of market value of"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"The Progressive MoDement 533 their property, railroads paid the state less than half as much as did other businesses. He forced through laws to tax railroad property on an equal basis, and his example was followed elsewhere. Theodore Roosevelt, when governor of New York, had led a similar movement to tax pubhc service corporations on the value of their franchises. The movement toward more equal taxation reached the federal sphere when in 1909 Congress first ta.xed corporation profits. In 1895 the Supreme Court in a 5-to-4 decision had declared the income tax unconstitutional, but the Sixteenth Amendment (see p. 146), ratified in 1913, empowered the federal govern- ment to levy such a tax. Regulation of Public Utilities The progressive period saw the passage of a great deal of state legislation, along the lines of the former Granger laws, to regulate public utihties such as street-car lines and electric- light companies. Many states set up pubhc service commissions with the power to control the rates charged by public utilities and some- times to regulate the way they were financed. Doubtful of the effectiveness of regulation, some cities bought out private owners and ran public utihties directly; by 1915 all but one of the thirty-six largest cities owned or operated their own watervvorks. At the national level, the progressives, as we have seen, urged stricter regulation of trusts, railroads, and banks. Protection of Consumers A basic principle of common law that Amer- icans inherited from England was caveat emptor (let the buyer beware). This meant that if a purchaser bought worthless oil stock, a spavined horse, bread made of sawdust, or patent medi- cine consisting of coloring matter and water, he had no one but himself to blame. During the progressive period, a new attitude began to make itself felt. It was argued that consumers had no means of knowing when food was adulterated, meat prepared under unsanitary conditions, children's soothing syrup dosed wdth opium, or medicine mislabeled. Such frauds not only injured consumers, but also penalized those who produced honest products and marketed them honestly. Therefore laws were passed at both the federal and local levels to provide for inspection of food, penalize fraudulent produc- ers, forbid the use of certain drugs in patent medicines, and insist on accurate labeling. Still another protection for consumers were city building codes which forbade some of the worst features of the former tenement houses by pro- \\iding for legal minimums regarding hght and air, fire escapes, size of rooms, and sanitation. Protection of Wage Earners A grim feature of the advance of industri- ahsm was the employment of children in fac- tories. Although children started to work on farms almost as soon as they could walk, the work itself was often \\aried and healthful, as well as being part of normal family life. In factories, however, the work was monotonous, the conditions were often unhealthy or danger- ous, and the children were under the unfeehng discipline of strangers. Factory- children were often denied the opportunity for schooling. A National Child Labor Committee was formed in 1904 to promote the legal abohtion of child labor. A book by John Spargo, The Cry of the Children, revealed \"conditions which might well shame a civihzed people into action.\" In the textile industry more than one-eighth of the employees were less than sixteen years old, and some children entered cotton factories at the age of seven or eight. In the anthracite in- dustry thousands of \"breaker boys\" were hired at the age of nine or ten to pick slag out of coal, being paid 60 cents for a ten-hour day. Tlie nature of the work was such that breaker boys acquired permanently bent backs, and"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"534 New Horizons often crippled hands as well. Public opinion was so stirred that by 1914 every state but one had fixed a minimum age for employment; most of them had established other controls as well. In 1916 and again in 1919 Congress passed laws seeking to forbid child labor in factories pro- ducing goods for interstate commerce, but both were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Meantime Congress had established the Children's Bureau as a branch of the Depart- ment of Labor. The Children's Bureau has little or no power, but by investigation, persuasion, and the pubhcation of excellent pamphlets it has helped immensely to improve the well-being of American children. Until the twentieth century, the victims of industrial accidents had little or no protection. They often could not afford doctors' bills and could seldom save enough to tide themselves over a period of convalescence without great deprivation. During the late nineteenth century, countries as far removed as Germany and New Zealand had introduced workmen's compensa- tion, also called employers' liabihty. Such legis- lation required employers to insure their workers against accidents. If a worker was in- jured, he received medical and hospital care plus compensation for lost wages. In the United States, agitation for \\^'orkmen's compensation was so great that forty-t\\\\o states had provided for it by 1921. Such legislation not only helped workers after they had been injured, but also reduced industrial hazards. Since employers paid lower insurance premiums if they lowered their accident rate, it was to their self-interest to introduce safety devices and to train their laborers to be careful. Child labor and workmen's compensation laws were only two of the many types of legisla- tion designed to reduce the hazards and in- security of employment. Other legislation provided for better factory inspection, for regulation of working conditions for women. for limiting the hours of labor, and for the abolition of crowded, unsanitary sweatshops. The frontier tradition of self-reliance was so strong, however, that the United States did not go so far in the direction of social se(.'urity legislation as many European countries which had already passed laws providing for imem- ployment insurance and old-age pensions. OTHER REFORM MOVEMENTS The spirit of reform e,xpressed itself in many other ways. It resulted in playgrounds and dental clinics for children; in the founding of the Boy Scouts, the Campfire Girls, and tlie Girl Scouts; in juvenile courts and reform schools to care for young delinquents. Americans began to have second thoughts about looting their land, with the result that both the states and the federal government passed laws providing for conservation of natural resources and for great public recreation areas. Pri\\'ate charities multiphed and increased their usefulness. One of the greatest medical feats in history was the successful campaign by the Rockefeller Founda- tion to eradicate hoolovorm in the rural districts of the South. Educational Advances The early twentieth century was a period of such advance in education that a European ob- server remarked that \"children reign supreme in the United States.\" In elementary grades the school year was lengthened and the curriculum enriched by the introduction of music, drawing, and manual training. The number of students in high schools doubled; on the average, a new high school building was completed every day in the year. Under the influence of the philoso- pher John Dewey, a iew schools began to abandon a rigid, traditional curriculum and rote learning in favor of studies that related to modem society and methods designed to enhst"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"The Progressive Movement 535 the natural inquisiti\\ eness and creativity of the individual child. At the college level, Columbia built up a great school of education; Wisconsin was a leader in making universities serve a wider public through extension courses and traveling lecturers; Princeton, under Woodrow Wilson, introduced the \"preceptorial system\" which supplemented lectures with small in- formal discussion groups. In tlie field of adult education, a picturesque and important development was the growth of \"Chautauqua.\" It started as a summer lyceum by the shores of Chautauqua Lake in western New York. It became so popular that it was copied all over the country, often by traveling tent shows playing one-week stands. Millions of people crowded the circus tents in thousands of small towns to hear a variet)' of cultural offerings— Shakespearean readings, choruses, orchestras, preachers, lecturers, and pobticians. \"Chautauqua Week\" was a great event to men, women, and children in isolated rural communi- ties. Still another contribution toward alleviating the loneliness of farmers' lives was the institu- tion by the Post Office Department of rural free delivery service. In the days before radio and television it meant much to farm people that at last they could get magazines and daily papers delivered to their door. Farm Cooperatives The agricultural prosperity of the early twentieth century was promoted not merely by high agricultural prices, but by various ways in which farmers learned to conduct their business more efficiently. The Granger and Popuhst movements had taught farmers useful tech- niques of organization. These were put to direct practical use in the development of producers' cooperatives that undertook functions previously performed by farmers themselves or by middle- men—food processing, storing, transporting, and marketing. In dairying, for instance, cooperative creameries pasteurized milk, made butter and cheese, and carried the products to city whole- salers in refrigerator cars. Cooperatives both increased the efficiency of farming and returned to the farmer a larger share of what the con- sumer paid for his produce. The Advance of Temperance The temperance movement made great gains during the progressive era. The Woman's Chris- tian Temperance Union and the American Anti- Saloon League, both well-financed by voluntary contributions, carried on unremitting propa- ganda against the evils of alcohol and of the saloon. The Anti-Saloon League became a force in politics by throwing support to candidates on the basis of their attitude toward prohibition. The position of the opponents of prohibition was weakened by the admitted evils of the saloon and the notorious tie-up between saloonkeepers and corrupt politicians. The temperance forces won so many local victories that by 1914 nearly half the people of the United States Hved in \"dry\" territory. Twelve states had passed state- wide prohibition laws and nearly all the rest had provided for local option (see p. 289). The Socialist Movement During the progressive period the socialist movement gained strength. In 1912 Eugene V. Debs, polled over 900,000 votes. Even at this high point the Socialist party gained less than one-sLxteenth of the total ballot. But for several reasons, the socialist movement had an im- portance greater than its numbers might seem to warrant. Socialist ideas were widely circu- lated by popular authors such as the Americans Jack London and Upton Sinclair, and the Britishers H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw. Although very few of the progressives were socialists, they owed much of their success to the widespread feeling that reforming cap- italism was the only alternative to abolishing it."},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"Eugene V. Debs was again Socialist candidate for the presidency in 1912. The nearly one million votes he received were still only 6 per cent of all votes cast. Edward Bellamy's novel Looking Backward (see p. 445) had made socialism seem an at- tractive alternative to the existing industrial society, and his influence was reinforced by other writers, of whom the greatest was the Russian novelist and Christian Sociahst, Leo Toktoy. An influential American Christian Socialist was Walter Rauschenbusch, whose widely read book, Christianity and the Social Crisis ( 1907 ) , argued that the Kingdom of God on earth would come only when a socialist society based on brotherly love had taken the place of laissez-faire capitalism based on com- petitive desire for gain. The organized socialist mo\\ement was not based as much on the teachings of the Bible as on the works of Karl Marx. By the twentieth century, Marxian socialists were active in all western countries. They tended to divide into two groups. Some Marxists believed that social- ism could be introduced gradually into capital- istic society through piecemeal reforms finally gained through the ballot box. Others thought the only way to cure capitalism was to abol- ish it. When, the American socialists split at the close of the nineteenth century, the majorit)' joined the moderate faction led by Debs. He argued that in a free country the socialists could abolish capitalism and establish a \"co- operative com- QUESTIOK • How do monwealth\" by you account for the small voting themselves popularity of socialism in into control of America? the government. Pending the time when they gained power, the moderate social- ists favored many reforms supported by the Populists or progressives, such as a graduated income tax, women's suffrage and public relief for unemployed persons. Radical Socialism Opposed to the Debs following was a radi- cal group led by Daniel De Leon, a brilliant, intolerant Marxist revolutionary. He preached that gradual, piecemeal reform was worse than useless because it would make capitalism toler- able and workers would ne\\er be driven to rebellion. De Leon denounced reformers as sentimentalists, moderate socialists as \"traitors to the working class,\" and Samuel Gompers as a tool of Wall Street. He repudiated existing trade unions as agencies of compromise with capitalists. Instead, he proposed to organize all workers into great industrial unions that would eventually take over the means of pro- duction. Yet, parado.xically, he was against vio- lence. Debs and De Leon briefly cooperated in tlie founding of a new labor organization, the Industrial ^^\"orkers of the ^^'orld in 1905.

It went on to attempt to organize those outside the protection of existing labor unions: migrants, immigrants, and unskilled workers. ^Vhere\\'er the HVAV appeared, there were strikes, and often violence, which were repaid in kind by deputy sheriffs, company police, and private vigilante groups. Yet al- though the \"Wobblies,\" as they were called, made headlines and actually won a few strikes, their membership never began to approach that of the non-revolutionary unions. The move- ment lost ground when its leaders opposed American participation in World War I and disintegrated during the \"red scare\" that fol- lowed the war. FAILURES OF PROGRESSIVISM Eventually any wave of popular emotion subsides; so it was with progressivism. Muck- raking became a journalistic formula, and the public grew tired of scandals. Many of the democratic reforms did not work out as planned, partly because the advocates of direct democracy had too optimistic a faith in the public's continuing interest in politics. Too frequent elections promoted voter indifference. Sometimes as few as 10 per cent of the eligible voters took part in primary elections. In any case, primary elections were apt to weaken party discipline and responsibility by taking the selection of candidates out of the control of the party organization. The new machinery for centralizing control of municipal government was no insurance against boss rule. After \"throwing the rascals out\" and setting up a commission or city-manager plan, the citizens of a town often lost interest and let the rascals back into power again. Public ownership of public utihties sometimes proved ineflBcient, as well as a fruitful source of patronage and graft. Furthermore, the benefits of progressivism were unequally distributed. The middle class leaders of the movement feared labor unions scarcely less than trusts, and manufacturers organized effectively to prevent unionization, often with the active cooperation of local courts and police. The principal advance of labor during this period was among the minority of skilled workers. The real wages of unskilled workers actually dropped, since it was a period when the prices they paid for commodities in- creased more rapidly than their rates of pay. Treatment of the \"New Immigrants\" A factor that depressed the wage scale was a great flood of immigrants, averaging a milhon a year, the majority from southern and eastern Europe. This \"new immigration\" caused alarm not merely among native laborers, who saw it as a threat to their livelihood, but among those who feared them simply as aliens. The new immigrants were more strange to established American custom than were the \"old immi- grants\" from northern and western Europe, and they had to face discrimination, both by law and by custom. ^ „ . . , This even reached QUESTION .

Pressure from labor union leaders and organizations such as an Immigration Restriction League induced Congress in 1897, 1913, and 1915 to pass laws requiring a hteracy test of immigrants.

Finally, however, such a law was passed over President Wilson's veto in 1917."},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"The Progressive Movement 539 Frustration for the Negro The most conspicuous failure of progres- sivism was in regard to the Negro. Since the close of Radical Reconstruction in 1877, the place of the Negro in the South had evolved into a pattern of settled inferiority— in other words, of \"white supremacy.\" This develop- ment did not take place at once. During the 1880's, visitors to the South from the North and from Europe were impressed by the way Negroes and whites mingled in public facilities such as streetcars, theaters, and soda fountains. A Negro newspaperman, returning from the North to his birthplace in South Carolina in 1885, found less discrimination in traveling and eating arrangements than in New England. The conservative whites, often former planters, who dominated southern politics for a time were quite ready to give Negroes a dignified, al- though subordinate, place in southern life. In return, the Negroes generally voted for the \"quality folk\" in elections. But in the decades before and after 1900, there were successful efforts, varying in degree from state to state, to segregate Negroes both by law and by custom and to deprive them of political rights. Segrega- tion extended to \"virtually all forms of public transportation, to sports and recreations, to hospitals, orphanages, prisons, and asyhmns, and ultimately to fimeral homes, morgues, and Jane Addams, Social Reformer While on vacation in Madrid in the spring of 1888, a frail, small, well-to-do young American woman suddenly hit on a strange plan. Taking her inspiration from Toynbee House, a social settlement house in the East End of London, she decided that she would go to a large city, find a place in the middle of the poorest district, and begin to live as a neighbor and friend to the very poor. By doing this, Jane Addams hoped to find a way to broaden the applications of democracy. She believed that to limit the concept of democracy to the eighteenth-century idea of political equality would not answer the growing needs of late nineteenth-century industrial America. Returning to the United States, she founded Hull-House, on South Halsted Street in the immigrant section of Chicago. There she blazed a trail of social responsibility to the community. Out of the experiences of Hull-House came the first juvenile court in the United States, the first public playground in Chicago, pensions for mothers, the start of industrial medicine, and the union label. Jane Addams' interests extended far beyond Hull-House to gaining suffrage for women, ending child labor, and establishing collective bargaining in labor disputes. She helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. From 1914 on, she was prominent in the movement to end war, winning the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1931. Perhaps her greatest achievement was the fact that thousands of women were moved by her example of moral leadership to enter actively into the life of the community. Three years before her death in 1935, she summed up her goals: \"To marshal the moral forces capable of breaking what must be broken and building what must be built; to reconstruct our social relationships through a regeneration of the heart; to repair a world shattered by war and sodden self-seeking; to establish moral control over a mass of mechanical achievements.\" (Themes 5 & 7, see p. xll)"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"540 New Horizons cemeteries.\" At the same time, Negroes were not only deprived of the franchise by various devices, but were also barred from holding of- fice, sitting on juries, and serving as policemen. They were even forbidden to reside or as much as spend the night in some counties in the deep South. The practice of white supremacy was enforced not only by law but by intimidation, which took its most extreme form in lynching and other forms of mob violence. The subordination of Negroes in the South was accomplished with little protest from the North. The average white in the North was ready to accede to the southern \"solution\" for the race problem, partly through indifference, partly because it seemed the price of reunion of the sections, and partly because he was in- clined to be affected by the pseudo-Darwinism of the day and to believe that Negroes were racially inferior. While the cruder forms of keeping the Negro in \"his place\" were not practiced in the North, colored people were generally restricted to ill-paid occupations and an inferior social status. Their children were often sent to segregated schools, where they often received inferior education. The Supreme Court reflected prevailing opinion by refusing to hold that segregation by state law was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the case of Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), the court held, with only one judge dissenting, that a Louisiana law that required railroads to provide \"separate but equal\" rail- road accommodations for Negroes was con- stitutional. The \"separate but equal\" doctrine was later upheld with regard to schools and other enterprises serving the public. Founding of the NAACP These unhappy experiences explain a shift in Negro leadership during the progressive era. At the turn of the century, the most influential Negro leader was Booker T. Washington, a former slave who had worked his way up from abject poverty and had foimded Tuskegee Institute in eastern Alabama in 1881 to train Negroes in agricultural and industrial skills; Washington urged Negroes to accept the idea that they could not make the jump to equality with whites at once. They must first undergo a period of subordination while they learned skills, acquired property, and developed habits of thrift and industry. Washington was even will- ing to accept segregation of Negroes during this tutelage. But as the Negroes' lot not only failed to improve but often got worse, some turned from the moderate counsels of the head of Tuskegee to other men. The most prominent new leader was W.E.B. DuBois, a brilliant, highly-educated Negro bom in Massachusetts. He insisted that Washington was doing the Negroes harm by acquiescing in injustice. Instead of training for industrial jobs as \"hewers of wood and drawers of water,\" DuBois proposed to gi\\'e the ablest Negro chil- dren, the \"Talented Tenth,\" the finest possible education so that they might better lead their fellow Negroes from bondage. \\Vhere Wash- ington was willing to wait, DuBois wanted im- mediate action now. He was one of the organ- izers, along %\\'ith John Dewey, Jane Addams, and others, of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), founded in 1909 and dedicated to the proposi- tion that all Negroes should gain the rights guaranteed them by the Constitution of the United States. The progressive era closed with the entrance of the United States into World War I, and Americans turned from reforming their o\\vn society to a fruitless crusade \"to make the world safe for democracy.\" For all its shortcomings, the progressive movement had protected the weak, curbed the strong, enriched men's hves, pro- moted equality, and averted revolution by re- storing faith in the processes of democracy."},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"Activities: Chapter 22 For Mastery and Review 1.

Most of these are either explicit or im- plicit in each of the nine Parts into which this text is divided. It is useful, however, to select particular themes for illustration, emphasis, and study at the end of each Part. This Part surely suggests a rather recent theme of American history, \"world- wide responsibility,\" and also one that goes back to the very first settlements, \"concern for the welfare of others.\" So: 1. Why did the United States \"take up the white man's burden\" in 1898? See May, From Imperialism to Isolationism, 1898-1919. 2. \"Reforms don't just happen. First, some persons have to get angry. Then they must agitate and get other people angry. Then the angry people form a pres- sure group with enough leverage so that officials decide that they will lose more votes by inaction than by promoting legislation to remove abuses.\" Does this pattern fit the facts of the progressive period?

What brings this on is hard to say — sometimes a sound, such as a distant train whistle or the song of a bird; sometimes a smell, such as the scent of lilacs or a wood fire. For a moment you remember what it was like to be three years old and reaching up for the hand of a grown-up, or six and getting water up your nose at your first swimming lesson. In the history of nations, as in the lives of individuals, different periods have characteristic moods. The progressive period of the early twentieth century was one of high purpose. The delegates to the Bull Moose convention in 1912 chanted \"Onward Christian Soldiers,\" and Woodrow Wilson called his inaugural \"a day of dedication.\" The spirit carried on into the World War: America was joining in a crusade to \"make the world safe for democracy.\" And there was the poignant gaiety of the doughboys singing \"Over There\" as they marched to the ghastly slaughter on the Western Front. With the coming of the twenties, there was an abrupt change. A new mood of disillusionment was reflected in two war plays, \"No More Parades\" and \"What Price Glory?\" The cynics' prophet, magazine editor H. L. Mencken, never fired of ridiculing the great American \"booboisie.\" Crazes came and went: flagpole sit- ting, marathon dances, Florida real estate, mah-jongg. The United States had emerged from the World War the wealthiest nation on earth, caught up in an ever-rising spiral of prosperity, and \"two cars in every garage\" was a 1928 cam- paign slogan. This was the \"jazz age,\" its pursuit of pleasure evoked by its popular songs \"Fascinating Rhythm,\" \"I Want to Be Happy,\" \"Ain't We Got Fun.\" But the mood changed again, from \"Just Around the Corner\" (there's a rainbow In the sky) to \"Brother Can You Spare a Dime?\" With the Great Depression, the light-heartedness of the twenties shifted to something the country as a whole had never experienced before— bleak fear and despair. Thousands of men stood in lines for a bowl of soup and a crust of bread — while farmers were burning un- salable surpluses of wheat and corn. Self-respecting men, with no jobs and savings gone, sold apples on street corners. Life had a nightmarish quality — as though the country were under a spell, or had been attacked by invisible Martians. And then there was \"Happy Days Are Here Again,\" the Democratic campaign song in 1932. It conjures up one of the most loved and most hated figures in American political history, Franklin D. Roosevelt, with his New Deal and his \"firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\""},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"Chapter 23 The First World War Governments and individuals conformed to the rhythm of the tragedy, sv/ayed and staggered forward in heipless vioience, slaughtering and squandering on ever-increasing scales, till injuries were w/rought to the structure of human society which a century will not efface, and which may conceivably prove fatal to the present civilization. WINSTON CHURCHILL As Wilson's First Inaugufal Address showed, his attention on taking office was focused en- tirely on domestic issues. About such matters as the tariff and banking he was well informed; he also had the assistance of experts such as Senator Carter Glass of Virginia, principal au- thor of the Federal Reserve Act. In foreign af- fairs, however, he was personally less well equipped, and he had few experienced advisers. William Jennings Bryan, his Secretary of State, had no training in diplomacy. The permanent staff of the State Department was composed largely of Republican appointees whom Wilson suspected, with some reason, of lack of sympa- thy for his policies. The top diplomatic posts were filled, as usual, with political appointees; Bryan also appointed scores of untrained \"de- serving Democrats\" to lesser posts. WILSON'S FOREIGN POLICY On the day he took office Wilson remarked to a friend that it would be the irony of fate if his administration had to deal much with foreign affairs. As it turned out, he was soon confronted with difficult and complex foreign problems that involved the fate of the whole world. \"A New Note in International Affairs\" Whatever his handicaps, Wilson was re- solved, as one of his biographers has written, to \"strike a^new note in J rt-prrinti\"\"'^^ affairfi\" and to see that \"sheer honesty and even unself- ishness . . . should prevail over nationalistic self- seeking in American foreign policy.\" Both he and Bryan were opposed to imperiahsm, to the Big Stick, and to war. They believed that the United States should exert leadership in the world by the force of moral example. Wilson repudiated dollar diplomacy during his first fortnight in office. During the Taft ad- ministration, a group of American bankers had been urged to join those of other countries in making a loan to the new Chinese republic. To insure repayment it was proposed that the fi- nances of the Chinese government be put under the supervision of foreign \"advisers.\" In March 1913, representatives of the American bankers came to Washington and asked whether the government would give them support. Wilson refused on the ground that such interference with Chinese sovereignty was \"obnoxious to the principles upon which the government of our people rests.\" Bryan's principal activity as Secretary of State was the negotiation of \"cooling-ofi^' treaties 547"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"548 Crusade and Disillusion betsveen the UaitedS ^tates and more than a score of foreign nations.

There was no requirement that the find- ings of the commission be accepted; the idea was simply to give time for war fever to sub- side. In a dispute with Great Britain over tolls on ships using the Panama Canal, Wilson re- vealed his determination that the United States should scrupulously observe its international ob- ligations. As the Canal approached completion, Congress passed a law in 1912 exempting United States coastwise shipping from tolls. Great Britain protested that this was a violation of the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty which guaran- fppr^_P^iiaJ rnf» c fnr n ViipE- r.f f|]1 naHnnc In 1914 Wilson appeared before Congress and in a \\-ery short message urged that exemption for American ships be repealed. His principal argu- ment was that out of self-respect the United States should act in such a way as to \"deser\\'e our reputation for generosity and for the re- deinption of every obligation without quibble or hesitation.\" Congress followed Wilson's ad- vice, even though his opponents accused him of \"cringing before the British throne.\" \"Moral Impe rjalisir\" '\" Mftxir\" On entering the White House, Wilson faced a diplomatic crisis in regard to Mexico. In 1911 the Mexicans overthrew Profirio Diaz, a dictator who had repressed his people for thirty years, while granting to foreign investors the right to exploit his country's rich mineral resources. Diaz was succeeded by Fr ancisco Madero, an idealist sincerely devoted to the interests of the people of Mexico. But shortly before Wilson's inaugu- ration Victori ano H uerta, a \"st rong man,\" seized power, and the deposed Madero was murdered, pBajimab]y_ on H uerta's orders. Now the ques- tion was: should the United States recognize a murderous usurper as lawful ruler of Mexico? It had generally been our policy to recognize any established government without passing judgment on how it gained power. American capitalists, who had invested a billion dollars in Mexico, favored Huerta because, like Diaz, .he would keep order. Other nations with large Mexican investments, notably Great Britain, lost little time in recognizing the new ruler. In devising a Mexican policy, Wilson again repudiated dollar diplomacy. He intended to favor \"thp_'iiihmprgfd \"ighJX::fiv° per cen t\" of the Mexican people, \"st ruggling toward liberty,\" o\\er the privileges ofToreij Ton^ vinced that without support by the United States \"the unspeakable Huerta\" would be over- throwTi, ^^'ilson refused him recognition and at- tempted to prevent him from obtaining arms. The President called this line of action \"watch- ful waiting.\" This policy ran into all sorts of diflBculties. Mexico had plunged into civil war. Scores of American h\\'es were lost in the resulting dis- order, and millions of dollars' worth of American property was destroyed. Wilson's policy w as dis- trusted in Latin America as an unwarran ted interference in Mexican affairs. In April 19l4, United States^naval forces, attempting to en- force the arms embargo, cla shed \\\\ath Mexic an liuopii and seized the cityof Vera Cruz. War seemed imminent. At this point Wilson made a gesture that temporarily lessened Latin-American distrust of the \"Colossus of the North.\" Resisting clamor for war, the President accepted an offer from the ABC Powers ( Areentina ^razil. and Chile) the dispute between the United to media States and Mexico. At a conference at Niagara Falls, the ABC Powers supported W'ilson in advising that Huerta must go.

The expedition not only failed to catch the Mexican chieftain, but was re- sented by Mexicans of all parties. War threat- ened again, but fortunately, neither Carranza nor Wilson wanted it. Eventually the American troops were withdrawn, and Mexico was left to her own devices. Although Wilson's Mexican policy was well intentioned, it won the United States no friends. The English ridiculed his at- tempt to \"shoot the Mexicans into self-govern- ment.\" Latin Americans regarded his \"moral im- perialism\" with no more favor than the Big Stick diplomacy of Theodore Roosevelt. Although Bryan and Wilson were opposed in principle to dollar diplomacy, their Latin- American policy, outside of Mexico, differed lit- tle from that of the previous Republican ad- ministrations.

OUTBREAK OF WAR IN EUROPE By 1914-there had not been a general Euro- pean war for nearly a century and none be- tween major powers since l S2Q.3Iany people thought that Western nations had abandoned war, save for skirmishes between whites and \"natives\" on the fringes of empire. Yet suddenly, between July 28 and August 4, 1914, Europe plunged into one of the bloodiest and most costly struggles in all its long history. How did this appalling event occur? We cannot answer with certainty. It is generally agreed, however, that two basic forces bringing about the First World War were nationalism and imperialism.

They rapidly extended their power into less developed areas, especially Asia and Africa. Out of this process developed bitter international rivalries. Thus, for many years Great Britain attempted to \"contain\" Russian aggression along a great arc extending from Turkey through Persia, Afghanistan, Tibet, and northern China. During the same period, the expansion of the French empire in Africa brought risk of war with Italy over Tunis, with Great Britain over the Sudan, and with Ger- many over Morocco. Added to the tension oyer these imperial rivalries was the long-standing French desire for revanche (revenge) against Germany for the defeat suffered in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. There was also a complicated situation in the Balkan peninsula, the \"tinderbox of Europe,\" where newborn nations such as Serbia and Bulgaria clashed with each other and with the decaying Ottoman and Austrian empires. Although the foregoing rivalries failed to produce a major European war between 1870 and 1914, they created great fear. And fear produced a great\" armament race, as each coun- try strove to increase its powers of \"self-de- fense.\" The armament race in turn produced not only more fear, but a situation in which the military leaders, who thought in terms of how best to fight a war, tended to take over from the diplomats, who generally hoped to prevent it. Perhaps the principal reason why the First World War came when it did, as well as why it came so suddenly, was a system of rival alli- ances. The ^riple Alliance, created by the Ger- man statesman Otto von Bismarck, drew to- gether GeQTTariy ^Au^tria . H ii ngqr^^^^ and^Jtal^, France became alarmed at her diplomatic isola- tion. The British feared growing German com- petition for trade, colonies, and naval suprem- acy. Therefore, Eraiice-and-.Eritain arranged a partnership known as the j Elnt P ntft Cnrdinlp (cordial understanding). The defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese War removed most of Britain's fear of Russian rivalry. Gradually there emerged the TrJ ole Entente tha t grew into an alliance between France, Russia, and Great ^BritairL The great powers attracted smaller countries as \"satellites.\" Thus, Germany and Austria had Bulgaria and Turkey on their side, while Serbia was tied to Russia. The danger of this situation was that in any international dispute, no matter how trivial, op- posing governments might call on allies for sup- port and bring on a general war. This happened in 1914. When a fanatical Serb patriot assassi- nate d Austrian Archduke Ferdinand at Sara - jevo, Austria demanded reparation from Serbia and was backed by her ally Germany. Serbia was backed by Russia, a nd Russia by France . The British governm ent was to fl_closp1y tied tf> France ana Russia to be etfective in its efforts for peace. Quickly the military leaders took over from the diplomats, and each army strove to strike first.

In general, however, American opinion was on the side of the Allies. This stemmed partly from a sense of common heri- tage with Great Britain. There was also strong sentiment for France, reflected in the lines: Forget us, Lord, if we forget The sacred sword of Lafayette. Even stionger than sentiment for either Brit- ain or France was that against Germany. This feeling had been stimulated by various inci- dents, by the sabre-rattling statements of Kaiser William II, and by a movement known as Pan- Germ anSnT rhe Pan-Germans preached that the Germans were to dominate the world; they glorified war.

Violations of American Neutral Rights In the early years of World War I, as in the period before the War of 1812, the United States had the largest share of neutial trade and suffered serious violations of its neutral rights. The BritislLwerejhefirstJo_bieak-e*tab- hshed intemataon aTliS^asniey clamped a tight blockade on the Cential Powers. They planted mines in the North Sea, forced American ships into English ports for inspection, limited tiade with neutral countries such as Denmark, opened American mail, and put food on the list of con- traband materials not to be exported to Ger- many. The British blockade was so effective that trade between the United States and the Central Powers shrank to less than 1 per cent of its prewar level. Meanwhile exports to the Allies \"• nearly quadrupled. For their very survi\\'al the Allies needed American war materials and food. The prosperity of tlie United States in tirm came to depend on war orders. The economic tie with the Allies became even closer when American citizens bought over two billion dol- lars' worth of French and British bonds. Serious as British violations of American neutral rights were, they were less maddening than those of Germany. To meet the challenge of the British blockade and to starve Britain into submission, the Germans relied on a new weapon, the oceag^oing submarine.

During the early months of the war, most of his protests were directed against Eng- land. These were not particularly effective, partly because ^^'alter H.

The 128 Americans who were drowned included _3I, women and ,.2]^ children. Many along the eastern seaboard, including Theodore Roosevelt, thought that America should go to war, or at least break off relations with Germany. But many others thought that Americans taking pas- sage on ships of nations at war did so at their own risk. Wilson steered a middle course. He refused to take extreme measures against Ger- many and incurred ridicule by saying that the United States was \"too proud to fight.\" On the other hand, he sent note after note insisting that the German government safeguard the lives of non-combatants in the war zones. During the Lusitania crisis, Bryan resigned as Secretary of State, because he thought Wilson's firm insist- ence on neutral rights would lead to war. Bryan's point of view was so widely shared that early . in 1916 Congress was on the point of forbidding Americans to travel on the ships of belligerent nations. Wilson managed to prevent this move, arguing that if we gave up any rights, \"many other hiuniliations would certainly follow.\" Late in March 1916, Wilson's policy was se- verely tested when a U-boat torpedoed the French passenger ship Sussex, w ith resulting injury to several Americans. Although his closest advisers favored breaking off relations with Ger- many at once, Wilson chose to issue one last warning. He demanded that the German gov- ernment immediately promise to abandon its methods of U-boat warfare or risk war with the United States. At this time Germany hoped for a great victory at Verdun that would defeat France in a few months; on the eastern front German arms were already close to \\'ictor>'.

Roosevelt was not happy in the Progressive party. It included too many impractical reformers of the type he had nicknamed the 'Ivmatic fringe\"; it had even less chance of winning in 1916 than four years ear- lier. Roosevelt hoped that the Republicans might heal the feud of 1912 by nominating him; instead they chose Charles Evans Hughes, who resigned from the Supreme Court to run. Roose- velt nevertheless refused to nm as a Progressive, thus killing the party he had foimded. The question still remained whether those who had voted for the Progressive ticket in 1912 would retiuTi to the Republican fold or whether they would vote for Wilson. The Democrats enthusiastically renominated Wilson. In the ensuing campaign they pointed with pride to their candidate's extraordinary suc- Compare this map to that of the Bryan-McKinley pres- idential race of 1896 (see page 460).

In for- eign affairs the Republicans \"played both ends against the middle\": some denounced Wilson for being too easy on Germany, while others rebuJced him for being too friendly with Britain. The election was one of the closest in history. On the night of election day even the Demo- cratic New York Times conceded a Republican victory.

Wilson swept rural America even more completely than Bryan had in 1896, and by adding the vote of just one important industrial state, Ohio, he was able to gain re-election. AMERICA ENTERS THE WAR ^ Dming the 1916 election campaign Wilson never personally claimed that he could guaran- tee to keep the United States neutral. By re- peatedly holding Germany to \"strict accounta- bility\" for the loss of American lives caused by submarines, he left himself small margin of choice should the German government decide to resume imrestricted submarine warfare. \"Any little German lieutenant,\" he told his Secretary of the Navy, \"can put us into war at any time by some calculated outrage.\" The only sure way to keep America out of the war was to end it. As head of the only great power still at peace, Wilson felt it his responsibihty to bring the warring nations together.

Dtiring the previous year, German armies had failed to win victory at Ver- dun, and had later suflFered heavy losses in the four-month battle of the Somme. Time was running out, as the British blockade began to cause severe shortages, even starvation. To an- swer this, the submarine fleet was increased. The leaders of. the German navy promised to starve England into submission in five months if U-boats were allowed to sink on sight. Even if this violation of the Sussex pledge drew America into the war, it was assumed that the United States could not raise an army and trans- port it to Europe before the Allies collapsed. Therefore, on January 31, 1917, the German government announced that vessels in waters near Great Britain, France, and Italy might be sunk without warning. Wilson now felt he had no choice; on Feb- ruary 3, 1917, he broke off diplomatic relations vwth Germany. When goods piled up in Atlantic ports because ships feared to sail, he asked Congress for power to arm American merchant ships. This measure passed the House by 403 votes to 13, but was blocked in the Senate by a filibuster of twelve senators.

Meanwhile, antagonism toward Germany mounted.

On March 12 an unarmed American merchant ship was sunk without warning, followed by three more on March 19. Two days later Wilson called for a special session of Congress to consider \"grave questions of national poUcy.\" upon us.

Late in 1917 the Italians suffered a severe defeat at Caporetto. After the Russians overthrew the Czarist government in March 1917, their military effort slackened. When the Bolsheviks seized power in Novem- ber, Russia stopped fighting entirely, thus re- leasing German armies for service on the west- em front. By the severe Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, Russia was forced to gi\\'e up immense areas, in which the Germans set up puppet governments. The conquered territory included the Ukraine, one of the richest grain- growing areas in the world; from it the Germans hoped to obtain food to relieve the severe short- ages caused by the British blockade. The Allies did not expect that the United States would gi\\e much help in the actual fight- ing. Not until 1916 had Wilson been persuaded to support plans for military preparedness, and by the spring of 1917 these had not been de- veloped very far. Including both regulars and The Doughboys On April 6, 1917, the Congress of the United States declared war on the German empire. Nearly twenty years later congressional investigating committees tried to find out why. Did the mal<ers of munitions press war to increase their profits? Did international bankers promote American intervention to protect their investment in government bonds issued by the Allies? Was Wilson carried along by the pro-English sympathies that he shared with some of his closest advisers? Or was the whole thing a result of the decision to insist on outmoded \"rights of neutrals\" on the high seas? At the grass-roots level there was enthusiasm for the war, if little understanding of just how the United States got in. Americans became convirrced that they were on the side of good, destined to destroy evil and somehow to create a better world. The four million \"doughboys\" (the Gl's of World War I) were suddenly torn from civilian life and sent to training camps that consisted of flimsy barracl<s set in seas of mud in winter and dust in summer. They were issued uniforms and shoes that seldom fitted, two scratchy blankets each, and a mess kit. At first there was a shortage of weapons, and infantrymen drilled with wooden guns, while artillerymen used logs. A million doughboys were packed into the ill-smelling holds of transports and shipped to France, often before their training was completed. In France there was apt to be more training, and then at last men were moved up toward the front lines in the famous French \"40 and 8\" boxcars (40 men and 8 horses). Finally they marched into the hell of trench warfare, singing as they went, for these were the last American armies that regularly sang on the march. The songs they sang — \"Over There,\" \"K-k-k-katy,\" \"Pack Up Your Troubles,\" \"Keep the Home Fires Burning,\" and \"Mademoiselle from Armenti^res\" — bring back a poign- ant memory of young men who somehow kept their spirit and sense of humor in unhappy situations.

The American Expeditionary Force was assigned its own sector of the Allied front. \"Over the top\" from the trenches meant a plunge into enemy fire and into a tangle of barbed wire strung across \"no man's land.\" National Guardsmen, the United States had only 200,000 soldiers; of these less than 25,000 were ready to take the field. The army possessed only 1,500 machine guns, 55 obsolete airplanes, and no heavy artillery whatever. Forging an Army In the face of this discouraging outlook, the United States mobilized at a speed which as- tonished both friends and foes. Supported by his able Secretary of War, Newton D. Baker, Wilson insisted that troops should be raised by a draft on the democratic principle of \"a uni- versal obligation to serve.\" Opponents of con- scription said that it was \"un-American\" and that it would \"Prussianize\" the country. Champ Clark, speaker of the House of Representatives, remarked that in Missouri, where he came from, people thought there was \"precious little dif- ference between a conscript and a convict.\" Nevertheless, the President's will prevailed, and in May 1917, Congress passed the Selective Service Act that made all men between twenty- one and thirty liable for military service. In June, nearly 10 million young men quietly regis- tered for the draft. There was no such resistance to conscription as occurred during the Ci\\11 War; this was perhaps because the registration was carried on entirely by civilians at ordinary centers of ci^dlian life such as schools and tov\\Ti halls. Draft liability was eventually extended to all men between eighteen and forty-five, and 2,800,000 were chosen for sendee. Another mil- lion were supplied by volunteers. Housing and training this \\'ast number of men required the building of 32 camps, each able to shelter over 40,000 men. In spite of great difficulties in equipping them, the camps soon came to resemble small cities, with running water, electric light, amusement centers, librar-"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"The First World War 561 ies, and hospitals. After preliminan' training averaging six months, the troops went abroad for further instruction before being sent into battle. Nearly tvvo million men reached France before hostilities ended. This vast new reservoir of manpower was in itself an important cause of \\ictory; it lowered German morale and raised that of the Allies. In Testament of Youth, Vera Brittain, who served as a nurse behind the British lines, described her first sight of Ameri- can troops as follows: I was lea\\'ing quarters to go back to my ward, when I liad to wait to let a large contingent of troops march past . . . though the sight of soldiers marching was now too familiar to arouse curiosity, an unusual quality of bold vigour in their swift stride caused me to stare at them with puzzled interest. Tliey looked larger than ordinary men; their tail, straight figures were in vivid contrast to the undersized armies of pale recruits to which we had become accustomed. . . . Had yet another regiment been conjured out of our depleted Dominions? Then I heard an excited exclamation from a group of Sisters behind me. \"Look! Look! Here are the Americans!\" . . . The coming of relief made me reaUze how long and how intolerable had been the tension, and with the knowledge that we were not, after all, defeated I found myself beginning to cry. Victory on Land and Sea In the spring and early summer of 1918, Germany made a last desperate attempt to win victory in the West and came uncomfortably close to success. A drive starting in March nearly drove through the British lines; another in June threatened Paris. American troops helped to stop the advance. They especially distinguished themselves in a counterattack at Chateau-Thierry, less than fifty miles from the French capital. The tide turned in mid-July as Marshal Ferdinand Foch, supreme commander of all Allied armies, ordered a great counter- offensive. General John J. Pershing, leader of the American Expeditionary Force, insisted on a separate American army with its own sector of the front. The Americans were assigned the sector north and east of Verdun. In mid-Sep- tember, 550,000 \"doughboys\" won an over- whelming victory in wiping out the St. Mihiel salient. Then a still larger force drove toward the key city of Sedan through the best defended portions of the German lines. By early Novem- ber, the Americans had almost reached their objectives and were preparing to advance into Germany. British and French forces met with even greater success. When the Armistice was signed on November 11, the Allies were advanc- ing everywhere. Meanwhile, Amencan naval forces practi- cally merged with the British in war against the submarines. The invention of the depth charge provided a new weapon. Its effective use demanded hundreds of patrol vessels in the sea lanes to watch for U-boats and to convoy ships. In addition to 79 destroyers, the United States sent abroad 170 small \"sub-chasers,\" plus a variety of former yachts, tugs, and fishing boats. \"Almost any craft which could carry a wireless, a gun, and depth charges was boldly sent to sea.\" By the end of 1917 the number of U-boat victims was cut in half. Not a single loaded troop transport was sunk on the way from America to Europe. In 1918 the United States navy took the principal part in laying an anti-submarine mine barrage nearly three hundred miles across the North Sea. This went far toward bottling up the U-boats entirely.

Mobilization of Industry, Labor, and Agriculture Since modem war is a battle of production, the most obvious need was to gear American industry to the war machine. Soon the entire economic life of the country was under the con- trol of various federal agencies. The most pow- erful of these was the War Industries Board, which had charge of purchasing for both the Allies and the United States. Under the driving leadership of Bernard Baruch, a Wall Street speculator, the War Industries Board attempted \"to operate the whole United States as a single factory dominated by one management.\" En- listing the ablest business brains in America as \"doUar-a-year men,\" Baruch set up an organiza- tion that comerted factories to war production, determined priorities of raw materials, and fixed prices. Cooperating with the War Industries Board were several agencies that took over especially critical areas of American economy. The Fuel Administration conserved coal and oil by means as diverse as introducing daylight sa\\'ing time and reducing the work week of factories not in war production. The Railroad Administration took over the railroads from pri\\'ate manage- ment and ran them as a single system. Former President Taft served as co-chairman of the War Labor Board (WLB), which sought to prevent labor disputes. In return for the promise of labor leaders not to call strikes, the \\\\'LB raised wages to a point where they would \"insure the subsistence of the worker and his family in health and reasonable comfort,\" insisted on equal pay for men and women, and guaranteed unions the right to organize. Plants refusing to obey the WT^B were taken over by the govern- ment, while workers threatening strikes were told they would be denied employment in any war industry or put into the army. Under gov- ernmental encouragement wages rose rapidly, and trade unions increased their membership. The war agency that most affected civilian lives was the Food Administration, directed by Herbert Hoover, who had achieved fame in organizing relief for Belgium. With the slogan \"food will win the war,\" extraordinary efforts were made to reduce consumption and increase production. Housewives were urged to \"Hoover- ize\" by \"serving just enough\" and planning for Wheatless Wednesdays or Meatless Mon- days. To increase wheat production a federally financed Grain Corporation guaranteed farmers first $2.00, then $2.26 per bushel, and in 1918 bought the entire American wheat crop."},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"The First World War 563 Financing the War The World War was costly beyond all ex- pectation. By 1919 the federal government had spent about 33 billion dollars, of which 10 billion went to the Allies as loans. About a third of the money was raised by ta.xation, the rest by bor- rowing. The income tax was increased to a basic 12 per cent on incomes of $4,000 or more, with rates running up to 77 per cent on incomes over $1,000,000. Heavier burdens on corporations in- cluded an \"excess profits\" tax, designed to return war profits to the government. E.xcise duties were levied on items as varied as theatre tickets, chewing gum, and phonograph records. To borrow over t\\venty billion dollars, the government sold four issues of Liberty Bonds, plus a postwar issue of Victory Bonds, direct to the people. Bonds were issued in denominations as low as $25, with War Savings Stamps for as little as 100. Through posters, rallies, volunteer salesmen, \"Liberty Loan sermons,\" and persua- sion by employers, the purchase of bonds was made a test of patriotism. Even children were enlisted and urged to put their pennies in War Savings Stamps. Twenty-one million people, more than a fifth of the nation's population, subscribed to the Fourth Liberty Loan. Control of Opinion Since so much depended on voluntary ci\\il- ian cooperation, the government undertook to \"sell\" the war. A Committee on Public Infor- mation was set up under George Creel, who described his job as \"the world's greatest adven- ture in advertising.\" Creel mobilized advertising men, commercial artists, authors, songwriters, actors, orators, and motion picture companies. Millions of pamphlets explained such matters as the causes of the war and American war aims. The effect of this flood of propaganda was to reinforce Wilson's idea that the war was a crusade. While this probably heightened the war effort, it also helped to produce the ver>' intolerance that Wilson dreaded. Congress passed the Espionage and Sedition Acts, de- signed to prevent spying and disloyalty. These were so severe that they silenced opposition to the war. The Postmaster General was given au- thority to ban newspapers, magazines, and pam- phlets from the mails at his discretion. Under these laws hundreds of people were imprisoned, sometimes even for opinions expressed in pri- vate conversations. Men were e\\'en jailed for criticizing the Red Cross or the YMCA. Although they were enforced with unneces- sary vigor, the Supreme Court upheld the prin- ciple of the Espionage and Sedition Acts in a decision written by Justice Holmes. \"When a nation is at war,\" said Holmes, \"many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to the effort that their utterance will not be endured. . . .\" Holmes refused, however, to support punishment when there was no \"clear and present danger\" of hurting the United States, or when the accused were ap- parently being jailed for unpopular political beliefs. An unhappy result of enthusiasm for the war was persecution of Americans of German ancestry. Wilson's insistence that we were \"the sincere friends of the German people\" could not stand against posters displaying Germans as bloody-handed \"Huns.\" Anti-German feeling went to such ridiculous lengths as banning the teaching of the German language in schools and abandoning public performance of music by Beethoven, Schubert, and Wagner. There were super-patriots who even insisted that sauerkraut should be called \"Liberty cabbage.\" Increase In Presidential Power As in the Civil War, there was a huge in- crease in the power of the President. Instead of acting independently of Congress, as did Lincoln (see pp. 358-360), Wilson insisted that Congress formally grant him whate\\er emer-"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"564 Crusade and Disillusion gency powers he thought necessary. By a series of laws, notably the Lever Act of 1917 and the Overman Act of 1918, the President was not only gi\\en control over agriculture and indus- try, but allowed to set up or reorganize govern- ment agencies at his discretion. Such bodies as the War Labor Board \\\\ere created b\\' him without even senatorial ratification of their top officers. Thus Wilson had greater authority than any previous President. It was understood, how- ever, that these extraordinary po\\\\'ers were granted only \"for the duration,\" and that with the return of peace the President and Congress should resume their normal constitutional relations. The entrance of the United States into World War I has often been condemned as an unwise departure from the isolationist tradition of the Founding Fathers. It would ha\\'e re- quired, however, almost superhuman restraint on the part of the American government and American people to remain neutral; had they done so, a German victory might have imper- iled national safety. The war effort has been deplored because it vastly increased the power of go\\emment and led to a spirit of intoler- ance. All sacrifices in money and blood, all re- strictions on personal freedom, might have bee n justifiable if victory had led to a just and enduring peace. But such was not to be the case. WILSON'S PEACE PROGRAM Although \\\\'ilson did all in his power to crush Germany, he never ceased to think ahead to the peace that would follow victory. His peace program was crystallized in the Fourteen Points, iDublished in January 1918. The President hoped to enlist public opinion ever\\'whcre in support of this charter for a new world order. The Fourteen Points may be summarized under three headings: (1) Abolition of general causes of tear ( points 1-5 ) . This section ad\\ocated open in- stead of secret diplomacy; freedom of the seas; reduction of trade barriers; disarmament; and an impartial adjustment of colonial claims, gi\\- ing consideration to the needs of native peoples. (2) \"Self-determination\" for Europe (points 6-13). This upheld the right of peoples to live under a go\\ernment of their own choice. Thus Poland was to be an independent state; France was to get back Alsace-Lorraine; and in the Balkans new boundary' lines were to be drawn on the basis of nationality. (3) \"A general association of nations\" (point 14). The idea of an international or- ganization to prevent war was centuries old, and it now had an immense appeal because of the obvious failure of the balance of power. Wilson made it the cornerstone of his program. Although based on \"the principle of justice to all peoples and nationalities,\" the Fourteen Points bristled \\\\ ith practical difficulties. Some of the questions raised were: Would nations agree to disann? How was it possible to be \"impartial\" in assigning colonies? How to draw boundaries in areas that contained people of different nationalities? Would nations surrender enough sovereignty to a world organization to make it effecti\\e? Words as Weapons Wliate\\er the objections to Wilsons pro- gram, it helped to shorten the war. Using words as weapons, the President deliberately dro\\e a wedge between the German people and their government. He offered \"a place of equality among the nations of the world\" to Geirnany once it had thrown off the yoke of its \"military masters.\" His promise of \"self-determination\" stimulated revolts among the subject peoples of the Austrian Empire. His speeches, show- ered behind enemy lines from airplanes, weak- ened the will to fight. When the German gov-"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"The New Deal: First Phase 625 crops. In many cases the AAA actually created distress, since by reducing acreage it lessened the demand for agricultural labor and for ten- ants. AAA payments, for instance, enabled own- ers of cotton plantations to buy new farm ma- chinery, with the result that tenants were \"tractored off the land.\" Dust Bowl The New Deal had to cope with a terrible disaster that struck the Great Plains in 1934 and 1935. During World War I, prices had tempted fanners to grow wheat and cotton in the former grazing lands west of 98° longitude (see map, p. 9). Plows and harrows broke up the deep, tough sod that had previously prevented ero- sion and conserved moisture in this semi-arid region. \\\\'hen the years 1933-1935 proved un- usually dry, there was danger that the region would become a desert. Terrible dust storms carried away topsoil in such quantities that even on the Atlantic seaboard the sun was ob- scured by a yellow haze. The water table of parts of the Plains region sank so low that deep wells ran dr\\'. Bet\\\\'een 1934 and 1939 an esti- mated 350,000 fanners emigrated from the \"dust bowl.\" To take care of immediate distress. Con- gress pro\\'ided funds so that dust bowl farmers could get new seed and livestock. On a long- term basis, the Department of Agriculture dealt with the dust bowl by helping farmers to plant 190 million trees in shelter belts, which cut wind \\elocity and retained moisture. Farmers were also encouraged to restore the Plains to what they had been in the days of the cattle kingdom and earlier— a grazing region. There was much criticism of the New Deal farm program. Many farmers did not like being told how much they could plant. Deliberately creating scarcity when people were hungry seemed immoral. The benefits of the AAA were unequal. On the whole, though, the New Deal provided more direct assistance to fanners than to any other group in the population. Hundreds of thousands of families were saved from bleak poverty and despair. INDUSTRY AND LABOR The principal measure whereby the New Deal cried to promote the recovery of industry was the National Industry Recovery Act of June 1933, which Roosevelt hailed as \"probably . . . the most important and far-reaching law ever passed by the American Congress.\" It proposed a partnership of business, labor, and goxemment to attack the emergency of hard times. Much of its inspiration came from the United States Chamber of Commerce which in 1931 proposed a \"national economic council\" to balance pro- duction with consumption and to prevent cut- throat competition. If permitted to combine to control standards and prices, asserted the Chamber of Commerce, industry could keep up wages and insure workers against accidents, sickness, and old age. The law provided that representatives of management and labor draw up \"codes of fair competition.\" These were based on the notion that one of the primary causes of the depression was overproduction. The United States was a \"mature economy,\" it was argued, with a pro- ductive capacity greater than its needs. What was demanded of industry as of agriculture was controlled production, with equitable arrange- ments to divide the proceeds among different business firms and their employees. Codes were established to spread employment by reducing the length of the work week, to put a floor under wages, to allow industries to fix \"fair\" prices, and to punish \"chiselers.\" To spread business among as many firms as possible, fac- tories were usually limited to two shifts a day. Every code was supposed to have the force of law and was enforced by a \"code authority\" appointed by the President.

As head of the NRA, Roosevelt appointed a colorful, energetic ex-army officer, General Hugh S. Johnson, formerly Bernard Baruch's right-hand man in the War Industries Board. The NRA was launched with parades, fire- works, and speeches. Business firms signing code agreements were allowed to display a blue eagle with the words \"We Do Our Part.\" The beginning of the experiment was accom- panied by a revival of business confidence; pro- duction rose temporarily to 93 per cent of the 1929 figure. Soon about 600 codes had been drawn up, covering 22 million workers and nine-tenths of American business concerns. NRA in Difficulties It was not long, however, before the NRA ran into difficulties. It was easy to see that the steel and textile industries should have codes, but did the fly-swatter, dish-mop, and armored- car manufacturers each need one? Were rubber balls subject to the code for toys or to that for athletic supplies? Even more serious than con- fusion caused by trying to draw up rules for all American industry was the fact that the NRA did not work out as planned. Prices increased more rapidly than wages. While a few business-"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"The New Deal: First Phase 627 men were prosecuted for violations of NRA codes, many successful \"chiselers\" escaped no- tice. Henry Ford, the country's greatest in- dustrialist, refused to have anything to do with the NRA. In trying to promote cooperation be- tween business concerns, the NRA relaxed the antitrust laws. According to competent observ- ers the result was a great increase in monopo- listic practices and the growth of big business at the expense of small concerns. (For New Deal efforts to regulate business and control monopoly, see pp. 637, 644. ) Revival of Trade Unionism No group suffered more during the depres- sion than wage workers. In 1932 a third of the covmtry's laborers were unemployed, and the pay envelopes of the rest had shrunk. Some women earned as little as $3 a week. Many of the benefits of \"welfare capitalism\" were also withdrawn: companies running at a loss could not aflFord pensions, health plans, or vacations with pay; they could not continue profit-sharing when there were no profits to share. At the same time, labor union membership declined to its lowest point since before American entrance into Worid War I. When cooperative efforts by employer groups failed to keep wages up, there was wide- spread feeling, even outside the ranks of labor, that a way to prevent wage cuts and preserve purchasing power might be to strengthen labor unions. This trend was apparent even before Roosevelt came into office. In March 1932, President Hoover had signed the Norris-La Guardia Act, which improved the legal position of labor unions. The law declared that \"the public policy of the United States\" was that a worker should have \"full freedom\" to join a union and empower it to represent him in bar- gaining with his employer. This law went be- yond the Clayton Act in limiting the right of federal courts to issue injunctions against labor unions. It also declared that \"yellow-dog con- tracts,\" whereby a worker promised his em- ployer not to join a union, were not enforceable at law. Section 7-a Once the New Deal was lavmched, labor's right to organize received further protection. Section 7-a of the National Recovery Act pro- vided that every NRA code should guarantee the workers' right of collective bargaining and forbid employers to interfere with the forma- tion of labor unions. Section 7-a encouraged a revival of unionism. Between May and October 1933, the American Federation of Labor gained 1,500,000 new members. After a first wave of success, the new effort to enlist workers in unions stalled. The Ameri- can Federation of Labor, composed mostly of skilled workers, was not well suited to the task of organizing labor in the mass production in- dustries. Employers were generally opposed to unionization of their plants. In some cases they headed off effective organization and techni- cally complied with the Norris-La Guardia Act and Section 7-a by forming company imions of their own workers. Company unions lacked bargaining power because they had no support from outside. In 1934 the struggle to organize erupted into violence in every section of the country. Laboring men struck, demanding the right to organize as essential to their security and dig- nity; employers, usually with the local police and militia on their side, opposed unionization of their plants as an interference with their right to run their own affairs. More often than not strikes resulted in defeat for the workers. In spite of sympathy for organized labor, the Roosevelt administration could do little. A Na- tional Labor Relations Board had been set up to enforce Section 7-a, but its only weapon was to take away the blue eagle emblem.

Union men began to say that NRA stood for \"National Run Aroimd.\" They demanded of Congress more vigorous protection of the right to organize that had been guaranteed them by law. Death of NRA So strong was criticism of the NRA that in 1934 General Johnson resigned \"under a hail of dead cats,\" as he expressed it. Roosevelt attempted to keep the organization going un- der a National Recovery Board composed of representatives of industry, labor, and consum- ers, but the elaborate codes and code adminis- trations were ob- viously breaking down. Of an al- leged 155,000 cases of code vio- lations only 400 were prosecuted in the courts. It is quite possible that the NRA would have died a natural death when the act creating it expired in the summer of 1935, but QUESTION • How was the NRA like the Hoover- sponsored trade associa- tions of the 1920's? How was it di§erent? before then the Supreme Court put an end to it by declaring it unconstitutional. In a case that in\\ol\\'ed the wholesale poultry code in New York City (Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States), the court found that \"codes of fair competition\" were unlawful because Congress had no right to delegate lawmaking powers to the President and code authorities. Although Roosevelt remarked that the justices seemed to want the country to return to the horse-and- bugg>' era, he made no serious attempt to re- vive the NRA. As the next chapter will show, ho\\\\^e\\'er, manv of its features were carried on by later legislation. RELIEF MEASURES In 1933 those most in need of immediate aid were the tweh'e to fifteen million unem- ploved, manv on the verge of star\\'ation. At first Roosevelt, like Hoover, thought that relief was primarily the task of local agencies, and expected them to pro\\'ide it until industry and agriculture reco\\'ered enough to proN'ide jobs. It was soon apparent, however, that many states, municipalities, and local charities had reached the end of their resources. In May 1933, Congress therefore established a Federal Emergency Relief Administration ( FERA ) , the first of several great New Deal relief agencies. FERA made loans and outright gifts to states and municipalities, which distributed the money as they chose. They generally provided a \"dole\"— either outright pavments in money or handouts of clothing and food. The dole was the cheapest form of relief, but those receiving it for any length of time lost self-respect and technical skills. Thus it tended to make the unemployed unemployable. Partly because of the influence of Harry Hop- kins, a former social worker who eventually became Roosevelt's most intimate adviser, the New Deal turned in autumn of 1933 to a great 628"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"work relief program, the Civil Works Adminis- tration (CWA). At its height the CWA em- ployed more than 4,000,000 people. It built or improved 1,000 airports, 500,000 miles of roads, and 40,000 school buildings. Because of the very speed of the operation and Hopkins' desperate desire to get relief to people in dis- tress, some of the CWA projects were simply \"make work\" of little usefulness, to which its critics applied the term \"boondoggling.\" In 1934 Roosevelt gave in to fierce criticism from conservatives and called off the program. The CCC and PWA The most generally admired New Deal agency reflected the fact that Franklin Roose- velt, like Theodore Roosevelt before him, was an ardent conservationist. This was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which offered out- door work to unemployed, single men between 18 and 25 years of age. The basic wage was $30 a month, of which $22 went back to the boy's family. By the midsummer of 1933, the CCC had established 1,500 camps and put 300,- 000 young men into wilderness areas. They planted trees, cleaned beaches, fought blights, made reservoirs, and checked erosion. But the most important work of the CCC was to check human erosion. The average CCC boy returned to his home after six months or a year ten or fifteen pounds heavier, better disciplined, im- proved in health, and with a heightened sense of self-respect. A section of the National Industrial Recov- ery Act of 1933 established a Public Works Administration (PWA), which Roosevelt put under the direction of his able Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes. A cautious, scrupulously honest man who wanted to make sure that not a dollar was wasted, Ickes tried to see that all projects undertaken by PWA were useful, well planned, and efficiently administered. It was therefore some time before PWA had much The appalling human wastage of the depression, with a third of the working men of the country unable to find employment and dependent on inadequate relief, is suggested by this picture of a despairing man in a San Francisco breadline in 1933. effect on employment, but eventually it en- gaged in projects in 99 per cent of the counties of the country. It built great dams, sewer sys- tems, waterworks, even cruisers and aircraft carriers. Generally PWA worked through pri- vate contractors, rather than hiring men di- rectly. Help for Home Owners The depression saw many families lose their homes when mortgages were foreclosed.

A Federal Housing Agency, established in 1934, also helped to revive the hard-hit construction industry by guarantee- ing bank loans to pay for new housing and home repairs. These agencies promoted much- needed reform in methods of writing and re- paying mortgages so that borrowers were pro- tected from excessive rates of interest and were enabled to pay off the principal in a reasonable period of time. SOCIAL PLANNING: THE TVA While most early New Deal laws were stop- gap emergency measures, the Roosevelt admin- istration also engaged in one dramatic adven- ture in longtime social and economic planning. In May 1933, Congress, under Roosevelt's prod- ding, established a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) designed to promote the well-being of the immense area drained by the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers. The authority itself was a new type of federal agency; as the Presi- dent described it to Congress, it was to be \"a corporation clothed with the power of govern- ment but possessed of the initiative and flexi- bility of a private enteiprise.\" It was given im- mense powers and endowed with ample funds. The most notable fact about the Tennessee Valley area before the TVA was the way its natural resources had been exploited or wasted. Forests had been cut off, and most of the farmers eked out a bare living on exhausted"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"The New Deal: First Phase 631 land. Heavy rainfalls contributed to erosion and caused disastrous floods. Over half the people of the Valley were on relief in 1933. Under a three-man board of directors, the TVA set about with \\igor to change all this. Employing as many as 40,000 men at a time, it built or improved 25 great dams, moved farmers from marginal lands, reforested mil- lions of acres, established power plants and fer- tilizer factories, and e\\en built new towns. The Tennessee Ri\\'er became a great inland water- way, o\\er 600 miles long, carrying a heavy freight of barges. The new man-made lakes and public parks provided recreation areas. Perhaps the most notable changes resulted from the immense arpount of cheap electricity that TVA produced. In 1933 only two of ever>' hun- dred farms in the Valley had electricity; by 1960 practically all had it. This improved agri- culture by enabling farmers to install refriger- ators, milking machines, and cream separators. It reduced the back-breaking toil of housewives by enabling them to buy washing machines and electric stoves. It attracted heavy industry to the Vallev. the country as a whole. For the federal goxem- ment to socialize production of private power was, they argued, a form of robbery. Defenders of TVA argued that promotion of a single region helped the country as a whole: prosperity is indivisible. They argued that the yardstick worked. Utility rates all o\\er the country were reduced in the 1930's and 1940's, yet power companies made more money than ever, because lower rates meant more varied use of electricity. As to the charge that TVA was a communistic measure, its propo- nents pointed to American precedents for the socialization of natural monopolies. Like the Erie Canal, TVA was action by government that stimulated private enterprise. Opponents of TVA were persuasive and powerful enough to see that no other river authorities were granted such great powers as it enjoyed. The federal go\\'emment did, how- ever, build other power plants. The most fa- mous of these was the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River, the largest structure ever made by man except for the Great Wall of China. Criticism of TVA The T\\'A recei\\ed a barrage of criticism. It was denounced as a communist measure, as a gigantic pork barrel, as a robbery of the rest of the country to benefit a particular section. Abo\\e all, it was attacked by private power companies. One purpose of TVA was to pro- vide a \"yardstick\" whereby it might be possible to assess fair rates for electricity all over the country. In the Valley itself rates charged to consumers were cut by two-thirds. But repre- sentatives of private utilities argued that the TVA yardstick was unfair, and was arrived at only by writing off part of the costs of produc- ing electricity' to flood control and navigation. The private utilities were even more alarmed by TVA as a threat to their ver>' existence, in the Valley at once and perhaps eventually in ATTACKS ON THE NEW DEAL In 1934 Roosevelt deliberately gave the country a rest. The great flood of must legisla- tion, enacted at the insistence of the White House, dwindled to a trickle. The President attempted to woo the business communit}', as was seen by the dismantling of the great Civil Works Administration. He played down parti- sanship and attempted to win the support of progressive Republicans in Congress. But most of the great leaders of the business community now opposed him.

Da\\'id Lawrence wrote that the New Deal, with its \"maelstrom of centralized order-giving . . . more strongly resembles the dictatorship of the Fascistic or Commimistic states of Europe than it does the American system.\" Cartoonists ridiculed Roosevelt's brain trust and portrayed Uncle Sam at the mercy of crackpot professors who dosed him with strange foreign medicines that had been made in Moscow. Roosevelt countered the attacks by direct appeals to the people. In the early fall of 1934, he traveled across the coimtry and everywhere was met by crowds of admirers, sometimes simply standing at a grade crossing to wave as the presidential train went by. In a fireside chat in late June he put it to the people: \"The simplest way for you to judge recovery lies in the plain facts of your individual situation. Are you better off than you were last year? Are your debts less burdensome? Is your bank ac- count more secure? Are your working condi- tions better? Is your faith in your own indi- vidual future more firmly grounded?\" Mid-term Elections, 1934 The attacks on Roosevelt were so extreme that they boomeranged, and in any case the Republican Party was handicapped. Its titular leader, Hoover, had been repudiated at the polls in 1932, and the party presented no alter- native to the New Deal. In the congressional elections of 1934 the Democrats increased their majorities in both houses. This was the first time such a thing had happened in a mid- term election since the Radical Repubhcan sweep of 1866. At the state level the results were equally decisive. Only 7 of 48 state gover- nors were Republicans. The New Deal had apparently won a great vote of confidence from the people. But the victory was less than it appeared. The depres- sion was not ciu-ed. MiUions of Americans were still hungry and hving in quiet despair. They favored Roosevelt over his foes, but they began to demand more than the New Deal had done for them yet. Activities: Chapter 26 For Mastery and Review 1.

ROOSEVELT As the last chapter suggested, the New Deal failed to stem a mounting tide of unrest among the underprivileged. Ten million people were still unemployed as the year 1935 began. They received just enough relief to keep them and their families alive. The circumstances under which they received their miserable dole were usually humiliating. In rural districts, small farmers and tenants were being driven off the land. Everywhere, millions of elderly people faced stark misery, without savings, pensions, medical care, or hope. Here was an explosive mixture of suffering and discontent. \"THUNDER ON THE LEFT\" Much more of a threat to the Roosevelt administration than the prostrate Republican Party or the Liberty League was \"thunder on the left\" from radical critics of the New Deal. There was a rising demand for drastic action to deal with the fact, as Roosevelt later ex- pressed it himself, that one-third of the nation was \"ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.\" Upton Sinclair, the former muckraking novelist, nearly won the governorship of California in 1934 by ad\\ocating a plan to \"End Poverty in Califor- nia\" through setting up cooperative colonies of the unemployed. Dr. Francis Townsend, a for- mer public health officer shocked by the plight of older people, proposed that the federal gov- ernment give e\\'ery retired person over sixty a pension of $200 per month, to be paid for by a national sales tax. He won a fanatical follow- ing numbering millions, organized into thou- sands of Townsend clubs, who sang \"Onward Townsend Soldiers\" and insisted that Congress act at once. Another pied piper of the dis- tressed was Father Charles E. Coughlin, the \"Radio Priest,\" whose broadcasts were heard by an audience said to reach the amazing total of 40,000,000 people. Although originally a supporter of Roose\\'elt, Coughlin charged that the New Deal had sold out to the bankers.

The most dangerous left-wing foe of the New Deal appeared to be Huey Long, senator from Louisiana. With the fer\\'id backing of the rural poor, he had become a dictator in his own state. He was now bidding for national power; he even wrote a book entitled My First Days in the White House. With a folksy, hu- morous manner and a gift for pungent expres- sion. Long knew how to win audiences. He proposed to make \"Every Man a King\" by confiscating the property of the wealthy and giving every family a home and $2,000 a year, with free college education- for the children. His followers were organized in \"Share Our Wealth\" clubs. Postmaster James A. Farley, Roosevelt's campaign manager, conducted a secret poll which indicated that if the senator ran for President on a third-party ticket in 1936, he might receive three or four million votes, possibly enough to give him the balance of power between the Democratic and Repub- lican parties. The threat never materialized, be- cause in September 1935, Long was assassi- nated by a political opponent. Shift to the Left Roosevelt did not engage in public debate with his left-wing critics, but in his annual message to Congress in January 1935, he indi- cated that he was prepared to put the New Deal on a new tack. He admitted that in spite of all efiForts, \"we have not weeded out the overprivileged and we have not eflFectively lifted up the underprivileged.\" He proposed that the federal government dedicate itself to providing greater security for its citizens. Un- der pressure both from the President and from a large segment of the public. Congress headed off the extreme demands of share-the-wealth advocates by a new program of legislation. The second phase of the New Deal had the same over-all objectives as the first— recovery, relief, and reform. But now the emphasis was more on reform, less on short-term, emergency measures. There was greater concern for the less fortunate members of society, and at the same time the attempt to enlist the support of the business community was abandoned. Like the Populists and progressives before them, the New Dealers now tried to restrain business through tighter controls and attacks on mo- nopoly. In government finance, the New Deal drifted from its earlier conser\\'atism. Efforts to balance the budget became weaker and were finally discarded entirely. New taxes were frankly designed to redistribute wealth, al- though not to the degree demanded by Father Coughhn or Huey Long. The political alignment behind the New Deal was also altered. In 1932 Roosevelt had received support from all segments of the popu- lation, including the business community. Partisanship was played down, as he sought the votes of moderate and progressive Repub- licans. Now there was greater emphasis on the Democratic party organization. The traditional basis of Democratic strength— the Solid South and northern city machines— was reinforced by a coalition of organized labor and organized farmers: the alliance that the Populists at- tempted in the 1890's. In addition, the Demo- cratic party now received more backing than ever from the underprivileged. Work Relief: WPA and Other Agencies The most immediate result of the shift in attitude that marked the new trend was the President's demand for large-scale work relief. The unemployables would continue to live on doles administered by local agencies, but the federal government would provide useful em- ployment for all who were able and willing to work. \"We must,\" Roosevelt told Congress,"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"636 The Roosevelt Years \"preserve not only the bodies of the unem- ployed from destitution, but also their self- respect, their self-reliance and courage and determination.\" Responding to the President's request. Con- gress appropriated $5,000,000,000 in April 1935 for \"work relief and to increase emplo>'ment by pro\\'iding useful projects.\" An immense new agency, the W'orks Progress Administration (WPA) was set up under Harry Hopkins. The WPA embodied Hopkins' conviction that the first purpose of relief was to \"help men keep their chins up and their hands in.\" He at- tempted to see that no matter what skills a man or woman possessed, the WPA would pro- vide a chance to use them in a way that would benefit society. And so, in addition to the more ob\\aous work relief projects, such as building schools and making roads, the WPA found em- ployment for \"white collar\" workers— librarians, writers, teachers, musicians, actors, and artists. WPA projects included theatrical performances, symphony concerts, state guide books, traveling libraries, and mural paintings in post offices. There was ine\\atable inefficiency and \"boon- doggling,\" but on balance the WPA produced social benefits for the rest of the countr\\' as well as for those it rescued from bread lines. The \\\\TA was supplemented by other new relief agencies. A Resettlement Administration (RA) attempted, without much success, to re- establish po\\ert\\'-stricken farmers on the land. A Rural Electrification Administration (REA) extended power lines into farming areas not reached by private utilities. A \"junior WPA,\" the National Youth Administration (NYA), helped high school and college students to con- tinue their education by providing part-time work, such as typing and library cataloguing. Meanwhile, pre\\'iously established agencies continued to operate. The Reconstruction Fi- nance Corporation lent large sums to business and to local governments. The CCC put twice as many \\'oung men as before to work in the open air. The PWA now rolled into high gear and provided employment for hundreds of thousands of men on great public works. Social Security Life in the pre-industrial \\illage society had been marked by unremitting toil, by high mor- tality from disease, and sometimes— when crops failed— by desperate want. But there had been no unemployment, and no business cycles of alternating prosperity and depression. Old people and orphans had been taken care of, because on farms there was usually \"room for one more.\" But even in good times the modem city worker was subject to unpredicta- ble loss of employment. When too old to work, he often had no place to go but the poorhouse. To deal with this fundamental problem of in- security. Congress passed the Social Security Act of 1935. This was the one New Deal meas- ure clearly inspired by foreign examples. Social security measures, first tried in Germany in the 1880's, had spread through western Europe, as well as to Australia and New Zealand. They had also been tried out in the United States by state governments and private employers. The Social Securit)' Act was a complex measure. It furnished the states with money grants to assist them in caring for dependent children, cripples, \"unemployables,\" and the blind. The federal government financed state programs of unemploNTnent insurance through a payroll tax paid by employers. The act set up a national system of old age and surxdvors pensions varying from $15 to $85 per month; the money came partly from pay deductions, partly from employer contributions. The Social Security Act had many flaws. Some of the provisions for financing it were unworkable; the benefits it provided were meager and insufficient. The act specifically ex- cluded protection for some who needed it most,"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"such as agricultural laborers, domestic help, and sailors in the merchant marine. Neverthe- less, the establishment of the social security system was a landmark in the history of the United States. It established the principle that an industrial society has a responsibility toward those it casts out of employment and those too old to work. Eventually, many of the in- justices and omissions of the original law were repaired. Extension of Federal Control over Business Several pieces of legislation passed in 1935 revealed that the New Deal's earlier efforts to win the support of the business community had been abandoned. Federal regulation of private enterprise was extended; new efforts were made to curb monopoly; and heavier taxes were levied on wealth. By the earlier banking legislation of 1933, ultimate control of banking practices remained with private bankers, especially those who were directors of the nine Federal Reserve Banks, and among the Federal Reserve Banks especially that of New York. The Banking Act of 1935 centered control of the Federal Reserve system in a seven-man Board of Governors ap- pointed by the President. Now such funda- mental decisions as whether to expand or contract currency and credit by raising or lowering the rediscount rate (see p. 523) were made in Washington rather than on Wall Street. Another expansion of federal regulation was the Motor Carrier Act which put inter- state bus and truck lines under the Interstate Commerce Commission. One of the major agencies of monopolistic control of industry was the holding company (see text and diagram, pp. 583-584). Some of the worst abuses of the device were found in the field of pubhc utilities. In 1935 an esti- mated three-quarters of the electric light and power companies of the United States were © Walt Disney Productions \"Three Little Pigs\" was a favorite Walt Disney ani- mated cartoon. The little pigs, threatened by the wolf who would \"blow their house down,\" sing triumph- antly, \"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?\" controlled by thirteen holding company groups. They were used not merely to centralize con- trol, but to siphon off immense profits and to conceal serious breaches of business ethics. \"A holding company,\" remarked Will Rogers, \"is a thing where you hand an accomphce the goods while the policeman searches you.\" There was, however, a wholly legitimate use for hold- ing companies in the utilities field. They pro- moted efficiency by coordinating the fimctions of local operating companies, and effected economies through centralized purchasing, au- diting, and engineering. In the summer of 1935, Roosevelt had a bill introduced into Con- gress which provided for a \"death sentence\" on holding companies. After a prolonged and bit- ter fight, a law was passed that essentially em- bodied the President's wishes. Over a period of years, holding companies in the utilities field were to be abolished save where, in the opinion of the Federal Power Commission and the Securities Exchange Commission, they were useful in promoting efficiency."},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY A.

CRAFT UNIONS PLASTERING ELECTRICAL WORK CARPENTERS' UNION PLASTERERS' UNION ELECTRICIANS' UNIONS PLUMBING PLUMBERS' UNION In the \"horizontal\" organization, represented by the American Federation of Labor (AFL), workers belong to unions representing crafts, and several unions may work on the same project. In the \"vertical\" organiza- tion of the Congress for Industrial Organization (CIO), all workers in an industry belong to the same union. Throughout the first years of the New Deal, income and corporation taxes remained at the modest levels fixed when Andrew Mellon was Secretary of the Treasury (see p. 579). Now Roosevelt proposed new taxes that would fall with special weight on large accumulations of wealth. The President was apparently not especially interested in increasing federal reve- nues. Instead, he intended to head off the vari- ous \"share the wealth\" schemes that had at- tracted large public support. He also hoped to reduce concentration of economic power. The Revenue Act of 1935 which finally emerged from Congress laid new surtaxes on incomes over $50,000. Inheritance taxes were also im- posed, with a top of 70 per cent.

It set up a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which had power to hold secret elections in factories to find out whether workers wanted to join a union. It could order employers to stop anti- union activities, arbitrate grievances, and rein- state workers dismissed for union activities. For a time, employers resisted the National Labor Relations Act as an interference with their right to run their plants as they chose and as a violation of the worker's right to \"freedom of contract.\" But after the Supreme Court upheld the law in 1937 in a decision written by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, the NLRB be- came generally effective. . The Wagner Act stimulated a burst of labor union activity', marked by the appearance of a new national labor organization. As has already been suggested, the American Federation of Labor was ill equipped both in philosophy and in structure to organize the great mass pro- duction industries, such as radio, steel, automo- bile, and textile. Soon there arose within the AFL a group of energetic labor leaders who called themselves the Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO). Its principal figure was John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers, one of the most aggressive, colorful, and controversial figures in the history of Amer- ican labor. Lewis proposed that all workers, skilled and unskilled, be organized in industrial or vertical unions in place of the craft or hori- zontal organization of the AFL (study the dia- gram on p. 638). The rise of the CIO caused a bitter dispute as old-line leaders of the AFL, led by President William Green, foresaw that the type of organization demanded by Lewis would disrupt existing craft unions. Eventually, the CIO seceded from the AFL to form its own national organization with the same initials but a different title, the Congress of Industrial Or- ganizations. Success of the CIO In 1936 the CIO attacked the strongest cita- del of the open shop— the steel industry. Under the leadership of PhiHp Murray, four hundred organizers went through the steel towTis dis- tributing pamphlets, holding meetings, and buttonholing workers. Within a few months, they signed up enough members to threaten a nation-wide strike. The strike never occurred, because in March 1937, John L. Lewis, now president of the CIO, and Myron C. Taylor, chairman of the board of the United States Steel Corporation, announced that they had settled their differences. To the amazement of the country, \"Big Steel\" granted a wage in- crease, reduced the work week to 40 hours, and recognized the CIO steel union as bargain- ing agent for its members. By 1941 the CIO had signed contracts with the entire steel in- dustry. Its attempt to organize the \"Little Steel\" companies was achieved, however, only after a struggle so bitter that it resulted in bloodshed. Meanwhile, the CIO had moved into the automobile industry. Although hourly rates in the industry were high, seasonal layoffs reduced the average wage to less than $1,000 per year. Workers also had a strong sense of grievance against the speed-up which occurred when management increased the rate at which cars moved along the assembly hne. The auto work- ers were difficult to organize. Mostly unskilled, they tended to change jobs when dissatisfied rather than to try for better conditions. The em- ployers actively discouraged union membership, partly by exploiting racial and religious antag- onisms among Negroes, southern Protestant whites, and Roman Catholics of Polish and Bo- hemian descent. In 1936, however, the CIO granted a charter to the United Auto Workers Union ( U AW ) . Under the leadership of Homer S. Martin, a former preacher, the UAW enrolled thousands of workers."},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"640 The Roosevelt Years CIO leaders did not want to challenge the automobile industry until the struggle with the steel companies ended, but locals of the UAW forced their hand early in 1937 by starting sit- down strikes in several General Motors plants.

They were peaceful, yet they were an il- legal occupation of employers' property, and the workers made it plain that they would leave only if forced out by troops. Finally, to avoid violence, General Motors gave in and signed a contract with the UAW. By 1941 the other auto- mobile companies also recognized the union. Sit-downs were abandoned, however, both be- cause they were against the law and because they caused public resentment. As a result of the foregoing developments, the number of workers in labor imions in- creased from less than 3 milhon in 1933 to nearly 9 milhon in 1939. Never in American history had the economic and political power of a large section of the population grown so rapidly. THE NEW DEAL ON TRIAL As we have seen, the New Deal came under constant attack, both from those who thought it did not go far enough and from those who thought that it went too far. To homegrowTi radicals, such as Upton Sinclair, Huey Long, and Father Coughlin, the New Deal relief and social security measures were mere \"cnimbs from the rich man's table.\" To SociaUsts, such as the perennial presidential candidate Norman Thomas, the New Deal was simply an attempt to patch up capitahsm and to \"plan scarcity.\" Thomas could find a good word to say only for the TV A— \"a beautiful flower in a garden of weeds.\" The Communists at first denounced Roosevelt as a \"fascist\" who pretended to be a friend of the toilers, but was really a tool of the bankers and trusts. The Commimist party was opposed to all New Deal efforts at recovery and reform because it feared they would satisfy the masses and put back the day when the workers would rise and overthrow their capitalist masters. In 1935, however, or- ders came from Moscow for a change in the \"party line\": Communists were now ordered to ahgn themselves with all \"progressive\" forces against fascists and reactionaries. The party, therefore, switched to support of the New Deal. Party members attempted to infil- trate trade imions, youth groups, and federal agencies. The second phase of the New Deal, with its concern for those afflicted with poverty, weakened its left wing critics, and the assassi- nation of Huey Long removed their most effec- tive leader. But the new ' Tiard line\" against big business and the \"soak the rich\" taxes stimu- lated opposition from the right. The majority of the newspapers of the country turned against the Roosevelt administration, as did most businessmen and many professional men, such as lawyers, doctors, and engineers. Many Roosevelt opponents worked themselves into fury at \"That Man in the White House\" (or simply \"That Man\"). They convinced them- selves that he was a Sociahst or Commimist in disguise, a would-be dictator as dangerous to American hberties as a Mussolini, a Stalin, or a Hitler. Eleanor Roosevelt was denounced with equal fervor."},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"The New Deal: Second Phase 641 The Election of 1936 On the eve of the 1936 presidential election, the Democrats renominated Roosevelt by ac- clamation and enthusiastically endorsed the New Deal. The President set the tone of his campaign in his acceptance speech in which he said that he was engaged in a war to tree the country from the \"economic royalists\" who had sought to enslave its people. The shift in support for him since 1932 was revealed by the fact that businessmen contributed only about a fifth or a sixth as much proportionately in 1936 as in 1932. But the CIO contributed three-quarters of a million dollars. In spite of the prediction of his campaign manager, James Farley, that he would carry every state except Maine and Vermont, Roosevelt took no chances and campaigned vigorously. He rang constant changes on the theme that the common people were tar better ofi than in the dark days when he took office in 1933. The Republicans, up against the most popu- lar Democrat since Andrew Jackson, faced a bleak prospect. Their candidate tor President was Alfred M. Landon, a popular and moder- ately progressive governor of Kansas. They de- nounced Roosevelt for \"usurping\" power, en- dangering \"the American system of free Fiorello H. LaGuardia, Municipal Reformer \"When I make a mistake, it's a beaut!\" Few politicians have had the courage or the good sense to make such a statement. But then, \"the Little Flower\" was no ordinary politician. An Episcopalian of Italian ancestry with a Jewish mother, LaGuardia symbolizes the coalition politics that have developed in many American cities in an effort to find answers to the problems of urban life. LaGuardia was a congressman from East Harlem for more than a decade, during which time he made an enviable record in the fights against prohibition and child labor. He is best known for the Norris-LaGuardia Act, which regulates the use of the injunction in labor disputes. But his greatest achievements came as mayor of New York City from 1933 to 1945. A roly-poly, five-foot-two dynamo, he galvanized the city and brought it out of the doldrums of the depression. He fought against the gangsters, unified the subway system, restored the city's credit, reorganized the civil service, established a city planning commission, and led the fight for greater democracy in city govern- ment by reform of the city's charter. At the same time, he chased fire engines and read the comics over the city-owned radio station during a newspaper strike so the \"kids\" would not miss Dick Tracy. During his administration the city led the country in building massive complexes of low-cost housing, as well as parks, play- grounds, bridges, airports, and highways. Although a life-long Republican in a solidly Democratic city, LaGuardia out- maneuvered Tammany Hall and was elected for three four-year term;-.. He claimed, \"I could run on a laundry ticket and beat these bums.\" He added sJyIe and verve to politics, at the same time bringing honesty and good government. As he summed up his work, \"Our theory of municipal government is an experiment to try to prove that nonpartisan, nonpolitical local government is possible \" (Theme 3, see p. xll)"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"642 The Roosevelt Years enterprise,\" and sending out \"swarms of in- spectors to harass our people.\" Their platform supported, however, most of the essential fea- tures of the New Deal, such as relief for the unemployed, protection of labor's right to or- ganize, and subsidies for agricultuj-e. Landon enjoyed the support of a number of conser\\'a- tive Democrats, including Al Smith, and most of the press. The Literary Digest poll, which had correctly predicted the winner of every presidential election since 1916, foretold a Re- publican victory. When the returns came in on November 3, Farley's prediction as to the result proved to be right. The Republicans carried only Maine and Vermont, as Roosevelt won by the largest margin since Monroe's all-but-unanimous elec- tion in 1820. A Union party with William Lemke, a radical farm leader from North Da- kota as its candidate, and with the endorsement of Father Coughlin and Dr. Townsend, polled close to a million votes. The Sociahsts and Communists won only negligible support. The Congressional elections were almost as one- sided. Only 17 of 96 senators and 89 of 435 members of the House were Republicans. A\\Tiv had the Literart/ Digest poll gone wrong? The answer to this question explains the nature of the new political coalition that supported Roosevelt. The Literary Digest based its prediction on replies to postcards sent to a random sampling of names in the telephone book. Thus it was weighted in favor of the upper-income levels of the population. A large proportion of those who voted for Roosevelt, especially in the cities, did not have telephones. An element in the result, although not a deci- sive one, was that for the first time the Negro vote was cast for a Democratic candidate. Four years earlier. Republican politicians in Negro city wards noted, \"They're getting tired of Lincoln.\" Negroes, who were too apt to be \"first fired, last hired,\" owed much to the New Deal relief policies. Their gratitude was shown at the election booths. The Supreme Court Fight The 1936 elections apparently gave Roose- velt and the immense Democratic majority in Congress a mandate from the people to expand the New Deal. Roosevelt indicated in his Sec- ond Inaugural Address that he intended to pro- pose new legislation to aid the \"one-third of a nation\" that suffered from want. Rut before the New Deal could go on, it had first to reckon wdth the Supreme Court. During 1935 and 1936, the Supreme Cotirt had declared unconstitutional a number of major New Deal laws. The destruction of NRA, which has already been mentioned, was fol- lowed by a decision ( United States v. Butler ) that invalidated the Agricultural Adjustment Act. In declaring the AAA unconstitutional the majority of the court made the amazing asser- tion that the production of great staple crops, such as wheat and cotton, which were sold all over the country, was \"a purely local activity.\" The court denied both to the states and to the federal government the right to set minimum wages, leaving a \"no man's land\" wholly out- side the sphere of governmental action. Laws designed to ease the debt burden and to sa\\'e municipalities from bankruptcy were declared to deprive creditors of property \"without due process of law.\" Never had the Supreme Court invalidated so much legislation. Furthermore, laws that had not yet come before the justices were widely disobeyed. Thus employers openly defied the National Labor Relations Roard, trusting that the Supreme Court would strike down the Wagner Act. During Roosevelt's first term, no Supreme Court justice had died or resigned, so that for the first time since Madison's second term in oflRce the President had no opportimity to make new appointments. Of the \"nine old men\" on"},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"the court, seven had been appointed by Re- pubhcan Presidents. The court was divided between four extreme conservatives, three lib- erals, and two \"swing men\" who voted some- times one way and sometimes another. The country was presented with the spectacle of laws that affected millions of people, passed by large majorities in Congress, being sup- ported or rejected by margins of 6 justices to 3 or 5 to 4. The unpredictable opinion of one or two men o\\'erweighed the collective judg- ment of the President and Congress. Much as Old Hickory considered the elec- tion of 1832 a command to destroy the Bank of the United States, Roosevelt apparently thought his sweeping victory in 1936 justified him in curbing the Supreme Court. In Febru- ary 1937, without prior consultation with most of his close advisers or with Democratic lead- ers in Congress, the President presented legisla- tion to reorganize the entire federal judicial system. Along with useful schemes for reform of the lower courts was a provision that the President might appoint one extra member to the Supreme Court for every justice over seventy years of age. This meant that the court might be increased from nine to fifteen mem- bers. In presenting this plan, the President argued that the court needed \"younger blood\" to enable it \"to recognize and apply the essen- tial concepts of justice in the hght of the needs and facts of an ever-changing world.\" The \"court-packing\" bill caused a revolt in the President's own QUESTION . Should P^^tv'. Alarmed changes in the composi- by the threat to tion of the Supreme Court the independence he left to the chance of of the judiciary, justices dying or resign- enough Demo- •ng? crats joined the Republicans in Congress to defeat the President's proposal, after a legislative battle that went on for more When Roosevelt attacked the Supreme Court, he pro- voked such violent criticism that his \"court-packing\" proposal was defeated. This cartoon suggests that the proposed new justices would have been mere \"rubber stamps.\" than five months. The President thus suffered a major defeat; he also lost the confidence of many who had up to now gi\\'en him whole- hearted support. He claimed, however, that he had lost the battle but won the campaign. Even before the court-packing bill was de- feated, the court had apparently reversed itself. In two 5-to-4 decisions, it supported the consti- tutionality of the Social Secimty and National Labor Relations acts. In any e\\'ent, the character of the court soon changed, as older justices retired and were replaced by other men. Recession, 1937-1938 By 1937 the economy had recovered so far that it was close to the level of 1929, although the gnawing problem of widespread unemploy- ment still remained. Roosevelt's financial ad- visers feared another period of wild lending such as marked the 1920's; they also advised a cutback in spending in order to bring the fed- eral budget into balance. The Federal Reserve banks therefore tightened credit, and the \\\\TA cut the number it employed by half. Bimiper crops brought huge farm surpluses and a col- lapse in agricultural prices. The economy soon plummeted down into what the New Dealers"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"644 The Roosevelt Years called a \"recession\", and their opponents, a \"Roosevelt depression.\" Industrial production dropped by one-third, almost do\\Mi to the levels of 1932. The President blamed the slimip on busi- nessmen who, he claimed, had sabotaged re- covery by failure to invest in new producti\\'e capacity, and by monopolistic practices that kept prices at artificially high levels. Business- men naturally blamed the President, saying that the extravagance and experimentation of the New Deal had destroyed confidence. To meet the new economic crisis the Presi- dent called Congress into special session, and it voted to pump new billions into work relief programs and subsidies to agriculture. The new flood of pump-priming brought a quick re\\Tival of business activity at the cost of a greater federal deficit. Last New Deal Measures In 1938 Congress passed a number of New Deal measures that carried out earlier policies. A Fair Labor Standards Act abolished child labor and proxaded for a ceiling on hours and a floor imder wages, at least for most workers engaged in businesses classified as \"interstate commerce.\" A new Farm Settlement Adminis- tration was established to promote the well- being of poverty-stricken farmers and was more effective than the earlier Resettlement Administration in doing so. A new AAA at- tempted to cope with the ever-present diflBculty of surpluses by paying farmers not merely to take land out of production but also to im- prove the soil and control erosion. It also pro- vided facilities so that surpluses could be stored from year to year, with the purpose of proWding an \"ever normal granary.\" A food stamp plan helped to end the scandal of him- ger in the midst of plenty by distributing \\vith- out charge surplus agricultural products among those on relief. The anti-monopoly philosophy of the second phase of the New Deal was seen when Con- gress established a Temporary National Eco- nomic Committee (TNEC) to conduct an ex- hausti\\'e investigation of American business practices. The committee collected mountains of testimony, and some of it revealed that busi- ness concerns engaged in price-fixing, in de- hberate creation of scarcity, in agreements not to compete, and in abuse of patent laws. By the time its reports came out, however, the United States was at war, and there was little interest in enacting new anti-monopoly legisla- tion. During 1938 and 1939, Thurman Arnold, the vigorous head of the Antitrust Di\\-ision of the Department of Justice, did, however, con- duct over 200 investigations of monopolistic practices. He brought nearly 100 cases of al- leged Ndolations of the Sherman and Clayton acts into court. He was able to get a number of industries to agree to abandon practices that destroyed competition and hurt the con- sumer. End of the New Deal The legislation described in the foregoing section was by no means all that Roosevelt asked for. A congressional coalition of Republi- cans and conservative southern Democrats was increasingly effective in thwarting New Deal measures. In 1938, therefore, Roose\\'elt threw his weight in primarv' elections against the \"copperheads\" in his party and in favor of liberal Democrats. This attempted \"purge\" ended in defeat. The President's interference in local politics was resented, and in most cases the conser\\'ative Democrats won. In the mid- term elections, furthermore, the Republicans staged a modest comeback, picking up eight seats in the Senate and 81 seats in the House. The Republican-southern Democratic coalition was now more powerful than e\\'er, and was able to \\eto further extension of the New Deal."},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"An example of the work of the Public Works Administration is the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River. The largest structure of its kind in the world (4,173 feet long and 550 feet high), it harnesses the river to provide water power, irrigation of arid land, and flood control. Roosevelt accepted the judgment of the voters. In his annual message to Congress in January 1939, he announced that at least for the time being he would urge no new pro- grams of reform. Instead, he turned his atten- tion to the ominous world situation and the imminent threat of World War II. AN ESTIMATE OF THE NEW DEAL The New Deal was a movement of bevWl- dering complexity and contradiction; it spelled no more sense, it was charged, than alphabet soup. And yet certain patterns emerged. It was clear, for instance, that the power and sphere of action of the President were greatly en- larged. Congress could thwart the President and occasionally act independently of him, but the initiative in law-making had moved down Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House. It was even more clear that the scope of federal power had increased enor- mously, as the central government assumed many functions previously reserved for states and municipalities, such as the regulation of conditions of labor and the provision of relief for the poor. In its day-to-day attempts to deal with the economic crisis, the New Deal operated on no consistent economic theory. It was damned with equal fervor by Jaissez-faire economists and by socialists. Yet in retrospect we can see that something in between traditional capitalism and socialism had emerged, combining features of both. The essential structure of private own- ership was disturbed only in the area of the production and distribution of electricity, and even there only marginally. Elsewhere, the ownership of the means of production and dis- tribution of goods and services continued in private hands. Profit remained the dominant motive. On the other hand, the federal govern- ment became the \"senior partner\" in the eco- nomic system, with power to intervene in the interest of stability and individual welfare. Ac- cording to Mario Einaudi, who saw America with the perspective of a profound knowledge of European politics, the New Deal had foimd a middle way: It demonstrated that a strong public hand did not mean exclusion of private efiForts. It viewed un- der a fresh light the old disputes about property rights and, against the Marxist doctrine, it made clear the possibility of bringing to private property"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"646 The Roosevelt Years a sense of its dut>' to the community at large, with- out interfering at all with its formal structure.

It moved by fits and starts, and there was some justice in the complaint of businessmen that its unpre- dictability made for lack of confidence. For all its genuine concern with the unfortunate, its relief efforts were spotty and sometimes unfair. Little was done, QUESTION • Under con- for instance, for ditions like those df the one of the poor- 1930's, icould you vote in est and most e.\\- favor of a program such ploited segments as the New Deal? of the population —farm labor, es- pecially in the South. Those who benefited most from the New Deal were those best able to exert political pressure, especially organized labor and the farm organizations. So the most powerful got the handouts rather than the most in need. For all its shortcomings, the New Deal ac- complished much. In the field of conser\\'ation, it made a determined attack on the terrible exploitation and waste of natural resources that had been characteristic of the United States from the first. Of equal importance was the consenation of human resources effected by the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Social Se- curity Act, and the great relief agencies. Above all, the Roose\\'elt administration preserved faith in democratic processes at a time when de- mocracy in the western world was on the de- fensi\\'e or in retreat. As the next chapter will explain in more detail, the existence of free governments in all Europe, indeed in the whole world, was threatened by the rise of the fascist dictators, Mussolini and Hitler. The 1930's saw one country after another succumb to their agents, their allies, or their imitators. The New Deal showed that it was not necessary to sacri- fice liberty' to achieve economic security or effective government. Roosevelt was fully aware of the world-wide significance of \\vhat he was attempting. In 1936 he said: In this world of ours in other lands, there are some people, who, in times past, have lived and fought for freedom, and seem to have grown too wear\\- to carry on the fight.

They begin to know that here in America we are waging a great and success- ful war. It is not alone a war against want and des- titution and economic demoralization. It is more than that; it is a war for the survival of democracy. We are fighting to save a great and precious form of government for ourselves and for the world. NEW ADVANCES During the New Deal the federal govern- ment was only one agency of reform. Like the earlier progressive period, this was an era of reform at every level. In education the most important ad\\ance was that, although total school enrollment declined, students in high school increased by 50 per cent. This was partly because teen-agers, unable to find jobs, went to school in order to occupy themseKes. Sec- ondary education had become the rule rather than the exception— a situation which existed nowhere else in the world. Private enterprise as well as government agencies cleared slums and erected better housing. In 1938, for in- stance, the Metropohtan Life Insurance Com- pany started a 50-million-dollar housing project in New York City. The T\\'A was not alone in planning for improved use of land.

In several industrial states there were \"little New Deals\"— programs of legislation designed to improve labor stand- ards, control corporations, and extend social services. The great strain on local government caused by the depression encouraged municipal re- form. The 1930's saw a great expansion of the city-manager plan (see p. 531), which at- tempted to put local government into the hands of nonpolitical experts. New York City's vigor- ous httle mayor, Fiorello H. LaGuardia, showed what could be done to free city government from corruption. Robert Moses, LaGuardia's park commissioner, made New York a better place to live in by building playgrounds, im- proving parks, and cleaning polluted waters. The prolonged depression apparently did not impede technological advance. During the 1930's commercial aviation came of age. By 1940, air lines were carrying millions of tra%'el- ers and had extended their ser\\'ices to Europe and the Far East. Industrial laboratories con- tinued to produce new wonders. The Du Pont Corporation easily weathered the depression by manufacturing two new materials— cellophane, which answered the need for a cheap, trans- parent, nonporous wrapping material; and ny- lon, a fabric that soon displaced silk. Amusements, the Arts In the field of amusement, the 1930's saw the universal introduction of the sound picture. Although Hollywood often presented a dis- torted or unreal picture of American Ufe, there were more film plays of real merit than ever before. As a result of the inspired imagination of Walt Disney, the animated cartoon created a new world of fantasy, peopled with figures who gained world-wide affection— Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Pluto. The motion picture also gained as a means of education. Every month The March of Time produced a film presenting in dramatic form some impor- tant modem problem or development. The de- pression brought only a temporary halt to the expansion of radio, and by 1940 possession of radio sets was almost universal. This was one explanation of Roosevelt's success in winning support of the electorate when most of the press was against him. Although many radio broadcasts were designed for the lowest com-"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"648 The Roosevelt Years mon denominator of intelligence, there was an increasing demand for more serious programs, such as the news analyses of conmientators like Lowell Thomas and H. V. Kaltenbom, or the concerts of the New York Philharmonic Orches- tra, directed by Artiuro Toscanini. Artists and writers seem to find the crisis- ridden America of the 1930's more congenial than the prosperous America of the 1920's. In any case, there was a marked retiun to the native scene. A dominant school of painting portrayed the countr>'side and the hfe of the people, its most well-known members being Grant Wood, John Steuart Cmry, and Thomas Hart Benton. The WPA art projects, especially the murals in pubhc buildings, gave the disci- ples of this school such an opportvmity to get their work directly before the public as had never existed before. In the field of the novel two important new writers confined themselves to the American scene: Thomas Wolfe, who fictionahzed his youth in North Carolina in Of Time and the River, and John Steinbeck, whose best-seller The Grapes of Wrath told of the trek of a family of displaced tenant farmers from Oklahoma to California. In the theatre, playwrights turned to the life around them; whether in the fight-hearted musical, Of Thee I Sing, which spoofed the American political scene; Thornton Wilder's Our Town, which conjured up the day-to-day fife of a New Eng- land community; or Clifford Odets' Waiting for Lefty, which dealt with a taxi drivers' strike. A climax of the LaCuardia administration was the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940, the greatest exhibition of its kind in history. In a dreary area of swamp and city diraips in Flushing, Long Island, was erected a great wonderland where foreign countries, American states, and private corporations vied to erect buildings and fabulous exhibits. The most pop- ular featvu-e at the World's Fair was the Gen- eral Motors building, where the theatrical designer Norman Bel Geddes built what he called a \"Futurama.\" This showed \"the world of tomorrow\" that technical advance and in- teUigent planning would make possible. Even after ten years of depression and near-depres- sion, Americans had not lost the optimistic feeling that new frontiers stiU lay ahead. Activities: Chapter 27 For Mastery and Review 1.

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT Like his distant cousin Theodore, Franklin Roosevelt was acquainted with the world be- yond the shores of the United States. He had made thirteen trips to Europe; he had first- hand knowledge of the Caribbean area; through family connections with the China trade he had acquired an interest in Asia. He resembled Theodore Roosevelt, too, in realizing that as a world power the United States had a commitment to help preserve the peace of the world. As a former associate and disciple of Woodrow Wilson, he believed in world organi- zation to promote international cooperation and allay disputes. But when he entered the White House in 193.3, Roosevelt's attention was fo- cussed almost entirely on domestic affairs. The affairs of Europe and Asia were no immediate concern. Furthermore, the dominant mood of the country was strongly isolationist, and this mood was reflected in Congress. Even when it appeared that Europe might be conquered by Nazi Germany, a far more dangerous threat to the world than the former German empire, the overwhelming desire of the American people was to avoid another Wilsonian crusade to make the world safe for democracy. Even when Roosevelt came to feel that the expansion of Germany was a mortal threat to the United States, his efforts to alert the United States to the danger were marked by caution and lack of candor. Only when dealing with foreign affairs in this hemisphere did he act with the directness and boldness that usually character- ized his poHtical style. THE GOOD NEIGHBOR POLICY IN LATIN AMERICA In his First Inaugural Address, Franklin Roosevelt pledged that the United States would be a \"good neighbor\" in the family of nations. In Latin America this pious phrase meant that the President and his Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, pursued with vigor the efforts to improve relations with our southern neighbors that Coolidge and Hoover had begun. At a Pan- American Conference at Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1933 the United States joined in over a him- dred resolutions and recommendations for fos- tering cooperation between the coimtries of the Western Hemisphere. The most important of these said that \"No state has the right to inter- 650"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"The Good Neighbor and the Axis Threat 651 vene in the internal and external affairs of another.\" Thus the Franklin Roosevelt admin- istration formally abandoned the right of inter- vention introduced by Theodore Roosevelt as a corollary of the Monroe Doctrine. The words of this nonintervention agree- ment were soon translated into deeds. The United States withdrew the marines from Haiti, wrote a new treaty with Cuba which put an end to the Piatt Amendment (pp. 483-484), and gave up the right to police the govern- ment of Panama. Later it abandoned control of the finances of the Dominican Republic. Even when the Mexican government took over, at a fraction of their value, oil and farming lands owned by citizens of the United States, the Roosevelt administration made only mild pro- tests. Pan-Americanism In pm-suing the Good Neighbor Policy, the Roosevelt administration promoted the ideal of Pan-Americanism whereby the countries of the Western Hemisphere are joined as equals. In 1936 a Pan-American Conference at Buenos Aires, Argentina, drew up an important \"Dec- laration of Principles of Inter-American Soli- darity and Cooperation.\" By this statement, the American na- tions agreed to QUESTION • Many Latin forego territorial Americans resent the way conquest or the the United States has tried ^^^ ^j f^^^^ ^ l!\"°AT!fZ '^Vut% collecting debts, to refrain from in- tive \"American.\" What, if anything, can and should be done about it? terfering in the affairs of one an- other, and to set- tle all disputes by peaceful means. What gave this real force was that the United States, by all odds the most powerful coimtry, was willing to deny itself the privilege of dominating weaker neighbors. The Roosevelt administration continued to treat Latin-American countries with the kind of courtesy shown by D wight Morrow's mission to Mexico and by Hoover's trip to Latin Amer- ica before his inauguration. At the Montevideo Conference, Secretary Hull broke precedent and made calls on the other delegates before they had opportunity to call on him. Henry Wallace, Secretary of Agriculture, learned enough Spanish to talk to Latin Americans about their agricultural problems in their own language. Roosevelt himself attended the Buenos Aires Conference; this was only the second time a President had left the shores of the United States. Roosevelt's warmth and charm imdoubtedly won friends for this coun- try. Cioser Cuiturai Reiations with Latin America More important than official courtesy, and probably as important as resolutions or treaties, was the effort to advance closer cultural rela- tions among the nations of the Western Hemisphere. The cultural ties of Latin-Ameri- can countries had always been with Europe, especially with Spain, France, and Portugal. People in the United States tended to dismiss Latin America as a backward area inhabited by lazy peons, guitar-playing caballeros, beau- tiful sehoritas, and small-time dictators. Latin Americans had an equally unflattering opinion of us. Luis Quintillana thus describes the Latin- American notion of the typical gringo (citizen of the United States): He is always in a hurry, pushing people around for no reason at all. His tastes are very simple: baseball, automobiles, and cocktails. When he is not chewing gum, smoking cigars, or gulping Coca- Cola, he is eating ice cream. Intellectually, this creature, so successful in busi- ness, is rather slow and limited. . . . The business office is the natural habitat of a gringo.

He seldom takes ofiF his hat, and once seated never gets up, even to greet callers. During the 1930's, deliberate efforts were made to correct wrong impressions and create better feelings on both sides of the Rio Grande. The Montevideo Conference provided for re- vision of school textbooks to eliminate misufl- derstandings, and the Buenos Aires Conference set up a committee to promote closer cultural relations. A division of the State Depart- ment under Nelson A. Rockefeller brought Latin-American artists, musicians, and students to the United States, and in exchange sent students and professors from the United States to learn and to teach. These activities were supplemented by local and private agencies. American public schools introduced courses and units in Latin-American history, geogra- phy, and civilization. In Hollywood the moving pictiire companies agreed to eliminate from films, especially from Westerns, anything that would give offense to Latin Americans. The Mexican painter Jose Clemente Orozco was commissioned to paint murals in the Dartmouth College Library, and the BraziUan singer Car- men Miranda took leading parts in Broadway reviews and Hollywood musicals. Magazines such as Time provided editions in Spanish and Portuguese for readers in Central and South America. Although mutual ignorance and distrust were not abolished overnight, there was httle doubt that the various aspects of the Good Neighbor Pohcy created new friendliness for the United States in the countries \"south of the border.\" This paid dividends when the United States attempted to organize the Americas against the threat of German and Italian ag- gression. RELATIONS WITH EUROPE Dviring Roosevelt's first years in office, the United States seemed no more disposed to pursue a policy of cooperation with European nations than when Harding and Coolidge had been in the White House. During the campaign of 1932, Roosevelt made a public statement that he no longer belie\\'ed that the United States should join the League of Nations. Like Coolidge and Hoo\\er before him, he urged American membership in the World Court, but was thwarted by the opposition of isolationist senators. When the Hoover Moratorium on war debts and reparations ran out in November 1932, most of our former Allies refused to resume pa\\Tnent. Pre\\'iously, German reparations had furnished them the funds with \\\\hich to pay. But in the summer of 1932 reparations were cut to a small fraction of their former amount, and after Adolf Hitler gained power in Ger- many in 1933, they ceased entirely. Roosevelt, like his predecessors, insisted that reparations were none of our business, and that he ex- pected the Allies to continue pa\\Tnent of the war debts. After 1933, however, no coimtry except Finland paid in full. Congress re- sponded to this by passing the Johnson Act of 1934, which forbade future loans to any nation failing to pay its debts to the United States. Wrecking the International Economic Conference, 1933 During the first year of the New Deal, the Roosevelt Administration pursued a policy of economic isolation. Not only were NRA and AAA attempts to advance recovery \\vithin the United States without reference to the rest of the world, but the President was empowered to raise the already high rates of the Hawley- Smoot Tariff.

It had been called at the urging of former President Hoover, and its purpose was to discuss meas- ures that would promote international coopera- tion, such as mutual lowering of tariff barriers and stabilization of currencies. WTiether or not the conference had much chance of success is debatable, but there is no doubt that Roose\\'elt wrecked it by publicly forbidding agreements that would peg the value of the dollar to that of any other currency. He feared that such action would hurt his efforts to raise American farm prices. His action had the unfortunate effect of increasing European dislike and dis- trust of the United States. Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, 1934 Once the United States had achieved some measure of recovery, Roosevelt was willing to consider measures of economic cooperation with other coim tries. In 1934 the Democrats retujned to the traditional low-tariff position of their party. An important influence in induc- ing Congress to abandon the policy of high protection was Secretary of State Cordell Hull. A disciple of Woodrow Wilson, Hull believed that international prosperity and good will could be promoted by reducing tariff barriers. In 1934 Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which has been peri- odically renewed. This law empowered the executive department to make treaties with foreign nations pro\\'iding for mutual lowering of duties on imports. By the act of 1934, the rates of the Hawley-Smoot Tariff could be re- duced as much as 50 per cent in retiu^i for concessions from other countries. This law had se\\'eral practical advantages over previous attempts to lower the tariff. It prevented logrolling between congressmen and relieved the individual congressman from pres- sure to see that products of his home district recei\\'ed protection. It also enabled the State Department to use American concessions as a lever for persuading foreign countries to open their markets to the products of the United States. Within six years of the passage of the first Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act, the State Department wrote treaties with over twenty nations, covering more than 60 per cent of American foreign trade. The effects of the Re- ciprocal Trade Agreements are difficult to assess, but they surely did not bring the great benefits Hull predicted. On balance, however, they have tended to promote prosperity in the United States and in the world at large and have also generated good will. Recognition of the USSR, 1933 Another change in American policy took place when the United States recognized the go\\'emment of Russia in 1933. Although the Bolsheviks had ruled Russia ever since 1917, the United States had refused to grant them recognition, departing from its usual practice of recognizing any effective government, no matter how it gained power. American policy reflected two considerations: (1) the Bolshe- viks refused to pay debts or individual claims incurred by previous Russian governments; (2) they preached and plotted world revolution. In 1920 they had founded the Third Interna- tional, a world-wide organization whose pur- pose was to undermine capitalism and over- throw existing \"bourgeois\" governments. But with the rise of Stalin after Lenin's death in 1924, the Bolsheviks had apparently abandoned hope of inciting world revolution and instead were concentrating on the industrial develop- ment of Russia itself. By 1933 most other coun- tries had recognized the Bolshevik government. Thus the Soviet Union seemed less of a threat to the estabhshed order. Russia's great need for industrial equipment seemed to promise a profitable market for American goods at a time"},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"Adolf Hitler, whom many did not regard as a serious threat in the early 1930's, leads a march of his brown-shirted Nazis through a German city street.

By 1946 most of the Nazi leaders were either dead or in prison, convicted of war crimes. when our foreign trade had been craelly hit by the depression. \"The United States would probably recognize the Devil,\" remarked Will Rogers, \"if it could sell him pitchforks.\" Japa- nese aggression in Manchuria provided another argument for recognizing the USSR, since the United States and Russia had a common interest in halting Japan's advance. In 1933, therefore, the Soviet diplomat Maxim Litvinov came to Washington and ar- ranged with Roosevelt an agreement whereby the United States recognized the Soviet Union in return for certain concessions. The Soviet government promised, for instance, to negotiate a debt settlement and to refrain from subver- sive activity, either directly or through its pup- pet, the American Communist Party. In 1934 normal diplomatic relations were resumed. The Roosevelt-Litvinov pact proved disappointing. The Russian government bought little in the United States; it never offered a debt settle- ment satisfactory to American negotiators; it continued to support subversive agents in this country. On the other hand, the agreement gave the United States government a \"window\" in Russia and opportunity to gain valuable infor- mation concerning a country about which it was dangerous to be ignorant. AGGRESSION, ISOLATION, APPEASEMENT During the New Deal period, the threat of a second world war came ever closer. In Japan fanatical militarists assassinated their way to power and planned to establish domination of the Far East and the Pacific. The Itahan dic- tator Benito Mussolini made plans to realize his dream of controlling the Mediterranean and the Near East. On March 5, 1933, the day after Roosevelt was inaugurated, the German dictator Adolf Hitler came to power, with a program that included plans for the conquest of central and eastern Europe and the acquisi- tion of overseas colonies."},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"656 The Roosevelt Years Fascism Mussolini and Hitler preached and prac- ticed a new political doctrine known as fascism. The fascists repudiated democracy; Mussolini called it a \"rotting corpse.\" Instead of the idea that the government exists to preserve individ- ual rights, they favored the \"totalitarian\" state which controls the total life of its people. The citizen (or rather, the subject) exists only to serve and to obey. Instead of using the demo- cratic machinery of voluntary parties compet- ing in free elections, the dictators imitated the Bolsheviks and set up all-powerful oflBcial par- ties: the Fascists in Italy and the National So- cialists (Nazis) in Germany. Elections in these one-party countries were not intended as a means of selecting officials, but as a demonstra- tion of civic loyalty. The voter was given the choice of voting \"yes\"— that he accepted the officials chosen for him by the party— or \"no.\" Voting \"no\" was not only futile, but dangerous, since it put the individual and his family in peril of punishment for \"disloyalty.\" Both dictators demanded absolute obedi- ence. Mussolini wrote, for instance, that a state must culminate in a \"pinpoint\"— meaning him- self. Finally, both men— and here they were joined by the Japanese mihtarists— believed that their countries had a divine right to expand at the expense of QUESTION . // Musso- neighboring peo- lini and Hitler used high- ples. The Nazis pressure indoctrination preached that the successfully to sell fascism Germans were a to their people, why not master race of teach democracy the same \"blond beasts,\" way? with a mission to conquer Europe and establish a \"thousand-year empire.\" In the course of this conquest, \"lesser breeds\"- Poles, Ukrainians, the French— would be reduced to serfdom or slavery. The Nazis revealed new dimensions of the human capacity for evil in their treatment of the Jews. Years later, the horrors of concentration camps, and their in- famous gas extermination chambers, continued to shock the world. The \"final solution of the Jewish problem\" was almost reached: six mil- lion Jews perished in 1939-1945. Conquest By the mid-1930's, it was already evident that Italian, German, and Japanese glorifica- tion of war was no idle talk. In 1935 Mussolini climaxed years of sabre-rattling by an unpro- voked attack on Ethiopia, followed by conquest and annexation of the entire country. In 1936 Japan exercised her right to withdraw from the disarmament provisions of the Treaties of Washington and London (pp. 574-577 and 602) and started to increase her navy. In 1937 Japanese armies poured into China and soon controlled the northern and central plains. Meanwhile Hitler, disregarding the Treaty of Versailles, began to build a great army, navy, and air force. Nazi agents disguised as students, tourists, and businessmen carried on subversive activity, not only throughout Europe, but even in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. An attempted Nazi takeover of Austria failed in 1934, but in March 1938, Hitler embarked on a career of aggression by annexing the Austrian republic. Meanwhile in 1936 the two European dic- tators formed an alliance that became known as the \"Rome-Berlin Axis.\" This partnership went into business together when it supported the rebellion of General Francisco Franco against the left-wing government of Spain in 1936. For almost three years, Spain was torn by bitter civil war in which Italian and German weapons and troops contributed greatly to Franco's eventual victory. Spain provided a proving ground for German and Italian tanks and bombers and a school for troops. It was obvious that Hitler and Mussolini were plan- ning future aggression."},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"The Good Neighbor and the Axis Threat 657 Neutrality Legislation, 1935-1937 The response of the majority of the Ameri- can people to the Axis threat and to the possi- bihty of a new world war was a determination not to get involved. They were disillusioned with the former great crusade to \"make the world safe for democracy,\" which had left only a greatly increased domestic debt and billions of dollars lost in uncollectible foreign debts. Nor had it brought a stable peace. In 1934 and 1935, a committee headed by Senator Gerald P. Nye of North Dakota made an investigation of the munitions industry which revealed that American armament manufacturers had made large profits by supplying arms and credit to the Allies during the years 1914-1917. This led to the notion that American participation in World War I had been arranged by \"merchants of death,\" assisted by British propagandists. The attempt to defend neutral rights had also been a decisive element in bringing the United States to war, as it had helped to bring on the War of 1812. There was increasing feeling that Bryan had been right in 1914-1915 (see p. 553) in urging that the United States supply no arms to the belligerents, make them no loans, and abandon defense of neutral rights on the high seas. Wide acceptance of what may be called the \"sucker theory\" of World War I led to a great increase in pacifism, especially among young people. An expression of this at- titude was a short-lived organization in col- leges, the Veterans of Future Wars, which ridiculed military service and demanded their veterans' bonus in advance. In 1935, 1936, and 1937, Congress passed three Neutrality Acts designed to keep the United States from getting involved in wars overseas, even if this meant allowing aggression to go unchecked. The laws varied in detail, but in general they ( 1 ) put an embargo on the sale or transportation of munitions to bel- ligerents, (2) forbade loans to nations at war outside of this hemisphere, (3) insisted that raw materials to belligerents be paid for in advance and be carried in belligerent ships (this was called \"cash and carry\"), and (4) ordered American ships to stay out of war zones and American citizens to refrain from traveling on belligerent ships. When the Spanish civil war broke out. Congress with only one dissent- ing vote forbade shipments of war materials to either side. Appeasement The response of the two great European democracies. Great Britain and France, to the threat of Axis aggression was somewhat similar to that of the United States. Their people had suffered far more severely than the Americans in World War I. Like the Americans, they were disillusioned with the results of that strug- gle. Much as they disliked Italian, German, or Japanese expansion, they disliked the thought of war even more. Pacifism reached new heights: a majority of the students in the fa- mous debating umion at Oxford University voted that on no account would they go to war for king or country. Reflecting such senti- ments, the British and French governments pursued a policy known as \"appeasement.\" This consisted in making concessions to the aggressor nations in the hope of satisfying their demand for \"room to live.\" It reached its height at the Munich Conference of September 1938, when British and French statesmen allowed Germany to annex part of Czechoslovakia in return for Hitler's promise to make no further demands. The appeasement policies of France and Britain, combined with the American neutrality laws, confirmed the Axis powers in their opinion that they had nothing to fear from the \"de- cadent,\" \"soft,\" peace-loving democracies.

Roosevelt Overborne by Isolationist Sentiment Roosevelt had signed the Neutrality Acts without protest, although he would have pre- ferred to have been allowed some discretion in distinguishing between aggressors and their victims. Secret information revealed that the Axis powers were bent on war. American isola- tion simply reinforced the Anglo-French ap- peasement pohcies. The President became con- vinced that \"storm cellar neutrality\" was more dangerous than resistance to the dictators. (In England Winston Churchill reached the same opinion, but he was not in oflBce.) Roosevelt first showed his hand in a speech delivered at Chicago in October 1937. He warned his audi- ence that if aggression continued unchecked, there was no reason to suppose the Western Hemisphere and America would be spared. He suggested that the United States should help to cure \"the epidemic of world lawlessness\" by joining with other powers to \"quarantine\" ag- gressors. Just what the President meant by his \"quar- antine\" speech was never clear because public opinion forced him to abandon for a time any attempt to organize collective action against the aggressors.

By 1939 Japan controlled the richest areas of China, and the Chinese government had been driven back into the hinterland. President Roosevelt found means of getting some sup- phes to the Chinese, in spite of the Neutrality Act, because of the technicahty that the Japa- nese had not declared war when they invaded China. But materials went in vast amoimts from the United States to Japan— including 90 per cent of the copper and metal scrap used to feed its war machine— because the Japanese, with a large merchant marine and far more money, could \"cash and carry.\" That the mili- tarists planned further conquest was seen when, in 1939, Japan seized the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea, only 400 miles from the PhiUppines. In the spring of 1939, German aimexation of Czechoslovakia revealed that Hitler was bent on vmlimited conquest. France and Great Brit- ain at last decided that appeasement had failed and that Hitler must be stopped, by arms if necessary. Yet Congress refused to lift the arms embargo so that the tsvo great democracies could buy weapons to arm themselves against the Nazis. It was small wonder that when, in April 1939, Roosevelt attempted to extract from Mussolini and Hitler a promise not to attack 31 countries, the dictators answered him with ridicule. They had nothing to fear, they thought, from the isolationist, peace-loving American republic. Organizing the Western Hemisphere Against the Axis Only in the \\\\'estem Hemisphere did Roose- velt have any success in getting nations to cooperate against possible Axis aggression. Sev- eral Latin-American countries contained large German and Italian minorities. Among them appeared organizations to spread the anti-demo- cratic doctrines of fascism and prepare the way for Axis penetration of South America. German \"tourists\" and \"commercial agents\" appeared in such numbers that it was hard to believe they were interested merely in natural beauties or business opportunities. The Nazi government also bought South American air lines and manned them with German pilots. Since these lines ran at a loss, it was suspected that their purpose was military rather than commercial. At the 1938 Pan-American Conference in Lima, Peru, Cordell Hull attempted to line up the Latin-American countries against the Axis. The Declaration of Lima, which came out of this meeting, proclaimed that the American re- publics were bound together in \"continental solidarity.\" It said that the nations composing the Pan American Union would collaborate \"against all foreign intervention or activity.\" On the face of it this was a victory for \"Pan-Ameri- canism,\" the idea that all American states, large and small, work together. It also appeared that at last the Monroe Doctrine was made \"multi- lateral\" rather than \"unilateral\"— that is, it was no longer a case of the United States defending Latin America for its own self-interest, but in- stead a case in which the United States joined \\vith its sister republics to the south in common defense. There was no machiner>', however, to force Pan-American cooperation. The resound- ing phrases of the Lima Declaration revealed that Latin Americans had lost some distrust of"},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"660 The Roosevelt Years the United States and feared European aggres- sion. But the United States was still free to act as it pleased in defense of its own self-interest; it was still a \"colossus,\" although a more friendly one than in the days when Theodore Roosevelt chastised Caribbean repubUcs for \"misdoing.\" The Declaration of Lima was followed up by positive help to Latin-American governments that wanted to reduce Nazi influence. Thus the State Department helped Colombia to buy out a German air line that operated within easy striking distance of the Panama Canal. The War and Navy departments also worked out better means of defending the Americas and of lending assistance to any Latin-American na- tion that requested arms or military advice. Relations with Canada The Good Neighbor Policy was applied to Canada. In 1931 Canada had become a fully independent nation, tied to Great Britain by sentiment and traditional loyalty to the British crown. This opened the way for more direct cooperation between Canada and the United States, which faced each other across the long- est unfortified boundary in the world. Both Hoover and Roosevelt favored the St. Lawrence Cordell Hull, Secretary of State A member of Franklin Roosevelt's wartime cabinet once commented wryly, \"The President rarely remembered that he was not his own Secretary of State.\" Nevertheless, Cordell Hull, Secretary of State from 1933 to 1944, was far from a \"yes man.\" Hull received his appointment because of domestic political considerations. He had been in Congress for over a quarter of a century and was an expert on fiscal policy. He had been chairman of the National Democratic Committee. Thus he was fitted to act as a liaison between the President and Congress and between rival Democratic factions. But Hull had no special qualifications that fitted him to head the State Department, except that with his fine head, courtly manners, and dignity, the white-haired Tennessean looked the very model of a wise elder states- man. He was totally lacking in diplomatic training and knew no foreign lan- guage. Furthermore, he served a chief who often took important actions in foreign policy without consulting him. Such were the frustrations of his position that in private Hull occasionally burst into the picturesque profanity he had learned when driving mules as a boy. During most of World War II, Hull played a secondary role, but as hostilities drew to a close, he busied himself with preparations for a new world order. Here his long acquaintance with the men on Capitol Hill stood him in good stead. He worked closely with the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in drawing up plans for the entrance of the United States into the postwar United Nations. He was careful not to repeat Wilson's mistake of 1919 in making peace terms a parti- san matter. Instead, he sought and gained the cooperation of Republican leaders. He must therefore be regarded as one of the architects of the bipartisan foreign policy which became a remarkable feature of American politics during the ad- ministration of Harry S. Truman.

Nevertheless, Canada and the United States were already cooperating, through \"joint commissions\" in many matters of common interest, such as offshore fisheries, protection of wildlife, and na\\igation of the Great Lakes. Canadian disappointment at the failure of plans for the Seaway was somewhat reduced when, in 1936, the United States ar- ranged a Reciprocal Trade Agreement that opened our markets to Canadian products. A private agency that impro\\'ed relations was the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. In 1935 it started a series of conferences to improve understanding.

EUROPE AT WAR AGAIN The nightmare that haunted Hitler in plan- ning his career of conquest was the fear of ha\\'ing to fight a t\\vo-front war such as Germany had waged in World War I. The Nazi dictator scored one of the great diplomatic victories of modem times when, in August 1939, he re- moved the danger from the east by making a nonaggression treaty with the USSR. This cleared the way for a Nazi attack on Poland. Ever since the Treaty of Versailles, Germans had denounced the arrangements that granted Poland a \"corridor\" to the Baltic Sea, cutting Germany in two, and which put the Geiman city of Danzig under control of the League of Nations. Late in August 1939, Hitler demanded that Danzig be reunited with Germany and that Poland grant Germany the right to build a road across the corridor. He accused Poland of atrocities against its citizens of German an- cestr\\'. On August 31 he delivered an ultimatum and, before the Polish government had time to reply, sent his armies into Poland without de- claring war. Conquest of Poland: \"Blitzkrieg\" Poland was a country almost the size of France; its army was large; its people were patriotic. The Poles expected to hold out at least until winter, when \"General Mud\" would come to their aid and slow up the in\\aders. Long before winter set in, however, the German armies won a complete victory. They moved so fast, in fact, that they created a new word— blitzkrieg, meaning \"lightning war.\" As German armored di\\isions cut behind the Polish de- fenders in a series of pincer movements, the German air force ruthlessly bombed not only Polish cities but also refugees fleeing the war zones. This was a deliberate attempt to terrorize the civilian population. \\Mthin three weeks Warsaw, the Polish capital, had fallen, and in httle more than a month the Nazis were totally victorious. Meanwhile Russia, as part of its bar- gain with Hitler, seized eastern Poland.

Their only possible move was to blockade Germany by sea. Lifting tlie Arms Embargo, November 1939 The Nazi blitzkrieg against Poland con- firmed the American people both in their intense dislike of Hitler and in their determination to keep out of war. Roosevelt accurately reflected this mood when he issued a public declaration calling on Americans to be neutral in deed, even though he could not ask them to be neutral in thought. After war broke out, it was apparent that American neutrality legislation favored Germany. The embargo on sale of arms or mu- nitions to the warring powers prevented Great Britain and France from using their command of the sea to obtain arms. The German govern- ment, which had put \"guns before butter\" for several years, had Httle need to import weapons. Roosevelt's sympathies, like those of the ma- jority of Americans, were so strongly with the Allies that in September 1939, he urged Con- gress to repeal the arms embargo. There was bitter opposition to this measure, and congress- men were bombarded with thousands of tele- grams imploring them to \"keep America out of the blood business.\" After six weeks of impas- sioned debate Congress followed the President's recommendations. France and Britain could now get arms from the United States as long as they could pay cash and supply the ships. Other features of the neutrality legislation were retained and even strengthened, such as the ban on sending United States shipping into war zones. Russian Attacic on Finland The collapse of Poland in September 1939 was followed by a curious lull in hostilities, nicknamed the \"phony war\" or \"sitzkrieg.\" Great Britain and France, desperately attempt- ing to rearm, made no offensive move against Germany. Hitler was equally quiet. The only major event to disturb the calm was a war between Russia and Finland. After the USSR occupied eastern Poland in September 1939, it also asked \"permission\" to occupy all or part of the four countries that lie along the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea— Lithuania, Latvia, Es- tonia, and Finland. The governments of all the states but Finland thought it hopeless to refuse Russian demands and allowed Soviet troops to move in and \"protect\" them. But Finland, blessed with better natural de- fenses and inspired by a long history of resis- tance to Russian aggression, refused to give in. On November 30, five Russian armies attacked Finland. All were defeated. For over three months the Finns carried on a heroic defense that won the intense sympathy of the people of the Western democracies. Nowhere was this sympathy more intense than in the United States, but the determination to keep out of hostilities was equally strong. The only gesture that Congress was willing to make in support of Finland was to vote $30,000,000 for non- military supplies. Forced to fight alone against a power that had fifty times as many troops, Finland surrendered in March 1940. Germany Sweeps On The \"phony war\" came to an end in the spring of 1940 with a series of Nazi attacks that were even more surprisingly successful and more terrifying than the blitzkrieg against Po- land. On April 9, Hitler sent his forces north- ward against Denmark and Norway, again with- out declaration of war. Denmark surrendered at once, since its situation was clearly hopeless. The Norwegians, who had more chance to de- fend themselves because of the rugged terrain of their country, were at first too stunned by the suddenness and ruthlessness of the attack to put up much resistance. The Norwegians fought bravely, but resistance was crushed and"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"664 The Roosevelt Years tvvo British landings in the north at Trondheim and Narvik were repulsed. What made the con- quest of Norway even more frightening was the report— now known to be exaggerated— that the Nonvegian defeat had been arranged before- hand by Nazi agents in the Norwegian army under the direction of Vidkun Quisling. So now \"quisling\" was added to \"blitzkrieg\" as the sym- bol of a new and diabolical Nazi tactic. Even before the Norwegian campaign was complete, Hitler struck again and once more revealed no\\'el and fearful tactics. On May 9, 1940, he attacked the Netherlands and Belgium simultaneously. In spite of opening the dikes, and of desperate resistance in the course of which a quarter of the Dutch army was killed or wounded, Holland was forced to surrender in five days. In the course of the fighting, Nazi bombers destroyed the defenseless city of Rot- terdam. Belgium surrendered in eighteen days; the Belgian fortress of Eben Emael, considered impregnable, was taken in a few hours by a handful of gliderbome soldiers, who suffered very few casualties. In Belgium, the Nazis finally collided with major British and French forces. To the amaze- ment and horror of the free world, the Nazi blitzkrieg was as effective against them as against the Poles, Norwegians, Dutch, and Belgians. German armored divisions first cut through to the sea, driving a wedge between the British and main French armies. After Bel- gium suddenly surrendered on May 28, a force of over 300,000 men, two-thirds British, was trapped at Dunkirk on the French side of the English Channel. By mobilizing planes, war- ships, and an amazing armada of over 600 pri- vate craft ranging from tugs to private yachts, Britain managed to perform the \"miracle of Dunkirk\" and evacuate 90 per cent of its army. But the evacuation was only a moral victory, as vast amounts of supplies and arms were left behind. The Fall of France, June 1940 After Dunkirk, the German armies turned south and east and in three weeks had overrun more than half of France. The French surren- dered on June 22, 1940. By the terms of the armistice, Germany kept over a million prison- ers of war as hostages, and occupied nearly tvvo-thirds of France, including Paris. The rest of the countr>' was ruled by an authoritarian government under Marshal Henri Philippe Petain. Once the heroic defender of Verdun in World War I, Petain was now willing to col- laborate with Hitler. General Charles de Gaulle, however, organized the \"Free French\" mo\\ement, which enlisted Frenchmen overseas and organized resistance in France. Meanwhile Hitler's ally, Mussolini, had en- tered the war. When it was clear that France had been defeated, the Italian dictator an- nounced that he was coming to the aid of his German allies, and Fascist troops invaded France in mid-June. On the day of the attack President Roosevelt, speaking at Charlottesville, Virginia, remarked, \"On this 10 day of June, 1940, the hand that held the dagger has struck it into the back of its neighbor.\" Once France was knocked out of the war, Nazi soldiers sang a new song, \"We sail against England.\" Britain was clearly marked as Hitler's next victim. Her army was far smaller than that of Germany and had been stripped of its equip- ment in the French disaster. All southern Eng- land was within easy range of the superior German air force. It would be a matter of hours for German transports to cross the Channel.

WINSTON CHURCHILL When France fell, President Roosevelt ranged himself clearly on the side of interven- tion. In the speech .at Charlottesville in which he damned Mussolini's attack on France, he said it was a \"delusion\" to believe that the United States could become \"a lone island in a world dominated by the philosophy of force.\" He pledged that America would send to the foes of fascism \"the material resources of this nation.\" In the summer of 1940 this meant that the United States would furnish aid to Britain. THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN In mid-July, less than three weeks after France surrendered, the Battle of Britain began in earnest. Nazi bombers attacked southern England to prepare the way for in\\asion by German armies across the English Channel. The troops defending Britain had been largely stripped of equipment in escaping from France; some Home Guard units were armed only with pitchforks and shotguns. England seemed doomed to go the way of Poland and France. But in her dark hour she had found a great leader, Winston Churchill. Offering his people only \"blood, tears, sweat, and toil,\" Churchill pledged that Britain would resist to the utter- most. . . . we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing-grounds, we shall fight on the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment bebeve, this island, or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with aU its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and liberation of the Old. To Roosevelt, America's first line of defense was now the English Channel. In the summer of 1940 he overruled the advice of some of his military advisers and \"scraped the bottom of the barrel\" to send American rifles, machine guns, and artiller>' to Great Britain. tn addition to the threat of invasion, Britain faced starvation. Nazi submarines in the Atlan- tic had greater cruising range than the U-boats of World War I. They hunted in \"wolf packs,\" making it harder for merchant ships, once sighted, to escape. By midsummer, 1940, British ships were being sunk at a rate nearly four 668"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"times as fast as new ships could be launched. Already half the ships in the British fleet had been damaged or sunk. In this crisis, Churchill and Roosevelt arranged an extraordinary deal. On September 2, the President announced that he had given Britain fifty overage destroyers and had received in exchange, by gift or 99- year lease, sites for eight naval and air bases extending from Newfoundland to British Gui- ana (see map, p. 653). It was evidence of his country's desperate plight that Churchill was willing to make a bargain so favorable to the United States. The destroyer deal was an act of war against Germany on the part of the United States, yet the majority of Americans supported the meas- ure as an act of self-defense. And the British justified Roosevelt's confidence. Londoners stood up under daily bombing by hundreds of planes with calm and even cheerful courage. In the sky a handful of British fighter pilots inflicted such heavy losses on the German air force that the Nazi plan to invade England, \"Operation Sea Lion,\" was abandoned. \"Never in the field of human conflict,\" said Churchill, \"was so much owed by so many to so few.\" Protection of the Western Hemisphere Hitler's victories aroused fear that the Nazis might take over the American colonies of con- quered countries in the Western Hemisphere. The most important of these were Dutch Guiana, the French and Dutch West Indies, and the Danish colony of Greenland (see map, p. 756). A Pan-American Congress at Havana, Cuba, in July 1940, dealt with this threat. It drew up the Act of Havana which forbade the transfer of colonies from one non-American na- tion to another. If there was danger of such a change of control, or if a colony proved unable to govern itself, it might be taken over by \"trustees\" representing the twenty-one Ameri- can republics. An individual American nation These ships were among the fifty sent Britain accord- ing to the \"destroyer deal\" of 1940. The Lend-Lease Act of 1941 provided for much greater aid to the Allies, on terms which \"would promote the safety of the United States.\" (meaning the United States) was empowerd to take emergency action if necessary. The Act of Havana provided evidence that the Monroe Doctrine might evolve toward multilateral coop- eration of all the American republics rather than unilateral action by the United States. THE ELECTION OF 1940 The issue of intervention cut across party lines. Many Democrats who favored Roosevelt's domestic politics were isolationists, while many anti-New Deal Republicans favored all-out aid to Britain. In a gesture designed to put foreign"},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"670 The Roosevelt Years policy above politics, Roosevelt appointed two Republican interventionists to his cabinet in June, 1940. Frank Knox, Republican vice-presi- dential candidate in 1936, became Secretary of the Na\\y, and Henry L. Stimson, who had ser\\'ed in the cabinets of Taft and Hoover, be- came Secretary of War. As the presidential election of 1940 ap- proached, the battle between inter\\'entionists and isolationists was fought out in both major parties. In June the Repubhcans nominated a newcomer to politics, Wendell L. Willkie. A successful businessman, Willlde had won fame for his intelligent criticism of New Deal policies, and admiration, even from those who disagreed with him, for his forthright and attractive per- sonality. Since he was sympathetic with the aims of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies, his nomination was a victory for the inter%'entionists. The great question on the eve of the Demo- cratic convention was whether Roosevelt would break the precedent that went back to Washing- ton and Jefferson and seek a third term. If war had not broken out, he probably would not have run; his party indeed might have refused to nominate him. But in the face of the Nazi menace he felt his experience was needed, al- though he refused to say whether he would run until the Democrats actually met in convention. He then announced that he was willing to ac- cept the presidential nomination if he were drafted. He was renominated with only scat- tered opposition. In the ensuing campaign, the great issue be- fore the country— abandoning neutrality to aid Britain— received surprisingly little attention, because both candidates were on the same side. Roosevelt even informed Willkie in advance about the destroyer deal. Yet Willkie carried on a vigorous campaign. He attacked the aban- donment of the two-term tradition, accused Roosevelt of thinking himself indispensable, and pointed out the failure of the New Deal to end unemployment. Roosevelt attempted to keep aloof from obvious campaigning, but he was drawn into the battle when Willkie began to predict that QUESTION -WouU you Roosevelt's re- have favored the interven- ^j^^^^^ ^^.^^,j tionists in 1940 or nave ., ., 7 .t J i ^L mean war. It the been on the side of the isolationists? Presidents prom- ise to keep Amer- ican boys out of foreign war, he said, were no better than his promise to balance the budget, \"they're already almost on the transports.\" Roosevelt's response, deli\\'ered in a speech in Boston, was one that later hurt him; \"I have said before, but I shall say it again and again and again. Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.\" The President surely did not intend or want to send American troops abroad, but if this country were attacked, there might be no choice. In November, Roosevelt was re-elected, e\\'en though Willkie polled the largest Republican vote up to that time. In a world in crisis the majority' of the American people were imwilling to gamble on a change in leadership. Lend-Lease Act, March 1941 At the end of 1940 it appeared that England would sur\\'i\\'e the Nazi threat, and Churchill even began to talk of Wctory. \"Give us the tools,\" he said, \"and we will finish the job.\" But the British government was running desperately short of funds to pay for the tools. To meet this situation President Roosevelt proposed late in December 1940, that the United States be- come \"the great arsenal of democracy.\" America must, he said, furnish arms to Hitler's enemies on the same principle that a man lends \"a length of garden hose\" when his neighbor's house is on fire. The President's recommendation touched off two months of furiotis debate. Senator Burton"},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"The Second World War 671 A. Wheeler of Montana called it \"the New Deal's Triple A, for it will plow under every fourth American boy.\" But Wendell Willkie helped to remove the so-called Lend-Lease bill from partisanship by coming to its support, and public opinion was strongly in its favor. In March 1941, it was enacted into law by large majorities in both houses of Congress. The Presi- dent was empowered to send American supplies and weapons to foreign nations on whatever terms he thought would promote the safety of the United States. The only limitations were that Congress had to appropriate the money and that the President had to consult with both the army chief of staff and the chief of naval operations. Battle of the Atlantic It was one thing to vote funds for lend-lease and another to get goods across the Atlantic in time to help. When Hitler attacked Yugoslavia and Greece in the spring of 1941, lend-lease aid was promised, but the Nazis overran these countries before it could reach them. While German bombers had failed to knock out Brit- ain, German submarines might still sta^^'e her into submission. In trying to see that lend-lease supplies reached their destination, the United States was drawn step by step into the critical battle of the Atlantic. By agreement with the Danish minister in Washington, the United States temporarily took over Greenland in April 1941, partly to prevent its use as a weather station by the Nazis. The same month American naval vessels, patrolling the western Atlantic, began to \"trail\" Axis sub- marines, but not attack them. In July, United States marines occupied Iceland to help protect the \"bridge of ships\" to Britain. By September, after Nazi submarines had sunk American mer- chant vessels without providing for the safety of crews or passengers, American naval vessels began to convoy ships as far as Iceland. In Oc- tober, two American destroyers on convoy duty were torpedoed; one of them, the Reuben James, was sunk. Congress in November aban- doned the last important provision of the neu- tralitv laws by \\'0ting to allow American merchant ships to enter combat zones. These ships were armed, and their guns manned with navy crews. To try to keep the Nazi menace from its shores, the United States had become engaged in a \"shooting war.\" This was, however, a lim- ited war: the United States sent arms to the enemies of Hitler and used force to guarantee their delivery, but it sent no troops. Public opin- ion polls revealed again and again that the American people wanted to defeat the Axis and at the same time keep our young men from foreign battlefields. This attitude was strikingly illustrated when in the summer of 1941 the President recommended that the Selective Serv- ice Act be continued for eighteen months. The law passed the House by only a single vote, 293-202, and the extension was limited to six months. Japanese Aggression in the Far East While the attention of the American public was focused on the Atlantic and Europe, events were taking place in the Pacific and Asia that eventually plunged the United States into total war. The war in Europe had presented Japanese war leaders with a golden opportunity for con- quest. The four European powers with the greatest stakes in the Far East were France, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and Russia. France and the Netherlands had been con- quered by Hitler in 1940, and Great Britain was wholly involved with resisting the Nazis. Japan signed a five-year neutrality pact with Russia in April 1941, and Hitler's armies invaded Rus- sia in June.

They were poised to strike the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, and the Dutch East Indies. It was an area containing in abun- dance raw materials needed by Japan's growing population and expanding industry: rice, rub- ber, tin, zinc, and petroleum. The only barrier remaining was the United States. In accordance with the Stimson Doctrine, the United States had refused to recognize the Japanese con- quest of Manchuria because it violated both the Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 and the Kellogg- Briand Peace Pact. The United States had pro- tested the Japanese invasion of China as \\'iola- tions of these treaties. In September 1940, Japan formally entered into alliance with the Axis powers, Germany and Italy. Thus resistance to aggression in Eur- ope and Asia became part of the same struggle. Understandably, United States policy toward the Japanese stiflFened. It hardly made sense to provide vital war materials both to Hitler's enemy, Britain, and his ally, Japan. The federal gON'emment first cut do\\vTi exports of \\'ital war materials, such as aviation gasoline. Then in July 1941, the Japanese were denied the use of their credit to make purchases in the United States. In August an American lend-lease mis- sion was sent to China. On the other hand. Secretary Hull attempted month after month to persuade the Japanese to abandon their career of conquest. He baited his arguments by offering wider commercial opportunities in the United States. The Japanese diplomats who conferred with Hull assured him that they in turn would like to arrange a peaceful settle- ment with the United States. But they never offered to abandon Japanese conquests in Manchuria and China. In November 1941, the Japanese government still seemed interested in peace, since it sent a special envoy to Washington to arrange a Far East settlement. But the militarists who domi- nated Japan had already decided to attack the United States without a declaration of war. Attack on Pearl Harbor The Roosevelt administration had secret in- formation of the possibility of new Japanese ag- gression, but expected it to be in the direction of the East Indies. The military authorities had been alerted to the possibility of efforts to crip- ple the Pearl Harbor na\\al base, but they ex- pected sabotage rather than a mihtary attack. And on the morning of December 7, 1941, the average American had no intimation that a sud- den change was to take place in his life. In recalling the mood of that Sunday morning, Jonathan Daniels wTOte: The Matson Line was advertising vacation cruises to Hawaii. The upswept hair-do was re- ceiving early attention. TrafiBc accidents in the country were already up sixteen per cent above . . . 1940. John L.

Many will never forget hearing newscasters breaking in on symphony concerts, football games, and children's programs to tell of the awful event.

In April Nazi armies overran Yugo- sla\\'ia and Greece in three weeks. In May the Nazis staged the first airborne invasion in his- tory and took the island of Crete from a British force. In June Hitler launched a massive attack against his recent ally, Russia. It seemed for a time as though the ISO Nazi divisions engaged in this imasion would \"go through Russia like a hot knife through butter.\" By December the Germans had occupied an area tsvice the size of France, including most of the Ukraine, one of the richest agricultural, regions in the world. Only with the onset of winter had they been checked at the \\'ery gates of Moscow and Len- ingrad. It was generally predicted that Russia would be crushed in 1942. After that, German armies might sweep through the Middle East and join forces with their Japanese allies in India. In the face of these grim prospects the two war leaders, Churchill and Roosevelt, never lost their courage or their confidence in ultimate \\'ictory. Pictures of the smiling Churchill, with his billy-cock hat, big cigar, and \"V for Victory\" salute, seemed a sort of guarantee that Britain would not go under. In his annual message to Congress, delivered in the midst of disasters, Roosevelt told Congress: We cannot wage this war in a defensive spirit. As our power and our resources are fully mobilized, we shall carry the attack against the enemy— we shall hit him and hit him again wherever and when- ever we can reach him. Difficult Military Problems In World War I, the United States had sim- ply to guard the sea lanes to Europe and send enough troops to break the stalemate on the western front. In ^^'orld War II, America had to carry on global warfare in the Atlantic and Pacific, in Europe, in Africa, and in Asia. There was little time to lose. Germany and Japan were so close to dominating the great \"heartland\" of Europe and Asia that it seemed almost as though nothing could dislodge them. President Roosevelt as commander in chief was immediately faced with a vital decision: should the United States strike harder against Japan or against Germany? American anger was directed most strongly against the Japanese, since it was they who had attacked us. But the President followed the ad\\ice of his military counselors who considered Germany the more dangerous foe. Although Japan \\vas not allowed to rest secure in the Pacific, the main weight of American military' might was thrown against Hitler. The Russian Front Success or failure of the war in Europe hinged on whether Russia could hold out until the United States and Britain could strike from the west. Although Nazi armies had suffered heavily from the Russian winter after the cam- paign of 1941, they were still strong enough to launch a second great offensive in the spring of 1942. Worry as to whether Communist Russia might some day prove a more dangerous foe than Nazi Germany was silenced by Churchill at the time Hitler's invasion of Russia began. \"I have only one purpose,\" he said, \"the destruc- tion of Hitler If Hitler invaded Hell, I would make at least a fa\\orable reference to the De\\'il in the House of Commons.\" It fol- lowed, therefore, that the western Allies must give what aid they could. The three possible routes by which supplies might be sent to Rus- sia were long and difficult: across the Pacific to Vladivostok and then across Siberia, around Africa to the Persian Gulf and then north through Iran, or through submarine-infested waters around Norway to the port of Murmansk."},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"American Allies: World War II The events of late 1942 constituted a turning point in ttie Second World War.

By midsummer the Germans were more than halfway to their goal. But at Stalin- grad (since renamed \\'olgograd) on the \\'olga Ri\\er the Russians made a heroic defense which held up Hitler's armies month after month. Meanwhile, thousands of British tanks and American trucks and hundreds of thousands of tons of American supplies had reached Russia. In November the Russians were strong enough to strike back. The besiegers of Stalingrad were themselves besieged. Late in January 1943, the tattered remnants of a Xazi army which once numbered 330,000, surrendered. The Russian armies then started an advance to the west which ended at Berlin over two years later. They kept two-thirds of the Xazi troops en- gaged and, in the words of Churchill, \"tore the guts out of the German army.\" Attack from the West Meanwhile, American forces concentrated in the British Isles for a blow against the Axis. In November 1942, a British-American army landed in Morocco and Algeria to attack the Germans and Italians in North Africa. Rommel, defeated by a British army in the battle of El Alamcin in October, was retreating westward from Egypt. Pressed from t\\vo sides, A.xis armies were bottled up in Tunisia and, in May 1943, they surrendered. The way was nou' open for an advance on what Churchill optimistically called \"the soft ^ide rbelly\" of Europe. In July and August 1943, British and American forces took Sicily, and in September they landed in Italy. Although Mus- solini had by this time been o\\erthrown, Ger- man armies still occupied Italy. The country was mountainous and German resistance fierce; progress up the Italian boot was slow. Not until June 1944, did the Allies enter Rome, only half- way to the .'\\lps. One reason for the limited success of the Italian offensive was that the United States and Britain were building up strength for a direct attack on western Europe. Although the Ameri- can and British air forces were engaged in \"round the clock\" bombing of German industry and transportation, German armies could be de- feated only on the ground. On June 6, 1944 (D-Day), the greatest amphibious force in his- tory, carried in 9,000 vessels, landed in Nor- mandy on the coast of France. Planning for this risky attack on \"Fortress Europe\" had been un- der way for over two \\'ears. Within a month after D-Day, a million men had crossed the English Channel. In August the Americans and British broke out of Nor- mandy and struck rapidly eastward. By Sep- tember they reached the western border of Germany. The Russians meanwhile closed in from the east. The Nazis fought to the last. In June 1944 they had started to bomb Britain from the coast of Europe with V-l's and V-2's (jet-propelled and rocket-propelled bombs). In December twenty German di\\'isions drove a \"bulge\" into the Allied lines in Belgium. But in March 1945, the western Allies were able to cross the Rhine and penetrate the heart of Ger- many. Meanwhile, the Russians pushed west- ward, taking Berlin in April. The great Nazi machine that had brutalized human beings by glorifving war, by its purges of \"non-Ar\\'ans,\" by its ma.ss executions and concentration camps, collapsed in ruins. Late in April, Hitler com- mitted suicide in his underground shelter in Berlin. On May 7, German military leaders agreed to unconditional surrender. In his history of the Second \\\\'orld War, Churchill wrote that many Europeans, on both the Axis and Allied sides, thought that the Americans would prove soft and undisciplined."},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"In World War II, as in World War I. the immense productive capacity of the United States astonished us and confounded our enemies.

Elsenhower, known as \"Ike\" among the troops, seldom missed an opportunity to talk to soldiers face to face. His warmth and sincerity went a long way to win the affection of the men in the army, just as his ability won their respect. Churchill never shared this doubt. He had studied, he wrote, \"the American Civil War fought out to the last desperate inch.\" On the night he heard that the United States had en- tered the war, he knew Hitler would be de- feated. \"I went to bed,\" he said, \"and slept the sleep of the saved and thankful.\" The achieve- ments of American soldiers, sailors, and airmen justified Churchill's confidence. Dwight D. Eisenhower — Early Career The commander of the armies that landed in Africa and Sicily in 1942 and 1943, as well as of the great force which established the sec- ond front and drove deep into Germany, was an American general, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Few men have ever met more difficult tasks with more success. Bom in Denisoh, Texas, in 1890, Eisenhower spent most of his boyhood in Abilene, Kansas, which had been a brawling \"cow town\" only a few years before. It was unlikely that he would become a professional soldier, because his fam- ily, of Pennsylvania Dutch stock, were pacifists. Ne\\'ertheless he competed for and won an ap- pointment to the United States Military Acad- emy. His parents were poor, and this was a chance to get a free higher education. From the time he entered West Point in 1911 until he emerged from obscurity thirty years later, Eisenhower worked hard to make himself a competent officer. It was not all easy going. Older than most of the cadets, he had difficulty adjusting to the strict discipline of the militan,' academy. In World War I he was disappointed in his am- bition to command troops in France. Between the two world wars, there was a period when he gained no promotion for sixteen \\ears. Yet within the rather small circle of regular army officers Eisenhower gained a high reputation. He stood first in his class in the Army War College, a specialized training school for the ablest officers. He ser\\ed as aide to General Mac.\\rthur, and at MacArthur's request went to tlie Philippines to help organize the Filipino army. He had read widely in the histon,' of warfare, and made a special study of two prob- lems with which he had to deal later: (1) how to get unified command in an alliance of several nations, and (2) how to make most effective use of motorized vehicles and aiqilanes. When World War II broke out, Eisenhower was still only a lieutenant colonel whose great ambition was to command a regiment. But sen- ior officers recognized his ability, and after a brilliant performance in war games in Louisiana in 1941, he was called to ser\\e on the General Staff in Washington. Reporting to Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall a week after Pearl Harbor, he was asked to prepare reports on the best over-all strategy for both the Pacific and European theaters of war. The chief of staff was impressed by Eisenhower's grasp of the war as a whole, as well as by his qualities"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"The Second World War 679 of leadership. Within a few months Roosevelt, on Marshall s advice, appointed Eisenhower to command the American forces in Europe. Later he became supreme commander of all the forces of the Allies in the west. Eisenhower's Abilities Eisenhower justified his superiors' faith in him. Over and above military competence, his task demanded a variety of qualities. He needed the ability to compromise between military rep- resentatives of difierent countries, and between different branches of the military services. Yet he had to be stubborn when it came to insisting that he, and he alone, must make the final military decisions. He had to be cautious about putting military forces in the field before they were sufficiently trained or equipped, yet to gain time he had to take enormous risks, such as when he ordered the D-Day attack on the day planned in spite of appalling weather. He had to be flexible enough to permit changes of plans in the face of sudden difficulties, such as the German breakthrough in the Battle of the Bulge, or of sudden opportunities, such as a German failure to destroy a Rhine River bridge. As this map suggests, it was the Russians who, in Churchill's phrase, \"clawed the guts\" out of the Ger- man army. The first Anglo-American attack on \"fortress Europe,\" by way of Italy, stalled south of Rome. After the Normandy landing on \"D-Day.\" June 6, 1942, the Americans and English finally established a \"second front\" and engaged the main German forces.

His charm, his modest>-, his genuine devotion to the cause of democracy against Naziism, all helped to make him one of the most popular military men in history'. Turn of the Tide in the Pacific The Japanese were unable to organize their vast conquests before the tide of war began to turn against them. In May 1942, an American naval force narrowly defeated a Japanese fleet in the battle of the Coral Sea. A month later an immense Japanese Hotilla was turned back with hea\\'y losses in the three-day battle of Mid- way. These engagements were the first in mod- em naval history in which surface ships did not exchange a single shot. All damage was inflicted by planes or submarines. In August 1942, American forces took the first step on the long and bloody road to Tokyo when marines landed on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. The struggle to hold Guadal- canal, fought out on the ground, at sea, and in the air, lasted six months and se\\eral times seemed close to failure. Not until 1943 did Japa- nese resistance there cease. Conquest of the Pacific Islands, 1943-1945 In risking war with the United States, the Japanese had failed to reckon with the indus- trial strength of America and its ability to mo- bilize that strength rapidly. By December 1942, 17 of the 19 ships damaged at Pearl Harbor were again in commission, and new units were constantly being added. In the autumn of 1942 only one American aircraft carrier remained afloat in the entire Pacific; by 1945 over a hun- dred carriers were in senice. The United States Navy developed entirely new techniques of fueling and repairing ships at sea. Fleets were thus able to operate for long periods without returning to their bases. During 1943 and 1944, American forces en- gaged in \"island hopping\" toward the Philip- pines and Japan. A southern thrust, commanded by General MacArthur, moved along the north shore of New Guinea until it was possible to strike northwest toward the Philippines. In Oc- tober 1944, Mac.\\rthur fulfilled his promise to return to the Philippines when he landed on Leyte. Mac.\\rthur's ad\\ance was matched by amphibious operations, directed by Admiral Chester Nimitz, against Japanese-held islands in the Central Pacific. In 1945 the last of the island outposts of Japan fell with the taking of Iwo Jima in March and Okinawa in June. The Japanese defended these islands with almost unbelievable bravery; although Iwo Jima has an area of only eight square miles, American marines suffered over 20,000 casualties in capturing it. The Japanese now began to use \"Kamikaze\" pilots who flew bomb-laden planes into American ships even though it meant suicide. The Kamikazes scored 279 hits on United States naval \\'essels off the island of Okinawa. By midsummer 1945, Hitler had been de- feated and all the forces of the Allies could be concentrated against Japan. American forces were expected to suffer appalling losses in over- coming the fanatical resistance of Japanese armies fighting on the sacred soil of their own country. The Russians were expected to dispose of Japanese troops in Manchuria. The Atom Bomb and Japanese Surrender, 1945 The most terrible weapon the world had ever known made it unnecessary to invade Ja- pan or to count on the Russians for help.

THE HOME FRONT To fight the Axis, the United States had to mobilize manpower and resources more quickly and completely than ever before. By 1944 more At the time of its greatest extent, late in 1942, the Japanese empire was. in terms of population, the largest the world had ever seen, and it contained immense resources. But British and American mili- tary and naval forces defeated Japan before it had time to consolidate the immense conquests the Jap- anese militarists had made in Asia, the East Indies, and the Pacific.

The work of the agency was made easier by the fact that after Pearl Harbor both the CIO and the AFL made a no-strike pledge. Although there were numerous small wildcat (unauthor- ized) strikes, and two major strikes of the coal workers, the no-strike pledge was on the whole well kept, ^\\'ork stoppages amounted to a small fraction of one per cent of working time. In June 1941, Roosevelt reorganized the sci- entific research program by creating the Office of Scientific Research under the direction of Vanne\\'ar Bush. This organization had almost as much to do with winning the war as the army, navy, or air force. It developed radar- controlled artillery, more accurate bomb sights, a proximity fuse that immensely increased the eflFectiveness of antiaircraft fire, and the ba- zooka, with which infantrvmen could knock out tanks. It helped to make jungles habitable by developing insect-destroying DDT, and to save lives through the use of penicillin and blood plasma. TTie most dramatic and fateful achievement of all was the harnessing of nu- clear energy for military purposes. Attempts to Control Inflation The expansion of war industries caused a corresponding increase in employment. Individ- ual take-home pay also increased, because the work week was longer and workers received time-and-a-half pay for hours worked overtime. Thus more people had more to spend. At the same time the shift of industries to war produc- tion reduced the availability of consumer goods. Runaway inflation threatened. The danger was attacked in a variety of ways. Wages were stabilized at an increase of about 15 per cent and rents were \"frozen.\" An Office of Price Ad- _jiunistration (OPA) attempted to fix the prices qL consumer goods and rationed products in short supply, such as meat, sugar, gasoline, shoes, and canned goods. The federal govern- ment reduced civilian purchasing power by taxes on small incomes as well as large, taken directly out of payrolls. There was a determined effort to persuade people to buy war bonds, which would defer purchasing power until later. This many-sided attack on inflation was not completely successful, but it undoubtedly did immense good. The cost of living rose 29 per cent bet^veen 1939 and 1945 as compared with 63 per cent during the First World War (1914-1918). In the Second World War there was greater effort than in the first to limit profiteering. In addition to heavier corporation and excess profits taxes there were surtaxes on high in- comes that reached the almost confiscatory figure of 94 per cent. Far more than the earlier \"soak-the-rich\" taxes, the war taxes tended to redistribute the wealth. Civil Liberties World War II did not inspire the enthusiasm or ideali.sm of either the Civil War or World War I. Tlie prevailing attitude was that beating the Axis was a dirty job that simply had to be done. There were few war songs, and none to compare with \"John Brown's Body,\" \"Dixie,\" or \"Over There.\" At the same time there was little effective opposition to the war. There was on the whole less invasion of civil liberties during this war than in earlier ones. Conscientious ob- jectors were treated leniently. The press and radio agreed to voluntary censorship and were in turn freed from much direct control. Govern- ment propaganda was on no such mammoth scale as in 1917-1918. But on one important oc- casion the rights of civilians were violated by the federal government on a scale never before seen.

It is estimated that they lost nearly half their property. That this forced \"re- location\" was unnecessary was rexealed by the loyalty of Japanese- Americans in Hawaii during the war. as well as by the fine fighting record of Nisei (Japanese-American) troops. The Election of 1944 In spite of occasional dire predictions that once at war the United States would throw the Constitution overboard, elections were held as usual. The Republicans made heavy gains in the congressional elections of 1942, when the war was going badly. There were hopes, there- fore, of a Republican victon,- in the presidential election of 1944. The Republican nominee was Thomas E. Dewey, go\\emor of New York, who had achieved nation-wide fame as a district at- torney prosecuting racketeers in New York City. The Democrats renominated Roosevelt for a fourth term. Dewey chose not to attack the New Deal. He was unable to criticize effectively the conduct of the war, since victory was in sight. He promised, however, to provide new and vigorous administration to replace the \"tired old men\" of the Democratic administra- tion. The Democrats maintained that the great problems of war and peace must be kept in experienced hands. Once again the voters agreed with this argument. Although Dewey faired slightly better than Wilkie in 1940, Roosevelt again won the presidency by a wide margin. WARTIME DIPLOMACY The problems faced by the United States in the field of foreign affairs in World War II all centered, naturally, on achieving victory over the A.xis. As one historian has written, the aims of the United States were: ... to sustain and fortif\\- the tottering British Em- pire; to keep ali\\e the defeated French nation, al- mcst inanimate under Hitler's heel but still alive and stirring in North .Africa; to arm . . . tire swarm- ing Russian legions; and to prevent the remaining neutrals, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turke>', from falling prey to the enenix': in short, to win the war in Europe, then with Russia's hoped-for aid to knock out Japan in Asia: first VE Day, then \\] Day. Closely tied to the problems of fighting the war was the job of making arrangements for the peace which should follow. The Atlantic Charter, 1941 The most novel feature of the conduct of foreign affairs during \\\\'orld War II was the way heads of state journeyed vast distances, often by air, to confer in person. President Roosevelt, especially, liked to make direct con- frontation with rulers of other states. He had a somewhat exaggerated belief in his ability to arrive at effective agreements through persua- siveness and charm, as he had dealt with con- gressmen or members of his cabinet. The first great meeting of heads of state occurred before American entrance into the war when, in August 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill met on shipboard off the coast of Newfound- land and jointly issued the Atlantic Charter. This was a statement of the \"common princi- ples \" on which depended \"hopes for a better future for the world.\" It was somewhat similar, in both intention and content, to Wilson's Four- teen Points. It looked to a world in which ag- gression should cease, in which peoples should have the right to choose their form of govern- ment, in which natural resources should be shared to provide a better life for all, and in which the burden and fear of armaments should be removed. It suggested, without specifying any of the details, a new world organization to keep the peace."},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"The Second World War 685 The United Nations Declaration, 1942 After Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt turned his at- tention to promoting an effective alliance among the nations opposed to Hitler. On January 1, 1942, representatives of the twenty-four coun- tries at war with the Axis met in Washington and signed the Declaration of the United Na- tions. Each member of the United Nations agreed to abide by the Atlantic Charter, pledged full economic and military support of the war against the Axis, and promised not to make a separate peace. These provisions were written into the lend-lease agreements whereby the United States furnished aid to its allies. In holding the great alliance together, Roosevelt and Churchill were in constant touch. Although they frequently differed on strategy, neither wavered in admiration for the other. Making close working arrangements with other major allies was more difficult. The Chinese government had been pushed back into the hinterland of China, and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was naturally unhappy because the European theater of war got priority. General Charles de Gaulle, leader of the Free French, disapproved of the way the United States con- tinued to recognize the Retain government (see p. 664). The United States hoped by this policy to keep Hitler from seizing the French fleet and from occupying Algeria and Morocco. Even after the Allied North African campaign, Roose- velt and Churchill failed to make De Gaulle a full partner in their discussions because of un- certainty as to whether he really represented France. Cooperation with the USSR presented the greatest difficulty. Roth Roosevelt and Churchill had publicly denounced the Soviet government at the time of the Finnish War in 1939-1940. Churchill said that Soviet policy was impossible to understand; Russia, he remarked, was \"a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.\" Stalin, who had almost never been outside his country, was intensely suspicious of the capi- talistic democracies. Nevertheless, the \"strange alliance\" between the two great democracies and totalitarian government of Russia continued to the end of the war. Germany apparently could not be beaten without Russian aid, and the Russian war effort in turn depended on supplies from Rritain and the United States. Admiration for the heroism of the Russian peo- ple, whose losses on the bloodiest front of the war were heavier than those of any other nation, lulled distrust of their government. Wartime Conferences Cooperation in plans for war and peace was worked out at a series of international confer- ences. At Casablanca, Morocco, in January 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to demand \"un- conditional surrender\" from the Axis powers. At Quebec, Canada, in August 1943, the two men agreed on peace terms for Italy, while their military advisers developed plans for the second front in western Europe. At Cairo, Egypt, in November 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill met Chiang Kai-shek and arranged that Japan should be stripped of her Pacific empire. Korea was also promised independence. From Cairo Roosevelt and Churchill flew to Teheran, capi- tal of Iran, to meet with Stalin. There the three men discussed postwar arrangements, the pos- sibility of Russia entering the war against Japan, and plans for the D-Day attack in the west. In February 1945, Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin met again at the Crimean Conference at Yalta. Publicly they agreed that their nations, along with France, should occupy Germany af- ter the war, that Naziism should be rooted out, that a conference should meet at San Francisco in April to create a new world organization, and that the peoples of Europe should have democratic governments based on free elec- tions.

Stalin in turn agreed to support the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek as the legitimate ruler of China. The Yalta agreements later came under vio- lent attack as a \"sell-out\" to Russia. This charge ignored several facts. In the first place, it seemed vital to keep Russia in the war against Germany at a time when American forces had hardly recovered from the Battle of the Bulge and, even more important, to bring Russia into the war against Japan. It was expected that the defeat of Japan QUESTION • Would would cost from Russia have entered the half a million to icar against Japan if no a million Amer- promiscs had been made ican lives and to her at Yalta? ^yould take eight- een months. Sec- ondly, no territorial concession was made to Stalin that the United States and Britain were in a position to prevent, except the Kurile Islands. Thirdly, Stalin on his part made con- cessions. The main trouble with Yalta was not the agreements themselves, but that Russia later broke them. Central European nations were never granted free elections, and StaHn failed to fulfill his promise to support Chiang Kai-shek. Churchill's judgment of Yalta was this: \"Our hopeful assumptions were soon to be falsified. Still, they were the only ones possible at the time.\" Death of Roosevelt On the aftemoon of April 12, 1945, President Roosevelt suddenly died at Warm Springs, Georgia. His death was perhaps mourned more widely than that of any other man in history. According to Henry L. Stimson, his Secretary of War, who serxed him loN-ally yet obser\\'ed him critically, Roosevelt had been a great war President. While he made mistakes in picking subordinates and in failing to give them clear responsibility, he had shown, according to Stim- son, a clear grasp of world strategy, \"courage and determination ... in time of threatened dis- aster,\" and \"very strong faith in the future of our country and of freedom, democracy, and humanitarianism throughout the world.\" Before his death, with victory in sight, Roosevelt was thinking ahead to peace. On his desk was a draft of a speech for a Jefferson Day Dinner. It contained these words:"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"The Second World War 687 Today we are faced \\Wth the preeminent fact that, if civilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science of human relationships— the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live together and work to- gether in the same world, at peace. BIRTH OF THE UNITED NATIONS On April 25, 1945, representatives of about fifty anti-Axis nations met at San Francisco, California, to make plans for a world union. The groundwork had been carefully laid. In October 1943, foreign ministers of the United States, China, Great Britain, and the USSR met at Moscow and agreed to establish \"a general in- ternational organization\" to maintain \"peace and security.\" In the ne.xt month the United States Senate passed the Connally Resolution favoring American membership in the proposed league. From August to October 1944, diplomats of the great powers met at Dumbarton Oaks, a mansion near Washington, to make detailed plans. At Yalta, Russian objections were tem- porarily quieted when the United States and Britain agreed that seats in the proposed United Nations Assembly be given to two additional republics of the USSR— the Ukraine and Byelo- russia. Arthur Vandenberg, Statesman In 1940 Arthur Vandenberg was an isolationist. His record in the Senate had been so consistent that the Republican convention of 1940, unwilling to support isolation, gave him scant consideration. They chose Wendell Willkie, an inter- ventionist, instead. In 1945 Senator Vandenberg was an interventionist. Between 1940 and 1945 ie had become convinced that a concert of nations would be necessary to maintain the peace, once it was won. As one of the Republican members of a bipartisan delegation, he went to San Francisco for the first crucial sessions in which the United Nations completed its organization. Returning, he was largely responsible for the huge majority, 89-2, by which the United States Senate ap- proved the Charter of the United Nations and the membership of the United States in that organization. In the closing days at San Francisco, Vandenberg wrote: \"We have finished our job. I am proud of it. It has been the crowning privilege of my life to have been an author of the San Francisco Charter.\" In 1948 he gave further evidence of statesmanship. Rising above partisan op- position to the Truman administrations foreign policy, he fought tenaciously for Senate approval of the Marshall Plan. The plan saved Western Europe from economic collapse. In the same year he introduced the Senate resolution which made possible the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He fully realized the importance of his change of position. In one of his letters to his wife, he commented: \"Everybody now seems to agree that I could have beaten the Charter if I had taken the opposition tack.\" Again, and later, he wrote her: \"At any rate, I have 'done my bif for the peace of the world — and I guess that justifies my senatorial existence.\" (Theme 10, see p. xii)"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"ess TIic Room tilt Years In planning for the San Francisco Confer- ence, Roosevelt had tried to avoid mistakes made by Woodrow Wilson in 19 18-19 19. He slighted neither the opposition party nor Con- gress when choosing the United States delega- tion. The Honse and Senate each sent one Re- publican and one Democratic member. The President also selected Commander Harold E. Stassen, former Republican governor of Minne- sota, and Virginia C. Gilderslccve, dean of Bar- nard College, whose presence symbolized the increasing political importance of women. The statesmen at Versailles had tried to form a world organization and to arrange detailed peace terms at the same time. The idea behind the timing of the San Francisco Conference was to form the world organization first, while the nations were still imited in a wartime alliance, and write the peace treaties later. San Francisco Conference, 1945 Negotiations at San Francisco were made difficult by growing suspicion, on the part of her Allies, of Russia's intentions. Already it appeared that the agreements made at Yalta were being broken, both in regard to Russian treatment of Poland and in regard to the extent to which one of the great powers could prevent action by the United Nations. Nevertheless, the San Francisco Conference managed to produce in two months the constitution for an interna- tional league similar to the former League of Nations. The elofjuent preamble of the UN Charter pledged all the countries signing it to \"faith in fundamental human rights,\" to \"justice and respect for obligations arising from peace treaties,\" to efforts to \"live together as good neighbors,\" and to the maintenance of \"interna- tional peace and security.\" All nations great and small were equally represented in a General Assembly, which had the right to debate world affairs but little power to direct them. The principal responsibility for keeping the peace was to rest with the Security Council of eleven members which would always be in session. The United States, China, France, Great Britain, and the USSR each had a permanent council seat, the other six places being rotated. Deci- sions of the Security Council required a vote of seven members, including all five of the perma- nent members. Thus each permanent member had the right to veto any major action, and the Security Council would be effective only so long as the wartime cooperation of the \"big five\" continued. In other words, the UN was powerless to act if a single major power de- cided to prevent it. UN Agencies The charter provided for an International Court of Justice, but it had no power to compel obedience to its decisions. It planned for a number of international agencies, such as a Trusteeship Council to oversee certain \"back- ward areas,\" an Economic and Social Council to promote international economic co-oneration and raise living standards, and a Military Staff Committee to organize a peace-keeping UN military force. UN agencies were to be staffed by a pemianent civil senice, the Secretariat, selected and paid by the organization itself. The Security Council might ask UN members to punish aggression by either economic boy- cott or military action. The action of the United States regarding the UN Charter contrasted with that in 1919 when a minority of the Senate blocked Ameri- can membership in the League of Nations. In 1945 the United States was the first to take action, when the Senate ratified the Charter by a vote of 89 to 2. The first use of the atom bomb nine days later reinforced the feeling that \"it must not happen again.\" Trusting the new organization, in which they hoped to take a full part, and blind to its weaknesses, Americans hoped to return fore\\'er to the path of peace."},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"Activities: Chapter 29 For Mastery and Review 1.

Most of these are either explicit or im- plicit in each of the nine Parts into which this text is divided. It is useful, however, to select particular themes for illustration, emphasis, and study at the end of each Part. Two themes seem especially relevant to Part VIII: \"belief in reform rather than revolution\" and \"world-wide responsibility.\" Questions suggested by these themes: 1. Two eminent historians, Morison and Commager, in The Growth of the American Republic, express the opinion that \"Roosevelt . . . saved the [American economic] system by ridding it of its grosser abuses and forcing it to accommodate Itself to the public interest and general welfare.\" Was this an alternative to re- volution? See Davies, The New Deal: Interpretations. 2. In view of the great extent of hardship and suffering during 1929-1933, why was there little violence and no revolution? Were the rebels whom Shays led in 1786 or the Great Plains farmers who were exhorted to raise less corn and more Hell in the 1890's worse or better off than the dispossessed farmer and unemployed worker in 1933? 3.

The hero did not want to fight, but was honor-bound to do so. So he shot it out with the villain. He won, put his six-shooter back in its holster, mounted his pinto pony, and rode back to the spring plowing. Now it is different. In the years 1941-1945 the United States was a victor in the most prolonged and difficult foreign war in its history. It helped to set up the United Nations as a sort of international sheriff's posse to keep future bad men in order and then fried to return to peacetime pursuits. But soon an ex-ally whom the United States had helped to save from Nazi hordes — and who in all fairness had saved the U.S. the trouble of fighting more than half the German army — turned out to be a new villain. This time it was not possible to shoot it out to a finish. Atomic weapons had turned all-out war to mutual annihilation. All this is frustrating to a people not used to accepting substitutes for victory. Americans have to live with a seemingly never-ending struggle against a foe who sometimes advances, sometimes retreats, but never sleeps. And when Russia seemed to be willing to accept a live-and-let-live policy, Communist China stepped in as the implacable foe of the United States and all it stood for. The Communists are more difficult to deal with than the Nazis. On the one hand, they are ready to draw back when they meet determined opposition; on the other, they are not dis- couraged by a single defeat. They stoutly believe that history is on their side, that they are certain to win eventually. Only by policies as long-range, as determined, and as flexible as those of the Communists can the United States and its allies fight the Cold War successfully. There is no clear-cut line between domestic and foreign policy. Foreign policy invades our daily lives. Heavy taxes are required to support the military establish- ment and aid the allies of the United States. Young men must give up peacetime pursuits for military service. What Americans do in their daily lives, in turn, affects foreign policy, since the world is watching to see whether they practice the prin- ciples they preach. Could the United States have avoided World War II and its sequel, the Cold War? Perhaps it could have avoided the former if its leaders had chosen to ig- nore the pledge to preserve the integrity of China and if it had allowed Britain to fight alone. America might have stayed out of the Cold War by turning its back on Europe, as in 1919, and by allowing new Asian and African nations to fend for themselves. But the United States did not choose to ignore its commitments, and the Cold War has yet to be won."},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"Chapter 30 The Cold War Begins / suppose that history will remember my term irt office as the years when the Cold War began to overshadow our lives.

And always in the background there has been the atomic bomb. HARRY S. TRUMAN When the news of Franklin Roosevelt's sud- den death reached Washington, Vice-President Truman was called to the White House. There Eleanor Roosevelt told him, \"Harry, the Presi- dent is dead.\" For a moment he could not speak and then said, \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" Mrs. Roosevelt replied, \"Is there anything I can do for you? You're the one in trouble now.\" Next day Truman told reporters that he felt as though the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on him; he asked them to pray for him. On the face of it, Harry S. Truman was ill-prepared to meet the appalUng problems that were suddenly his. He had not been briefed on major matters of foreign policy or military strategy, such as the secret engagement of Rus- sia to enter the war against Japan or the atom bomb. He had no experience with diplomacy. His previous political career had been that of a machine politician in Missouri, followed by two terms in the United States Senate. His one nota- ble achievement had been the chairmanship of a Senate War Investigation Committee that had discovered waste and profiteering in war pro- duction during World War II and had saved the United States some hundreds of millions of dollars. He had been nominated for Vice-Presi- dent in 1944 after Democratic urban bosses and southern conservatives revolted against re- nomination of Henry A. Wallace, a liberal New Dealer whom Roosevelt had imposed on a re- luctant Democratic convention in 1940. At the time he was suddenly thrust before the pubhc eye, the new President seemed to be one of the most average of average men. The New Yorker wrote of him: There's one thing about President Truman— he is made in the image of the people. You go into a men's shop to buy a pair of pajamas. President Truman waits on you. You go to have a tooth x-rayed, Truman takes the picture. You board a downtown bus, Truman is at the wheel. Probably it's those glasses he wears, but whatever it is, we rather like having a President who always seems to be around. President Roosevelt was for the peo- ple, but Harry Truman is the people. 695"},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"It later appeared that Truman had a tendency to lose his temper over petty trifles and to make occasional rash statements. At first he made mistakes by being in a hurry, as when he signed without reading it an order to cut off lend-lease shipments abroad right after Germany had been defeated. It was an action that made our allies think that the United States was going to let them starve. The President soon reversed his field, but the incident hardly made for con- fidence in his judgment. As time went on, it became clear that in spite of his undistinguished appearance and his small-town ways, President Truman was no or- dinary man. He worked hard and efficiently. He mastered the details of his job. He learned how to delegate action and at the same time assume responsibility. His greatest quality was symbol- ized bv a sign on his desk: \"The buck stops here.\" When great crises came up, such as the threatened Communist take-over of Greece, the Russian attempt to cut off Berlin, or the inva- sion of southern Korea, the President displayed an extraordinary capacity for quick, effective, and yet restrained action. His conduct of for- eign affairs gave evidence that Truman was speaking no more than the truth when he said, \"All my life, whenever it came time to make a decision, I made it and forgot about it.\" The war is over! President Truman reads the Japanese request for surrender in August 1945. The President is shown surrounded by his closest advisors, many of whom were to play leading roles as the nation shifted from problems of war to the problem of gaining a lasting peace in the world. SHIFT TO PEACETIME ECONOMY The very newspapers that told of Japan's surrender in August 1945 contained headlines predicting that six to ten million people would soon be unemployed. The shift to a peacetime economy was expected to result in a slowdown in business activity. Furthermore, the Napole- onic Wars, the Civil War, and World War I had been followed shortly by economic depres- sions (see charts on pp. 296-297, 470-471, and 778-779). There was evidence that the Commu- nists counted on a depression and hoped to use it to their advantage. But American fears and Russian hopes proved groundless. As it turned out, there was only a slight downturn in busi- ness activity and almost none in employment. Indeed, within tvvo or three years wartime lev- els of employment were exceeded. The continuing boom was apparently the result of a number of factors. Farm income re- mained high, as the United States continued to feed not only its own people but many millions abroad. Savings accumulated by individuals during the war provided a reserve of buying power. The demand for peacetime goods in turn stimulated business investment in machines and factories to produce peacetime goods. Although sharply cut back, military expenditures re- 696"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"THE UPWARD SPIRAl OF INFLATION mained high by pre\\\\'ar standards and poured money into the economy. Private industry cooperated to promote rapid transition toward a peacetime economy. A Committee for Economic Development ( CED ) , set up in 1942, pooled the theoretical knowl- edge of economists and the practical knowledge of businessmen to make plans for averting a postsvar slump. Heading CED was Paul Hoff- man, president of the Studebaker Company, knowTi as a \"super-salesman.\" Hoffman trav- eled throughout the countr>' selling businessmen the idea that if they wished to avoid further government controls, they must provide full em- ployment. By the war's end, over three thou- sand cities and to\\\\'ns had worked out detailed plans for quick conversion to peacetime pro- duction and reemployTnent of the 12,000,000 men of the armed forces who would return to civilian life. Perhaps the most important factor in pre- venting a postwar depression was full employ- ment itself, which provided an immense reser- voir of purchasing power. Prosperity became a responsibility of the federal government with the passage of the Employment Act of 1946, the stated purpose of which was to \"promote ma.ximum employment, production, and pur- chasing power.\" This law furnished the Presi- dent with a Council of Economic Advisers to make annual reports on the state of the economy together with recommendations for any action needed to keep it in high gear.

Yet so great was the cost of the war effort that the national debt increased from less than $50,000,000,000 to nearly $270,000,000,000. The federal government had borrowed much of this sum from Federal Reserve banks. The banks in turn issued new money with federal bonds as security. The result was currency inflation. There was four times as much money in circu- lation in 1945 as in 1938. Another force tending to produce inflation was the immense backlog of unsatisfied con- sumer demand for peacetime goods. Consumers and retailers became impatient with ration stamps and controlled prices. Black markets in- creased. There were shortages of everything— nylon stockings, building materials, shoes, beef- steak. Manufacturers and cattlemen wanted to sell in a free market and predicted that compe- tition would keep prices down. President Tru- man urged that price controls be continued through the wartime Office of Price Adminis- tration (OPA), but Congress was reluctant to continue it. Finally, a bill was passed that con- tinued OPA, but with such drastically curtailed powers that Truman declared it would be use- less to prevent inflation and vetoed it. OPA closed down in late June 1946, r.«>d within three weeks commodity prices rose by 25 per cent. While prices went up, pay checks shrank, as factories returned to a 40-hour week and workers ceased receiving overtime pay. Caught in a \"double squeeze,\" workers demanded a higher wage. If it was refused them, they often went off the job. In 1946 there were fi\\'e thou- sand strikes, an all-time high. Nearly 4,600,000 men were involved, approximately a quarter of the unionized workers of the nation. Most alarming were strikes involving basic industries, such as steel, automobile, and coal. The public was fearful of the power of minority groups to paralyze the whole economy. Even President Truman, who generally favored labor, asked Congress for power to draft striking railroad workers into the army. A United Mine Workers' strike was halted by a federal injunction. On an appeal, the Supreme Court held that the Norris-La Guardia anti-injunction law (see pp. 621, 641 ) did not prevent the federal govern- ment from ordering laborers back to work to prevent \"a public calamity.\" The Eightieth Congress Labor unions and their activities were a cen- tral issue in the midterm congressional election of 1946. The fear inspired by the big strikes and by the power wielded by such a leader as John L. Lewis was probably a major factor in inducing voters to favor conser^'ative candi- dates. In any case the Republicans showed new vigor as they campaigned on the slogan \"Had Enough?\" They gained control of both the House and the Senate for the first time in sixteen years. An immediate result of this swing toward conservatism was the Taft-Hartley Act, passed over President Truman's veto in June 1947. This complicated measure, which may be regarded as in effect a series of amendments to the Wag- ner Act (see p. 638), was designed to restrain the power of labor unions and prevent labor abuses. Among practices it forbade were closed- shop contracts (which forced employers to hire only union members); jurisdictional strikes (de- signed to force an employer to recognize one union instead of another); \"featherbedding\" ( pay for services not rendered ) ; and high initia- tion fees. Union officers were required to take an oath that thev were not members of the Com- munist partv— this provision applied also to employers. The use of union funds in political campaigns was forbidden. If a strike threatened to tie up the national economy, the President could get a court injunction to enforce an eighty-day \"cooling off\" period. The Taft-Hartley Act was one of the most controversial measures ever passed by Congress."},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"Labor spokesmen denounced it as a \"slave labor law,\" erasing gains the unions had made since 1933.

The Eightieth Congress lowered wartime taxes, especially those that fell on large incomes. It passed a law to estabhsh a commission to recommend methods of improving the efBciency of the executive departments. To emphasize the fact that this was a nonpartisan measure, Tru- man appointed former President Hoover as chairman of the commission. But Congress pro- duced little other domestic legislation, for it found itself in a deadlock with President Tru- man. At various times the President proposed measures in the tradition of the New Deal, such as slum clearance and the expansion of social security coverage. All failed to win legis- lative support. Truman and Civil Rights Truman came from a former slave state, and members of his mother's family had been ardent Confederate sympathizers. But in his early po- litical career he had fought the Ku Klux Klan, and as President he defended no cause more ardently than equal rights for Negroes, ^^'hen Congress refused to pass legislation continuing the wartime Fair Employment Practices Com- mission, Truman resorted to executive action. In 1946 he appointed a fact-finding Commission During the panic days after Pearl Harbor, Japanese Americans on the West Coast were unfairly arrested and herded into concentration camps for fear that they would engage in sabotage and espionage. on Civil Rights; he told its members that he wanted to make the Bill of Rights apply equally to every American. In 1947 the Commission is- sued an eloquent report, To Secure These Rights, which made a number of recommenda- tions designed \"to guarantee the same rights to every person regardless of who he is, where he lives, or what his racial, religious or national origins are.\" The commission's recommenda- tions extended beyond erasing discrimination against Negroes. It urged, for instance, that immigration quotas be abolished and that the West Coast Japanese-Americans who were de- prived of freedom and property at the opening of World War II be repaid for their losses. In 1948 Truman, in his role as commander in chief, issued an order that there should be equality of opportunity and treatment for all members of the armed forces. The most impor- tant result of this was the rapid elimination of segregated units. By the time Truman left office in 1953, segregation had been abolished in the army, naxy, and air force. For the first time in the history of America, large numbers of Ne- groes and whites lived together on a basis of equality."},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"ELECTORAL VOTE , . p^p^,_^^ ^^^^ Truman 303 V 24,105,812 (Dewey 189 21,970,065 ] Thurmond 39 I, 169,063 (Including on«. elax:tor in Tc.nncs5«.e.)

Even the most careful political observers had underesti- mated the effectiveness of Truman's one-man cam- y ^ paign and the New Deal's continuing appeal. A Political IVIiracle: Election of 1948 One reason for the deadlock between the President and the Republican leaders of the Eightieth Congress was that both sides were jockeying for political advantage. The 1948 Re- publican Convention again nominated Thomas E. Dewey. The New York governor campaigned as though the election result were a certainty; he avoided discussion of issues and called on Americans to join him in promoting \"unity.\" The Democrats renominated Truman, but only after prominent party members had failed to persuade General Eisenhower to run. The party was badly spht. Southern members re- sented Truman's efforts to promote racial equal- ity. Some of these formed a separate States' Rights party, nicknamed \"Dixiecrats,\" and nomi- nated Governor J. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina for President. In the North, Henry A. Wallace, former Secretary of Agriculture and Vice President, bolted the Democrats and ran for President under the Progressive label used by Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 and Robert M. La Follette in 1924. Wallace promised to \"get along\" with Russia and to greatly expand the New Deal. Nearly all political experts and public opin- ion polls predicted a Dewey victory. Betting odds ran 15 to 1 in his favor. Perhaps 90 per cent of the press supported him. One of the few Democrats who did not privately concede the election was Truman himself. Traveling 22,000 miles, the President delivered hundreds of speeches to increasing numbers gathered at ball parks, city squares, and \"whistle-stops.\" He made his target the \"do-nothing\" Eightieth Congress, arguing that it represented \"the privileged few, and not the common, everyday man.\" Especially he called on farmers and laborers to protect the gains they had made under the New Deal. The election was so close that the result was uncertain until the day after the polls closed. Although he lost four southern states to Thurmond and a million northern votes to Wallace, Truman was returned to office. Among the explanations for this amazing upset were Republican overconfidence; successful Demo- cratic efforts to get voters to the polls; and the continuing strength of the New Deal, especially in major agricultural states. The three-way Democratic spht that looked ruinous may have been a blessing in disguise. The Dixiecrat re- bellion helped Truman's cause with Negro voters in the North; Wallace's campaign blunted efforts to pin the Communist label on the President. The professional pollsters were caught off base because they failed to note a last-minute swing of undecided voters toward the Democratic column. In any case, the result was an immense personal triumph for Truman: his whistle-stop campaign had turned the tide. The Fair Deal In his state of the union message of January 1949, Truman proposed a \"Fair Deal,\" which meant a continuation and extension of the New Deal. The President urged slum clearance, sub- sidies for public schools, government-fostered"},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"The Cold War Begins 701 medical insurance, aid to agriculture, and higher minimum wages. But although the new Congress was Democratic, it was generally con- trolled by an unofficial coalition of Republicans and conservative southern Democrats. Hence only part of the Fair Deal program became law. Farmers were promised subsidies if the market prices of major farm products fell be- low certain fixed parity prices, based upon a cost-of-living index. Federal funds were voted for slum clearance. A Minimum Wage Act raised the minimum hom-ly wage for businesses engaged in interstate commerce from 40 to 75 cents. Social security benefits were extended to new groups, including teachers and the self- employed. In 1949 there was a halt in postwar pros- perity. Heavy industry slackened off; unem- ployment rolls increased. But the situation was never as bad as in any year during the 1930's. There was no panic, nor serious need for large- scale relief. In contrast to the situation before the New Deal, there were now various \"built-in stabilizers\" that operated almost automatically against a dowTiward plunge in the economy. These included price supports for agricultural products, unemployment insurance, increased social security benefits, and minimum wage laws. The Full Employment Act also helped to create confidence because the federal govern- ment was now committed to action to stop a catastrophic drop fike that of 1929-1932. Pri- vate enterprise contributed to economic stabil- ity by such measures as company pension plans. The Korean War, beginning in 1950, changed the economic pictiu-e sharply, as a rearmament program competed with the de- mand for consumer goods. The \"Truman Scandals\" During the latter years of Truman's presi- dency it was revealed that there was corrup- tion in high places. Men close to him had re- ceived valuable presents in return for political influence with government bureaus. Members of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the Department of Justice, and the Internal Reve- nue Service took bribes in return for favors. Democratic city machines were sho\\\\Ti to have close ties with gangsters. While the President was not personally involved and misdoing was on no such scale as under the Grant and Harding administrations, the \"Truman scan- dals\" provided the Republicans with a ready- made issue for the 1952 presidential election. OPENING OF THE COLD WAR Overshadowing all domestic problems dur- ing the Truman administration was the opening of the Cold War between the United States and the rest of the free world on the one hand, and Russia with her satellites and China on the other. This struggle could be foreseen even before World War II came to an end, when Stalin violated the Yalta agreement concerning free elections in Poland. The Cold War was fully joined when Truman helped Greece and Turkey to resist Communist aggression in 1947, and it has not stopped since. It is a strife like none other in which Americans have been en- gaged. Only twice, in Korea and in Vietnam, has it involved putting armies into combat. It has meant, however, a state of constant mih- tary preparedness, and military support for enemies or possible victims of communism all over the globe. It has been fought in the eco- nomic sphere, as both sides attempted to \"buy\" allies with gifts, ranging from foodstuffs to steel plants. Above all, it has become a struggle for the minds of men. This has produced propa- ganda of every sort— posters, broadcasts, over- seas libraries, student exchanges. Ultimately, the Cold War involves the question of which sys- tem deserves to survive by offering the most opportunities for good lives."},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"The Iron Curtain The quarrel was not of our choosing. On the contrary, Americans wanted to get along with Russia. According to James F. Byrnes, Truman's Secretary of State after the war: \"As a result of our sufferings and sacrifices in a common cause, the Soviet Union . . . had in the United States a deposit of good will, as great, if not greater, than that of any other country.\" Byrnes and Truman sincerely at- tempted to reach accommodations with the USSR, even when it meant making concessions that they regretted. It became increasingly clear, however, that it was no more possible to appease Stalin than Hitler. Russian actions changed American good will to fear and dis- trust. By 1946 Stalin had apparently decided that no peace was possible between the capitalist and Communist worlds. Not only did he. say so publicly, but his actions destroyed the big- power unity which Roosevelt had tried to forge during World War II. In the countries of Cen- tral Europe that Russian armies had liberated from the Germans, the Communists established one-party governments which took orders from Moscow. All opposition, dissent, or free expres- sion of opinion was ruthlessly suppressed. In March 1946, in a speech delivered at Fulton, Missouri, with President Harry Tru- \"From Stettin on the Baltic to Trieste on the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the continent,\" warned Churchill in a Ful- ton, Missouri, speech in1946. man on the platform, Winston Churchill de- clared: \"From Stettin on the Baltic to Trieste on the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the continent.\" The West, said the for- mer British prime minister, must meet the chal- lenge, by force if necessary, because the Com- munists had contempt for weakness. Truman and his diplomatic advisers came to agree with Churchill that a \"get tough\" policy toward Russia had been forced upon them. The Strength of Communism The new antagonist was in many ways more dangerous than the Axis. Although the USSR and its satellites held no such military superior- ity as the Axis powers enjoyed early in World War II, the Communists had more effective psychological weapons. The Nazis were hated and feared even before their armies conquered neighboring countries. They had glorified Ger- mans as a master race with a right to turn France into a warriors' playground, to reduce the Slavic people to hewers of wood and draw- ers of water, and— reverting to a barbarism more terrible than that of the Huns or the Tartar hordes of Genghis Khan— to exterminate the Jews. And in Asia the \"divine mission\" of the Mikado to rule China and nations to the south had little appeal to non-Japanese, who had little desire to trade one master for another."},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"The Cold War Begins 703 In the long run the Communists are prob- ably more dangerous opponents than were the Fascists, because the Communists' message has a wider appeal. Most of the world lives in desperate poverty, and many millions are un- employed—the Communists promise work and a decent living for all. Millions suffer discrimi- nation because of race or religion— the Commu- nists declare that all men (at least all who work with their hands) are brothers. Many people, especially the young, want to find identity by dedicating themselves to a cause— the Communists call on all men and women of good will to join in a crusade against poverty and oppression. The Communists profess belief in government by the people and call the states they control \"people's democracies.\" Often it is only after they have taken o\\'er a country that its people learn that the bright promises of communism are false and that they mask a totahtarian system of tyranny over body and mind. The strength of communism rests not merely on Russian and Chinese armies and the attractions of the Communist message, but also on agents all over the world. Unquestioning party members, and their dupes, are willing, on orders from Moscow or Peking, to engage in spying, sabotage, and the promotion of un- rest. Sometimes they win enough support to organize guerilla forces and to attempt to gain power through civil war. Such tactics have been used, with varying success, in Greece, China, Malaya, Indochina, and the Philippines. The Communists see the world as a place of struggle between themselves, representing the forces of enlightenment and progress, and the capitalist countries, representing repression and reaction. \"For the Communist,\" writes a recent observer, \"every non-Communist is either a potential convert or simply an oppo- nent who must be fought. Communists partici- pating in any non-Communist organization seek to subvert it, and thus bend it to their pur- poses, or, failing that, to destroy it.\" There may be truce with the Commimist world be- cause of fear of mutual annihilation, but no stable peace in the immediately foreseeable future. THE UNITED NATIONS As the last chapter suggested, no country had done more to promote the formation of the United Nations than the United States; no country had wanted it more; no country had higher expectations for it as a means of ridding the world of the scourge of war. It was fitting that the magnificent capitol buildings of the UN should be in this country. American ex- pectations were, indeed, somewhat exagger- ated, since the UN lacked power to enforce its decisions and in some situations even lacked the power to make a decision. It must also be remarked that the United States was somewhat to blame for the weakness of the UN. The Americans were just as responsible as the Russians for writing the big-power veto into the UN Charter. In 1946 the United States Senate further weakened the international or- ganization when it voted the crippling Con- nally Amendment to American acceptance of the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. According to the Connally Amendment, the United States would decide for itself whether or not it QUESTION • Why would would accept the a majority of the Senate jurisdiction of the vote for the Connally World Court in Amendment? any particular case. When the most powerful nation in the world refused to grant the judicial branch of the UN independ- ent power, it postponed indefinitely the hope that international disputes might be decided by rule of law."},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"704 The Cold War UN Failures The most obvious reason the UN did not live up to the bright hopes that surrounded its birth was the Cold War. \"To the Communists,\" writes a recent observer, \"the UN is no more than an instrument of conflict,\" rather than an agency for international cooperation. Meetings of UN bodies were often paralyzed because diplomats from both sides of the Iron Curtain spent their time denouncing each other, or be- cause action was blocked by Russian %etoes. The expectation that the UN would ha\\'e a peace-keeping army of its own, as pro\\ided by the charter, was soon abandoned because the Russian and American positions were so far apart. Efforts at disarmament by international agreement failed for the same reason. The most appalling failure in this area came with the effort to outlaw atomic warfare. In 1946 the United States, then the only country possessing the atomic bomb, urged that control o\\er atomic development be turned over to an In- ternational Atomic Authority imder the UN. It would not be subject to the veto, and would have the right of inspection to see that its purposes were carried out. The non-Com- munist nations in the UN were prepared to accept this generous offer, but the Russians blocked it. They would allow no foreign in- spectors behind the Iron Curtain. The tragic result of failure to put atomic energy under international control was a race to produce new weapons. The USSR had manu- factured an atomic bomb by 1949, the British by 1952. Meanwhile, the United States devel- oped the even more terrible hydrogen bomb. The radioactive \"fallout\" from a single explo- sion could destroy or endanger the lives of all people lixdng in an area as large as New Jersey. According to the great scientist Albert Einstein, the destruction of all life on earth was now \"within the range of technical possibilities.\" UN Achievements Although failing to bring peace in the Cold War, the UN has done much to avert or halt armed conflicts. During the first five years of its existence, it arranged an uneasy truce be- tween Israel and Arab states and another be- tween India and Pakistan in the disputed prov- ince of Kashmir. It brought war to an end in the Dutch East Indies and fixed terms under which the Republic of Indonesia came into existence. Keeping the peace is not the UN's only function. Its \"specialized agencies,\" such as the World Health Organization, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Food and Agriculture Organization, do vital work in such widely varying fields as combating epidemics, stabilizing currencies, and supplying loans for development of indus- try and commerce in the less prosperous coim- tries. Still, it is as a peace-making agency that the UN is judged. Here its one undeniable value has been that it is a bridge between the Com- munist and non-Communist worlds. It is a place where both sides can appeal to world opinion. According to John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State from 1953 to 1959: The United Nations ... is, in its own right, weak; but its power to expose gives it influence. If the spodight is turned on one who is perpetrating a theft, he will often drop his booty. The power to turn on a light so bright that all the world can see is itself an enormous power. Perhaps the greatest value of the UN as a peace-keeping mechanism is the least spectacu- lar, because it does not reach the headlines. The UN provides a channel constantly open for communication between the nations of the world.

The Organization of American States At the San Francisco Conference in 1945 the United States insisted that the United Na- tions Charter allow for regional organizations of states, even at the expense of weakening the UN itself. The purpose of this action was to promote closer cooperation among American countries. An Inter-American Conference had already met in Mexico and issued the Act of Chapultepec (March 1945)-, proclaiming the solidarity of the American republics and their devotion to the peaceful settlement of interna- tional disputes. A conference at Bogota, Colom- bia, in 1948, set up an Organization of American States ( OAS ) for mutual protection against ag- gression either by member states or from out- side this hemisphere. The OAS Charter provides for formal meetings of an Inter-American Con- ference every five years, for meetings of foreign ministers to consider action in time of crisis, and for an executive council in continuous ses- sion. THE WEST ORGANIZES The essential policies for meeting the threat of Communist expansion were developed dur- ing the Truman administration and have been carried on, with no major change, by succeed- ing Presidents. They owed much to General George C. Marshall, who became Secretary of State in 1947, and to Dean Acheson, who suc- ceeded him in 1949. Truman would have been helpless, however, had not something of the bipartisan spirit that Congress displayed dur- ing World War II continued after hostilities ended. A high proportion of Republican mem- bers of Congress who were bitterly opposed The most significant contribution of the United Nations nnay prove to be the work of the special- ized agencies of the Economic and Social Coun- cil. These agencies channel the resources and technical knowledge of more prosperous nations to help underdeveloped nations. N"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"706 The Cold War to the President's domestic measures neverthe- less backed most of his foreign pohcies. In par- ticular, Arthur H. Vandenberg, ranking Repub- lican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, collaborated closely with Truman in formulating policy and winning support for it. The President, in turn, publicly thanked Re- publicans for their support and usually con- sulted congressional leaders before taking important actions. Containment of Communism The Truman policies did not always win bipartisan backing, and they were often de- cided only after bitter public discussion. They were attacked by isolationists as too militaristic, by philanthropists as too stingy, by taxpayers as too expensive, by professional patriots as being \"soft on communism.\" Amidst so many pressures it was not surprising that American policy was not always consistent. In general, a fairly clear line of action emerged, known as \"containment.\" Its essential idea was to keep communism within its existing boundaries: to say to Moscow, and later to Peking as well, \"Thus far shall you go and no farther!\" The Truman Doctrine Containment began in Europe. Early in 1947, the British government secretly informed Washington that it must soon withdraw its troops from Greece. American experts in Greece sent word that this would mean a Communist take-over in the country. Already guerrillas, with military support from beyond the Iron Curtain, controlled much of the north of Greece. In this crisis President Truman lost little time in deciding that the United States must act. If Greece fell to the Communists, Turkey would go next, then perhaps Italy, or the Middle East. Therefore in March 1947, Truman told a joint session of Congress that the United States must \"help free people to .maintain their free institutions and their na- tional integrity\" against direct or indirect ag- gression. Congress voted military and economic aid to both Greece and Turkey, and the Greek government eventually suppressed the Commu- nist rebellion. This Truman Doctrine was in direct con- trast to that portion of the Monroe Doctrine which declared that the United States would not interfere in the internal affairs of European countries. It dramatized the change from the isolation of the nineteenth century to the world-wide responsibility of the twentieth. The Berlin Air Lift In 1945, Russia was granted control of east- ern Germany except for Berlin, which was di- vided into four sections under American, British, French, and Russian authorities. In the summer of 1948, the USSR tried to starve the Western powers out of Berlin by stopping all traffic from West Germany. The western allies overcame the Berlin blockade by an \"air lift,\" whereby supplies for over two million people were flown to the German capital. Hour after hour, day after day, for over a year, American and British cargo planes carried food, medical supplies, clothing, even coal, to the German capital. In May 1949, Russia lifted the block- ade. \"When we refused to be forced out of the city of Berlin,\" wrote Truman, \"we demon- strated to the people of Europe that with their cooperation we would act, and act resolutely, when their freedom was threatened.\" The IVIarshall Plan The suppression of communism in Greece and the air lift to Berlin were accompanied by efforts to rebuild the economic and military strength of Western Europe.

But soup kitchen relief provided no permanent solution, and the economy of Europe was shattered. In France alone over six hundred miles of railroad bridges had been destroyed, so people almost starved to death because crops could not be moved to market. In the American and British zones of Germany, food rations provided little more than a thousand calories a day; American cig- arettes passed as currency; one pack was said to equal the monthly wage of a laborer. In Great Britain during the severe winter of 1946- 1947, electricity was turned on for only three hours a day. Such a situation provided a seed- bed for communism, and the Communist party in France attracted more voters than any other; in Italy it received the support of a third of the electorate. In June 1947, Secretary of State George C. Marshall proposed that the United States help European nations in a united effort to raise pro- duction. Marshall included Russia and the countries behind the Iron Curtain in his offer. But the USSR denoimced the whole scheme as George C. Marshall, Soldier and Statesman George C. Marshall has been called the \"architect of victory\" in World War II, although he spent little time on the battlefield. A \"man's man,\" with an unexpectedly salty sense of humor, he disliked his position in the rear echelon. But as Army Chief of Staff from 1939 until November 1945, he organized the American effort. Well before Pearl Harbor, in December 1941, he had begun to raise, train, and equip a citizen army of ninety divisions. Marshall opposed the British plan to carry the invasion of Europe northward from Italy, fighting successfully for the direct cross-Channel assault on the Con- tinent. During the war he helped to plan strategy at all the important conferences — '^/Washington, Casablanca, Quebec, Teheran, Cairo, Malta, Yalta, and Potsdam. Z' / ^^^^' World War II, President Truman sent Marshall to China to attempt to arrange a truce in the civil war between the Nationalists, led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communists, led by Mao Tse-tung. He failed in this endeavor, as was probably inevitable. Once hostilities had been resumed, Marshall used his influence against all-out support of the Nationalists, on the ground that the United States had neither the will nor the power to make a large enough commitment in China to defeat the Communists. No one knows whether or not this was true, but Marshall inevitably received blame when the Communists took over all of China except Taiwan and a few small islands in 1949. In January 1947 Truman named Marshall Secretary of State. Europe was close to economic collapse, and it looked as though the Communists would pick up the pieces. On June 5, at the Harvard University commencement exercises, Marshall announced the plan for American aid to Europe which has become known as the Marshall Plan. It was enthusiastically approved in London, and the French ministry called a special meeting to discuss French participation. In the same year, basic planning began on what became the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Western world, which— through lack of imaginative leadership — had nearly de- faulted to communism, again moved forward.

By 1950, European industrial production had risen 64 per cent. It continued to rise thereafter at a rate faster than that of either the United States or the USSR. As the prosperity of Western Europe came to exceed all previous levels, the appeal of commimism diminished and its parties lost strength. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization To rebuild Western Europe's economy with- out increasing its military strength might sim- ply invite Russian aggression. In April 1949, nine European countries, plus Iceland, Canada, and the United States, formed a mihtary alli- ance called the North Atlantic Treaty Organi- zation ( NATO ) . By the NATO agreement, each country was bound to. consider an attack on one as an attack on all. The members of the alliance agreed to build up their military strength, the United States helping with money, arms, and troops. General Eisenhower became the first commander of NATO forces ( see map, Tension— Europe and the Middle East, p. 714). NATO was exactly the kind of \"permanent alliance\" that George Washington had long ago warned Americans to shun. When the Senate ratified the North Atlantic Treaty without reser- vations by a vote of 69 to 13, it was clear that the United States had abandoned its traditional policy of isolation from the power politics of Europe. COIVIIVIITIVIENTS IN ASIA In Asia the purposes of the United States at the close of W'orld \\\\'a.r II were simply to restore peace and to assist, where possible, the desire of native peoples to be free of foreign rule. But here, as in Europe, the Communists were on the march. They took over China, in- vaded South Korea, and threatened Southeast Asia. As Communist purposes were revealed, the United States turned to the pohcy already evolved for Europe: containment. The United States had a special responsi- bility in three areas: the Philippines, Japan, and China. In the first two countries, American policy was largely successful; in the last it suf- fered a severe setback. Communist aggression drew the United States into the military de- fense of South Korea, with results that might be called a standoff. The Philippine Republic On July 4, 1946, the Stars and Stripes were hauled down from pubhc buildings in the Philippines, as the United States fulfilled the promise of independence made in 1934. The new Philippine Republic was allowed tariff con- cessions in American markets imtil 1973 and was given over $600,000,000 to repair war damage and restore productive capacity. In return, the Filipinos granted commercial opportunities and military bases to the United States.

Occupation of Japan: 1945-1951 In July 1945, shortly before atom bombs fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, an inter-Allied conference at Potsdam, outside Berlin, drew up plans for postwar treatment of Japan. The essential provisions were: (1) mihtarists should be punished and Japan disarmed; (2) Japanese sovereignty should be restricted to the home islands; and (3) the people should be educated in democracy. Troops were to occupy Japan until these aims were accomplished. To carry out this Potsdam Declaration, General Douglas MacArthur was appointed supreme commander of the Allied powers (soon abbreviated to SCAP). Although two inter-Allied commissions were appointed to advise him, MacArthur in fact wielded dictatorial power. Under his able di- rection, Japan underwent a notable period of reform. Its armies were disbanded, and its war industries destroyed. A few militarists were tried for war crimes; many more were purged from government jobs. Political democracy was advanced by abolition of the secret police, by a new constitution, and by woman suffrage. The emperor remained as a symbol of national unity but was no longer treated as a god. Economic opportunity was promoted by attempts to break up the great trusts owned by a few families, by encouragement of trade unions, and above all by redivision of the land among the peas- ants. A reorganized educational system taught democratic ways instead of national myths and blind obedience. At first the intention had been to make Japan pay reparations, but the eco- nomic diflBculties of the island kingdom proved so great that instead the United States pro- vided nearly two billion dollars in aid. The Japanese showed courtesy, even friend- liness, toward their conquerors and willingly accepted most SCAP reforms. When MacArthur finished his reign at Tokyo, the Japanese were heading toward remarkable prosperity and re- covery of their sovereignty. In 1951 the country was granted independence in a treaty signed at San Francisco. The United States retained, however, military bases on the island of Okinawa. In some ways the Japanese conquered their conquerors. In America, as a result of close exposure to their culture, there developed a growing appreciation of the achievements of the Japanese in architecture, gardening, phi- losophy, and art. Communist Triumph in Ctiina Few peoples have ever undergone such suf- fering as did the Chinese in the twentieth cen- tury. For nearly forty years after the overthrow of the last emperor in 1911, the country was never free of civil war, foreign invasion, or both. By the end of World War II, the Chinese were profoundly war-weary, but new troubles were in store. Throughout the twentieth century the United States had favored an independent, uni- fied China. American missionaries and educa- tors had devoted their lives to the welfare of the Chinese people. It was the flat refusal of the United States to accept the Japanese con- quest of China that led to the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. And yet there had been a large measure of unreality in American policy. Until the Pearl Harbor attack, American statesmen had been willing to preach the Open Door pol- icy and the integrity of China, but had been unwilling to back it up with miUtary force. In planning for the peace, Roosevelt had insisted that China should be treated as a great"},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"China's hundreds of millions of people harnessed to a militant doctrine of communism and a developing industrialization capable of producing nuclear devices pose one of the major problems of foreign policy for the United States, Russia, India, and the countries of Southeast Asia. power— witness its permanent seat in the UN Security Covincil— in spite of the doubts of Sta- hn and Churchill. When hostilities came to an end in 1945, the United States assisted the Na- tionalist armies of Chiang Kai-shek to reoccupy their country, and American engineers helped rebuild Chinese railways. Ever since the early 1930's there had been a civil war in China between the Nationalist government and Communist rebels led by Mao Tse-tung. The struggle against Japan had pro- vided the Communists with a golden oppor- tunity. While Chiang's forces were driven far into the southwestern provinces, Mao extended the territory under his control from 35,000 square miles containing perhaps 1,500,000 peo- ple to 225,000 square miles containing 65,000,- 000 people. Mao's troops were well disciplined; he befriended the peasants; and his policies at this time were so moderate that many Ameri- can observers did not think him a true Com- munist but merely an \"agrarian reformer.\" Meanwhile the war had immensely weakened the Nationalists. The Japanese had controlled the cities, where the Nationalists had most of their popular support. In its long exile, the government led by Chiang Kai-shek had be- come inefficient and corrupt. Its one-party or- ganization, the Kuomintang (pronounced \"Gwomindong\" ) , was undemocratic and op- pressive. In 1946 General Marshall went to China to try to arrange a peace between the Nationalists and the Communists. He managed to effect a brief truce, but could find no permanent basis for compromise. The lull in the fighting assisted the Communists, and full-scale war broke out in 1947. As Mao's forces gained ground, some of Truman's advisers urged that he give mas- sive support to Chiang, including military \"ad- visers.\" But Marshall, now Secretary of State, thought that it was more important to defend Western Europe from Stalin than China from Mao. He opposed the use of American troops to save Chiang's tottering regime. The Nation- alists did receive economic aid and arms from the United States, but that was not enough to avert collapse. The Communist armies swept all before them, and by 1950 Chiang's forces held only Formosa and a few offshore islands."},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":",' ^ Once in power, the Chinese Communists proved themselves even more ruthless than the Russian Bolsheviks. They slaughtered or si- lenced all opponents and attempted to weaken the intense family loyalty that had been the basis of Chinese civilization. They preached undying hatred for the United States. In failing to prevent Communist victory in China, the United States suffered \"the major reverse in all the history of its dealings with foreign nations.\" The China policy of the Tru- man administration naturally came under vio- lent attack. Its critics maintained that a more accurate estimate of Communist purposes and strength, plus all-out aid to the Nationalists, would have saved the situation. Others argued that the time to have saved China was in the I930's, when Japan first attacked. Still others maintained that the United States was never in a position to \"save\" China on the grounds that public opinion would not have supported risk of war with Japan in the 1930's, nor large- scale military intervention in the late 1940's. It is diflBcult to judge between these positions, since the Chinese situation was fantastically The Korean War brought great suffering to the inhab- itants. At its close, the fighting resembled that in France in World War I, as is suggested by this sketch of infantrymen coming back from the front as Amer- ican artillery lays down a barrage. complex, and the whole affair became a bitter political issue. Divided Korea Promised \"freedom and independence\" at the Cairo Conference in 1943, Korea suffered a tragic fate after liberation from thirty-five years of Japanese rule. At the close of World War II, Russian troops occupied the country north of the 38th parallel of latitude. Aided by native Communists, they lost no time in setting up a \"people's republic.\" Like other satellite states, it was cut off from the outside world. In 1947 a UN commission was not allowed to set foot north of the 38th parallel. Meanwhile, in the south the United States fostered a Republic of Korea under Syngman Rhee, who had spent much of his life in exile in this country. In 1948 the UN recognized the republic in the south as the lawful government of the peninsula. In 1949 the United States withdrew its troops.

The Communists therefore decided to tr>- for a cheap victory. Korean War, 1950-1953 On June 25, 1950, Russian-trained North Korean armies invaded South Korea without warning. This action provided a vital test for the UN. If it backed do\\%Ti in the face of this improvoked aggression, it would be powerless in the future. On the very afternoon of the attack, the Security Council met, found North Korea guilty of a \"breach of the peace,\" and called on UN members to .aid South Korea. Fortunately, Russia was boycotting the Security Council at the time and so was unable to use its veto. Two days later— without waiting for formal action by Congress— President Truman ordered American military forces into action. Several other UN countries also sent military, naval, and medical units to aid South Korea. The United States Seventh Fleet was sent to protect Formosa from possible invasion by Communist China. After early Communist successes, General MacArthur, in command of the UN forces, made a brilliant surprise landing at Inchon, be- hind the Communist lines. He then swept northward toward the Yalu River, boundary between Korea and Manchuria. But in Novem- ber the tide turned again, as Chinese \"volun- teers\" poured across the Yalu and drove the UN forces back almost to the 38th parallel. The UN policy in Korea was to fight a lim- ited war. Thus UN planes were forbidden to bomb Chinese bases in Manchuria. General MacArthur resented such limitations. In April 1951, Joseph W. Martin, Republican leader in the House of Representatives, published a let- ter from the general, criticizing the failure to use Chinese Nationalist troops in Korea. Faced with this deliberate challenge to the supremacy of civil over military power. President Truman removed MacArthur from command. The \"Great Debate,\" 1951 When MacArthur came home to receive a hero's welcome, the country was bitterly di- vided between him and the President. The re- sult was a great debate on foreign and military policy. The general's desire to extend the war into China was countered by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. According to General Omar Bradley, a full-scale attack on Red China would have involved the United States \"in the wrong war at the wrong time in the wrong place with the wrong enemy.\" MacArthur demanded that the United States act independently of the UN if that body sought QUESTION • The policy *« l™it U.S. use MacArthur urged would of military power. have created full-scale war \"There is no sub- with Communist China, stitute,\" he de- What would have been clared, \"for vic- the outcome? tory.\" He further argued that de- fense of Asia was more \\'ital than that of Eu- rope. Administration supporters insisted that to weaken the UN was to weaken the United States, and that Western Europe, the second- greatest industrial region of the world, must be defended at all cost. The great debate failed to alter American policy, except that there was a stiffening in attitude toward Red China. American naval forces now protected Formosa. The United States flatly opposed admitting Communist China to the UN, because, said Secretary of State Dean Acheson, \"we cannot allow gov- ernments that want to get into the United Nations to shoot their way in.\" The Korean War settled dowTi to a pro- longed stalemate. An Indian peace proposal, presented in 1952, was acceptable to the free nations, but not to the Communists.

As Judge Harold Medina told the jury which convicted the twelve Communists, denial of the right to criticize does not strengthen the country, but weakens it by allowing abuses to go unchecked. In a unanimous decision, in 1952, declaring a state loyalty oath unconstitutional, the Suprerne Court pointed out that laws directed against Communists may make it dangerous for others \"to think, speak, or write critically.\" The China disaster and the Korean stale- mate helped to produce a mood in the United States not unlike the \"red scare\" that followed World War I. The public looked for scape- goats, and opponents of the Truman adminis- tration were ready to find them. The President had \"lost\" China and Korea because, his critics said, his advisers were Communists or Commu- nist dupes. The State Department, charged Robert A. Taft, leader of the Republicans in the Senate, was riddled by subversives who had \"surrendered to every demand of Russia . . . and promoted at every opportunity the Communist cause in China.\" Far more reckless in his charges was Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin, who declared that the Demo- cratic Party was guilty of \"twenty years of treason\" in the course of which Roosevelt had delibe'ately sacrificed the fleet at Pearl Harbor to get the United States into war, and had sold out to Russia at Yalta. McCarthy claimed to have lists of 205, or 57, or 81 \"card-carrying Communists\" in the State Department. While not one of these was ever discovered and a Senate committee declared the charges were \"a fraud and a hoax,\" in the atmosphere of the time McCarthy enjoyed an ever-increasing influence. The new witch-hunting went far beyond the federal government. Private vigilante groups sought to pin the Communist label on liberal and reformist people in every walk of life. They were successful in dri\\'ing allegedly \"pink\" professors from universities, in getting supposedly subversive textbooks banned from schools, and in blackballing certain broadcasters and entertainers from television, as well as ac- tors from the stage and films. ESTIMATE OF THE TRUMAN ADMINISTRATION President Truman's stock has risen since he left the W'hite House. It is evidence of his o\\er- all achievement that most of the Fair Deal measures he recommended have since been enacted into law, and the essential foreign poli- cies of the United States have been those initi- ated during his administration. In the foreign sphere especially, the wonder is not that there were failures, but that on balance they were so few. Given the complexity and novelty of the problems that the President and his ad\\isers faced, a public wearv' of foreign adventures, a Congress often suspicious or hostile, the fact that Truman led the country from isolationism to responsibility was an immense achievement. But Truman did not do it alone. Ultimately he could act only with public support. He suc- ceeded as far as he did because the people of the United States had reached a fundamental decision: that their responsibilities and com- mitments must match their wealth and power. In 1952 a group of scholars from Oxford Uni- versity in England paid America this tribute: The faults and shortcomings of America— which, unlike those of the Soviet Union, are wide open to the world and freely discussed by the Americans themselves— have led too many people ... to ignore the plain fact that the U.S.A. has been the best \"top nation\" since Rome. It establi.shes order, re- sists the aggressor, defends the attacked, strength- ens the weak, and succors the poor. The U.S.A. is the first world power to give money away, to tax itself for the foreigner in peacetime.

At one time such security was provided by the existence of free land and a great mass of untouched and valuable natural resources throughout our country. These are no longer to be had for the asking; we have had experience of millions of people — devoted, fine Americans, who have walked the streets unable to find work or any kind of sustenance for themselves and their families. On the other hand, for us to push further and further into the socialistic experiment is to deny the validity of all those convictions we have held as to the cumulative power of free citizens, exercising their own initiative, inventiveness and desires to provide better living for themselves and their children. DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER When approached to run for the presidency in 1948, General Eisenhower had flatly refused. \"The necessary and wise subordination of the military to civil power,\" he tlien wrote, \"will be best sustained when life-long professional soldiers abstain from seeking high political of- fice.\" In 1952, however, he reluctantl)' gave in to members of the liberal, internationalist wing of the Republican party, who were anxious to head off the candidacy of the midwestem con- servati%e Senator Robert A. Taft. An intense struggle for delegates to the national conven- tion resulted in a narrow victory for Eisen- hower. The Democrats nominated Adlai E. Stevenson, who had stood aloof from pre-con- vention campaigning, but whose record as a vigorous and popular governor of Illinois made him an attracti\\ e candidate. The ensuing presidential campaign was ex- citing, as the rivals— now using airplanes in- stead of railroad trains— traveled more widely than ever before. The Illinois governor proved an effecti\\'e speaker, somewhat reminiscent of Woodrow Wilson in his scholarly eloquence. He labored, however, imder the burden of hav- ing to defend the Truman administration that no longer enjoyed the confidence of the coun- try. The Republicans effectively insisted that it was \"time for a change.\" Their campaign was based on the themes \"Corruption, Com- munism, Korea.\" They promised to clean up \"the mess in \\\\'ashington,\" to ferret Commu- nists or their dupes out of high places in Wash- ington, and to bring the frustrating stalemate in Korea to an end. Eisenhower announced that if elected he would go to Korea at once. 718"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"More important than issues, real or imagined, was the fact that the Repubhcans had nomi- nated the most popular man in the country. Their most effective slogan was simply, \"I like Ike.\" The number of ballots cast for the two can- didates increased by one-fifth over the previous highest total, registered in the Roosevelt- Willlde election of 1940. The result was an Eisenhower landslide. The general carried the electoral college, 442 to 89, and won support even in the traditional Democratic stronghold, the \"Solid South.\" The result was more a per- sonal victory for \"Ike,\" however, than a triumph for the Republican party. The Republicans had a majority of only seven votes in the House of Representatives and controlled the Senate only through the casting vote of the Vice-President. For the first time in twenty years, the coun- try faced the task of transferring the reins of government from one party to another. The problem was effectively handled. Eisenhower went to Korea in a plane furnished by President Truman. The President-elect's major appoint- ments were promptly announced, and Demo- cratic oflBcials immediately called the new ap- pointees into consultation. Thus there was no such dangerous period of drift as occurred in 1860-1861 and in 1932-1933 (see pp. 343 and 609). EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION: DOMESTIC AFFAIRS Once in the White House, Eisenhower re- vealed that his long career as an army officer did not mean that he expected simply to give orders. On the contrary, he professed the \"Whig theory\" that the President should hmit his sphere of action and authority. He should not attempt to dominate or dictate to Congress, but instead should share leadership with the legislative body. His two predecessors, Roose- Diplomacy Abroad: In a series of trips to countries throughout the world, President Eisenhower did much to gather good will for the United States.

Within the executive department itself, Ei- senhower attempted to decentralize decision- making and make his top officials a \"team.\" The cabinet assumed new importance and became a genuine consultative body. For the first time in history, it had a regular agenda, regularly kept minutes, and a full-time secretary. Eisen- hower made his assistant Sherman Adams a \"chief of staff' and gave him power to decide what matters were of sufficient importance to be referred to the direct attention of the Presi- dent. The advantages of Eisenhower's orderly ar- rangements for sharing and delegating author- ity were seen when he was stricken three times with illness: in all cases the White House staff carried on without serious difficulty.

At some cru- cial times the President even seemed to be in the dark about important decisions for which he had nevertheless to assume responsibility. Eisenhower retained throughout his eight years in office the trust and aflFection of the American people. Whatever his shortcomings, they liked his simplicity, sincerity, modesty, and genuine desire to do right. Down \"the Middle of the Road\" As the quotation at the head of this chapter suggests, Eisenhower explicitly declared that he was tra\\'eling down \"the middle of the road.\" He meant to steer a course between the path charted by those who would return to unrestrained laissez-faire on the one hand and on the other those who would greatly extend the welfare activities of the federal government. Eisenhower's cabinet and the circle of friends with whom he played bridge and golf contained a high proportion of businessmen, and in several ways he reflected the outlook of the business community. During his first weeks in office he ordered the end of wage and price controls that had been imposed dur- ing the Korean War. \"Now,\" said the President, \"as well as in the long run, free competitive prices will best serve the interests of all the people.\" In May 1953, Congress, backed by Eisenhower, passed a bill granting to coastal states control of offshore mineral and oil de- posits. This reversed a Supreme Court deci- sion that these were under federal control. La- ter the same year the Reconstruction Finance Corporation closed its operations. The military services also abandoned numerous enterprises, including \"railroad and ship operation, scraip metal baling, hotel operation, furniture repair, baking, sawmilling . . . life insurance, motion pictures, and the manufacture of clothing, paint, and ice cream.\" In a return to more conservative financing, Eisenhower's first order of business was an at- tempt to balance the federal budget. Govern- ment services were reduced and defense spend- ing cut back. Taxes were kept high, although lower taxes had been a 1952 campaign promise. Eisenhower insisted that a balanced budget would make America stronger. It would halt the continuous inflation that consumed people's savings and undermined confidence in the dol- lar. By 1956, the federal budget showed its first surplus in eight years. For a time, too, the cost of living remained stable. Eisenhower once condemned the TVA as \"creeping socialism.\" His administration at- tempted, unsuccessfully, to arrange that private industn' should provide new power plants in the TVA region. The President's belief was similar to that of Herbert Hoover (see pp. 591"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"The Middle Way 721 and Appendix, pp. 808-810): that the federal government should produce power only if an- other purpose— such as irrigation or flood con- trol—was clearly involved. Some federal power projects were shelved, and private enterprise was encouraged to move in. For instance, in 1954 the Idaho Power Company was granted the right to build dams in Hell's Canyon on the Snake River, thereby heading off a half-billion- dollar public project. Concern for \"the Little Fellow\" In spite of these and other evidences of a svsdng toward conservatism, the new Republi- can administration followed a line in domestic policy much closer to Franklin Roosevelt than to Calvin Coohdge. Repeatedly Eisenhower im- pressed on his cabinet that an administration friendly to business must also show concern for \"the little fellow.\" At his urging Congress extended the Social Security Act to 10,000,000 more people and increased its benefits. He ad- vocated slum clearance and a greatly expanded road-building program, with the federal gov- ernment pacing 90 per cent of the cost. Without success, he urged Congress to enact a program of health insurance to be partially un- derwritten by the federal government. An achievement of his administration in which Eisenhower took genuine pride was the St. Lawrence Seaway. Presidents Hoover, Roosevelt, and Truman had failed to persuade Congress to join with Canada in this great project. Now Canada threatened to build it alone. Eisenhower insisted that it was neces- sary for defense, for the economic well-being of the United States, and for friendly relations with the great country that bordered our north- em frontier. Congress passed the necessary leg- islation in 1954. In 1959 The President and Queen Elizabeth of England formally opened the Seaway. This great engineering feat opened the Great Lakes to ocean-going shipping, cre- ating a second Mediterranean Sea. Continuing Prosperity During Eisenhower's first term, American prosperity, already high, reached new peaks. The steel industry, a standard barometer of business activity, was operating at full capacity much of the time and was behind in its orders. There was only one halt in good times. In 1953-1954, starting shortly after the close of the Korean War, there were signs of a coming de- pression. At almost every cabinet meeting in the spring of 1954 the President talked about how to prevent \"another 1929.\" Labor leaders demanded a big public works program, and Walter Reuther, president of the automobile workers union, charged the administration with \"creeping McKinleyism\" for not embarking on one at once. But the administration held off, except for speeding up government purchases already authorized by Congress and easing credit through the Federal Reser\\'e banks. Ei- senhower preferred to wait and see whether the country could not again make the shift to a peacetime economy without further assist- ance. The event justified his hope: by mid-1954 prosperity had returned. A more serious recession occurred in 1957 and continued for two years. At its depth in 1958 more than five million workers were un- employed. But again, as in 1949-1950 and 1953-1954, there were no stock market panics, no bank failures, and remarkably little slacken- ing off of domestic and industrial production. The \"built-in stabilizers\" mentioned in the last chapter, such as old-age pensions, helped to pre- vent the appalling downward spiral of the HooN'er period. Again the Eisenhower adminis- tration resisted demands for large-scale relief spending, and again the patient recovered. By 1960 business activity reached new heights."},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"During the 1950's wage workers often gained afflu- ence, while farmers were plagued with chronic prob- lems. Above, the multi-mil- lion dollar resort of the International Ladies' Gar- ment Workers Union. Below, farm surpluses in the mid- western wheat belt must be stored in the streets. Farm Problems and Policies Most farmers did not share in \"Eisenhower prosperity.\" Between 1948 and 1956 the farm- ers' share of the national income dropped from about 9 per cent to 4 per cent. It was esti- mated that in Eisenhower's first tenn alone half a million fanners gave up and left the soil. Men with large capital could buy the latest farm machinery, use the latest scientific meth- ods, buy or lease the best lands, and reduce their costs so much that they could make a profit even in a falling market. Federal loans and subsidies, furthermore, helped the large one- crop fanners more than the small farmers who raised several crops. Thus both natural and artificial causes were working against the tra- ditional one-family farm. By 1959 half the farmland in the country belonged to the 1 farmer in 25 who owned 1,000 acres or more. Ezra Taft Benson, Eisenhower's Secretary of Agricultiu-e, strongly beheved that fanners should rely more on themselves. He proposed \"flexible\" price supports for major products. These would allow for gradual reduction of the price of a crop in which there was already a surplus. Such reduction, argued Benson, would persuade farmers to shift to crops in more demand. Democratic leaders in Congress were joined by Republicans from agricultural states in denotmcing the Benson poUcies, which would, they charged, \"eliminate farmers instead of surpluses.\" They favored \"rigid\" price sup- ports that practically guaranteed the producer against serious loss, but did little to reduce"},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"The Middle Way 723 vast, unsaleable surpluses. Eisenhower stood squarely behind Benson. He was willing, how- ever, to accept a \"soil bank\" program, rather like a second AAA. It provided that farmers would be paid for taking land out of cultiva- tion, but at the same time improving the soil in case there were a need for more crops in the future. As a conservation measure the new ar- rangement was a success, but it did little to reduce the cost of agricultural subsidies or to halt the relative decline in farm income. Labor Advances In contrast to the plight of the farmers, the Eisenhower years saw laboring men make steady gains in wages and other benefits. These came for the most part without governmental action. Indeed, the President believed that fed- eral inter\\'ention in labor matters was unwise unless a strike threatened to paralyze the econ- omy. The advance of labor came instead from new attitudes on the part of both management and labor. \"Scientific management\" was once a term that referred only to increasing the mechanical efficiency of workmen: eliminating waste mo- tion, putting in better machinery, improving lighting and safety devices. Now a new phi- losophy of management stressed the idea that workers are human beings first and machine tenders second. With considerate treatment a man is less likely to be discontented, more likely to do good work. Furthermore, business was becoming more and more a profession with professional standards of conduct, and a dispo- sition to look beyond immediate self-interest. Senator Wallace Bennett of Utah, a former manufacturer, told a business convention: We must have a sense of social responsibility to see that our economic machine is operated for the benefit not only of our stockholders, but also of our customers and employees and the whole people. On the other side of the bargaining table, labor unions and their leaders were less mili- tant than they had been during the great or- ganizing drives of the New Deal period. Now generally accepted as part of the natural order of things, unions no longer had to fight for their very right to exist. Labor peace was also advanced when the American Federation of Labor and the CIO settled their twenty-year- old feud and formed, in 1955, a vast new \"union of unions,\" the AFL-CIO. The merger greatly reduced the nuisance of jurisdictional disputes which occurred when two unions were strug- gling to organize workers in a particular plant or industry. Strikes continued, to be sure, but on no such scale as in the years immediately after World War II. Most disputes were settled by direct bargaining, and companies increased wages along with rising productivity. \"Welfare capitalism\" in the form of pension plans, vaca- tions vvith pay, and medical care became the rule rather than the exception. Unions themselves often furnished their members with ser%'ices that went beyond their usual functions. The International Ladies' Gar- ment Workers' Union, for instance, provided its members with health insurance, cooperative housing, and summer vacation camps in the Pocono Mountains. Between 1946 and 1954 the United Mine Workers distributed $641,000,000 in benefits among its members. Labor Difficulties Despite advances, labor unions faced diffi- cult problems. One of the most serious was corruption among labor union officials. The Sen- ate Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management, headed by Senator John L. McClellan of Arkansas, discovered in 1957 that Dave Beck, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, had been using un- ion funds as his own. The McClellan Commit-"},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"724 The Cold War tee made other discoveries even more alarming. Investigation of the teamsters' union revealed that many of its officers had criminal records and that the union increased its natural bar- gaining power by violence or the threat of it. Some racketeering union leaders received pay- offs from employers for making \"sweetheart contracts,\" in which they were permitted to hire workers for less than union rates. Workers who protested were in danger of violence. The dishonesty of the officials of a few imions was not typical of labor unions as a whole. The AFL-CIO had made a determined effort to enforce a Code of Ethical Practices among all its members. Unable to persuade the teamsters' union to clean house, the AFL- CIO expelled it from its ranks in 1957. Even friends of labor unions agreed that major federal legislation was needed to pro- tect both workers and the general public from irresponsible or corrupt union officials. In Sep- tember 1959, Congress enacted a measure de- signed to curb racketeering and other abuses spotlighted in some unions by the congressional investigations. Union leaders criticized the bill as weakening their bargaining position, but the decisive majorities by which the bill was passed by Congress indicated that public opinion fa- vored the measure. The number of workers organized in labor unions had increased from less than 4,000,000 on the eve of the New Deal to over 18,000,000 in the mid-1950's, but then started to decline. This was partly the result of resistance to union- ization expressed in state \"right-to-work\" laws that prohibited the union shop. More impor- tant, it appears to have been the result of the fact that the generally higher wage scale made unions seem less useful. Furthermore, propor- tionately fewer workers were engaged in in- dustry and more in service occupations and white collar jobs, where unions had never gained much foothold. Threats to Presidential Power Two major attempts to reduce the Presi- dent's power were made during Eisenhower's first term— one through a proposed constitu- tional amendment, another through a reckless attack on him and his advisers. The Bricker amendment, named after Sen- ator John W. Bricker of Ohio, was designed to reduce the President's treaty-making powers. One provision forbade the President to make executix'e agreements, such as those at Yalta, without the consent of Congress. A second stated that no treaty should have the force of law until Congress, and in some cases even all state legislatures, had formally voted to accept its provisions. The proposed amendment had strong support in the Senate and in the countrv at large. Although he was usually unwilling to meet Congress head-on, Eisenhower became con- vinced that the measure would be a disaster. In a strong letter to the Republican majori- ty leaders in the QUESTION .

Adoption of the Bricker amendment would be notice to our friends as well as our enemies abroad that this countrv' intends to withdraw from leadership in foreign affairs.\" Eventually the amendment failed, by a single-vote margin, to gain support from the Senate. It had been predicted that the election of a Republican President would put an end to Senator McCarthy's wild charges that the fed- eral government was honeycombed with Com- munists. But McCarthy continued his \"crusade.\" In 1953-1954 he subjected the Eisenhower administration to a series of humiliating \"inves-"},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"The Middle Way 725 tigations.\" Two of his aides toured American libraries overseas and directed that books they considered subversive should be withdrawn. He accused the Secretar}' of the Army of \"cod- dling Communists.\" He arranged a private \"treaty\" whereby certain Greek shipowners agreed not to trade with Red China. For a time McCarthy was successful in giN'ing the impression that he was saving the RepubUc from sub\\ersion. A public opinion poll early in 1954 reported that 50 per cent of those ques- tioned were favorable toward him and another 21 per cent had no opinion. Opposition to him in the Senate had subsided after he used his influence to dri\\'e out of ofBce four or five senators who had spoken against him. President Eisenhower privately detested McCarthy and thought his methods were \"un- American,\" but he refused to come to the pub- lic defense of himself or of his subordinates. He did not wish to demean himself or his oflBce, he said, and he felt that ultimately the senator would destroy himself. In 1954 the tide turned. In a series of televised hearings of his subcommittee, the public had an opportunity to see McCarthy's disregard of law and de- cency. After the hearings were over, a resolu- tion was introduced into the Senate to con- demn him for his conduct. In December 1954, it was passed by a vote of 67 to 22. From this time on the senator's influence rapidly declined and with it the much larger, not easily definable witch-hunting movement known under the heading of \"McCarthyism.\" Eisenhower's Illness: the Vice-Presidency As the election of 1956 approached. Repub- lican chances rested on Eisenhower's willing- ness to run. In September 19.55 the President suffered a heart attack. The shock to business confidence was so great that the stock market dropped more sharply than at any time since 1929. The President recovered rapidly, how- ever. Given \"a parole if not a pardon\" by his doctors, he announced in February 1956, that he would run again if nominated. Another ill- ness, followed by an operation in June, did not change this decision. The President's illness focused attention on the \\ice-presidency. The Constitution does not make proper arrangements for this office. In the first place, it does not give the Vice-President enough to do (see p. 115), as Benjamin Frank- lin observed when he dubbed him \"His Super- fluous E.xcellency.\" Secondly, the Constitution does not say who shall decide when the Vice- President should take over in case the President is unable to perform his duties. Congress had never passed legislation to remedy the situation. Truman had helped to clear up the first diflB- culty by giving the Vice-President more respon- sibility. Eisenhower went so far in this direc- tion that a popular magazine wrote of Vice- President Richard M. Nixon: NLxon is Eisenhower's stand-in, alter ego, and right-hand man. He not only makes speeches for the President, he presides at meetings in his absence, does major liaison work with Congress, and gener- ally helps shape Republican Party policy the way Ike wants it. Although workable arrangements were made for carrying on business during the three times Eisenhower was stricken with ill health, he urged that Congress enact legislation or initiate a constitutional amendment that would make formal arrangements for transfer of power when the President is unfit to carry on his duties. Congress did not act, partly because there was wide disagreement as to a proper solution to the problem.

In spite of his personal popularity, the Democrats won control of Congress. major issues between parties or candidates. The Republicans claimed that the administration had brought peace and prosperity. (\"Every- thing is booming but the guns\"). Capitalizing on fears about the President's health, the Democrats concentrated their fire on Nixon, again vice-presidential candidate. Declining farm prices made them confident of support in agricultural areas. Their hopes soared when Democratic candidates showed surprising strength in the Maine elections, held in Sep- tember. When radio and TV brought the election returns into millions of homes on the night of November 6, they revealed an extraordinary result. Eisenhower was re-elected by a land- slide vote, carrying 41 states to Stevenson's 7. But the President's popularity did not rub off on his party. Republican congressional candi- dates ran so far behind him that the Democrats controlled both the Senate and the House of Representatives. As he began a second term, Eisenhower was more independent of party than any Presi- dent in modem times. He had followers in his own party, the so-called \"modem Republicans,\" but many of the \"Old Guard \" regarded him as dangerously tainted with New Deal philosophy and with internationalism. The President found allies, however, among Democrats. The two chief Democratic leaders in Congress— Speaker Sam Raybum and Senate Majority Leader Lyn- don Johnson, both Texans— were as much be- lievers in \"the middle way\" as the President himself. Thus there was formed a rather shaky alliance of \"modem Republicans\" and moder- ate Democrats, opposed by Old Guard Repub- licans and conservative southern Democrats. The most striking achievement of the liberal coalition was the passage of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, designed to guarantee Negroes the right to vote. Other important legislation of Eisenhower's second term included the admission of Alaska to the Union in 1958 and of Hawaii in 1959, both partly as a result of presidential prod- ding. The Congress follo\\\\ed the advice of the President and Secretary of Agriculture Benson in some lowering of agricultural subsidies; also persuasive were mountains of surplus com, wheat, cotton, and butter. As the country approached the 1958 con- gressional elections, the Republicans were hurt by the decline in prosperity and by the blow to national prestige that occurred when the Russians sent up \"Sputnik,\" the first man-made satellite. Another blow was the revelation that a few oflBcials had used their positions to pro- mote private ends. Most prominent of these was Sherman Adams, the President's executive assistant, who resigned under fire. Even though Adams was guilty of no more than impropri- ety, his case was embarrassing to an adminis- tration that had come into office pledged to \"clean up the mess in Washington.\" As it tumed out, the Democrats scored their biggest mid-term triumph since 1934.

A clear result of the elections was the strengthening of the liberal wing of the Democratic party, since all the seats taken from the Republicans were outside the conservative South. THE DULLES-EISENHOWER FOREIGN POLICIES President Eisenhower delegated much of the conduct of foreign affairs to his able Sec- retary of State, John Foster Dulles. The grand- son of one Secretar>' of State and nephew of another, Dulles had long experience in high- level diplomacy. He had been a delegate to the Versailles Conference of 1919, the San Francisco Conference of 1945, and half a dozen sessions of the United Nations. He had negotiated the peace treaty with Japan in 1950-1951. Both before and after coming into office Secretary Dulles preached a vigorous foreign policy. During the 1952 presidential campaign he denounced mere \"containment\" of commu- nism and advocated \"liberation\" of the subject peoples behind the Iron Curtain. He threatened that renewal of Communist aggression would meet \"massive retaliation.\" A magazine inter- view reported that Dulles declared that the art of diplomacy in the Cold War included willingness to go to the very brink of war if necessarv'— hence the nickname \"brinkmanship\" to characterize his methods. The Defense Department adapted its mili- tary strategy to the concept of massive retalia- tion. It cut do'wn on conventional ground forces, such as had been used in Korea, and concentrated instead on developing nuclear weapons and airplanes to deliver them to their targets. This was said to promise \"more bang for a buck.\" In actual practice, the foreign policy of the Eisenhower administration was far more cau- tious than Secretary Dulles' slogans would sug- gest. To President Eisenhower nuclear war was unthinkable, since it might mean the destruc- tion of western civilization. He and Dulles therefore continued the policy of containment of Russian and Chinese aggression, but made no effort to dislodge Communist governments already established. Peace in Korea; War in Southeast Asia In July 1953, a settlement ended the Korean War. Unhappy Korea was still divided along a line held by the opposing armies when hos- tilities ceased. The struggle had been frustrat- ing and costly for the United States, but it accomplished its primary aim of repelling Com- munist aggression. Hardly was the fighting ended in Korea than the United States was faced with the problem of dealing with Communist expansion elsewhere in the Far East. When the Japanese surrendered Indochina in 1945, the French attempted to resume their prewar position as rulers. But the Japanese victories early in World War II had destroyed the myth of European invincibility and whetted the appetites of Asians for self-rule. In Indochina there were three different nationalities, each wishing a state of its own: the Cambodians, the Laotians, and the \\'ietnamese (see map, p. 715). To complicate matters further, the strongest leader of the Vietnamese independence movement, Ho Chi Minh, was a dedicated Communist, trained in Russia and China. Ho was head of a movement called the Vietminh, which in 1946 began a war to drive France from Indochina. The United States was not engaged, but it paid for more than a third of the war materials used by the French forces. When the key for- tress of Dienbienphu was besieged in 1954 by the Communists, and a military disaster threat- ened, the question arose: Should the United States enter the war?

As President Ei- senhower explained at a press conference: You have a row of dominoes set up, and you knock over the first one, and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go very very quickly. To save the first domino, the French suggested that American planes bomb Communist positions and Dulles favored such action. But Eisen- hower refused to get into a \"hot war\" in Indo- china without support from other nations or from Congress. In May 1954, Dienbienphu fell, and the Vietminh took over northern Vietnam. By the truce arranged at Geneva, Switzerland, in July, southern Vietnam remained under French control. France soon pulled out of Vietnam, but that did not leave the South open to the Vietminh. The United States moved into the vacuum and supported a rather shaky regime headed by an anti-Communist Vietnamese, Ngo Dinh Diem. American economic support enabled Diem to survive and to embark on some land reforms to aid the peasants. Increasingly, too, American \"advisers\" and \"instructors\" trained Diem's army. After the Dienbienphu disaster Secretary Dulles attempted to put Indochina under in- ternational protection. At a conference in Ma- nila in September 1954, the United States joined Great Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Tliailand, and the Philippines in set- ting up a Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) to resist Communist aggression. Su- perficially similar to NATO, this alliance was in fact much weaker. Indonesia, Malaya, Burma, and India refused to join because they did not want to line up with the West against the Communists. The countries most in danger —Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam— were not members. The governments of these countries did not attract strong popular support and there was a constant threat of rebellion or in- filtration by Communist guerillas, who often terrified villages into submission. The exposed and unwieldy state of Laos was especially vul- nerable. By the end of Eisenhower's adminis- tration local Communists aided by the Viet- minh and Communist China had taken over most of that country. Formosa and China: Uneasy Stalemate During the Korean War President Truman had ordered the United States Seventh Fleet to patrol the waters between Formosa (Tai- wan ) , held by Chiang Kai-shek, and mainland China, held by the Communists. The Eisen- hower administration continued the policy. It also refused to recognize the government of Mao Tse-tung and opposed its entrance into the UN."},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"The Middle Way 729 In addition to Formosa, Chiang Kai-shek still retained a few small islands near the main- land. Early in 1955 the Communists took the northernmost of these, the Tachens, and threat- ened two more, Quemoy and Matsu (see map, p. 715). Eisenhower thereupon asked Congress for a resolution authorizing him to use Ameri- can forces to defend Formosa. It passed both houses by overwhelming votes, but did not make clear whether it applied also to Quemoy and Matsu. It may ha\\'e served, however, to make the Communists cautious. In any event, they decided against all-out attack and tension was eased. In August 1958, heavy bombardments of the offshore islands again threatened a Communist attempt to seize them. But Eisenhower warned Red China that the United States would help to defend them, and American naval vessels convoyed suppUes to the islands. At the same time the United States made clear that it was not sympathetic to an attempt by Chiang to attack the mainland. The Communists again ceased fire. Thus, as Eisenhower left office, the China problem remained exactly where it was when he came in. There was neither war nor peace. Bandung Conference: Neutralism In May 1955, world attention was focused on a conference at Bandung, Indonesia, at- tended by representatives from 29 Asian and African states. The tsvo thousand delegates rep- resented countries having more than half the people on earth. Most of these had recently won freedom from Western rule, and resent- ment of their former white masters continued. In such an atmosphere there was danger that Chou En-lai, Red China's able foreign minister, might gain a diplomatic victory by harping on the familiar claim that Communists were the enemies of \"colonialism.\" To the relief of the West, many African and Asian states- men proved as fearful of future Communist ag- gression as they were of former Western im- perialism. The Bandung Conference therefore proved indecisive in the Cold War. Bandung focused attention on a point of view kno\\Mi as neutralism, which was especi- ally connected with Prime Minister Nehru, of India. Nehru insisted that India was an \"un- committed nation\" and that it was degrading for African or Asian nations to become \"camp followers\" of either side in the Cold War. At various times he denounced Russia for suppres- sion of Hungarian freedom and invasion of Korea, Red China for invasion of Tibet, the United States for military aid to India's uneasy neighbor Pakistan, and Britain and France for warring on Egypt. Neutralism was hotly debated in the United States. Some Americans, Secretary Dulles among them, took the view that no man or nation has a right to be neutral in a struggle between tyranny and freedom. Others com- pared neutralism to the early isolationist policy of the United States— necessary for a new. com- paratively weak nation. The Middle East — a Powder Keg For a number of reasons, the United States was drawn into the problems of the Middle East, an ill-defined area extending from the Mediterranean to the boundaries of India. Dur- ing World War II, American lend-lease sup- plies reached the Soviet Union from the Persian Gulf through Iran. American capital had pre\\i- ously entered the Middle East to develop its fabulously rich oil deposits. Many Americans were intensely interested in the state of Israel, set up in 1948 in the original Jewish homeland of Palestine.

Finally, there was always the threat of a Russian thrust south- ward toward the oil fields and warm water ports. By 1955 it was clear that the Russians were contemplating a move into the Middle East. Powerful radios in the southern USSR broad- cast anti-Western propaganda to the Arab world. In the UN, the Soviet Union blocked action to promote peace between Israel and her neighbors and joined the Arabs in denounc- ing French rule in Algeria. The Western an- swer to this ^^•as to organize the \"northern tier\" of Middle Eastern countries— Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan— into a Middle Eastern Treaty Organization (METO), to be modeled on NATO (see map, p. 714). Great Britain joined in signing this so-called Baghdad Pact. The United States lent support, but did not join. Russia's answer to the Baghdad Pact was to 'leapfrog\" METO and make close connec- tions with the more southerly Arab states. In 1955 the USSR arranged a \"commercial treaty\" with Gamal Abdel Nasser, the ruler of Egypt; according to its terms, Egyptian cotton was exchanged for tanks and guns. These weapons suggested an early renewal of war against Israel. Suez Crisis, 1956 Meanwhile Secretary Dulles had been at- tempting to woo Nasser. In 1954 he had helped to persuade the British to write a treaty with Egypt whereby Britain withdrew its forces guarding the Suez Canal. Even after the arms deal with Russia, Dulles tried to win over Nas- ser by promising .American funds to start con- struction of a great irrigation dam at Aswan on the Nile. But when Nasser bartered Egyptian cotton for military supplies not only with the USSR but with Red China, Dulles suddenly changed his tack. Without warning he publicly canceled the Aswan loan. Nasser replied to this humiliation by seizing the Suez Canal from its French and British owners in July 1936. For three months thereafter, Dulles and other western diplomats vainly attempted to persuade Nasser to agree to international control of the vital waterway, but the Egyptian leader re- fused to budge. Dulles' inept diplomacy infuriated the Brit- ish, the French, and the Israelis. The three nations decided to act independently of the United States. On October 25, Israeli troops invaded Egypt, seized the Sinai Peninsula, and advanced toward the Suez Canal. Five days later, British and French military forces seized the northern portion of the canal. This sudden attack threatened a general war, since Russia threatened to send \"volun- teers\" to Eg>'pt.

This was in line with the policy expressed in the Eisenhower Doctrine: that the Middle East was \"out of bounds\" to Commu- nist expansion. the Hungarian revolution, which took place at the same time, persuaded the Western powers to close ranks against Russia. The Eisenhower Doctrine The Suez crisis, by weakening the prestige of the United States and its allies, appeared to open the door to Communist penetration of the Middle East. To forestall such action President Eisenhower appeared before Congress in Janu- ary 1957, and asked for power to deal with the situation. He proposed that Congress grant him power to use American military forces to repel Communist aggression in the Middle East, and that it vote him funds to be used in the area as he saw fit. His purpose was to make clear that the region was \"out of bounds\" to Com- munist expansion. This new application of containment, which became known as the Eisenhower Doctrine, provoked criticism. It offered no solution to the most pressing problems of the Middle East, such as control over the Suez Canal, the Arab- Israeli conflict, and the fate of nearly a million Arab refugees from Israel. The President was accused of \"rewriting the Constitution\" and weakening the presidential office by asking Congress for permission to use troops. As com- mander in chief, he had power to use them already, as Presidents have done ever since John Adams fought an undeclared war with France (see p. 184), and Jefferson punished the Tripolitan pirates (see p. 198). In spite of grumblings, however. Congress voted Eisen- hower the power and funds he requested. The Eisenhower Doctrine was put into ef- fect with dramatic suddenness in mid-1958. On July 14 the pro-western monarch of Iraq, King Faisal II, was killed by a group of army officers. They obviously had the support of the USSR and were in league also with Colonel Nasser. Their action immediately threatened the two small states of Jordan and Lebanon (see map, p. 714). The \\ery next day in a message to Congress, followed by a radio and television address to the nation, Eisenhower announced that at the request of the Lebanese president he had ordered American forces to Lebanon. A few hours later a navy task force started to land several battalions of marines on Lebanese beaches. On July 17, two thousand British para- troopers landed in Jordan. Again the United Nations convened to con- sider a Middle East crisis, and again some sort of compromise was arrived at. In return for guarantees that Lebanon and Jordan would be safe from cither attack from without or subver- sion from within, the British and American occupying forces were withdrawn.

Rifts in the Western Alliance On entering office in 1953 Eisenhower at- tempted to strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by encouraging the formation of a European Defense Community (EDC) that would have a single army under unified com- mand. But in 1954, the French, fearful of a rearmed Germany, voted not to join and the movement collapsed. The defense of the West was somewhat bolstered, however, when West Germany was allowed limited rearmament and membership in NATO. Greece and Turkey had already joined the alliance in 1952. The NATO military forces had never been strong enough by themselves to resist a Soviet attack on west- em Europe. They were supposed to provide a \"trip wire.\" If attacked, they would immed- iatelv engage the Russians and in doing so would bring all the members of the organiza- tion into action. The union of west European countries and the United States faced other difficulties besides that of coordinating military power. Within Europe itself there were age-old divi- sions and fears, and many Europeans had no great love for the United States. Socialists as well as Communists saw America as a dollar- crazy land where workers were exploited to swell the profits of a few great trusts, a land where all values were based on the simple ques- tion: \"Will it sell?\" Conser\\'atives often liked the United States no better. They saw Europe in danger of being \"Coca-colonized,\" as their young people took to wearing blue jeans, read- ing comic strips, and hstening to jazz. Many Britishers thought the United States partly to blame for Britain's loss of power and prestige in the Middle and Far East. Similarly in France, America received blame for the loss of Indochina and the Suez fiasco. Fortunately for the survival of the Western alliance, the USSR could be depended on to create fears that persuaded west European nations and the United States to maintain a common front. Unrest behind the Iron Curtain The Russian answer to the Marshall Plan had been the establishment of a Council for Economic Aid, allegedly designed to help the satellite countries. The counterpart of NATO was a military alliance, the Warsaw Pact of 1955. But both helped to breed disillusionment and discontent behind the Iron Curtain. It be- came clear that the Council for Economic Aid was an agency for plundering the \"people's democracies,\" and the Warsaw Pact a means of keeping Russian troops perpetually on their backs. In late October 1956, two satellite countries rose against the Soviet overlords and their lackeys. In Poland leaders of the local Commu- nist party demanded an end of \"Stalinism.\" There were anti-Soviet riots in the cities, and Polish soldiers exchanged shots with Russians. The USSR backed down and granted conces- sions, such as a reduction in the number of Soviet troops in Poland and cancellation of Po- lish debts to Russia. The new Polish premier, Wladyslaw Gomulka, granted some freedom of worship to the Roman Catholic Church and permitted limited freedom of speech and press. The Polish government was still Communist, but no longer a puppet with all the strings pulled in Moscow. In 1957 and 1958 it even asked for, and received, loans from the United States to purchase food and machinery. Revolution in Hungary, 1956 A rebellion in Hungary had tragically dif- ferent results.

But on November 3, Russian troops and tanks suddenly attacked Budapest and overcame its gallant defenders. It was an ironic fact that the backbone of resistance to the re-establishment of the \"workers' paradise\" was provided by factory and mine workers. As these events unfolded, the United Nations tried to aid the Hungarians. The General As- sembly demanded that Soviet forces withdraw from Hungary. But the USSR refused even to allow UN observers into Budapest. Great as was American sympathy for Hungary, President Eisenhower made no attempt to liberate the unhappy country; the only way to do so would have been to wage atomic war. American action was limited to sending relief and providing homes for thousands of Hungarians. A third area of trouble was the beleaguered city of Berlin. West Berlin was a continuing reproach to the USSR because it was so much more prosperous than the eastern sector of the city held by the Communists.

Americans were tra- ditionally sympathetic to anti-colonial mo\\'e- ments, but there was a reluctance to take active part on the side of the emerging African nations against America's European allies, France and Great Britain. Even after independence there was no immediate occasion for the United States to be drawn in. The transfer of power to the African go\\eniments usually went smoothly, and most of the new countries retained close social and economic ties with their former im- perial masters. These happy results were partly the result of the foresight of the British and French in training an elite in technological skills and government. The Belgian Congo was granted indepen- dence in 1960, but with no preparation for self- rule. There were said to be only 17 native university graduates in an area three times the size of Texas, and the first local governing coun- cil met only three weeks before the Belgians pulled out. Immediately there were outbreaks of intertribal warfare and of violence against Europeans. The province of Katanga, rich in minerals, attempted to secede. To make the situation even worse, two Congolese leaders called for Russian military aid, and Khrushchev assured them that the USSR would supply it. The threat that the Congo might become a battleground of the Cold War was averted by the United Nations. Under the skillful leader- .ship of Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold, the UN slowlv took charge. Hammarskjold him- self was killed in a plane crash while tr\\ing to arrange a cease-fire between rival Congolese factions. A UN army kept order; UN techno- logical and economic assistance a\\crted star\\a- tion and helped to reorganize the economy. Soviet intervention and large-scale civil war were a\\'ertcd. Gradually uneasy peace and a measure of prosperity came to the Congo. There was fear of Soviet intervention in other African states, but even the Republic of Guinea, which had the closest ties with Russia, expelled the So\\iet ambassador in 1961 and suppressed a local Communist party. The new African nations were, in fact, strongly neutral- ist. They were too weak militarily and had too many problems of their own to take sides in the Cold War. \"When the bull elephants fight,\" re- marked the Ghanaian leader Kwame Nkrumah, \"the grass gets trampled down.\" Trouble in the Americas The Western Hemisphere did not escape the world-\\\\ide Communist drive to gain power. In 1954 it was clear that the Communists had thoroughly infiltrated the government of Guate- mala, and shipments of arms were being sent to that country from behind the Iron Curtain. If the United States acted on its own to o\\cr- throw the Guatemalan government, it would mean the abandonment of the nonintervention policies developed under Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt and reawakening of Latin American fears of the \"Colossus of the North.\" But joint action with other Latin-American countries was possible. In March, an Inter-American Confer- ence, meeting at Caracas, resolved in words re- calling the Declaration of Lima, that extension of the Communist political system in this hemi- sphere would be considered a threat to the Americas. In June the regime in Guatemala was overthrown bv anti-Communist forces, who"},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"736 The Cold War were probably secretly trained and armed by the United States. On the surface, the Latin-American countries and the United States were members of a part- nership. But all was not sweetness and light. Latin Americans had good cause to believe that they were \"forgotten neighbors.\" They saw bil- lions of dollars being poured into remaking Europe's economy and shoring up weak gov- ernments in Asia, while they received little assistance. In 1952-1953, for instance, the Latin- American republics recei\\ed less than $75,000,- 000 out of .$6,000,000,000 voted for foreign aid; in 1960 South Korea alone received more aid than all the Latin-American republics put to- gether. It took a visit to Latin America by Vice- President Nixon and his wife in the spring of 1958 to make this country realize the results of such neglect. In the majority of the eight coun- tries he \\'isited, Ni.xon had to face hostile dem- onstrations. In Peru and Venezuela he was in actual danger from angry mobs. Re-examination of Policy Toward Latin America Nixon's unpleasant experience led to re- examination of our Latin-American polic). A special report by Milton S. Eisenhower, the President's brother, made three major criticisms : (1) the United States failed to inform Latin Americans about this country; (2) it had neg- lected Latin America as a field for economic assistance and investment; and (3) in dealings with Latin-American countries, the United States had not distinguished between relatively democratic governments and brutal dictator- ships. In fact it had supplied the latter with tanks and machine guns that enabled them to suppress their people and stay in power. Milton Eisenhower's report proposed an expansion of United States information ser%ices and more cultural interchange between this country and its southern neighbors. To satisfy the need for credit, he proposed both an expansion of exist- ing facilities, such as the \\\\'orld Bank and pri- vate enterprise, and the formation of a new financial agency tailored to fit the special cir- cumstances of Latin America. As for the prob- lem of the dictators, Milton Eisenhower pointed out that our nonintervention policy prevented the United States from any active attempt to overthrow them. He agreed, however, with Vice-President Nixon, who had suggested that we reserve our \"abrazo\" (embrace) for demo- cratic leaders and give dictators \"a cool hand- shake.\" The new policy toward Latin-American dic- tators had its first test in Cuba, \\\\'here the corrupt and ruthless government of General Fulgencio Batista faced a rebellion headed by the radical Fidel Castro. The United States stopped all aid to Batista, an action which helped Castro and his bearded followers toward victor)-; they entered Haxana on January 1, 1959. Castro was generally popular in the United States. But enthusiasm for the new gov- ernment waned as the Cuban leader began to denounce the United States, to confiscate pri- vate propert)'. and to seek the friendship and militar>' support of Russia and Red China. President Eisenhower applied an embargo on trade with Cuba, barring the country from the great United States sugar market, and even- tually broke off relations with the Castro gov- ernment; but these actions provided no answer to the unhappy fact that the Communists had gained a beachhead in the Americas.

The island of Puerto Rico, acquired from Spain in 1898, had long chafed under the rule of the United States. In 1950 the United States Con-"},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"The Middle Way Til gress, recognizing the justice of the Puerto Ricans' demands for self-government, author- ized them to draft their own constitution. That document, ratified by popular vote in 1952, made Puerto Rico a commonwealth. Although within the defense and tariff systems of the United States, the island is self-governing and handles its own finances. No federal ta.xes— in- come or excise— are collected there. Under the dynamic leadership of Governor Luis Marin, Puerto Rico undertook a remark- able series of reforms, collectively nicknamed \"Operation Bootstrap.\" Literacy reached 86 per cent in 1960 and per capita income climbed to $571, a gain of 320 per cent over 1940. Large estates were broken up, agriculture was di- versified, and production of electricity increased tenfold. Tax concessions attracted hundreds of new industries from the United States. Delega- tions from under-industralized nations from all In no country in the world has economic advance been so rapid as in Puerto Rico since \"Operation Bootstrap\" was initiated under the leadership of Governor Luis Mufioz-Marin in the early 1950's.

Operation Bootstrap did not solve all prob- lems. Dramatic as the increase in wealth was, the per capita income of Puerto Ricans was less than half that in the United States. Unem- ployment was high. But the most persistent problem was overcrowding. The Puerto Rican death rate dropped more rapidly than its birth rate, with resulting heavy density of population (over 600 per square mile). Free migration to the United States of- fered an apparent safety valve, and there was an exodus in the 1950's of nearly a million people to the United States, especially to eastern cities. More than one-half million Puerto Ricans live in New York City alone, where they have faced, alas, many of the discriminations and frustrations of previous immigrant populations."},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"738 The Cold War NEW DIMENSIONS IN FOREIGN POLICY The Cold War against communism has in- volved the traditional aspects of international rivalry— diplomacy, armaments, rival alliances, armed conflict. But the Cold War also had a new dimension that became more apparent after the death of Stalin in March 1953. His passing was followed by a distinct \"thaw\" in Russian policies at home and abroad. The So- viet peoples were allowed a little more freedom and more personal interchange with the rest of the world. Stalin, previously hailed as a demigod, was denounced by his successor Khrushchev as a brutal tyrant and made a scapegoat for many of the oppressive measures and failures of the Bolshevik regime. Evidence of the \"thaw\" in foreign affairs was the Korean truce and the later willingness of the USSR to withdraw troops from Austria in 1955. Making a radical change in the party line, Russian Com- munist leaders now talked of \"peaceful co- existence\" between Communists and non-Com- munist nations rather than of an inevitable war which in the atomic age would be so horrible that after it, said Khrushche\\', \"the h\\-ing will envy the dead.\" Eisenhower was willing to gamble that the new Russian attitude might increase chances for peace. Expressing the hope that \"a new dawn may be coming,\" he met the Russian leaders, Khrushchev, Nikolai Bulganin, and Marshal Georgi Zhukov, along with the prime ministers of France and Britain, in July 1955. At this summit conference, held in Geneva, Switzerland, the President made a strong plea for disarmament. The Geneva meetings were almost cordial, but nothing was settled. Neither then nor later was there real progress on matters such as the reunification of Germany, which the conference had been called to discuss. There was no relaxation in the race to produce new, more terrible weapons. Failure of \"Summitry\" In 1959 Khrushchev paid a state visit to the United States and was received with courtesy, if not enthusiasm. At Eisenhower's retreat. Camp David, the Soviet leader and the Presi- dent discussed plans for the easing of world tensions and, especially, the prospects of a sec- ond summit meeting. Just before the second conference was to meet in May 1960, howe\\'er, an American high-level U-2 plane, engaged in photographing Russian militar>' installations, was shot down deep inside the USSR. Expla- nation of the affair was badly bungled by the Eisenhower administration. As a result of it, Khrushchev made a complete about-face that perhaps had already been planned under pres- sure from Red China. He deliberately wrecked the Paris conference, threatened American allies for permitting the United States to use air bases in their territorv, and denounced Eisenhower as a prisoner of the \"war-mongers.\" \"Simimitry\" had failed. During his last two years in office, President Eisenhower embarked on a series of visits to other countries as a means of impro\\'ing rela- tions and promoting peace. The most successful of these was one to neutralist India, where vast and friendlv crowds ga\\'e him a warm welcome. But a Russian journey planned for the spring of 1960 was abandoned after the failure of the summit conference, and later an ill-timed visit to Japan had to be given up when neutral- ist Japanese students violently demonstrated against the President's coming. Peaceful Competition The policy of peaceful coexistence meant that the USSR and the United States were also engaged in peaceful competition of various sorts. Thus the launching of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, in 1957, was an immense psy- chological victory for the Russians, who were seen not merely to have caught up to the Ameri-"},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"cans in one kind of advanced technology, but to have surpassed them. And Sputnik was fol- lowed by other Russian \"firsts,\" such as photo- graphing the other side of the moon and putting the first man in space. The Eisenhower admini- stration, which had been cool toward the \"space race,\" was forced by reasons of prestige to try to catch up with the USSR in missiles and artificial satellites. The Soviet \"new look\" called for economic competition with the West. Like the United States, the Soviet Union now offered to supply goods, machines, and technicians to underde- veloped countries. These tactics opened the way for a kind of international blackmail, as the leaders of underdeveloped countries played one side against the other, and each side attempted to \"buy allies.\" The very backwardness of Russia sometimes gives it advantages in economic competition. Since Russian farms and factories are less pro- ductive than American, the USSR has more need of foreign imports. To take Egypt as an example, in 1956 the USSR agreed to accept Egypt's only important export, cotton, as pay- ment for arms. American dealings with Eg^'pt were handicapped by the fact that the United States already produces a surplus of cotton. Furthermore, the Russians are able to move more quickly and divert a portion of their na- tional income as their leaders desire without the checks of a legislative body and public opinion. American Advantages in Foreign Aid On the other hand, the United States pos- sesses commanding advantages in the field of foreign aid. It has greater wealth and generally higher technical standards. Furthermore, it need not rely simply on government action, which always arouses suspicion that strings are at- tached.

On the Mediter- ranean island of Sardinia, the Rockefeller Foun- dation wiped out malaria. In Mexico the same foundation carried on a spectacularly success- ful program to develop higher-yielding strains of com, beans, and wheat. When the program started in the mid-1940's, Mexico was importing food, and many of its people were living on a deficient diet. In the 1960's the land easily sup- ports twice as many people; yet the per capita consumption of food has increased from an average of 1,700 to 2,700 calories a day, and Mexico is a food-exporting nation. In Pakistan the Ford Foundation trained thousands of ag- ricultural experts, teachers, mechanics, and en- gineers, who pass on their knowledge to fellow citizens. American business concerns, seeing the tie between their long-term self-interest and the well-being of the countries in which they invest, have engaged in many activities to improve men's hves. Thousands of men and women from American religious groups have engaged in self- less service, whether it be stamping out cholera and t>'phus in Nepal, or teaching the inhabi- tants of a Greek village how to can vegetables, raise better crops, and improve their livestock.

The brutal fact is that three-quarters of the people of the globe are desperately poor, while the technologically advanced nations are producing more wealth than ever before. How to close the ever-widening gap betvveen the poverty-stricken and the affluent? One of the main reasons why President Eisenhower sought a lessening of the tensions of the Cold War was so that the United States and the USSR might substitute \"cooperation in human welfare for competition in the means of destruction.\" THE CHANGING SCENE The prosperity of the 1920's was character- ized by the meteoric rise of three new industries —automobile, radio, and motion picture. The corresponding symbol of the period following World War II was television. In 1945 there were only six television broadcasting stations, and less than one receiving set for every 20,000 people. Within a few years TV sets were as common as telephones. The Impact of Television Television brought politics into living rooms. Its possibilities were first realized in the broad- cast of a UN debate in 1950. A second landmark was the televising of hearings before a crime commission headed by Senator Estes Kefauver. With the election of 1952, television arrived po- litically. TV cameras invaded party conventions, recording not merely speeches on the floor, but even committee debates in \"smoke-filled rooms.\" During the campaign, both parties spent mil- lions of dollars on broadcasts costing as much as $2,000 a minute. Although TV brought vivid awareness of political events, it also raised dis- turbing questions. Would TV favor the candi- date who could present the best dramatic per- formance, or one who could afford to buy most time? Would televising congressional investiga- tions promote the search for truth and justice? Fears were expressed that television would lower the level of American culture. Supported as they were by advertisers appealing to a mass audience, TV programs, it was argued, had to appeal to the lowest common denominator of public taste. In order not to offend potential customers, they tended to avoid controversial issues and to concentrate on entertainment de- signed \"to fix the attention but not engage the mind.\" TV was accused of destroying the desire to read, of allowing people \"to remain stupid without finding it dull.\" Yet there were countercurrents that at least partially confounded the prophets of doom. There were TV programs that certainly did \"engage the mind.\" Educational TV, still in its beginnings, promised to be unexpectedly suc- cessful in stimulating the imagination as well as in extending the influence of master teachers and educators. New Uses for Leisure Almost as if to refute the charge that tele- vision would destroy reading came the \"paper- back revolution\" in book publishing. As the costs of manufacturing conventional books rose to the point where they reduced sales, pubhsh- ers started to issue cheaply printed books in paper covers. The first large paperbound edi- tions came out in 1939, and in 1940, 6,000,000 copies were sold. By 1958 they were on sale at almost every drugstore and newsstand, as well as in bookstores, and sales mounted to 350,000,000. Much of what was published was trash; yet paperback editions of old classics and difficult works of sociology and philosophy also had amazing sales. According to Clifton Fadi- man: What is important is that the success of the paperbacks proves that on all levels there is a hun- ger for the word.

Hence the reaction in favor of the word ... as long as it offers the mind the pleasure of even the faintest resist- ance. The notion that Americans were spending all their leisure hours in passive contemplation of shadows on a screen was refuted by develop- ments in music and art. The invention of FM radio and high fidelity phonographs made \"canned music\" almost as good as live perform- ances, and the result was an almost fantastic demand for musical recordings. Simultaneously, live musical performances were flourishing as never before. In 1958 it was reported that no less than 728 organizations staged operas. Music festivals in all parts of the country became ma- jor tourist attractions. Growing interest in art matched that in music. Imaginative curators transformed American art galleries from lonely mausoleums into hvely and crowded community centers. Tens of thousands took up the study of art, whether in school, college, or adult- education classes. The public bought works of art— both reproductions and originals— as never before. Crisis in Education The proportion of high school students en- tering college nearly doubled between 1935 and 1969. The biggest jump in college enrollment came at the end of World War II, when Con- gress passed a law (nicknamed \"the GI Bill of Rights\") sponsored by the American Legion. Under its provisions, the federal government paid veterans' expenses at colleges and voca- tional schools. In general, the GI's were the most serious, mature, and industrious students that had ever attended American colleges. They cre- ated new demands for higher education; even after they left, college enrollments remained at higher levels than ever before. The postwar years saw elementary and pub- lic schools in serious diflBculties. Inflation caused a rise in educational costs often not met by increased public support. Teachers resigned be- cause their pay was frequently less than that of unskilled labor. In the fifth century B.C., Soc- rates remarked that Athenian fathers worried more about those who trained their horses than those who educated their children. In twentieth century America, a jockey might earn ten or twenty times as much as the best-paid teacher. Furthermore, American schools were over- crowded. War prosperity caused an increase in the birth rate that affected elementary schools by 1950 and high schools a few years later. Larger enrollments resulted in crowded class- rooms or double sessions. New suburbs or trailer towTis often poured a flood of new pupils into schools already bursting at the seams. As lack and inequality of educational facili- ties approached a crisis, there was increasing demand for federal aid to schools. Early in 1955 President Eisenhower proposed that Con- gress appropriate $7,000,000,000 to meet a threatened shortage of over 300,000 classrooms; late in the same year he called a White House Conference on Education attended by nearly t\\vo thousand people. Yet no important legisla- tion resulted. There was fear that federal aid would lead to federal control of education. Also many northern congressmen would vote no funds for schools where white and Negro chil- dren were kept apart, while southern Congress- men would not vote funds unless they could be used for segregated schools. The launching of the Russian Sputnik in October 1957 had an impact on American edu- cation. Obviously this magnificent techonologi- cal achievement could only have been carried out by highly trained scientists. How had they been produced? Investigation of the Soviet edu- cational system revealed that Russia spent a higher proportion of its national income on edu- cation than did the United States. There were also somewhat exaggerated claims that Russian"},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"The Middle Way 743 children were better taught than American in mathematics, foreign languages, and science. Congress responded to public alarm by appro- priating funds to improve teaching in these three areas of study. The Sputnik scare strengthened the hands of educators who demanded that American schools give more attention to the academically talented. Among these men was James B. Con- ant, former president of Harvard University, whose study of public secondary education. The American High School Today, appeared as a paperback in 1959. Conant proposed that the American high school continue its great mission of educating all boys and girls and of training students for a democratic society. But he also argued that the able be given much more in- tensive training in academic subjects. Progress in Medicine In the twentieth century, man made more progress in medicine than in all previous his- tory. Scourges such as yellow fever, smallpo.x, and typhoid fever were practically eliminated, at least in Europe and America. World War II revealed how rapidly medicine was advancing. In the Spanish-American War, fought in 1898, more men died of disease than of wounds. In World War II the death rate of the fighting men was no higher than it would have been at home. The threat of malaria in Pacific Islands and Burmese jungles was met by the develop- ment of a synthetic drug, atabrine, to replace quinine. Penicillin and sulfa drugs greatly re- duced the infection of wounds. In April 1955, the country heard of one of the most dramatic advances in the history of Gl Joe Goes to College The college professor leaned back in his chair behind the registration desk and asked the kind of questions he had raised so many times with other would-be students: \"Why do you want to do it? You tell me that you didn't like high school and had a hard time getting a diploma. You were going to work with a construction gang, but the war came along and interfered. Now you want to go to college for four years and study history and economics. I know you have the money from the Gl Bill, but can you afford to take four years out of your life? How do you know you can succeed?\" The answer he received was familiar, but still stirring. Leaning forward a little, the bronzed young man said: \"Look, I got in early — didn't wait for the draft — and rolled right up the Pacific from Guadalcanal to Okinawa. And do you know what I was doing most of the time? Nothing. It gave me a good chance to think, and I decided that if I was one of the lucky ones who came back, I'd do the best I could with my life. Four years of college will make me better able to make a better world. I may even teach. But anyway, you let me into college and it will take a team of horses to drag me out. I didn't study in high school because I couldn't see any sense to it. But now I know why I want to go to college. I'll make out all right.\" By September 1957, more than three million veterans of World War II and Korea' had gone to college under the Gl Bill. Not only did they benefit, but they stimulated a desire for more education among their younger brothers and sisters.

More Women in Jobs The great demand for labor during World War II drew millions of women into industry. Afterward, so many continued to hold jobs that in 1960 women workers composed more than a third of the labor force. With more working mothers and the almost complete disappearance of domestic servants, there developed a new fea- ture of American family life, the 'Tiaby sitter.\" The clear-cut division between the male as wage earner and the female as homemaker was break- ing down. More and more husbands helped wash the dishes, put the children to bed, and learned to cook. In the professions, women found new opportunities, gaining admission to medical schools and law schools formerly open only to men. The changing status of women made for many difficult adjustments, but it was the continuation of a trend that started when the first English settlers reached America (see pp. 17, 19). Progress in Race Relations In contrast to the 1920's, which had seen the growth of the Ku Klux Klan as a national organization, the period after World War II was one in which Americans made great ad- vances in tolerance between people of different religious and racial backgrounds. The most striking evidence of this was the rising status of Negro citizens. The improvement had begun during World War II, when President Roose- velt established the Committee on Fair Em- ployment Practices to see that there was \"no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries because of race, creed, color, or national origin.\" During the period of its activity, the employment of Negroes in defense industries rose from 2,300,000 to 8.500,000. After the war several northern states passed anti-dis- crimination laws. President Eisenhower carried on from where President Truman left off in abolishing discrimination and segregation in the armed services. In the North, taboos that had kept Negroes out of certain jobs disappeared in many areas. Places were now open to them on the basis of ability in fields as diverse as the professions, white collar jobs in business, and professional baseball. It has been estimated that the average earnings of Negroes more than doubled bet\\veen 1940 and 1953. There was progress also in the South, where several states at last attempted to spend as much per child on Negro education as on white.

Soon Gandhian techniques were used in many places in the South to fight segregation and discrimination in transportation, lunch counters, and restaurants. Negroes who engaged in boycotts and \"sit-ins\" faced arrests, fines, mob action, and loss of emplo\\'ment, but more often than not their quiet persistence was effective. In scores of cities segregation of public facilities was abandoned. Eisenhower's Last Warning As President Eisenhower neared the end of his second term, there was a widespread feeling that \\ital domestic problems, such as poor pub- lic transportation and the sprawling bhght of slums and jerr\\'-built suburbs, were being neg- lected because so much public money went into defense. Eisenhower himself was worried about the way the immense armaments called for by the Cold War had increased the power of the military in American life. On January 17, 1961, three days before he left office, he ga\\'e a fare- well message to the American people over tele- vision; it was devoted to a solemn warning against the \"military-industrial complex\" which reached into ever)' comer of American life and spent more than $40,000,000,000 a year. The President's warning was all the more impressive because it came from a man who had spent most of his life as a professional soldier. His last words were: We must never let the weight of this combina- tion endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military ma- chinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that securit>- and liberty may prosper to- gether.

Nixon, and the Democrats, Senator John F. Kennedy. The backgrounds of the two men presented striking contrasts: Kennedy, a Roman Catholic from Massachusetts, was the son of a wealth)- man who had ser\\ed as chairman of the Se- curities Exchange Commission and as United States ambassador to Britain; Nixon, bom a Quaker in California, had to work his wa\\' up from relative po\\erty. But both were \\oung; Nixon was fort\\'-se\\\"en years old, and Kenned\\' was forty-three. Both were experienced and astute politicians, who showed at the national con\\entions that nominated them that the}' in- tended to dominate their parties and run their own campaigns. Both insisted on relati\\ely lib- eral platforms. Yet Nixon, \\\\ith UN Ambassador Henr)' Cabot Lodge as his running mate, was apparently able to retain support of the right wing of his party. Meanwhile, Kennedy headed off a possible southern re\\olt by persuading Senator L>Tidon B. Johnson of Texas, his prin- cipal rival for the Democratic nomination, to join his ticket as candidate for the vice-presi- dency. Four TV debates were a unique feature of the 1960 campaign. In these the candidates answered a barrage of questions tossed at them b\\' newsmen.

As election day approached, opinion polls predicted that Kennedy would win, but the unspoken religious issue caused doubt. The outcome was uncertain right up to the time the electoral college met on December 19. There was talk of recounts, and some Demo- cratic electors threatened to \\\"0te for someone other than Kennedy.

THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION There were unusual human touches in the ceremonies that attended John F. Kennedy's in- auguration as thirt\\-fifth President of the United States. The participants almost visibly shivered in the intense cold— a blizzard had hit Washing- ton the day before. The white-haired poet Rob- ert Frost could not see to read the lines he had composed for the occasion, and a heater at the speakers' feet caught fire because of defective wiring. While the fire was being put out, the tens of millions of TV \\'iewers saw the incoming and outgoing Presidents in animated con\\ersa- tion, with Eisenhower gesturing as he described the tactics on D Day in 1944. Kennedy's brief inaugural address was full of echoes from American political literature and from the Bible. It was entirely de\\oted to de- fining the position of the United States in a hungry and di\\ided world. America had been summoned, he said, \"to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle . . . against the common enemies of man: tyranny, po\\'crty, disease and war itself.\" He urged that both sides in the Cold War \"begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed b\\' science engulf all humanity in planned or acci- dental self-destruction.\" To his fellow citizens he made the plea: \"Ask not what your country can do for you— ask what you can do for your country.\" The \"New Frontier\" The Kennedy administration acquired as a label the \"New Frontier.\" Its st\\le was certainh' new.

Kennedy was next to the youngest President ever to hold office— Eisenhower had been the oldest— and his closest advisers were brilliant, articulate men in their thirties and for- ties. The social hfe of the White House was more than ever the subject of attention, as beau- tiful Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy sought to make it a center of culture. In his public appearances the President combined idealism with realism and informality with dignity. But when it came to policy there was not much that was new about the New Frontier. In foreign afi^airs the Kennedy administration continued to follow the policy of containment that had originated in the Truman administra- tion and been carried on b\\- Eisenhower. In domestic affairs the New Frontier offered a rather cautious continuation of the New Deal and the Fair Deal. Domestic Program Frustrated Kennedy, like Eisenhower before him, found it difficult to translate personal popularity into influence over Congress.

It also extended the coverage of federal wage-hour legislation and increased the minimum wage from $1.00 to $1.25 an hour. In regard to other domestic legis- lation, howe\\'er, conservati\\e southern Demo- crats, strongl)' entrenched in such key positions as committee chairmanships, joined Republicans to frustrate administration measures, as pre- \\iously they had opposed Truman's Fair Deal proposals. The President met defeat when he urged large subsidies to public schools in 1961, and again in 1962 when he recommended mas- sive aid to colleges. In 1962, Congress voted down a \"Medicare\" bill to provide hospital services for the aged. In legislation pertaining to foreign affairs Kennedy ^^as generally successful, again follow- ing a pattern set by the Truman administration. At the President's urging. Congress freely voted funds for the Peace Corps and the Alliance for Progress in Latin America (both shortly to be described). It responded favorably to requests for increased appropriations for defense and for a stepped-up space-missile program (\"a man on the moon by 1970\"). The Kennedy administra- tion's greatest legislative victory was the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. This authorized the President to negotiate with foreign nations and, in return for concessions to American producers, to reduce American tariffs by as much as 50 per cent on some goods and to eliminate them entirely on others. In mid-term elections the party in power generally loses seats in Congress, but in 1962 the Democrats more than held their own, the first time such a thing had happened since the height of the New Deal in 1934. The elections revealed changing voting patterns. In the tra- ditionally Democratic South the Republicans won seats in Florida, North Carolina, Texas, and Tennessee. But supposedly Republican Vermont elected its first Democratic governor in o\\'er a century. When the new Congress met in January 1963, Kennedy again urged the passage of an ambitious program of reform legislation involv- ing public health, care of the aged, education, public transportation, and youth problems. He also proposed to cut federal income and cor- poration taxes to spur the economy and reduce unemployment— tlie threats of huge deficits and inflation were held to be offset by the release of more purchasing power. In June 1963, the President abandoned his fonner cautious ap- proach to civil rights legislation. In an eloquent address over telc\\ision, he urged Congress to pass laws ending racial discrimination. \"Every American,\" said Kennedy, \"ought to have the right to be treated as he would wish to be treated, as one would wish his children to be treated. \" But a conservative Congress held up most New Frontier legislation."},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"New Frontiers 751 Spotty Prosperity The years 1961 and 1962 saw the country' pulhng gradually out of the mild depression of 1957-1959, but progress was not uniform. Some industries and industrial areas were not pros- perous, and unemployment remained high. An- other diflBcuIty, whicli started in the Eisenhower administration, was that the United States now had a persistently unfa\\orable balance of pay- ments: more dollars went out of the country than came in. This deficit resulted in a steady drain on American gold reserx'es which, if long continued, might force this country to de\\aluate the dollar, reduce foreign aid, or abandon mil- itary installations abroad. Any one of these moves would weaken the free world. On coming into office, Kennedy recom- mended measures to reduce the balance of payments deficit. He proposed to stimulate American exports (hence the aforementioned Trade Expansion Act), to make economies in foreign aid and military spending abroad, and especially' to try to stop the steady «age-price inflation that had been going on since the end of World War II. The administration urged labor unions to moderate their demands for higher wages. Un- der prodding from Secretary of Labor Arthur J. Goldberg, the steel industry and steelworkers signed the first contract since 1945 that did not contain such increased wages that higher prices were a foregone conclusion. When, in April 1962, several companies announced a simul- taneous rise in prices, the President revealed one of his rare flashes of anger. Using all the resources of his position, he forced the steel companies to rescind the price increases. A NEW TACK IN FOREIGN POLICY The Kennedy administration pursued a slightly new tack in foreign affairs. The essential aims did not differ from those of the Tnunan and Eisenhower administrations, and there was no relaxation of the effort to contain commu- nism, but there was greater willingness to seek accommodation with the Communist world if it could be done without sacrificing \\ital Amer- ican interests. There was also less insistence that all who are not with us are against us and there- fore more tolerance of neutralism. By the same token, there was more emphasis on economic aid to promote prosperity in de\\eloping coun- tries and less on military aid to equip annies. Neutralist Laos The new attitude could be seen in the treat- ment of Laos. When Kennedy came into office, there was an intensification of the Laotian civil war, and a Communist \\ictory seemed immi- nent. With the USSR supporting the local Com- munists and the United States ha\\ing hitherto backed a right-wing group, there ^^\"as danger of \"another Korea.\" Kennedy was determined to prevent a Communist take-over of Laos. At one time he sent American marines to neigh- boring Thailand to show he was willing to com- mit military forces. But he was willing— as the Eisenhower administration had not been— to ac- cept a neutralist regime. After prolonged nego- tiations at Gene\\'a, a compromise was reached whereby a predominantly neutralist govern- ment was set up. In March 1961, Kennedy offered a new ap- proach to foreign aid with the establishment of the Peace Corps. This body was a force of American men and women who \\'olunteered for ser\\ice to humanity. Peace Corps members submitted to rigorous training and recei\\ed in payment only li\\ing expenses, small vacation allowances, and $1,S00 at the end of two years of ser\\'ice. They li\\'ed with the people to whom they were sent, ate the same food, and spoke the local language. Twehe countries asked for and rccci\\cd Peace Corps \\olunteers in 1961.

Abo\\e all, they taught English and practical skills. Although \\olunteers were of all ages— some e\\en in their seventies— most were young men and women just out of college, seek- ing a chance to be on their own and to test themselves in difficult situations. In spite of Communist attacks on Peace Corps members as spies, in spite of those in America who sneered at \"idealistic do-gooders,\" the Peace Corps was ob\\iously a success. Se- lecti\\'ity was high; of the first 700, only 2 had to be sent home. In 1962 and e\\'ery year from then on, a pre\\iously sceptical Congress voted increased appropriations. All the original twehe countries requested more volunteers, and by 1968, forty-seven more countries asked for them. Disaster and Success in the Americas When during the Eisenhower administration it became clear that Castro's Cuba was a Com- munist bridgehead in the Western Hemisphere, plans were laid to support an anti-Castro revo- lution. The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) trained and equipped Cuban refugees in Central America. The CIA believed that the landing of a Cuban e.xile force would touch off an uprising against Castro. It was able to persuade Kenneds' and his ad\\isers of the feasibility of the QUESTION • How were P^'^n- I\" April Kennedy and his advisers 1961, therefore, ever led info such a fan- the United States tasticaUij botched adven- supported bomb- tiire as the Bay of Pigs jng of Cuban air- disasfer? fields by planes flown by Cuban e.xiles, followed by a landing of 1,500 armed refugees at a place called the Bay of Pigs. The expectation that the landing would trigger a rebellion was not fulfilled; instead, nearly the entire force was killed or captured within three days. The appalling f;iilure of this \"inxasion by proxy\" was a heaxy blow to the prestige of the new Kennedy administration: Castro was strengthened in power; Khrushchev posed as the defender of Latin America against the \"Co- lossus of the North\"; there were anti-United States riots in Latin-American cities. The actions of the United States in regard to another dictator, Rafael Trujillo of the Do- minican Republic, were more successful. In January 1961, the Organization of American States voted an embargo against Trujillo's cor- rupt and cruel regime; in May, the dictator was assassinated by a local band of his enemies. Later the United States, working in close co- operation with other Latin-American countries, pre\\ented the slain ruler's family from re-estab- lishing his tyranny. Tlie Alliance for Progress The Castro mo\\ement, known as \"Fidel- ismo,\" threatened to spread to other countries. Promoted by Cuban agents, it often found ready support among the poverty-stricken and discontented. Parth' to meet this threat. Presi- dent Kenned)' proposed a long-term effort to build up the Latin-American standard of living. In August 1961, an Inter- American Economic and Social Council drew up plans for an \"Alli- ance for Progress,\" somewhat on the lines of the Marshall Plan. Over a ten-year period the United States proposed to help Latin-American countries help themselves in such endea\\'ors as better schools, housing, and public health; more diversified economies; stabilization of prices and currencies; fairer methods of taxation; reduction of poverty and social injustice. Chances of success were by no means certain. Conservative Latin Americans often saw the Alliance as fos- tering rcxolution and threatening their property. Communists and other leftists regarded it as a cloak for imperialism. In some countries— no- tably Chile, Colombia, and Venezuela— it helped promote reforms. In others, opposition from the"},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"New Frontiers 753 right, from the left, or from both sides at once, prevented the Alliance from doing much good. Second Cuban Crisis During the summer and earl\\- autumn of 1962 there was increasing fear that in addition to being a Communist satellite Cuba might be- come a Russian military base. Russian techni- cians proposed, for instance, to build a \"fishing port\" on the Cuban coast, and this might double as a base for So\\iet submarines. It was known that Russia was arming and training Castro's army. So long as Kennedy remained con\\inced that the militan,- preparations in Cuba were defensive, he held back, e\\en in the face of a mounting public demand that he act. In mid-October, howe\\'er, aerial photo- graphs offered proof that the Russians were building missile bases in Cuba and providing missiles that threatened nuclear attacks on the United States and Caribbean countries. Keep- ing his intentions secret until the last moment, Kennedy told the nation in a tele\\ised broad- cast about the So\\iet threat. He declared a naval \"quarantine\" of Caribbean waters. Ameri- can na\\al \\essels were alread\\' deplov'ed to intercept and search ships approaching Cuba. The President demanded prompt dismantling of the missile sites. He gave a clear ultimatum to Russia: \"Any hostile mo\\e an\\^vhere in the world against the safety and freedom of peoples to whom we are committed . . . wll be met by whate\\'er action is needed.\" There was an ago- nizing pause of fi\\e days before it was kno\\Mi whether Khrushche\\' would retreat from the brink of war. During this period the President was rewarded for his earlier restraint. The Organization of American States supported the action of the United States by a \\ote of 19-0. The New York Times termed this \"the clearest show of hemispheric unit)' since World War II.\" Finally, Khrushche\\' backed down and prom- ised to send the missiles back home. Relations with Canada During the Kennedy years, relations between the United States and Canada were not entirely happ\\', although the two countries cooperated in man}' ways and there was never the slightest chance of really serious conflict. One of Can- ada's troubles was just the re\\erse of that of Latin America— not too httle capital in\\estment from the United States, but perhaps too much. A third of the foreign in\\estments of this coun- try were de\\oted to dexeloping the resources of its northern neighbor. Canadians feared that their countr\\' might become an economic colony of the United States. There was also criticism of United States quotas on such Canadian prod- ucts as oil and of disposal of surplus United States wheat in world markets at less than cost. Early in 1963 a dispute between the two coun- tries came into the open. The State Department took the extraordinary step of issuing a state- ment criticizing the Canadian government for refusing to cooperate in agreed-upon defense policies.

Lester Pearson, the Liberal winner, expressed more friendliness toward the United States and its armament policy. Confrontation and Negotiation In his inaugural address, Kennedy had urged renewed efiforts to find means of relieving the tension of the Cold \\^'ar, saying, \"Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us ne\\er fear to negotiate.\" In June 1961. he flew to Europe for meetings with heads of states— with Charles de Gaulle in Paris, Prime Minister Harold Mac- millan in London, and Khrushchev in Vienna. The President reported that his meeting with the Russian premier was a \"very sober two days.\" The two men treated each other with courtesy, but could find no area of agreement. Kennedy later told the American people: For the facts of the matter are that the So\\iets and ourselves give totalK' different meanings to the same words: war, peace, democracy, and popular will. We have different \\iews of right and wrong, of what is an internal affair, and of what is aggres- sion. And above all, we ha\\'e totally different con- cepts of where the world is and where it is going. Perhaps thinking that he could intimidate the young President who had recenth- emerged from the Ba>- of Pigs fiasco with a damaged reputation, Khrushchev handed Kennedy a near- ultimatum on East Germany and Berlin. He in- sisted that the Western powers recognize the Russian puppet state and that the four-power occupation of Berlin be ended. When the Pres- ident refused, the Communist answer was a wall across Berlin, barring free mo\\ement between their district and the rest of the city. This \\\\eakened the economy of W^est Berlin, which had dra\\\\n much of its labor from the Russian sector. It closed off the flight of refugees from East Gennany. Man\\' who attempted to escape were mercilessh' shot douTi b>' East German police. \"The W^all\" was \\-isible testimony that the \"people's democracy\" of East Germany was a vast prison. E\\en more alarming than tension o\\'er Berlin was the fact that in the autumn of 1961, Russia resumed nuclear testing in the atmosphere. It exploded o\\er fort>' bombs, one with 3,000 times the power of that which destroyed Hiroshima. Kennedy unwillingh- followed suit, but re- doubled efforts to persuade the Russians to agree to ban above-ground testing. Russia would agree to no satisfactor\\- system of in- spection, but this became less important as means were found to monitor exjDlosions from outside the country. Demands for on-site in- spection were therefore abandoned, and in Au- gust 1963 the United States, Great Britain, and the USSR signed a test-ban treaty. 754"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"Division in the IVIarxist World Khrushchev's retreat in the second Cuban crisis and the test-ban treaty gave hope that the So\\iets as well as the Americans realized that in such a \"balance of terror\" nuclear war was unthinkable. There \\\\'as other e\\idence— such as greater freedom within Russia and less rigid control of satellite countries— to sug- gest that Russian communism might be becom- ing less militant and more willing to reduce friction with the West. Probably the most im- portant reason for the new Russian line was a di\\'ision in the Marxist \\\\'orld between Russia and China. It was becoming increasingly ap- parent that the two great Communist powers were drifting apart. They especiall)' disagreed about relations with the capitalist world. The Russians insisted that coexistence was the only altemati\\'e to mutual destruction, while the Chinese continued to preach the \"hard\" line that the ri\\'alry bet\\\\'een communism and cap- italism must end in \\iolence. TRAGEDY AND A NEW PRESIDENT Kenned>^'s >ears in office came to a sudden and appalling end when he was assassinated while \\isiting Dallas, Texas, on No\\'ember 22, 1963. Throughout the world, men and women felt a sickening sense of loss. This first President bom in the twentieth century had brought to the White House an infectious zest for life, cool courage, and a sense of purpose without pretense or pomposity. In a country' that had suspected \"eggheads,\" Kenned>- made trained intelligence popular. His tragedy, and ours, was that he was too young to die, and in such a senseless fashion. Lyndon B. Johnson, Legislative Craftsman Lyndon B. Johnson, who succeeded to the presidential office, had many qualities that the public mind associates with his native state of Lyndon B. Johnson took the oath of office a few hours after the assassination of President Kennedy in Dal- las. The shock and grief on the faces of those present reflected the feeling of the stunned nation. In this sol- emn atmosphere, Johnson assumed his heavy duties. Texas. He was a big man, possessed \\\\'ith im- mense energy and drive. Almost fanatically gre- garious, he enjoyed entertaining hundreds of people at a barbecue on his 4,000-acre ranch. After long experience as majority leader in the Senate he was a skilled legislative craftsman. In 1964, Johnson persuaded Congress to enact into law several measures that it had previously repudiated. The most notable of these were far-reaching ci\\il rights acts, laws establishing an anti-po\\'erty program, the issuance of food stamps for the needy, a program of slum clear- ance, aid to education, and medical assistance to the aged. Landslide of 1964 Johnson was ine\\itably selected as the Democratic candidate in the presidential elec- tion of 1964. He chose as his running mate Hubert H.

Determined, they said, to give the voters \"a choice, not an echo,\" they nominated Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, a right-winger. Goldwater declined to repudiate \"extremists,\" such as members of the John Birch Society, who were attracted to his banner. His opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Law alien- ated Negroes and other minority groups; his coolness toward social security made older people fearful; his support of the open shop hurt him with organized labor; his dislike of agri- cultural subsidies lost him votes in farming districts. Above all, perhaps, the senator's pro- posal that subordinate military commanders be empowered to decide whether to use atomic weapons aroused fear that his election might mean the horror of nuclear war. Johnson meanwhile promised a \"Great So- ciety\" that would presumably be promoted by welfare legislation. He won some business sup- port by his financial conservatism. Long before election day, polls predicted he would win by a landslide. He became the second presidential candidate in history to win more than 60 per cent of the popular vote. His margin in the electoral college was 486 to 52. Outside of his own state of Arizona, Goldwater carried only five states— all in the deep South, where former \"Dixiecrats\" (see p. 700) switched to the Re- publicans. The Democrats gained forty seats in the House of Representatives, and the new members represented the liberal wing of the party. \"THE ROAD TO THE GREAT SOCIETY\" In his state of the union message to Con- gress in January 1965, Johnson spelled out what he thought was needed to put America on \"the road to the Great Society.\" He hoped to open \"opportunity to all our people\" and to improve \"the quality of American life.\" In the ensuing ten months, Congress passed a series of laws that were matched in \\'olume and importance only during the hectic first \"100 days\" of the New Deal. The legislation completed much of the unfinished business left over from Johnson's Democratic predecessors, Franklin Roosevelt, Truman, and Kennedy. Assisting the Poor and Neglected The new legislation extended federal influ- ence into areas previously reserved for local government or private enterprise, and it was especially directed toward assisting the poor and neglected. Both of these aspects of the Johnson program were revealed by the Ele- mentary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. For the first time the federal go\\ernment gave direct, massixe aid to both public and parochial schools. The money was to be allocated so as to be of special benefit to children of low-income families. A parallel act to aid colleges provided scholarships to able and needy students.

A \\ast Anti-Po\\ert\\' Program was undertaken, and its directing agency, the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), was empowered in some cases to overrule local go\\ernments that opposed its activities. The purpose was not simply to pro- vide relief, but to help the poor to help them- selves by fostering community spirit and co- operative action in fields as diverse as pre- school training for children, cleaning up parks, and establishing playgrounds. After nearly twenty years of contro\\ersy. Congress finally passed a \"Medicare\" Act that provided people over sixty-five with hospital and nursing-home care, the cost to be paid for by higher social security taxes on payrolls. Medical centers were also to be established in areas where medical care was scarce. Medical schools were granted funds to increase enrollments and so avert a shortage of doctors. Rural poverty was attacked by the experimental Appalachia Program, de- signed to raise li\\ing standards in the Appa- lachian area. The continuing concern of the Johnson ad- ministration for ci\\'il rights was shown by a law providing voting registration by federal agents in communities containing a high pro- portion of Negroes where less than 50 per cent of adults were on the \\oting rolls. New Immigration Policy For over forty >ears the immigration polic>' of the United States had discriminated in fa\\or of people from northwestern Europe at the ex- pense of all others.

Great Britain and Ireland together were allocated 83,000; but India, with a popu- lation of 450,000,000, and Andorra, \\\\ith 6,400, each had the minimum qtiota of 100. Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy had all assailed the racist implications of the quota system, but without persuading Congress to end it. By the Immigration Act of 1965, national quotas were entirely abolished. The law established a \"global\" quota on a first-come, first-served basis. The only discrimination was in favor of men and women with special skills. Other Legislation Other legislation of the S9th Congress was designed to impro\\'e the en\\ironment in which Americans li\\ed. A new Department of Hous- ing and Urban Development (HUD) was cre- ated, headed by Robert C. Weaver, the first Negro to sit in the cabinet. Plans were initiated to improve rail transportation in the great metro- politan area that extends from Washington to north of Boston. Wilderness areas were expanded and funds appropriated to end pollution. President Kennedy's assassination promoted new demands that Congress make impro\\ed provisions for presidential disability and suc- cession. In the summer of 1965, therefore, both houses of Congress passed and submitted to the states a constitutional amendment that sets forth methods whereby the Vice-President may take o\\'er when the President is incapacitated and whereby a new Vice-President may be se- lected when a President is removed or resigns from office. In 1967, this became the Twenty- fifth Amendment. \"Consensus\" Lyndon Johnson owed some of his success as a legislatixe leader to his belief in \"con- sensus,\" which in terms of practical politics meant something for e\\erybody. Businessmen were pleased when Congress at his request abandoned excise taxes on hundreds of items- furs, jewelry, T\\' sets, theater tickets. This tax cut, at a time wlien the economy was slackening"},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"760 TJw Cold War a little, stimulated further prosperity by releas- ing purchasing power and lowering prices. Johnson's lcgislati\\ e program included the now almost traditional subsidies to farmers to reduce acreage. To aid labor unions, the President urged repeal of Section 14-b of the Taft-Hartley Law that allow^ed states to pass \"right-to-\\\\ork\" laws outlawing the union shop. The farm bill went through, but the repeal of Section 14-b failed to pass the Senate when Everett Dirksen, Republican minority leader, organized a suc- cessful filibuster against it. The President had reason to boast that the record of the S9tli Congress was \"without equal or close parallel in the present era.\" But to trans- late the legislative blueprint for the Great So- ciety into constructive achie\\ement required large sums of money. It was necessary therefore to reduce or at least keep in check the even waster amounts that were being spent by the Department of Defense for militar\\' prepara- tions, weapons, and space projects. Full-scale domestic reform demanded peace abroad. JOHNSON AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS Like Woodrou' Wilson half a centur>- before him, Lyndon Johnson was less prepared by pre- vious experience and b\\' inclination to deal with foreign affairs than with domestic policy. It is perhaps significant that in this area he retained two of Kennedys closest advisers— Presidential Assistant McGeorge Bundy and Secretary of State Dean Rusk. In most areas of the world the Truman-Eisenhower-Kenned)- policies were continued. The surprising fall of \\ikita Khru- shchev in the autumn of 1964 produced little change in dealings with Russia. The policv' of coexistence and limited cultural interchange between Americans and Russians continued— but the Berlin Wall remained intact as a svm- bol that the Iron Curtain was still drawn. In Europe there was further weakening of the NATO alliance. President de Gaulle of France kept Great Britain out of the European Eco- nomic Communitv- (Common Market) and re- sisted American pretensions to leadership of the free vvorld. Dominican Intervention In the Americas, Johnson continued support of the Alliance for Progress and the Cuban boycott. He handled with forbearance and skill a difficult situation in Panama, where anti- American riots endangered the Canal Zone. The President aroused fear in Latin America, how- ever, and controversy in the United States by armed intervention in the Dominican Republic. In April 1965, a rebellion broke out against a rightist government that had seized power in the island country. Three days later President Johnson ordered 20.000 marines to the Domini- can Republic. This intervention— the first of its kind since 1927— was necessary, argued the President, to protect the lives of 2,500 United States citizens on the island and to prevent a Castro-like Communist take-over. Critics of the President's action argued that the L^nited States could have taken whatever action was necessary bv- working through the Organization of Ameri- can States. The Dominican situation revealed some diffi- culties of United States policy toward Latin America in the Cold War period. In case of an attempted Castroite revolution the Communists gained whether the United States intervened or refrained from doing so. In the former case, Latin-American opinion was invariably aroused against the \"Colossus of the North\"; in the latter case the Communists extended their influence. Fear of \"Fidelismo\" also induced the United States to give active support to some reactionar\\- Latin-American governments whose repressive policies made eventual revolutions probable."},{"pageNumber":717,"pageContent":">.Y Involvement in Vietnam During the Kennedy and Johnson years the situation in South Vietnam got steadily worse. Local guerilla fighters (the Viet Cong), with support from the Communist government of North Vietnam and arms supplied by Russia and China, carried on an increasingly success- ful civil war and came to control more and more of the countryside. The rapid succession of South Vietnamese go\\emments that followed the overthrow and assassination of President Diem in 1963 recei\\ed no great popular sup- port, nor did they fight the Vjet Cong effectively. The difficulties had been foreseen by Kennedy. As a senator, he had said in 1954 : To pour money, material, and men into the jun- gles of Indochina would be dangerously futile and self-destructive ... I am frankly of the belief that no amount of American military assistance can conquer an enemy which is everywhere, and at the same time nowhere, an enemy of the people which has the sympathy and covert support of the people. Once in the White House, Kennedy saw mat- ters differently. Faced with withdrawing from Vietnam or increasing the American commit- ment, he did the latter, and every increase of commitment made it more difficult to withdraw. After Johnson came into office, the situation continued to deteriorate to such a degree that it became obvious that the United States must soon choose one of three unpleasant alterna- tives: carry on in a hopeless position and suffer eventual defeat, make a humiliating retreat, or earn,- the war to the north uith danger of bring- ing in Red China. In August 1964. North Vietnamese torpedo boats had unsuccessfully attacked three United States destroyers in the Tonkin Gulf off the Vietnamese coast. Congress responded by pass- ing, with only two dissenting \\otes, a resolution that authorized the President to use armed Three U.S. Marines carry a wounded fellow soldier from the ruins of Hue, South Vietnam. force to assist any nation in Southeast Asia that asked American assistance in defending its freedom. In Februar\\- 196.5, when the Viet Cong at- tacked an American air base in Vietnam, inflict- ing over a hundred casualties, Johnson decided to retaliate. He \"escalated\" the war by ordering the bombing of North Vietnamese supply routes and military establishments. United States forces now abandoned their \"ad\\isory\" role and acti\\'ely entered the fighting. The position in which the United States now found itself was even more difficult than the one it had faced in Korea. There the fact of Communist aggression had been clear; the United States fought as the agent of the United Nations; and the South Koreans fought well to defend themselves. Now the United States was inter\\ening in a cixal war as well as resisting Communist aggression from outside; many non- Communist South Vietnamese were indifferent or hostile to the war effort; and the United States had military support only from South Korea, Thailand, .Australia, and New Zealand.

American bombs and napalm dropped on villages supposedly held by the Viet Cong took the lives of thousands of noncombatants. As the Vietnam war dragged on with no near prospect of victory and with mounting American casualty lists, it provoked \\iolent con- troversy at home. Highly vocal opposition at first centered on college campuses, where it of- ten took the form of massive demonstrations of protest. Many clergymen of all faiths joined the \"doves,\" as those who favored peace were called. A way-out fringe of the peace movement re- sorted to illegal or bizarre forms of protest, such as burning American flags. But there was also in- creasing opposition to the war from responsible journalists, such as Walter Lippmann; from staid newspapers, such as the New York Times; and even from military men, such as General James M. Gavin, who had served President Kennedy as United States ambassador to France. There were doves highly placed in Congress, several in the President's party. They included Mike Mansfield, Senate majority leader, and J. William Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Although those who opposed the President's actions in Vietnam tended to be more in the public eye than the \"hawks\" who favored them, the latter had their way. Johnson's policies re- ceived support from the majority in Congress, and polls re\\ealed that this reflected public opinion. Apparently the majority of the people could see no reasonable alternative to the Pres- ident's policy, and withdrawal from Vietnam would, according to the \"domino theory,\" open the way to Communist aggression elsewhere. The do\\'es and hawks did not fall into two neat categories, but included a whole spectrum of opinions. Dovish attitudes ranged from those who demanded immediate, unconditional with- drawal to those such as General Gavin who rec- ommended stopping the bombing of the North and pulling back American forces into more defensible \"encla\\es.\" At one extreme the hawks included persons who disliked Johnson's poli- cies but saw withdrawal as bringing greater woes; at the other extreme were those who thought the President should escalate the war further, even to the use of atomic weapons against both North Vietnam and Red China. Early in 1966 there was a glimmer of hope that peace might be arranged. After a Christmas and New Year truce. President Johnson called off bombing raids on North Vietnam during the entire month of January. He made public offers of negotiation and, rather belatedly, instructed Ambassador Arthur Goldberg to lay the dis- pute before the United Nations. But Ho Chi Minh, president of North Vietnam, made the condition that the United States withdraw all troops before negotiations could begin. Reluc- tantly, Johnson ordered bombing resumed on February 1. On the advice of the military, he gradually increased the American ground forces until by the end of 1967 they numbered over half a million men. Middle Eastern Flare-up: The Six Day War, 1967 In 1967 there was a sudden flare-up in the Middle East. The truce that had existed there since the Suez crisis of 1956 had been an un- easy one, punctuated by frequent petty clashes between Israel and its Arab neighbors, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt. Russia now posed as the defender of the Arabs and provided Egypt with an abundance of modern weapons with which to a\\enge pre\\ious military defeats. The new crisis began on May 16, when Eg>pt demanded that UN peacekeeping troops abandon positions they held in order to police the Gulf of Aqaba, Israel's outlet to the Red Sea. U Thant, Secretary-General of the UN,"},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"\\cw Frontiers 765 withdrew the forces entirely, whereupon Presi- dent Nasser of Egypt mo\\ed his anny in and closed the Gulf of Aqaba to Israeli ships. This was an act of aggression, and Nasser suggested that it might be a prelude to outright war when he remarked, \"Israel's existence is itself an ag- gression.\" In spite of efforts by the Security Council of the UN to avert hostilities, Israel suddenh- seized the initiative by attacking Egyptian, Jor- danian, and S\\rian airfields on June 5. This was the opening of tlie amazing Si.x Day War in which brilliantly led Israeli forces o\\crwhelmed the Arabs surrounding them and captured terri- tory' nearly four times as large as Israel itself. It was well that the war was so swift and conclusi\\e. Had it been prolonged, the USSR and the United States might have been drawTi into it. As it turned out, the USSR suffered a severe blow to its prestige. Perhaps a billion dollars' worth of Russian arms had been de- stro\\ed or captured by the Israelis, and the USSR had shown itself unwilling to commit its o\\\\Ti forces on behalf of its Arab allies. Soviet diplomats attempted to sa\\ e face b\\' persuading the UN General Assembly to condemn Israel and, b>- implication, the United States. But the Assembly could be persuaded to do no more than urge Israel to return to Jordan that part of Jerusalem it had taken. Although the USSR lost prestige in the Mid- dle East as a result of the Six Day War, the United States did not gain any. On the con- trary, the Arab \\\\orld bitterb' resented the American partialit\\- toward Israel and held the United States partly responsible for the defeat. A by-product of the Middle East crisis of 1967 was a summit conference on June 24-25 between President Johnson and So\\iet Premier Kosygin at Glassboro, New Jersey— a site chosen because it was halfway between the White House and New York City, where Kos>gin was attending sessions of the UN. The meeting was cordial, and the crowds attracted by the event were friendly. In tw o con\\ersations, one o\\er fi\\e hours long, no important agreements or change of position emerged. AFFLUENCE AND INSECURITY In 19.58 tlie economist John Kenneth Gal- braith wrote a book, Tlie Affluent Society, in which he declared that the recent American prosperity was something new in the world. In all previous societies, productivity had been so low that most people could expect nothing but backbreaking toil and po\\crt\\'. The economies of most countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are in this category. The United States and a few other highly de\\eloped countries are, howe\\'er, in sight of a day when all people can li\\e in abundance. Not only has American producti\\it\\' run far ahead of increases in population, but wealth has become more equally dixided. During the \"golden twenties,\" the top 5 per cent of the people amassed 35 per cent of the nation's income. By 1960 this share had sunk to 18 per cent, e\\en before taxes; and most Americans earned enough for luxuries as well as for the ne- cessities of life. The proportion of home owners increased from 40 per cent in 1940 to nearly 60 per cent in 1960. So many could afford cars that new super-highways became overcrowded as soon as completed. There was more leisure: hours of work were shortened, and millions of workers enjo\\ed \\acations with pa\\'. An auto- mobile for nearly ever\\' family, combined with annual vacations, led to the development of a new business: the motel. First appearing in the late 19.30's, motels soon were built along every highway from Maine to California. Lei- sure time also produced booms in gardening equipment and power tools. Most Americans became more secure as well as better off. Unemplo\\ment insurance and"},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"766 The Cold War social security were extended to the majority of jobholders. Such programs were supple- mented by a \\ariety of pri\\'ate welfare plans, promoted by employers or trade unions. Busi- ness executives, facing high income taxes, often preferred to be paid in annuities after retire- ment rather than in higher salaries. Federal subsidies protected farmers against serious loss. Federal legislation also protected bank depos- itors, investors, and mortgage holders. In spite, howe\\er, of the greater diffusion of prosperit)', the United States had not reached the point W'here e\\er\\one recei\\'ed enough for a satisfying life. There remained a hard core of po\\erty, both rural and urban. Indeed, the bottom 20 per cent of the population gained no greater share of the wealth than in the 1920's. Scientific Advances During the 1960's, scientific ad\\ances con- tinued to impro\\'e men's li\\es and to extend their horizons. The achievements most visible were those in medicine and in the conquest of outer space. Arthur Goldberg, Conciliator In 1965, Arthur Goldberg had reached the pinnacle of the legal profession as a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. When, however, Johnson asked him to resign and succeed Adiai Stevenson as United States Representative to the UN, Goldberg immediately agreed. He said he could not rest easy in a world where the issue was human survival; if the President thought he could help mankind to survive, he would eagerly offer his assistance. The job of representing the United States to over a hundred foreign nations is a grueling one, but hard work was not new to Goldberg. Son of a poor Russian immigrant, he went to work at twelve for a weekly wage of $3.80. While holding a full-time job, he completed high school, college, and law school at twenty. As a lawyer, Goldberg specialized in representing labor unions. Chief counsel for both the Steelworkers' Union and the CIO, he earned $100,000 a year. He developed an extraordinary ability to settle management-labor disputes. He knew his facts; he could see both sides; he kept his head. A reporter who observed him during difficult negotiations wrote; \"He wraps resourcefulness, understanding, psychology, patience, toughness, flexibility, self-confidence, intuition, and a perfect sense of timing into one irresistible package, and when it's all over you wonder why you didn't think of it first yourself.\" Before being called to the Supreme Court, Goldberg had served Kennedy as Secretary of Labor. A friendly, gregarious man, he got on with people who bitterly opposed the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. One of these was Barry Goldwater. who wrote him when he took the UN job; \"You are taking on a thankless, difficult, and at times almost impossible job, but if anybody can bring the strength that is needed to that assignment it is you.\" In 1968, Goldberg resigned as ambassador to the United Nations. Perhaps this was because of disagreement with President Johnson over Vietnam policy. As a private citizen, he opposed continued bombing of North Vietnam.

Operating on the heart, fonnerly a measure of desperation, now became commonplace. Doc- tors learned how to transfer whole organs, such as kidneys, from one human being to another. It became possible also to transfer tissues from the dead to the li\\ing, the most spectacular advance along these lines being transplantation of the heart. There was also progress in the treatment of cancer: a linkage between ciga- rette smoking and lung cancer was established, and certain types of cancer responded favor- ably to injections of organic substances. The \"space race\" between the United States and Russia that started with Spufnik in 1957 produced a series of startling achie\\ements. By 1968, hundreds of artificial satellites were in orbit; some were expected to circle the earth for a thousand years or more. Satellites were of increasing practical usefulness as means of observing weather patterns and of facilitating intercontinental communications. Some went far beyond the earth. The Russians were the first to photograph the far side of the moon, but in 1965 an American satellite, Mariner 4, pho- tographed Mars. In 1966 the Russians with Luna 9, and later the Americans with Surveyor I, solved the problem of a soft landing on the moon. In 1967, both countries sent up satellites to seek answers to some of the long-standing questions about Venus. The ri\\alry of the two great powers was also manifested in manned flights. At first the Russians iield an ad\\antage because their rock- ets had a more powerful thrust. They were the first to put a man in orbit ( 1961 ) and the first to send up two men (196.3).

Still another area where man's knowledge and control of his enxironment spectacularly increased was the ocean. Here French scientists were pioneers. It was they who invented the aqualung and devised means whereby men li\\ed for weeks under water. By tlie 1960's, scuba diving had become an international sport, and submarines had been built capable of de- scending o\\er a mile below the surface of the sea.

Automation and Its Effects Other scientific acUances resulted in a tech- nological de\\elopmcnt kno\\\\Ti as automation. This new phase of the industrial re\\olution in\\ol\\'ed the increased use of transistors that could send and recei\\e signals and of auto- matic computers— \"thinking machines\" able to perform complex mathematical operations al- most instantly. The application of automation to all sorts of mechanical processes eliminated the need for human controls. According to a calculation made in 1965, automation was dis- placing 35,000 workers a week. It rendered jobless many people with high skills— coal miners, accountants, linotype operators, and in- dustrial designers. But the hardest hit were the unskilled, such as ele\\ator operators. Automa- tion also promoted employment, but the new jobs usually demanded high literacy and often mathematical knowledge as well. It was esti- mated that of 6,400,000 new openings between 1956 and 1964, 5,400,000 were \"white-collar\" jobs, and only 1,000,000 were suitable for \"blue- collar\" workers. Unemployment among the poorest, least educated segment of the population created a dangerous situation. Inability to get work not only meant living on relief but also implied rejection by society. It bred resentment and irrational antisocial beha\\ior. The growing con- \\iction that mass poverty in the midst of plent\\' was both a moral \\\\'rong and a threat to societ\\' was behind the efforts of the Johnson admin- istration to start an assault on poverty. Urban Problems The symbol and symptom of mass poverty was the slum. \\\\'itli a declining or stationar\\- population, mounting financial problems, anti- quated systems of government, and a diminish- ing sense of civic responsibility, many cities were decaying at the center. Their underpaid employees in understaffed schools, social serv- ices, libraries, hospitals, and police departments could not do their jobs well. The worst sec- tions of such cities became \"asphalt jungles,\" the breeding ground of crime, drug addiction, and alienation from the rest of society. The suburbs were not \\\\'ithout problems of their own. They were not communities in the older sense of being places that contained most human activities and commanded human loyal- ties. A suburb was simph' \"a place to hang >our hat.\" One study revealed that American mar- ried couples of less than middle age move, on an average, once every five years. They have too little opportunity to develop a sense of belong- ing or to get the satisfactions that come from active communitv- life. Suburbia tended to stratify and isolate groups in American societv\" b\\' throwing to- gether people of similar age and income. This sometimes had an adverse effect on schooling. Younger couples often could not afford the high taxes necessary to provide good schools, and yet they were the ones with the children who most needed education. Communities dom- inated bv- older people of wealth were not anxious to pay taxes to educate other people's children. But these urban problems are not all new or peculiar to America. Nor are they bevond solution. Pittsburgh, to take a notable example, has cleared away the pall of smoke that used to hang over the city and has completely re- built its central area, letting in light and air. \\\\'ith imaginative leadership, citizens willing to sacrifice time and energy, and often the assistance of federal funds, the most stubborn urban problems can be dealt with."},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"New Frontiers r69 \"The Quiet Crisis\" The ugliness and decay of many urban areas of the United States were unhappily matched by de\\eIopnients outside them. In liis book The Quiet Crisis, published in 1963, Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall issued a solemn warning: America today stands poised on a pinnacle of wealth and power, yet we li\\e in a land of vanish- ing beauty, of increasing ugliness, of shrinking open space, and of an over-all environment that is di- minished daily by pollution and noise and blight. Udall's book described how Americans were fouling their en\\ironment with junkyards, ur- ban sprawl, and strip mining. Indiscriminate use of detergents and pesticides was destroy- ing wildlife, and several species of birds, in- cluding the bald eagle, were threatened with extinction. A prolonged drought in the East in the years 1964 and 1965 brought on a water crisis and made the public aware that many rivers were open sewers. Even the Great Lakes (which contain 20 per cent of the a\\ailablc fresh water in the world) were so contaminated that \\alu- able species of fish were dying out. Udall urged that the United States at long last learn something of \"the land \\\\isdom of the Indians,\" who regarded their hunting grounds as a sacred trust to be transmitted unspoiled to their children. THE NEGRO REVOLUTION During the Kcnncd\\- and Johnson admin- istrations, Negro Americans demanded more insistently that they recei\\e the rights that were supposedly the birthright of e\\er\\- American. In the South the \"sit-ins\" of 1960 were followed by the \"freedom rides\" of 1961. Mi.xed groups of blacks and whites, often clergvmen or theo- logical students, challenged segregation of buses and bus stations. The \"riders\" quietly submitted to \\iolcnce at the hands of mobs and to jail sentences or fines for \"loitering\" or \"in- citing to riot.\" The freedom rides were followed by \"freedom schools\" in which southern Negroes were urged to insist on their rights and were instructed in Gandhian techniques of non- \\ iolent demonstrations. Meanwhile, the federal go\\'emment acted with increasing \\igor to advance and protect Negro rights. President Kennedy insisted on equal job opportunities and prohibited segrega- tion in housing built with federal funds. The Department of Justice, headed by the Presi- dent's brother, Robert Kennedy, sent federal marshals to protect freedom riders. The Su- preme Court, under the liberal leadership of Chief Justice Earl Warren, handed down de- cision after decision that promoted school de- segregation and civil rights for Negroes. In September 1962, a Negro, James Meredith, backed by a court order, sought entrance to the University of Mississippi. When Governor Ross Bamett refused to admit him, mob \\iolence broke out, and two people were killed. Order was restored and Meredith was admitted to the university only after Kennedy sent troops. In contrast was the enrollment of a Negro archi- tectural student at Clemson University' in South Carolina in 1963. In this case, state and local authorities not only obeyed a court order, but took strong measures to head off rioting. As we ha\\e seen, Kennedy in 1963 urged strong legislation to end racial discrimination. Lending weight to the President's program was a great \"March on Washington\" in August. 0\\er 200.000 people, black and white, converged on the capital, led by priests, rabbis, ministers, and civic leaders. Singing hymns and spirituals, they marched toward the Lincoln Memorial in"},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"770 The Cold War testimon\\' of all men's right to be free and equal. Then they shpped quietly away. It was the most massi\\e and orderly day of protest in American histor\\'. Civil Rights Act of 1964 After Kenned\\'s death. President Johnson, a Southerner, demanded with equal fervor that Congress take action. On July 2, 1964, he had the satisfaction of signing the strongest Ci\\il Rights Act since Reconstruction. Passed b\\ large majorities in both houses of Congress, it provided that all citizens should ha\\e equal ac- cess to public facilities, such as parks and librar- ies, and to pri\\ate businesses serving the public, such as restaurants and theaters. It forbade discrimination in emplo\\ment or education and strengthened guarantees of the right to vote. A few months after passage of the Act, the De- partment of Justice reported general compliance \\\\'ith the law in southern states, \"as befits a people who respect and comply with the law.\" It is significant that all twehe southern con- gressmen who \\oted for the law \\\\ere re-elected in 1964. New l\\1ilitancy: \"Black Power\" Although the Negroes were gaining legal rights that would ha\\e seemed surprising onh- a decade earlier, translating these into action was often a slow process. By 1964, for instance, ten years after the Broun v. Board of Education decision, less than 10 per cent of black children in the South were in desegregated schools. Furthermore, the relati\\e impro\\ement of the economic status of Negroes that began during World War II had not been sufficient. Automa- tion hit Negro workers with peculiar force, since many of them were unskilled and had received inferior schooling. Despite court decisions and federal poficies, Negroes were becoming in- creasingly segregated in the North, often more so than in the South. As they moved into new- city districts, the whites mo\\ed out. As their cliildren entered public schools, white children were sent to pri\\ate schools. E\\en prosperous, well-educated Negroes found it difficult to buy propert\\' in suburban areas. These difficulties created a mood of frustra- tion and a new militanc\\-. Martin Luther King's insistence on non-violence and Christian love now seemed to man\\' Negroes a form of \"Uncle Toniism.\" The black man must no longer wait for the whites to gi\\ e him rights, but must seize them for himself. The goal now, as preached by radical leaders such as Stokely Carniichael of SNCC (Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee), was \"black power.\" This phrase has a \\ariet\\' of meanings. It may apply to or- ganized protests against poor conditions, such as school bo\\ cotts or sit-ins by mothers on wel- fare. In the economic sphere it may refer to efforts b\\' black communities to get control of their own businesses, supermarkets, and banks. It certainly means political action, defined by Carniichael as \"the coming together of black people to elect representati\\'es and to force those representatives to speak to their needs.\" Thus the Negro began to be a force in southern politics for the first time since Reconstruction. In the 1964 presidential election. Negro \\otes pro\\ided the winning margin for Johnson oxer Goldwater in Arkansas, Florida, Texas, and \\'ir- ginia. Negroes elected increasing numbers of minor officers in the South— sheriffs, count)' commissioners, state legislators. In the North in 1967, Negroes were elected as mayors of Cleveland, Ohio, and Gary, Indiana. The changed attitude revealed itself in a \\ariety of ways.

Re- jecting Christianity, the Black Muslims, a rehgious group, sought to instill in their follow- ers great self-discipline, along with a belief in black supremacy. Some black power ad\\ocates proposed complete separation from the white communit)'. Violence In some parts of the South there were efforts to thwart the legislation designed to advance the lot of Negroes. Resistance took \\arious forms, such as firing or refusing to hire Negroes who joined the ci\\il rights mo\\ement. White mobs tried to intimidate children who entered desegregated schools; Negro churches were bombed or burned; ci\\il rights workers, both Negro and white, were killed. Thus, up to 1963, most of the \\iolence con- nected with the Negro Revolution had been committed by whites. In Ma\\- 1963, houe\\cr. after peaceful demonstrations organized by Martin Luther King in Birmingham, Alabama, had been broken up by police with dogs and fire hoses, and after King's brother's home had been bombed, there was an outbreak of Negro \\iolence against whites. Within a week, inter- racial clashes occurred in three other southern cities and in New York Cit\\-. Perhaps ine\\itably, gi\\en \\\\hat the Negro had sufifered for three centuries, some black power leaders preached \\ iolencc. Some of them, like Carmichael, had previously supported Dr. King. Much of the assault was merely verbal- bitter denunciations of \"whitcy\" in black litera- ture, in the black theater, and at black rallies. But some Negroes deliberateh- armed them- sehcs for a struggle that might be hopeless but would at least assert their willingness to die rather than accept an inferior status. In 1964 and 1965 there were flare-ups of violence in \\arious northern cities, but the"},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"72 The Cold War public was unprepared for the explosion that took place in ^^'atts, a Negro section of Los Angeles, in August 1965. For four days mobs looted, burned, and fought the police. The out- break was only suppressed after 12,500 mem- bers of the National Guard had been called out. The area looked afterward as though it had been bombed; damage was conser\\ati\\ely esti- mated at $40,000,000. much of it suffered b\\- Negroes. Most of the 900 injured, and all but 3 of the 34 killed, were also blacks. A commission appointed to investigate the Watts riot made the chilling prediction: \"So serious and cxplosi\\e is the situation that, un- less it is checked, the August riots ma>' seem by comparison to be only a curtain raiser to what could blo\\\\' up one day in the future.\" So it pro\\ed to be. There was somewhat of a lull in 1966, but during the \"long hot summer \" of 1967 there ^\\•ere outbreaks in o\\er sLxt\\' cities in twent\\-one states. Those in Newark, New- Jersey, and Detroit, Michigan, were e\\en worse than the \\\\'atts outbreak. There was no eas\\' answer to what caused the riots or how to a\\ert them. The riots showed that responsible Negro leadership, such as that which organized the magnificently disciplined March on Washington, had not reached down to the poor in the ghettoes. The\\' showed that mere attainment of paper rights was not enough to assuage the blacks' sense of rejection and injustice. The riots were espccialh- difficult to deal with because all such outbreaks tend to become irrational, almost suicidal. Inevitabl\\\\ more Negroes got hurt than whites, and more suffered property loss. E\\ery outbreak tended to harden white prejudice. The latter aspect was the most difficult of all. As President John- son's commission to investigate the disorders reported; \"\\\\hat white Americans have ne\\er fully understood— but what the Negro can never forget— is that white society is deeply impli- cated in the ghetto, ^^'hite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it. and white so- ciet\\' condones it.\" The riots also pointed up what all students of the situation of Negro Americans had come to realize: many Negroes were handicapped by patterns of life that go back to slavery. Among Negro men physical prowess was generalK- held in higher esteem than mental skills— witness the folk hero John Henr\\% who swung a 20-pound sledge hammer and, prophetically, died trying to compete with power-dri\\en machiner\\'. Ne- groes are toda\\- the onl\\' group in which men are apt to ha\\e less fomial schooling than women. Such patterns inhibit progress, espe- cially among the poor. Progress, But . . . The brutalit\\- of Ku Kluxers in the South, the polite but perhaps equally deadly prejudice of much of suburbia all over the country, the black looters breaking store windows, and the burning cities should not obscure the fact that immense progress has been made in race rela- tions in the last three decades. Countless legal disabilities ha\\e been erased. In 1940, only 100.000 Negroes voted in the entire South; in 1968. that man\\- voted for a Negro candidate for go\\ernor of Georgia. In 1940, practicalh- the only field where blacks could achieve emi- nence was entertainment, and e\\en there only to a limited extent. B\\\" the late sixties there were Negro ambassadors, bishops, and judges (one on the US Supreme Court). But large as the gains had been, a great gap still remained, and blacks were disposed to measure progress not b\\' where the\\- once were but b\\- where the white man was.

Abroad, the Vietnam war dragged on with no immediate prospect of victor)', although General Westmoreland did assure the countr\\- that the Viet Cong military efiFort \\\\as weak- ening. Alas, 1968 turned out worse than was antici- pated. The first rude shock came in Februar\\- when the supposedly exhausted \\'iet Cong \\ ig- orously attacked three dozen supposedb- well- defended South Vietnamese cities, e\\\"en pene- trating the US Embass\\' in Saigon. They threatened to turn an American marine outpost into another Dienbienphu (see p. 727). Al- though by no means a complete success, the so-called Tet offensi\\'e made mockery of claims that the Viet Cong could soon be conquered. The Tet offensive had immediate political effects in the United States. Senator Eugene McCarthy, a do\\'e, challenged Johnson in a presidential primary in New Hampshire and \"shook even' comer of the political landscape\" by a surprising near-victor\\'. The next day, Senator Robert Kennedy, who had previoush' decided to defer presidential ambitions until 1972, threw his hat in the ring. He too cam- paigned against the war. The last day of March brought President Johnson's astonishing statement. \"I shall not seek, and will not accept, the nomination of my party for President.\" Instead of taking the advice of the Pentagon to send 200,000 more troops to \\'ietnam, Johnson ordered curtailment of the bombing of North Vietnam and an- nounced he would immediately seek a nego- tiated peace. The enthusiasm that greeted the President's announcement was shown when the stock market jumped 20 points the next da\\'. On April 4, howe\\er, jo\\- turned to gloom when a sniper's bullet killed Martin Luther King in Memphis, Tennessee. A bitterly ironic reaction to the news of the murder of the great preacher of non-\\iolence was a sudden outbreak of rioting, arson, and looting in o\\er a score of cities, including Washington, D.C. The city suffered more grievously than at the hands of the British in 1814; at one time, forty fires were burning. In many urban communities, howe\\'er, black leaders and even organizations of mili- tants urged their neighbors to \"cool it.\" and \\iolence was a\\\"erted. Early in Ma\\-. another form of \\iolence jolted the public. Radical student protesters Columbia was one of several universities that wfit- nessed demonstrations by students demanding more voice in the University's policies."},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"774 The Cold War seized buildings of Columbia University, New York City, and held them for a week until evicted by police. This was only the worst in- cident in a wa\\e of protest that was sweeping many campuses. Sometimes demonstrations were peaceful and demands moderate— the end of bias in fraternities, or attempts to enroll black students. Sometimes the students, or at least their leaders, seemed intent on taking o\\er the colleges (\"student power\") or simply dis- rupting them. Student riots were not peculiar to the United States. In the previous year they had occurred in Rio de Janeiro, London, Rome, Madrid, and even beyond the Iron Curtain in Warsaw and Prague. The same week as the Columbia inci- dent saw French students battling police in the streets of Paris. Soon they were joined by mil- lions of workers in a great general strike. France was economically paralyzed; the De Gaulle regime, seemingly so well established, appeared helpless. Finally, De Gaulle calmed things down by promising reforms and new parliamentary elections. Rather surprisingly, the voters gave him strong support, but the French economy had suffered grie\\ously and disorders might re- cur. Johnson's withdrawal had left the Demo- cratic presidential race wide open. By early June, Robert Kennedy was well ahead of McCarthy and appeared to be challenging Vice- President Hubert Humphrey. Then another ap- palling tragedy occurred. Kennedy was assas- sinated by an Arab nationalist who was incensed at American support of Israel. Kennedy's death removed from American politics a man \\\\'ho had extraordinary sympathy for, and ability to communicate with, those most alienated from American society— the poor, the blacks, many of the young, even the Indians. The tragic event touched ofiF much soul-search- ing about the high incidence of violence in America— organized crime, the black riots, white vigilantism, the steady diet of fighting and gunplay on TV and in movies. President Johnson pleaded, \"Let us, for God's sake, re- solve to live under the law! Let us put an end to violence and the preaching of violence.\" Congress, however, was cool to the President's proposal to vote the strict controls of the sale and possessipn of guns that are commonplace in other countries. Although there were no more major riots in the summer of 196S, isolated in- stances of racial strife occurred almost daily. Meanwhile, prospects for peace in Vietnam dimmed. American and North Vietnamese dip- lomats duly met in Paris in May. But the North Vietnamese refused to negotiate until the United States stopped bombing above the 17th parallel. The United States refused to stop bombing until the opponents made a corre- sponding gesture of de-escalation. So the meet- ings dragged on fruitlessly month after month —as did the fighting. The outlook in foreign affairs was darkened further by events in Czechoslovakia. There a quiet rebellion, triggered by student protests, had overthrown the Stalinist regime that had been riveted on the countr\\' after ^^'orld War II. A new premier, Alexander Dubcek, restored free speech, some democratic processes, freer contact with the West. Such freedoms the men of the Kremlin could not tolerate. After several warnings to Dubcek from the USSR to re\\'erse his policies, Russian troops and tanks, assisted by other Communist forces, overran Czecho- slovakia in late August. Unable to withstand the invasion, the Czechs unhappily submitted to those So\\iet demands they could not safely resist. The event was a moral disaster for the USSR. It split the Communist world more than e\\er, as Rumania, Yugoslavia, and Communist parties in France and Italy denounced So\\iet actions.

Ni.xon chose as his run- ning mate Spiro T. Agnew, Governor of Man- land, a candidate agreeable to southern Republi- cans. In his acceptance speech NLxon set the tone of the ensuing campaign by stressing \"law and order.\" \"The first civil right of everv' Ameri- can,\" he declared, \"is to be free of domestic violence.\" Without saying how, he promised to bring the Vietnam war to \"an honorable end.\" The Republican Convention, with its tradi- tional and tiresome ballyhoo, won few friends for the GOP. but the Democratic Convention, meeting in Chicago three weeks later, was a disaster. Good features, such as a thoughtful ke}Tiote address by Senator Daniel K.

Although he selected as vice presiden- tial candidate a moderate \"dove,\" Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine, Humphrey supported the Vietnam policies of the unpopular Johnson administration to which he belonged. He went along with the \"law and order\" mood but also promised to attack causes of crime and rioting by massive \"Marshall Plan aid\" for the cities. A third candidate was George C.

Here too, the Demo- crats gained, since Muskie proved a more attrac- tive candidate than Agnew. A week before the election. President John- son announced that the bombing of North Viet- nam was halted and that the Hanoi government had agreed to discuss a cease-fire. This was a further boost to the Democrats. The Gallup and Harris polls, which in September had predicted a Republican landslide, now said the result was a toss-up. The pollsters proved right. Not until the morning after the voting booths had closed was it apparent that Nixon had won, after carrying Ohio, Illinois, and California by close margins. His comeback was unprecedented in modem American political histor\\'; not since the election of William H. Harrison in 1840 had a candidate who lost out the first time been elected on a second try for the presidency. In the congressional races the Democrats easily retained control of both houses. A predicted swing to conservatism failed to materialize. Lib- eral Democratic Senators McGovem and Church were reelected in South Dakota and Idaho, both carried by Nixon; Fulbright was reelected in Arkansas, carried b>' Wallace. Max Rafferty, an extremely conservative candidate for senator in California, ran far behind Nixon and lost. If Nixon had received a iew thousand votes less in any of the key states mentioned above, the result would have been in doubt until the electoral college met in December. There Wal- lace would have held the balance of power. He could have been a President-maker by telling his electors ( who had pledged themselves to vote as he bade them ) which major candidate to sup- port. If the deadlock in the electoral college had continued, the election would have been thrown into the House in January 1969, each state hav- ing one vote, so that the one representative from Alaska (population 275,000) would have equal say with the thirt>-eight from California ( popu- lation 19.000,000). Clearly, refomi of the elec- toral system was long overdue. \"We want to bring America together,\" Nixon declared on hearing that he had been elected. He immediately conferred with President John- son to find means of cooperation with the admin- istration and to arrange an orderly transfer of power. He met Humphrey, who pledged to help him as he faced the immense tasks that lay ahead —finding a way to end the costly and divisive Vietnam war, easing racial tension, making the great cities liveable, and finding means to allay the stresses of the Cold War.

The quotation beginning this chapter comes from a speech delivered by John F. Kennedy the day before he was killed. It suggests surely that men must not run away from difficulties. Better to think of this as an age that opens new frontiers. The great new frontier is not outer space, but mankind itself. As the Daniel Boones and nameless women in sunbonnets faced the rigors and terrors of the physical frontier, so their successors must face the challenges of the present. Taking a Chance on Freedom Confronted with such difficulties as frustrat- ing wars, poor distribution of goods, and racial conflict, nations have turned to dictatorsliip or military government. But the United States, along with its closest allies, has taken a chance on freedom. Freedom of enterprise encourages the production of an abundance of goods. Free discussion promotes understanding of issues. A freely elected government has managed to cope with every crisis. An eloquent description of the spirit of free- dom that should ser\\e Americans weW in the future, as it has served in the past, was written by Learned Hand, former chief judge of the Court of Appeals in New York. It is fitting that the last chapter of this book should close with words by a judge, because the judiciary is the guardian of liberty under law. During World War II, Judge Hand gave an address entitled \"The Spirit of Liberty.\" It closed as follows: What then is the .spirit of liberty? I cannot define it; I can onlv' tell you my own faith. Tlie spirit of liberty is the .spirit which is not too sure tliat it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understand the minds of other men and women; It is a gloomy moment in history. Not for many years— not in the lifetime of most men who read this paper—has there been so much grave and deep apprehension; never has the future seemed so incalculable as at this time. In France the political caldron seethes and bid)bles icith uncertainty; Russia hangs as usual like a cloud, dark and silent upon the horizon of Europe . . .

For generations these constituted a system of values that Americans held in high esteem. Are they still rele\\ant? Let us examine them in the context of today's world: ( 1 ) Economic opportunity^. Even though two hundred million people now occupy a land that was almost entireh\" \\irgin territor\\- two centuries ago, the United States remains a country of fabulous plent\\'. The a\\-erage per capita income is twent\\'-fi\\'e or thirty times that in Asia. But the nation has become painfully aware that in certain areas and among certain groups there is desperate continuing po\\ert\\'. Federal and local go\\ emments and other agen- cies seek wa\\s to ensure that the economic op- portunity most Americans enjoy is thrown open to all. (2) Wide participation in politics. Today the belief that the people of the United States can run their own affairs is challenged. Some local go\\emments are so inefficient or corrupt that they frustrate the popular will. In local elections it is often difiBcult to determine what the popular will is, since many \\oters are ap- athetic and stay away from the polls. At the national level the Cold War presents the con- stant danger that matters of national importance will be decided without public debate, or e\\en in secret. There is, however, widespread polit- ical discussion of most major problems, foreign and domestic. Elections are \\igorously con- tested. The caliber of men going into politics has seldom, if ever, been higher. Within the past decade the formerly disfranchised Negroes of the South ha\\e entered actively into politics, and in the North, blacks ha\\ e been chosen for high political office. There is no \\isible danger that democratic processes will be replaced by another system of go\\ernment. ( 3 ) Belief in reform rather than revolution. The only time since the Ci\\il War when there seemed to be any danger of re\\olution was during the Great Depression, which ran from 1929 to 1939. But the ballot box was open, and the people chose to follow the traditional path of refonn as represented b\\' President Franklin D. Roose\\elt and the New Deal. Today, how- ever, some alienated people challenge the whole system. Although a small minority, they pose a threat to the idea that societ\\\" can be improved by peaceful processes. (4) A mobile population. \"Mobile\" here has two meanings: it suggests actual physical move- ment from place to place and mo\\\"ement from one occupation or economic status to another. Both meanings fit present-day America. A \"na- 782"},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"Epilogue 783 tion on wheels\" is constantly on the road, and the axerage person changes residences several times in a lifetime. Opportunity to advance economically is not equal, hut for most people there are no fixed ceilings. (5) A high position and freedom for women. During the twentieth century, and especially during the past three decades, taboos that limited women's personal freedom and kept them out of certain occupations ha\\'e been swept away. It is still true, however, that women tend to get less fomtal education than men and less pay for their labor. (6) Belief in education and widespread educational opportunity. As academic education becomes an increasing necessity for employ- ment in a society that has less use for unskilled labor, the number of years of formal schooling has increased. Today the majority of American boys and girls finish high school, and, if present trends continue, the majority will soon go on to college. But the quality and accessibility of education vary widely, according to institution, locality, and relative wealth. (7) Concern for the welfare of others. The change from a rural or small-town society to the impersonality of city life has reduced the feeling of mutual helpfulness, summed up in the term \"neighborliness.\" There have been shock- ing instances of crimes of violence in full view of scores of people, none of whom raised a fin- ger to help. And yet other evidence points to the continuing \\igor of the feeling of concern: witness great philanthropic agencies such as the Ford Foundation or the Sahation Army and the thousands of men and women who ser\\e in the Peace Corps and the Job Corps. (8) Toleration of differences. The unpun- ished murder of civil rights workers and the violent race riots are appalling evidence of American intolerance. And \\et, in the long pull, toleration of racial and religious differences has gained, as indicated by the recent abolition of discrimination in immigration laws and by ef- forts of the state and federal governments to end racial discrimination. (9) Respect for the rights and abilities of the individual. There have been recurring times of h\\steria in American history when dissenters were denied rights supposedly guaranteed them by law. Law enforcement itself has been too fre- quently negligent of the rights of the poor man, the immigrant, and the Negro. On the other hand, the courts and the legal profession, with the Supreme Court leading the way, are now more than ever concerned that the laws shall be so enforced that there will be in fact as well as in theory \"libert\\' and justice for all.\" (10) World-wide responsibility. There is abundant e\\idence that the United States is committed to the exercise of world-wide re- sponsibility, whether one looks at the billions of dollars granted in aid to foreign nations or at the 50,000 American lives given to save South Korea from aggression. It may be argued, how- e\\'er, that the United States should make greater efi^orts to combat the appalling poverty that affects most of the world's population, to strengthen the United Nations, to rid the world of the scourge of war, and to find means to do away with weapons of \"defense\" that can wipe out humanity. So— after examining the ten \"themes,\" what is the \\erdict? Are they relevant today? Do Americans hold to the values they represent? The answer would appear to be a guarded t/es. There is no room, howe\\'er, for complacency or self-congratulation. Too much in American life cries for improvement. Our cities are ugly and our suburbs often not much better. We despoil our countr\\side. Our crime rate is among the highest in the world. And yet there is still immense vitality, immense optimism, and a belief that the world can be made a better place to live in. The way to a better world is to practice what we preach."},{"pageNumber":740,"pageContent":"THEME PART 9 Surely theme 10, \"world-wide responsibility,\" is applicable to this period, as to the two or three preceding it. At the same time, we have come to realize that if the United States is to do good in the world, it must at the same time achieve good for its own people, especially those who have hitherto been excluded from a full share in the benefits of American life. The latter realization involves at least five themes: \"economic opportunity,\" \"belief in education and widespread educational opportunity,\" \"concern for the welfare of others,\" \"tolerance of differences,\" and \"respect for the rights and abilities of the individual.\" Questions: 1. In a series of policy statements such as the Act of Havana (1940), the Dec- laration of the United Nations (1942), the United Nations Charter (1945), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (1949), the Truman Doctrine (1947). the Eisenhower Doctrine (1958), and Kennedy's promise to Khrushchev (1962), \"Any hostile move anywhere in the world against the safety and freedom of people to whom we are committed . . . will be met by whatever action is needed,\" the United States has moved away from the isolationist policies of the 1930's. Is this trend wise, or do you think America should return to the former position? Could we return if we so desired? See Winks, The Cold War: From Yalta to Cuba. 2. Is there any relationship between investments all over the world by American business and the development of a sense of world responsibility by our govern- ment? What other explanations seem applicable? 3. Who are going to lead American Negroes in their search for the promised land— the preachers of violence, such as the Black Muslims, or the men of peace, such as the late Martin Luther King? See Silberman, Crisis in Black and White. 4. What is justice for the American Negro? READINGS PART 9 Special Supplements Arnof, *A Sense of the Past, Part Nine.

It is placed here so that students may look up or make sure of terms used in the text. It is also worth reading through as an elementary introduction to certain important concepts. Anarchy (political science). Absence of government; a society in which there is no ultimate ruler and in which individuals enjoy total freedom. The term is often used to describe a period of political or social disorder. Arbitration (diplomacy, economics). Settlement of a controversy by agreement of opposing parties to ac- cept as binding the decision of a third party. It oc- curs most often in labor and _ diplomatic disputes. Aristocracy (political science). A government run by the best people. In theory, aristocracy is appealing to many, but in practice it is difficult to decide who is \"best.\" Hamilton, in his sympathy for government by the rich and well-bom, believed to some extent in a form of aristocracy. Automation (economics). An industrial process in which machines do their own \"thinking,\" i.e., adjust to changing conditions. A simple example is a house thermostat, which turns the furnace on and off ac- cording to the temperature. Cabinet (political science). A top-level body that advises a head of state. The British cabinet is, in effect, an executive committee of Parliament. Usually drawn only from the majority party in Parliament, this cabinet is all-powerful. In America, the cabinet as a body has no real power and only as much in- fluence as the President chooses to give it. Capital (economics). Accumulated wealth which is invested or otherwise used to produce new income. \"Liquid\" capital refers to money and to stocks and bonds, which can be easily converted to money. Factory plants, railroad lines, and even human skills are forms of \"fixed\" capital. Caucus ( political science ) . A meeting of party or faction leaders to choose candidates or decide pol- icies. In Congress, both parties caucus to decide on appointments, common policies, and political strategy. Civil Liberties, Civil Rights (law, political science). These two terms overlap. However, the term civil liberties implies freedom from interference by gov- ernmental agencies (state or federal) in a citizen's private life. Civil liberties include freedom of wor- ship, of speech, and of the press. The term civil rights has come to mean freedom to act in equality with others. The right to vote, to have equal access to public facilities such as buses, and to have equal job opportunities are civil rights. Civil liberties are, in general, the freedoms defined in the Bill of Rights, especially the first eight amendments to the Consti- tution. Civil rights commonly find their legal basis in the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which forbids states to abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States. Class (sociology). A group of people united by some distinguishing characteristic such as level of income, amount of formal education, or type of employment. Communism (economics, politics). The theory or policy that the means of production and distribution of goods should be owned by the community. Theoretical communism differs from corrununism as it is practiced anywhere today. The Soviet Union claims that it is a socialist state trying to achieve communism, and that when it does there will be no further need for gov- ernment, because there will be no economic classes in conflict. Communist-controUed states today are undemocratic in political structure and are totalitarian. There are, however, important differences in both principles and practice among such nations as the Soviet Union, China, and Yugoslavia. See also Social- ism. Confederation (political science). A league of states, such as that set up by the Articles of Confederation. Contract Theory or Social Contract Theory (political science ) . A political theory, which gained force during the Enlightenment, that governments acquire their just power by means of contracts made with the people ruled. One of the leading social contract the- orists was John Locke, whose ideas were the the- oretical basis for the Declaration of Independence. Culture (anthropology, sociology). The entire way of life of a people: their art, beliefs, laws, customs, morals, etc. Deflate (economics). To decrease the supply of cur- rency or credit relative to the total amount of goods and services. Deflation (economics). The act of deflating currency or credit. Thus, \"As country after country went on the gold standard during the last thirty years of the nineteenth century, there was world-wide deflation.\" Democracy (political science). In theory, democracy means rule by the people, as opposed to rule by a long (monarchy), by the best (aristocracy), by the 787"},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":"wealthy (plutocracy), or by the few (oligarchy). In practice, pure democracy is impossible to carry out except in states so small that the entire citizenry can convene in one place. Democracy is commonly carried out through elected representatives ( represent- ative democracy). Dictatorship (political science). A government in whicli either one man or a small group of men runs the state, making or enforcing laws arbitrarily. There are varj'ing forms of dictatorship, and the tenii itself is sometimes used as a con\\eniently \\ague slogan. In a modem totalitarian dictatorship not only every- aspect of the national life but also most aspects of the individual's life are under government control. An example of such a dictatorship was Nazi Germany. Discrimination (sociolofiy). In common American us- age, discrimination means treating certain groups of people unfavorably. For many years, racial discrim- ination was enshrined in the law codes of many states. Recently, . Supreme Court decisions have all but eliminated legal discrimination by the states. Due Process ( political science, laic ) . Fair legal proce- dure. Due process is the backbone of rule by law rather than by the arbitrary whim of those in power. Procedural due process refers to court procedures designed to insure fair trial, such as the right to counsel and to jury trial. Substantive due process refers to the actual substance of legislation. Laws involving state regulation of private enterprise have sometimes been held to deny due process on the ground that they limit liberty or confiscate property. The specific meaning of due process is a matter of constant debate and redefinition by the courts. The Enlightenment (philosophy). An eighteenth-cen- tury intellectual movement characterized by distrust of existing authorities of church and state and op- timistic belief that human reason can increase man's social and political happiness. Established Church (political science). A church sup- ported by the civil government, as the Anglican church in colonial Virginia and in modem Great Britain. The First .'\\mendment to the Constitution forbids Congress to establish any religion or church. Faction (political science). A group of people within a state or part>' seeking to promote certain private interests. Thus, in 1824 the Republican party \"had broken up into warring factions.\" Fascism ( ]tolitical science). A political movement orig- inated by Benito Mussolini in Italy shortly after World War I, later imitated in Germany under the Nazis, and in such other countries as Spain and Portugal. The term fascism is derived from the Latin fascis, a bundle of sticks bound together which sym- bolized magisterial authority in ancient Rome. The doctrine of fascism repudiates parliamentary democ- racy, which Mussolini called a \"rotting corpse,\" and favors a highly disciplined state in which power radiates down from \"the leader\" at the top. All power is exercised by a single elite party, as in Communist states. Fascists denounce individualism and teach that a person reaches his highest fulfill- ment in ser\\'ice to the state. Nationalistic by defini- tion, fascism extols the military virtues, usually creates an \"enemy,\" and uses propaganda to whip up mass enthusiasm. All criticism and all organizations outside the party itself are suspect, and are suppressed. Federal (political science). (1) Before the framing of the United States Constitution— referred to a league of states. See also Federation. ( 2 ) Refers to a govemment of the type set up by the Constitution of the United States that at- tempts to divide sovereignty between the central ( federal ) government and individual states. See also Sovereignty. Federation (political science). A league of states. Iden- tical in meaning with Confederation. Filibuster (political science). In the nineteenth cen- tury, filibuster usually referred to a private military adventure, such as William \\\\'alker's in Nicaragua. A second meaning, widely used today, is the attempt by a single man or a small group of men to prevent a legislative body from acting on a bill by simply talking and talking. Franchise (economics, political science). ( 1) The right to vote. Thus, \"At the time the Constitution was ratified, franchise was limited to white males paying taxes on property.\" (2) A right or liberty granted by a legislature. Thus, \"Mr. Smith and his associates were granted a franchise to run a street railway in Cripple Creek.\" Free Trade (economics, political science). Trade free of governmental restrictions. Especially used as the antonym of Protection. Frontier (geography, sociology). (1) A political bound- ary. \"At the frontier they took our passports,\" (2) The line between civilization and the wilderness; the area of the most recent white settlement as the United States expanded to the Pacific. Gross National Product (economics). The dollar value of the total outputs of goods and services produced in a country in a given year. Usually abbreviated GNP. Imperialism (political science). The action or policy whereby a nation extends its power by obtaining direct or indirect control over other peoples. Thus, \"As a result of the American Revolution the United States threw off the >oke of British imperialism\" and \"Theodore Roose\\elt believed in imperialism as an expression of national virility.\" 788"},{"pageNumber":745,"pageContent":"Indentured Servant {economics, sociology). A person held to service for a stated luiinber of years by an indenture, or contract. Inflate ( economics). To inflate currency or credit means to intrcasc the supply in circulation relative to the total aiiioinit of goods and services. This usu- ally results in a rise in prices. See also Quantity Theory of Money. Inflation (economics). The act of inflating the cur- rency. Tlius, \"By printing so much worthless con- tinental currency the Continental Congress caused runaway inflation.\" Judicial Review (political science). The evaluation of state and federal laws and of the actions of officials by the judiciary, especially by the Supreme Court. Laissez-Faire (economics, political science). A French term meaning \"let do.\" People should be peniiitted to carry on economic activities Without governmental interference. In its pure fomi, the theory of laissez- faire would not permit government-run enterprises, governmental control of wages and price, social security, protective tariffs, or any other restriction on business practices. See also Private Enterprise. Mediation (diplomacy, economics). Evaluation or working out of a solution to a controversy by a third party to the dispute. The mediator tries to bring the parties together by offering his own sug- gestions for a solution. The parties are under no ob- ligation to accept the mediator's advice. Mercantilism (economics). May refer either to the theory of mercantilism or to trade policies based on this theory. ( See p. 10. ) Mobile (economics, sociology). A \"mobile,\" as opposed to a \"static,\" society is one in which it is relatively easy for men and women to move up or down in the economic scale or to change their status in other ways. The life of Andrew Carnegie is a good example of mobility in American life. Monarchy (political science). A government having a hereditary chief of state who rules for life. The power of monarchs has varied in different periods of history. George III was not an absolute monarch, as he shared power with Parliament. Most mon- archies today are constitutional, i.e., the monarch's power is severely limited by law or custom. Natural Law (political science). A general body of law which eighteenth-century philosophers believed to govern human conduct just as gravity governs the movement of falling bodies. This \"natural law\" was defined as eternal, immutable, discoverable by reason, and binding on human society. Locke, Paine, and Jefferson used natural law to justify the right of revolution against a government that denies men's freedoms. Natural Rights (political science). Those rights that all men are bom with and that can be neither given nor taken away. John Locke popularized the idea of natural rights, stressing as foremost the rights to life, liberty, and property. The Declaration of Inde- pendence enumerates \"certain unalienable rights . . . among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap- piness.\" Non-violent Resistance (political science). A means of political action in which people resist or refuse to obey what they consider to be unjust laws without resorting to physical force, in order to persuade those in authority to agree to their demands. Used effec- tively in India under the leadership of Gandhi and in the southern United States by civil rights demon- strators. In the South it has taken such fonns as the \"sit-in,\" in which civil rights demonstrators take seats at lunch counters where Negroes have not hitherto been served, and simply stay there. This technique was also used in the 1930's, when auto- mobile workers refused to leave their plants, thereby preventing employers from hiring men who would have worked without a union contract. Oligarchy (political science). Government by the few. This may take many forms: government by a heredi- tary nobility (aristocracy), government by a few wealthy men (plutocracy), government by a few military men (junta), or government by an elite political party (one-party state). Parity (economics). A steady level of real income guaranteed farmers on the basis of what the govern- ment determined to be fair at a given period. Much farm legislation since the 19.30's has been aimed at preserving parity prices for farm products, with the intention of keeping the income of fanners in step with that of other segments of the population. Party (political science). In the United States, an i)rganizati()n aimed primarily at the election of men to public oflice. .'\\merican political parties are for- ums where var\\ing interest groups can decide how they will compromise their differences, for neither the Democratic nor the Republican party is a mono- lithic institution. In Western European democracies, parties are more tightly di.sciplined and usually stand for certain principles or segments of the population, viz., the Conservative, Liberal, and Labour parties in Eng- land. In totalitarian states, whether communist or fascist, a single, unopposed party dominates all organs of gov- ernment. Thus, these states are a form of oligarchy. Patronage (political science). The power to fill public offices. It may be a means whereby a winning polit- ical party rewards it followers with offices ( the 789"},{"pageNumber":746,"pageContent":"\"spoils system\"). At the federal level today most civil service jobs are under the \"merit system,\" which forbids appointment and removal for political reasons. Unrestricted patronage is much more common at the state and county levels. Precedent (political science). Something said or done that justifies later action of a similar nature. Judicial decisions ser\\e as precedents, or examples, for later opinions by judges. Prejudice (sociology). Pre-judging; that is, making up one's mind before one looks at the evidence. The term now usually refers to pre-fonned attitudes about racial, ethnic, or religious groups and to the tendency many people have to regard others more as members of groups than as individuals. Price Index (economics). A statistical device for meas- uring inflation or deflation. A price inde.x determines the average price of certain key goods during a given year and calls that average 100. To measure how prices have ciianged since that base year, one need only find the average price of the same key goods in another year, and compare that figure, as a percentage, to the base year. Private Enterprise (economics). Refers to an economic system in which factories, stores, and other means of production and distribution are owned by pri\\ate individuals or companies and operated for profit. Private enterprise is always mixed, as in the United States, with cooperative enterprise (such as churches, tlie family), and with government enterprise (the post office, waterworks, public schools, police). Proletarian (economics, sociology). A member of a class of people without property or of wage earners without capital. ( The word may also be used as an adjecti\\e. ) Proletariat: Proletarians collectively; the proletarian class. Protective Tariff (economics, political science). A tax on imports designed to aid domestic producers by reducing foreign competition in the home market. It may be \"competitive\" (designed to equalize costs of producing foreign products with costs of Amer- ican products) or \"prohibitive\" (so high that foreign goods are excluded entirely). Protective System, Protection (economics). The theory, policy, or method of favoring or imposing protective tariffs Quantity Theory of Money (economics). The quantity theory of money as presented on p. 430 (and as understood by proponents of greenbacks and of free silver) is incomplete. It leaves out two important economic factors: ( 1 ) Credit, which today serves much more often than money as a medium of exchange. Credit stands for money, as can be seen when a person pays or is paid by bank check rather than by cash. Credit is created by banks when they make loans. (2) Velocity, the speed at which money and credit pass from hand to hand. To the simple equation P =-Jp-, we must first add credit ( which we will call M' since it is inter- im II n, ^ I. M + M' changeable with money) so; I — = . Tlien we work in velocity of money ( — V ) and of credit (—V'), which has a multiplying effect, to get the complete equation; P = = . Race (anthropology, sociology). A subdivision of the species of mankind, the members of which have cer- tain distinguishing hereditar>' physical characteristics, sucli as different skin and facial features. Scientists recognize diree principal races— Caucasian, Mongo- loid, and Negroid— althoiigli no race is \"pure.\" So far, no reputable scientific study has found any dif- ferences in intelligence or behavior among races. The term race has also been used to describe ethnic or even language groups. Hitler, for instance, described Gennans as members of the \"Aryan race.\" Republic (political science). A state in which sovereign power lies with a body of citizens who elect their rulers. ,\\ republic may or may not be a democracy, according to what proportion of the population has the franchise. Republican (politics). Referring to one of the two major parties in the United States today. ( See pp. 326, 329, 439-140.) The term refers also to the political party founded by Jefferson and Madison (see pp. 180, 184-185). Revenue Tariff (economics, political science). .\\ tariff designed cliiefly to earn income for the go\\ernment, although revenue tariffs protect certain .\\merican in- dustries just as protecti\\e tariffs earn income for the government. During its early years, the U.S. gov- ernment received most of its income from revenue tariffs. The difference between revenue tariffs and protective tariffs is in emphasis. Revolution (economics, political science, sociology). A fundamental change in political or economic organ- ization or in social or intellectual attitudes. The term is used to describe a wide variety of political events, ranging from the revolt of the .American colonies to the French, Russian, and Chinese re\\olutions, to the frequent but non-radic;d upheavals in some Latin- American countries. The Industrial Revolution is more properI\\' termed an evolution. The gradual advance in technology that characterized it has in turn wrought profound cultural changes, such as the growth of great cities— \"the urban revolution.\" The term is 790"},{"pageNumber":747,"pageContent":"often used loosely (\"the teen-age revolution\"). Secede {political science). To withdraw from an organ- ization or federation. Secession {political science). The act of withdrawing from an organization. Sedition {political science). Inciting illegal or revolu- tionary opposition to established authority, either through speech or writing. Socialism {economics, political science). A theory or policy of control of the means of production and distribution, usually through the government. Like communism, the term has been used to describe a variety of theories and activities. One can say, for instance, that the United States Post Office is a socialist enterprise. So was the Erie Canal. The term socialism may also be applied to welfare services, such as social security and Medicare. Generally, how- ever, theoretical socialists wish to go much farther and place under governmental control all manufac- turing, transportation, commerce, and agriculture. Sovereignty {political science). Supreme political au- thority or power. Thus, the government of the United States nearly broke apart because the states retained their sovereignty. Under the Constitution, however, an attempt was made to divide sovereignty between the states and the federal government, the latter being supreme within its sphere. Strategy {military science). The over-all planning of a military campaign or a war, sometimes as opposed to tactics, whicli concern the planning of a limited operation in detail. Thus, \"The strategy of the York- town campaign involved cooperation of a French fleet from the West Indies, a French army from Newport, and Washington's army from near New York. \" See also Tactics.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that man- kind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves bv abolishing the forms to which thev are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Govern- ment, and to provide new Guards for their future security.— Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Sys- tems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establi.shment of an absolute TvTanny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be sub- mitted to a candid world.— He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and neces- ' Jefferson in his original draft of the Declaration (see f. 58) used \"inalien*il»le.\" When the document w. in the official version, the word became \"unalienable.\" sary for the public good.— He has forbidden his Governors to pass La\\ys of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.— He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Repre- sentation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.— He has 1 called together legislati\\e bodies at places un- usual, uncomfortable, and distant from the deposi- tory of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his meas- ures.— He has dissolved Representative Houses re- peatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasion on the rights of the people.— He has re- fused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legisla- tive powers, incapable of Annihilation, have re- turned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and con\\'ulsions within.— He has endeavoured to pre- vent the population of these States; for that pur- pose obstructing the Laws of Natiualization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.— He has ob- structed the Administration of Justice, h\\ refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.— He has made Judges dependent on his \\\\'i]l alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.— He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.— He has kept among us, in times of peace.

Friends and Fellow-Citizens: Called upon to undertake the duties of the first executive office of our country, I a\\'ail myself of the presence of that portion of my fellow-citizens which is here assembled to express my grateful thanks for the favor with which they ha\\'e been pleased to look toward me, to declare a sincere consciousness that the task is above my talents, and that I approach it with those an.xious and awful presentiments which the greatness of the charge and the weakness of my powers so justly inspire. A rising nation, spread over a wide and fruitful land, traversing all the seas with the rich productions of their industr\\% engaged in com- merce with nations who feel power and forget right, advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye— when 1 contemplate these transcendent objects, and see the honor, the hap- piness, and the hopes of this beloved country committed to the issue and the auspices of this day, 1 shrink from the contemplation, and humble myself before the magnitude of the undertaking. Utterly, indeed, should I despair did not the presence of many whom I see here remind me that in the other high authorities provided by our Constitution I shall find resources of wisdom, of virtue, and of zeal on which to rely under all difficulties. To vou, then, gentlemen, who are charged with the sovereign functions of legisla- tion, and to those associated with you, I look \\\\'ith encouragement for that guidance and support which may enable us to steer with safety the vessel in which we all embarked amidst the con- flicting elements of a troubled world. During the contest of opinion through which we have passed the animation of discussions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might impose on strangers unused to think freely and to speak and to write what they think; but this being now decided by the voice of the nation, announced according to the rules of the Consti- tution, all will, of course, arrange themselves under the will of the law, and imite in common efforts for the common good. All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that though the will of the majorit\\- is in all cases to prevail, that will to be rightful must be reasonable; that the minor- ity possess their equal rights, which equal law must protect, and to violate would be oppression. Let us, then, fellow-citizens, unite with one heart and one mind. Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection v\\athout which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things. And let us reflect that, having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered, we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as des- potic, as wicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions. During the throes and con- vulsions of the ancient world, during the agoniz- ing spasms of infuriated man, seeking through blood and slaughter his long-lost liberty, it was not wonderful that the agitation of the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful shore; that this should be more felt and feared by some and less by others, and should divide opinions as to measures of safety. But even- difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans, we are all Fed- eralists. If there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this Union or to change its repub- lican form, let them stand undisturbed as monu- ments of die safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it. I know, indeed, that some honest men fear that a republican government can not be strong, that this Government is not strong enough; but would the honest patriot, in the full tide of successful experiment, abandon a goxernment which has so far kept us free and firm on the theoretic and visionary fear that this Go\\ernment, the w^orld's best hope, may by possibility want energy to preserve itself? I trust not. I believe this, on the contrary, the strongest Government on earth. I beliexe it the onlv one where every man, at the call of the law, would fly to the stand- ard of the law, and would meet in\\asions of the public order as his own personal concern. Some- times it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the go\\ernment of others? Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let history answer this question. Let us, then, with courage and confidence pur- sue our own Federal and Republic;iii principles, our attachment to union and rejircsontative gov- 801"},{"pageNumber":758,"pageContent":"emment. Kindly separated by nature and a wide ocean from the exterminating havoc of one quar- ter of the globe; too high-minded to endure the degradations of the others; possessing a chosen country, with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth generation; enter- taining a due sense of our equal right to the use of our ow'n faculties, to the acquisitions of our own industry, to honor and confidence from our fellow-citizens, resulting not from birth, but from our actions and their sense of them; enlightened by a benign religion, professed, indeed, and prac- ticed in various forms, yet all of them inculcating honesty, truth, temperance, gratitude, and the lo\\'e of man; acknowledging and adoring an over- ruling Providence, which by all its dispensations proves that it delights in the happiness of man here and his greater happiness hereafter— with all these blessings, what more is necessary to make us a happy and a prosperous people? Still one thing more, fellow-citizens— a wise and frugal Govern- ment, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regu- late their own pursuits of industry and improve- ment, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government, and this is necessary to close the circle of our felicities. About to enter, fellow-citizens, on the exercise of duties which comprehend everything dear and valuable to you, it is proper you should under- stand what I deem the essential principles of our Government, and consequently those which ought to shape its Administration. I will compress them within the narrowest compass they will bear, stat- ing the general principle, but not all its limita- tions. Equal and exact justice to all men, of what- ever state or persuasion, religious or political; peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none; the sup- port of the State governments in all their rights, as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks against anti-republican tendencies; the preservation of the General Government in its whole constitutional vigor, as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad; a jealous care of the right of election by the people— a mild and safe corrective of abuses which are lopped by the sword of revo- lution where peaceable remedies are unprovided; absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the ma- jority, the vital principle of republics, from which is no appeal but to force, the vital principle and immediate parent of despotism; a well-disciplined militia, our best reliance in peace and for the first moments of war, till regulars may relieve them; the supremacy of the civil over the military authoritv'; economv in the public expense, that labor may be lightly burthened; the honest pay- ment of our debts and sacred preservation of the public faith; encouragement of agriculture, and of commerce as its handmaid; the diffusion of information and arraignment of all abuses at the bar of the public reason; freedom of religion; free- dom of the press, and freedom of person under the protection of the habeas corpus, and trial by juries impartially selected. . . . These principles form the bright constellation which has gone before us and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation. The wisdom of our sages and the blood of our heroes have been de- voted to their attainment. They should be the creed of our political faith, the text of civic instruc- tion, the touchstone by which to trv the services of those we trust; and should we wander from them in moments of error or of alarm, let us hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road which alone leads to peace, liberty, and safety. THE MONROE DOCTRINE Extracts from President Monroe's Seventh Annual Message to Congress, December 2, 1823 (See pp. 237-240) ... At the proposal of the Russian Imperial Government, made tlirough the minister of the Emperor residing here, a full power and instruc- tions have been transmitted to the minister of the United States at St. Petersburg to arrange by amicable negotiation the respective rights and interests of the two nations on the northwest coast of this continent. ... In the discussions to which this interest has given rise and in the arrangements 802"},{"pageNumber":759,"pageContent":"bv which thev may terminate the occasion has been judged proper for asserting, as a principle in which the rights and interests of the United States are involved, that the American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization bv anv European powers. . . . It was stated at the commencement of the last session that a great effort was then making in Spain and Portugal to improve the condition of the people of those countries, and that it appeared to be conducted with extraordinary moderation. It need scarcelv be remarked that the result has been so far ver\\' different from what was then anticipated. Of events in that quarter of the globe, uith which we have so much intercourse and from which we derive our origin, we have always been anxious and interested spectators. The citi- zens of the United States cherish sentiments the most friendlv in fa\\or of the libert\\' and happiness of their fellow-men on that side of the Atlantic. In the wars of the European powers in matters relating to themsehes we ha\\'e never taken any part, nor does it comport with our policv so to do. It is onlv when our rights are invaded or seriously menaced that we resent injuries or make prepara- tion for our defense. With the mo\\'ements in this hemisphere we are of necessity more immediately connected, and bv causes which must be obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers. The political system of the allied powers is essentially different in this respect from that of America. This difference proceeds from that which exists in their respective Governments; and to the defense of our own, which has been achieved by the loss of so much blood and treasure, and matured by the wisdom of their most enlightened citizens, and under which we have enjoyed unexampled felic- ity, this whole nation is devoted. We owe it, therefore, to candor and to the amicable relations existing between the United States and those powers to declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safet)'. With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power we have not interfered and shall not interfere. But with the Governments who have declared their independ- ence and maintained it, and whose independence we have, on great consideration and on just prin- ciples, acknowledged, we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any other manner their destiny, by any European power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States. In the war between those new Governments and Spain we declared our neutrality at the time of their recognition, and to this we have adhered, and shall continue to adhere, provided no change shall occur which, in the judgment of the competent authorities of this Government, shall make a corresponding change on the part of the United States indispensable to their security. . . . Our policy in regard to Europe, which was adopted at an earlv stage of the wars which have so long agitated that quarter of the globe, nevertheless remains the same, which is, not to interfere in the internal concerns of auN- of its powers; to consider the government de facto as the legitimate government for us; to culti\\ate friendly relations with it, and to preserve those relations by a frank, firm, and manh' policv, meet- ing in all instances the just claims of e\\'ery power, submitting to injuries from none. But in regard to those continents circumstances are eminently and conspicuously different. It is impossible that the alhed powers should extend their political sys- tem to any portion of either continent without endangering our peace and happiness; nor can anyone believe that our southern brethren, if left to themselves, would adopt it of their own accord. It is equallv impossible, therefore, that we should behold such interposition in anv form with indif- ference. If we look to the comparative strength and resources of Spain and those new Govern- ments, and their distance from each other, it must be obvious that she can never subdue them. It is still the true policy of the United States to leave the parties to themselves, in the hope that other powers will pursue the same course. . . . 803"},{"pageNumber":760,"pageContent":"LINCOLN'S SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS March 4, 1865 (See pp. 364-365.) FeUow-Countrijmen-.—M. this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, dur- ing which public declarations have been con- stantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory' and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured. On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiousK' directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, a'l sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to sating the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war— seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survi\\e, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came. One eighth of the whole population was colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful inter- est. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the mag- nitude or the duration which it has already at- tained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the con- flict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be an- swered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. \"Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man bv whom the offense cometh.\" If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time. He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this ter- rible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any de- parture from those divine attributes which the believers in a li\\ing God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fift}' years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, \"The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\" With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations. 804"},{"pageNumber":761,"pageContent":"POPULIST PARTY PLATFORM July 4, 1892 (See pp. 455-457.)

First.— That the union of the labor forces of the United States this day consummated shall be permanent and perpetual; may its spirit enter into all hearts for the salvation of the Republic and the uplifting of mankind. Second.— Wealth belongs to him who creates it, and every dollar taken from industry without an equivalent is robbery. \"If any will not work, neither shall he eat.\" The interests of rural and civil labor are the same; their enemies are identical.

We demand that postal savings banks be established by the government for the safe deposit of the earnings of the people and to facilitate exchange.

WILSON'S FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS March 4, 1913 (See pp. 517-518.) My Fellow Citizens: There has been a change of government. It began two years ago, when the House of Repre- sentatives became Democratic b\\' a decisive major- ity. It has now been completed. The Senate about to assemble will also be Democratic. The offices of President and \\'ice-President have been put into the hands of Democrats. What does the change mean? That is the question that is uppermost in our minds to-day. That is the question I am going to trv to answer, in order, if I may, to interpret the occasion. It means much more than the mere success of a party. The success of a party means little except when the Nation is using that party for a large and definite purpose. No one can mistake the pur- pose for which the Nation now seeks to use the Democratic Part)'. It seeks to use it to interpret a change in its own plans and point of view. . . . We see that in many things that life is very great. It is incomparably great in its material aspects, in its body of wealth, in the diversity and sweep of its energ\\', in the industries which have been conceived and built up by the genius of individual men and the limitless enterprise of groups of men. It is great, also, very great, in its moral force. Nowhere else in the world have noble men and women exhibited in more striking forms the beauty and the energv of svmpath^' and helpfulness and counsel in their efforts to rectify wTong, alleviate suffering, and set the weak in the way of strength and hope. We have built up. moreo\\er. a great system of government, which has stood through a long age as in many respects a model for those who seek to set liberty upon foundations that will endure against fortuitous change, against storm and accident. Our life contains ever)' great thing, and contains it in rich abundance. But the evil has come with the good, and much fine gold has been corroded. With riches has come inexcusable waste. We have squandered a great part of what we might ha\\e used, and have not stopped to conserve the exceeding bounty of nature, without which our genius for enterprise would have been v\\'orthless and impotent, scorn- ing to be careful, shamefully prodigal as well as admirably efficient. We have been proud of our industrial achievements, but we have not hitherto stopped thoughtfulK' enough to count the human cost, the cost of lives snuffed out, of energies over- taxed and broken, the fearful physical and spiritual cost to the men and women and children upon whom the dead weight and burden of it all has fallen pitilessly the \\'ears tlirough. The groans and agony of it all had not yet reached our ears, the 806"},{"pageNumber":763,"pageContent":"solemn, moving undertone of our life, coming up out of the mines and factories and out of every home where the struggle had its intimate and familiar seat. With the great Government went many deep secret things which we too long de- laved to look into and scrutinize with candid, fear- less eyes. The great Government we loved has too often been made use of for private and selfish purposes, and those who used it had forgotten the people. At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and vital. With this vision we approach new affairs. Our dutv is to cleanse, to reconsider, to restore, to correct the evil without impairing the good, to purify and humanize every process of our common life without weakening or sentimentalizing it. There has been something crude and heartless and unfeeling in our haste to succeed and be great. Our thought has been \"Let every man look out for himself, let every generation look out for itself,\" while we reared giant machinery which made it impossible that any but those who stood at the levers of control should have a chance to look out for themselves. We had not forgotten our morals. We remembered well enough that we had set up a policy which was meant to serve the humblest as well as the most powerful, with an eye single to the standards of justice and fair play, and remembered it with pride. But we were very heedless and in a hurry to be great. We have come now to the sober second thought. The scales of heedlessness have fallen from our eyes. We have made up our minds to square every process of our national life again with the stand- ards we so proudlv set up at the beginning and have always carried at our hearts. Our work is a work of restoration. We have itemized with some degree of particu- larity the things that ought to be altered and here are some of the chief items: A tariff which cuts us off from our proper part in the commerce of the world, violates the just principles of taxation, and makes the Government a facile instrument in the hands of private interests; a banking and currencv system based upon the necessity of the Govern- ment to sell its bonds fifty years ago and perfectly adapted to concentrating cash and restricting credits; an industrial .system which, take it on all its sidfs, financial as well as administrative, holds capital in leading strings, restricts the liberties and limits the opportunities of labor, and exploits without renewing or conserving the natural re- sources of the country; a body of agricultural activities never yet given the efficiency of great business undertakings or served as it should be through the instrumentalitv of science taken di- rectly to the farm, or afforded the facilities of credit best suited to its practical needs; water- courses undeveloped, waste places unreclaimed, forests untended, fast disappearing without plan or prospect of renewal, unregarded waste heaps at every mine. We have studied as perhaps no other nation has the most effective means of production, but we have not studied cost or econ- omy as we should either as organizers of industry, as statesmen, or as individuals. Nor have we studied and perfected the means by which government may be put at the service of humanity, in safeguarding the health of the Nation, the health of its men and its women and its children, as well as their rights in the struggle for existence. This is no sentimental duty. The firm basis of government is justice, not pity. These are matters of justice. There can be no equality or opportunity, the first essential of justice in the body politic, if men and women and children be not shielded in their lives, their very vitality, from the consequences of great industrial and social processes which thev can not alter, control, or singly cope with. Society must see to it that it does not itself crush or weaken or damage its own con- stituent parts. The first duty of law is to keep sound the society it serves. Sanitary laws, pure food laws, and laws determining conditions of labor which individuals are powerless to deter- mine for themselves are intimate parts of the very business of justice and legal efficiency. These are some of the things we ought to do, and not leave the others undone, the old-fashioned, never-to-be-neglected, fundamental safeguarding of property and of individual right. This is the high enterprise of the new day: To lift everything that concerns our life as a Nation to the light that shines from the hearthfire of every man's con- science and vision of the right. It is inconceivable that we should do this as partisans; it is incon- ceivable we should do it in ignorance of the facts as thev are or in blind haste. We shall restore, not 807"},{"pageNumber":764,"pageContent":"destroy. We shall deal with our economic system as it is and it may be modified, not as it might be if we had a clean sheet of paper to write upon; and step bv step we shall make it what it should be, in the spirit of those who ques- tion their own wisdom and seek counsel and knowledge, not shallow self-satisfaction or the ex- citement of excursions whither they can not tell. Justice, and only justice, shall always be our motto. . . . This is not a day of triumph; it is a day of dedi- cation. Here muster, not the forces of party, but the forces of humanity. Men's hearts wait upon us; men's lives hang in the balance; men's hopes call upon us to say what we will do. Who shall live up to the great trust? Who dares fail to try? I summon all honest men, all patriotic, all forward- looking men, to my side. God helping me, I will not fail them, if they will but counsel and sus- tain me! THE PHILOSOPHY OF RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM Speech by Herbert Hoover, New York City, October 22, 1928 (See p. 593.) This campaign now draws near a close. The platforms of the two parties defining principles and offering solutions of various national problems have been presented and are being earnestly con- sidered by our people. . . . In mv acceptance speech I endeavored to out- line the spirit and ideals by which I would be guided in carrying that platform into administra- tion. Tonight I will not deal with the multitude of issues which have been already well canvassed. I intend rather to discuss some of those more funda- mental principles and ideals upon which I believe the government of the United States should be conducted. After the war, when the Republican party assumed administration of the country, we were faced with the problem of determination of the very nature of our national life. During one hun- dred and fifty years we have builded up a form of self-government and a social system which is pecuharly our own. It differs essentially from all others in the world. It is the American system. It is just as definite and positive a political and social system as has ever been developed on earth. It is founded upon a particular conception of self- government in which decentralized local responsi- bility is the very base. Further than this, it is founded upon the conception that only through ordered liberty, freedom, and equal opportunity to the individual will his initiative and enterprise spur on the march of progress. And in our insist- ence upon equality of opportunity has our system advanced bevond all the world. During the war we necessarily turned to the government to solve every difficult economic prob- lem. The government having absorbed every energy of our people for war, tliere was no other solution. For the preservation of the state the Fed- eral Government became a centralized despotism which undertook unprecedented responsibilities, assumed autocratic powers, and took over the busi- ness of citizens. To a large degree we regimented our whole people temporarily into a socialistic state. However justified in time of war if continued in peace-time it would destroy not only our Amer- ican system but with it our progress and freedom as well. When the war closed, the most vital of all issues both in our own country and throughout the world was whether governments should con- tinue their wartime ownership and operation of many instrumentalities of production and distribu- tion. We were challenged with a peace-time choice between the American system of rugged individu- alism and a European philosophy of diametrically opposed doctrines— doctrines of paternalism and state socialism. The acceptance of these ideas would have meant the destruction of self-govern- ment through centralization of government. It would have meant the undermining of the indi- vidual initiative and enterprise through which our people have grown to unparalleled greatness. . . . When the Repubfican party came into full power it went at once resolutely back to our fundamental conception of the state and the rights and responsibilities of the individual. Thereby it"},{"pageNumber":765,"pageContent":"restored confidence and hope in the American people, it freed and stimulated enterprise, it re- stored the government to its position as an umpire instead of a player in the economic game. For these reasons the American people have gone for- ward in progress while the rest of the world has halted, and some countries have even gone back- wards. If anyone vvUl study the causes of retarded recuperation in Europe, he will find much of it due to stifling of private initiative on one hand, and overloading of the government with business on the other. There has been revived in this campaign, how- ever, a series of proposals which, if adopted, would be a long step toward the abandonment of our American system and a surrender to the de- structive operation of goverrmiental conduct of commercial business. Because the country is faced with difficulty and doubt over certain national problems— that is, prohibition, farm relief, and electrical power— our opponents propose that we must thrust government a long way into the busi- nesses which give rise to these problems. In effect, they abandon the tenets of their own party and turn to state socialism as a solution for the diffi- culties presented by all three. It is proposed that we shall change from prohibition to the state pur- chase and sale of liquor. If their agricultural relief program means anything, it means that the gov- ernment shall directly or indirectly buy and sell and fix prices of agricultural products. And we are to go into the hydroelectric power business. In other words, we are confronted with a huge pro- gram of government in business. There is, therefore, submitted to the American people a question of fundamental principle. That is: shall we depart from the principles of our American political and economic system, upon which we have advanced beyond all tlie rest of the world, in order to adopt methods based on prin- ciples destructive of its very foundations? I should like to state to vou the effect that this projection of government in business would have upon our system of self-government and our eco- nomic system. That effect would reach to the daily life of evers' man and woman. It would impair the very basis of liberty and freedom not only for those left outside the fold of expanded bureaucracy but for those embraced within it. Let us first see the effect upon self-government. When the Federal Government undertakes to go into commercial business it must at once set up the organization and administration of that busi- ness, and it immediately finds itself in a labyrinth, every alley of which leads to the destruction of self-government. Commercial business requires a concentration of responsibility. Self-government requires decen- trahzation and many checks and balances to safe- guard liberty. Our Government to succeed in busi- ness would need to become in effect a despotism. There at once begins the destruction of self- government. . . . It is a false liberahsm that interprets itself into the government operation of commercial business. Every step of bureaucratizing of the business of our country poisons the very roots of liberalism— that is, political equality, free speech, free assem- bly, free press, and equality of opportunity. It is the road not to more liberty, but to less liberty. Liberalism should be found not striving to spread bureaucracy but striving to set bounds to it. . . . Liberalism is a force truly of the spirit, a force proceeding from the deep realization that eco- nomic freedom cannot be sacrificed if political freedom is to be preserved. Even if Governmental conduct of business could give us more efficiency instead of less efficiency, the fundamental objec- tion to it would remain unaltered and unabated. It would destroy political equality. It would increase rather than decrease abuse and corrup- tion. It would stifle initiative and invention. It would undermine the development of leader- ship. It would cramp and cripple the mental and spiritual energies of our people. It would extin- guish equalitv and opportunits'. It would dry up the spirit of liberty and progress. For these reasons primarily it must be resisted. For a hundred and fifty years liberalism has found its true spirit in the American system, not in the European systems. I do not wish to be misunderstood in this state- ment. I am defining a general policy. It does not mean that our government is to part with one iota of its national resources without complete protec- tion to the public interest. I have already stated that where the government is engaged in public works for puq^oses of flood control, of navigation, of irrigation, of scientific research or national de- 809"},{"pageNumber":766,"pageContent":"fense, or in pioneering a new art, it will at times necessarily produce power or commodities as a by-product. But thev must be a by-product of the major purpose, not the major purpose itself. Nor do I wish to be misinterpreted as believing that the United States is free-for-all and devil- take-the-hindmost. The vers' essence of equality of opportunity and of American individualism is that there shall be no domination by any group or combination in this republic, whether it be busi- ness or pohtical. On the contrarv, it demands eco- nomic justice as well as political and social justice. It is no system of laissez faire. I feel deeply on this subject because during the war I had some practical experience with govern- mental operation and control. I have witnessed not onlv at home but abroad the many failures of government in business. I have seen its t)Tannies, its injustices, its destructions of self-government, its undermining of the ver)' instincts which carry our people forward to progress. I have witnessed the lack of advance, the lowered standards of liv- ing, the depressed spirits of people working under such a system. My objection is based not upon theory or upon a failure to recognize \\\\Tong or abuse, but I know the adoption of such methods would strike at the very roots of American life and would destroy the very basis of American prog- ress. . . . And what have been the results of the Ameri- can system? Our country has become the land of opportunity' to those born without inheritance, not merelv because of the wealth of its resources and industry but because of this freedom of initi- ative and enterprise. Russia has natural resources equal to ours. Her people are equally industrious, but she has not had the blessings of one hundred and fifty years of our form of government and our social system. By adherence to the principles of decentralized self-government, ordered liberty, equal oppor- tunity, and freedom to the individual, our Ameri- can e.\\periment in human welfare has yielded a degree of well-being unparalleled in all the world. It has come nearer to the abolition of povertv, to the abolition of fear of want, than humanity has ever reached before. Progress of the past seven years is the proof of it. This alone furnishes the answer to our opponents, who ask us to introduce destructive elements into the system by which this has been accomplished. . . . I have endeavored to present to you that the greatness of America has grown out of a political and social system and a method of control of eco- nomic forces distinctlv its own— our American system— which has carried this great experiment in human welfare farther than ever before in all his- tory. We are nearer today to the ideal of the aboli- tion of povert)' and fear from the lives of men and women than ever before in any land. And I again repeat that the departure from our American sys- tem by injecting principles destructive to it which our opponents propose, will jeopardize the very liberty and freedom of our people, and will destroy equality of opportunity not alone to ourselves but to our children. . . . F. D. ROOSEVELT'S FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS March 4, 1933 (See pp. 609-610.) President Hoover, Mr. Chief Justice, my friends: This is a day of national consecration, and I am certain that my fellow-Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency I will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our nation impels. This is pre-eminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So first of all let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself— nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leader- ship of frankness and vigor has met with that 810"},{"pageNumber":767,"pageContent":"understanding and support of the people them- selves which is essential to victory. I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days. In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things. Values have shrunken to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our ability to pay has fallen, government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income; the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers find no markets for their prod- uce; the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone. More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment. Yet our distress comes from no failure of sub- stance. We are stricken by no plague of locusts. Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for. Nature still ofi^ers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply. Primarily, this is because the rulers of the ex- change of mankind's goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incom- petence, have admitted their failure and abdi- cated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men. True, they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit, they have proposed only the lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence. They know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish. The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit. Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. The joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits. These dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true des- tiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellovvmen. Recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit; and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing. Small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacred- ness of obligations, on faithful protection, on un- selfish performance. Without them it cannot live. Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This nation asks for action, and action now. Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accomplished in part by direct recruit- ing by the government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accom- lishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources. Hand in hand with this, we must frankly rec- ognize the overbalance of population in our indus- trial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in the redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land. The task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities. It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss, through fore- closure, of our small homes and our farms. It can be helped by insistence that the Federal, 811"},{"pageNumber":768,"pageContent":"State and local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced. It can be helped by the unifying of relief activi- ties which today are often scattered, uneconomical and unequal. It can be helped by national plan- ning for and supervision of all forms of transpor- tation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character. There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it. We must act, and act quickly. Finally, in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order; there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments; there must be an end to speculation with other people's money, and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency. These are the lines of attack. I shall presently urge upon a new Congress in special session de- tailed measures for their fulfillment, and I shall seek the immediate assistance of the several States. Through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making income balance outgo. Our international trade relations, though vastly important, are, in point of time and necessity, secondarv to the establishment of a sound national economy. I favor as a practical policy the putting of first things first. I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment, but the emergency at home cannot wait. . . . In the field of world policy I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor— the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others— the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors. If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize as we have never before, our inter- dependence on each other; that we cannot merely take, but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because, without such discipline, no progress is made, no leadership becomes effec- tive. . . . Action in this image and to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors. Our Constitution is so simple and practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form. That is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has produced. It has met every stress of vast expansion of territorv, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, or world relations. It is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority mav be whollv adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us. But it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for tem- porary departure from that normal balance of public procedure. I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require. These measures, or such other measures as the Congress may build out of its experience and wisdom, I shall seek, within mv constitutional authority, to bring to speedy adoption. But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two courses, and in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of dutv that will then confront me. I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis— broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency as great as the power that would be given me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe. . . . We do not distrust the future of essential democracv. The people of the United States have not failed. In their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct, vigorous action. They have asked for disciphne and direction under leadership. They have made me the present instrument of their wishes. In the spirit of the gift I take it. In this dedication of a nation we humbly ask the blessing of God. May He protect each and every one of us! May He guide me in the days to come! 812"},{"pageNumber":769,"pageContent":"JOHN F. KENNEDY'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS January 20, 1961 (See p. 749.) We obsen'e today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom— symbolizing an end as well as a beginning— signifying renewal as well as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago. The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abohsh all forms of human po\\erty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe— the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God. We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans- bom in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heri- tage—and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world. Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of libert)'. This much we pledge— and more. To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United, there is little we cannot do in a host of new cooperative ventures. Divided, there is little we can do— for we dare not meet a powerful chal- lenge at odds and split asunder. To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always e.xpect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly sup- porting their own freedom— and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside. To those peoples in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required— not be- cause the Communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it can- not save the few who are rich. To our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge— to convert our good words into good deeds— in a new alliance for progress— to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty. But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers. Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. And let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house. To that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instru- ments of peace, we renew our pledge of support- to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective- to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak— and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run. Finally, to those nations who would make them- selves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction un- leashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction. We dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed. But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course- both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that un- certain balance of terror that stays the hand of man- kind's final war. 813"},{"pageNumber":770,"pageContent":"So let us begin anew— remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is alwav's subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate. Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us. Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms— and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all na- tions. Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us ex- plore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate di- sease, tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce. Let both sides unite to heed in all comers of the earth the command of Isaiah— to \"undo the heavy burdens . . . [and] let the oppressed go free.\" And if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungles of suspicion, let both sides join in creat- ing a new endeavor— not a new balance of power, but a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved. All this will not be finished in the first 100 days. Nor will it be finished in the first 1,000 days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin. In your hands, my fellow citizens, mo-e than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimonv to its national loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service are found around the globe. Now the trumpet summons us again— not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need— not as a call to battle, though embattled we are— but a call to bear the burden of a long Uvilight struggle, year in and year out, \"rejoicing in hope, patient in tribu- lation\"— a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself. Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, north and south, east and west, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic efFort? In the long history of the world, only a few genera- tions have been granted the role of defending free- dom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibilit)'— I welcome it. I do not be- lie\\e that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this en- deavor will light our country and all who ser\\'e it— and the glow from that fire can truly light the world. And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you— ask what you can do for your country. My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man. Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us the same high stand- ards of strengths and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own. 814"},{"pageNumber":771,"pageContent":"S^^dex Entries marked with • refer to the themes given in the Prologue pp. xi-xiii and the Epilogue pp. 782-783.
