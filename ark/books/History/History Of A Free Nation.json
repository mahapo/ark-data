the hundreds of pages that follow — with their thousands of scenes, characters, and ideas — you have every right to ask some questions: So what? What of it? Why should I work hard at teaching myself history? There are many possible answers. Your teachers will have some; the authors of this book will have some. But think about this: you teach yourself history to give yourself certain gifts that nobody will ever be able to take away from you, no matter how long you live, no matter what happens to you. What gifts? First, the power of judgment, of good sense about yourself and others, that comes from having many experiences in life and taking time to think about them. Some call it maturity, or growing up. Mainly, of course, we grow up from what happens to us in person — in the family, in school, on the street, at work or play, from our own joy and pain. But there are other human experiences we need to know that we can never have in person. By extending your experi- ence through history, you can at least know something of what it meant to be an explorer, a missionary, a slave, a soldier at Gettysburg, a scared child at Ellis Island, a farm woman in the Depression. Without the power to compare your life with others, you cannot know who you are, how your world got to be the way it is, or what choices you have before you. The second gift, or power, you gain from studying history is freedom of choice itself. What will you believe? What will you try to do with your life? You can have freedom to choose only by knowing the many ways citizens in the past have thought and acted upon their political, economic, and social problems, and the many private paths they have taken to pursue their own integrity, creativity, and happiness. In sum, teaching yourself history sets you free to question and to judge for yourself everything you hear, see, and read — including, to be sure, everything you read in history books. Not teaching yourself history leaves you as powerless to judge and to choose as if you had lost your own memory. So think seriously about giving yourself the gifts of history, and read on. — Paul A.

The Navaho arrived in the Southwest around A. D. 1000. They were an enterprising people who depended on farming and hunting for survival.

El Inca, 1608 Section Focus The first people to come to the Ameri- cas are called native Americans or Indi- ans. After adapting to their new home, they formed many rich and diverse cul- tures over time. Some ot these cultures became elaborate empires, while others remained simple in organization. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the origins and paths of settle- ment of the first immigrants to the Americas. • Compare the Indian cultures in Mexico and South America to those in North America. Twenty thousand years ago, much of the water in today's oceans was frozen in glaciers. Huge glaciers covered much of what is now Canada and the northern United States. Scientists today believe that people from Asia walked across a \"land bridge\" that once connected Alaska and Asia. They did not come all at once or together but in waves often hundreds or thousands of years apart. Most were groups of several families, following great herds of game animals. As these groups reached North America, they moved south along the coasts and mountain valleys. As waves of people continued to come, the people before them moved on to new places and spread out across the land. These waves continued until about 12,000 years ago when rising seawater destroyed the land bridge and separated the continents of Asia and North America. Not all these people looked alike or were closely related; but short or tall, stocky or thin, they were all Asian and had common characteristics, such as straight black hair and skin ranging from coppery red to yellow-brown. They gathered wild plants and hunted large animals — horses, mammoths, giant sloths, and beaver. Their spear points have been found with the bones of many animals now extinct in America: mastodons, tapirs, and giant bison. In addition to these and other large ani- mals, the people hunted the smaller deer, antelope, elk, and bison. Groups of these first Americans moved slowly south until they reached the tip of South America. Over time, these people adapted to their \"New World\" environ- ment and became the peoples known today as native Americans. For many thousands of years these peo- ple lived in bands of hunter-gatherers, adapting to the land or moving on. Often they became so close to their land that they came to believe that they had always been there. The Lakota Sioux of the Great Plains said: . . . Our legends tell us that it was hundreds and perhaps thousands of years ago since the first man sprang from the soil in the midst of the great plains . . . so far as we know our people have been born and died on this plain and no people have shared it with us 10 Unit 1 A New World: Prehistory- 1756"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Connections H I S T O R Y Prehistory and Archaeology Collectors of Indian relics buy and sell arrowheads, spear points, and bits of pot- tery and jewelry for prices ranging from 50 cents for common arrowheads to hun- dreds of thousands of dollars for rare ancient specimens. Native Americans and archaeologists object to this practice. They claim that \"pothunters\" destroy Americans' historic legacy and that an iso- A N D Science lated artifact can add little to the under- standing of prehistoric cultures. Although archaeologists \"destroy\" a site as they excavate, they observe and note details about the placement ot each object. Their observations, combined with scientific techniques of dating and classification, can tell much about a par- ticular culture. They can determine how people got their food, whether they built permanent homes, what they used to make tools, and whether they traded with others. Theories can then be developed about a culture's ideas and beliefs. This helps to preserve the prehistoric culture, even though the artifacts have been removed from their original sites. One pothunter in Kentucky has given up collecting. \"This is everybody's histo- ry,\" he says. \"It shouldn't be for personal profit. Don't dig,\" he urges. \"You destroy history when you do. \" fifllflll Making the Science Connection 1 .

In South America groups of these people moved onto the dry seacoast ot Peru and Ecuador. By harvesting the rich ocean waters and farming the river valleys, they developed a more complicated culture. By about 1000 B.c:., they and the moun- tain peoples above them began to draw together the abundance of the jungles and sea. From the jungles they got dyes and medicine. These peoples had a gift for farming moLUitainsidcs, cultivating potatoes, peanuts, squash, and beans. With their great knowledge of meralwork, they became fine engineers who buih great canals and cities. Some of these peoples had cities larger than cities of F.urope at the time — with canals, pyra- mids, temples, markets, even biueaucrats and taxes.

Because these people had no written language, however, precise knowledge of their histo- ry is uncertain. The last of these great empires in the Andes was the Inca. The Inca were a mountain culture, who, 100 years before Columbus, united South America from its northern coast to the middle of Chile. They had central government, a vast road system, trade networks, irrigation canals, and sets of government storehouses to feed and supply people in case of disasters. To the north, in the area called Mesoamerica — Central Mexico and Cen- tral America — much the same thing was happening. Not too long after the fishing people of Peru began to settle down, the gathering people in the central valley of Mexico cultivated a large-seeded grass. The grass, maize, developed over time into corn. Examining Fine Art This art shows the leg- endary origin of Tenochtltlan — an eagle on a cactus became the site of the Aztec capital. What modern city Is on this site? Along the Gulf of Mexico coast, a group called the Olmecs developed a much more complex society with large villages, temple complexes, and pyramids. The Olmecs were the first Mesoamerican people to handle large masses of stone, sculpting large stone monuments. Their civilization strongly influenced their neighbors. The Maya farther south were building ever larger pyramids and villages. Their trade networks spread along the coasts. Corn, cocoa, cotton, tomatoes, beans, and squash were traded far distances both north and south. Seeds and cloth ot the Maya were traded for the pottery and pre- cious stones of the South Americans. Both peoples became skilled at metalwork and pottery. No doubt ideas also moved back and forth trom group to group until, in some cases, origins of ideas and plants are impossible to find. Again, as people were able to improve their food supply, societies became more and more complex. Small groups grew into cir)'-states and small countries. Mar- ket and trade centers sprang up with some groups specializing in products. The Maya developed a vast group of city-states that competed with one another in battle and in building grand public works. Then about A.D. 1000, the Maya changed and scattered over their area. The Maya and their trade routes continued but on a smaller scale. More is known about the Maya because they had a written language with books written on bark paper. Unfor- tunately, most of these books were lost during the early years of European con- tact, and it took many years to learn to read them because there were so few sam- ples to study. The Maya and the people of the Andes had a fascination with mathematics and engineering. The Maya invented the con- cept of zero. Most of these people had complicated and accurate calendar systems, linked to the study of the stars. Their tem- ple-pyramids show a scientific knowledge of the earth's relation to the sun. Many other equally advanced groups rose all over Mesoamerica. In the valley of Mexico large groups came and went. Groups trom the north would arrive and 12 Unit 1 A New World: Prehistory- 1756"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"conquer the people already there, set up a new capital, and tall to a new group of invaders. The last invaders were the Aztec. In about 1325 they settled on some islands in the middle ot Lake Texcoco and built their city, Tenochtitlan, the site of modern Mexico City. Tenochtitlan was connected to the mainland by causeways. By the late l400s, it had gold-adorned temples, floating gardens, and an enor- mous market. Its population of 100,000 was far larger than any city in Europe at the time. By this time the Maya trade networks were partially taken over by the Aztec. To the south the Inca had consolidated an empire 3,000 miles long. It had 10,000 miles of roads with woven suspension bridges crossing canyons and rivers. The Inca had terraced hillsides with complicat- ed irrigation systems and were able to feed lar more people than lived in their empire. They had systems of moving peo- ple wherever they needed them for pub- lic works projects. They employed skilled weavers, metalworkers, and builders from other Andean peoples. The Inca had very strict ideas about responsibility of public officials and the duties of people to the state. Much of the system of organization was designed to take care of the people. In 1500, just as the European explorers set sail for the Americas, both the Inca and the peoples of Mexico reached these new heights of power and wealth. Indian Cultures North of Mexico The Indians who lived north of Mexi- co had entered into trade with the natives of Mexico. By 400 B.c:., maize had been introduced into what would become the southwestern United States and the fertile Mississippi valley. From these two areas, maize spread throughout North America. There were not nearly as many people to the north as there were in Mexico and the Inca empire. The Inca rtiled perhaps 5 million people, while there were perhaps 4 or 5 million people in Mesoamerica. North of Mexico there were only 1 to 1.5 million people, most of whom lived in small villages and bands with varied cultures and ways of obtaining food. Anthropologists group these people by where they lived and the way they had adapted to the land at the time the Euro- peans arrived. In North America these groups include: Northwest Coast, Califor- nia, Southwest, Plains, Southeast, Eastern Woodlands, and Northern Forest, as well as the Inuit (Eskimo and Aleut) in Alaska.

Hiawatha c. 1570s The character in the poem The Song of Hiaivatha is not based on the lite of the actual native American leader. The real Hiawatha, a Mohawk, enjoyed a reputation as a magician and a prophet. Dedicated to ending violence and warfare, Hiawatha devoted his final years to creating a union from among hostile Indian nations. About 1570, he brought together the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, and Seneca into the League of the Five Nations, also known as the Iroquois Confederacy. One remarkable aspect of the league was its ruling council in which each nation had a single vote. This early form of \"government based on the con.sent of the governed\" influ- enced the course of early American democracy.

Sev- eral groups began to build large close-knit villages in the area where Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico come tosrethcr. These people, called Anasazi, built large multi-story apartment-like buildings of adobe and cut stone with connecting causeways and elaborate ceremonial rooms. Early Spanish explorers called these houses pueblos, the Spanish word for \"villages.\" The Anasazi pueblos are the oldest standing buildings in North Ameri- ca. Pueblo Bonito, with more than 600 rooms, took about 100 years to build and was finished about A.D. 1 130. To the south in Arizona, the Hohokam were building large villages with elaborate irrigation canals, ball-playing courts, and temple mounds. Their trade goods and decorations show close contact with northern Mexico. Other groups in the area also built large villages and show evi- dence of extensive trade with the people of Mexico and each other. Then in about A.D. 1300 all of this changed. Perhaps a severe drought and cli- mate change took place. The Hohokam vanished; other groups scattered and moved closer to established water. The Anasazi moved to the springs on the Hopi Mesas and the Rio Grande. Other groups moved to similar places. Their descen- dants remain as the Pueblo people of New Mexico and Arizona. Another area that showed a great growth in population was the Mississippi valley. Around A.n. 900, people along the Mississippi river flourished as farmers and traders. They began to build great temple mounds of earth similar to those in Mexico. Settlements along the river grew into large towns. Cahokia (near present- day St. l.ouis) had a population of perhaps 10,000 people, with hundreds ot temple mounds. An earlier groLip of moundbuilders, the Hopewell culture, grew up in the Ohio River valley about 200 R.c:. and lasted about 700 years. The Hopewell people farmed their rich land and traded across the Midwest for copper and shells. They built htige mounds of cardi as both cere- monial centers and burial sites. Some of the Hopewells' elaborate and enormous mounds — as high as 30 feet — are in the shapes of snakes, turtles, and other ani- mals. Inside the burial mounds, archaeol- ogists have found pearl beads, woven cloth, copper ornaments, and striking objects of stone and mica. Groups such as the Hopewells spread all over the central United States from Wisconsin to the Gulf of Mexico. On the Great Plains, the last of the hunter-gatherers still hunted the enor- mous herds of buffalo, which were all that remained of the mighty herds their ances- tors followed from Asia. With the arrival of the Spanish and their horses, these peo- ple would also undergo a tremendous change. With horses to ride, the buffalo hunters would become a powerful force on the plains. In other parts of the country, other groups also flourished: the rich fishing cultures of the Pacific Northwest, the seed gatherers of California, the farmers of the Southeast, and the League of the Iroquois in the Northeast. The Iroquois, an alliance of farming people, dominated their area in the 1500s and 1600s. They were made up of Mohawk, Seneca, Oneida, Onondaga, and Cayuga tribes. Large groups of several families shared a \"long house\" of poles and bark. A large village might have 50 or more long houses and 300 to 400 people. Their league was a representative confed- eration, or government made up of inde- pendent units, probably formed about 1 580. It was founded by two of the cul- ture's heroes, Dekanawida and Hiawatha. The women leaders of each clan chose their chief, who would attend league councils. Though the League's Constitu- tion was not written down imtil 1850, its provisions included: The object of these laws is to establish peace between the iiurneroHS nations of hitiians. . .for the preservation of life, property and liberty. . .And the number of chief's in this confederation of the fii'e Indian Nations are fifty. . . . Linking Across Time Indian Beliefs Like their pre- historic forebears, native Americans today believe that their ancestors\" graves are sacred. Yet, for years archaeologists and those who sold such relics have dug up thousands of Indian remains. In 1989 the Smithsonian Insti- tution in Washing- ton, D.C., met the demands of native American activists and agreed to return properly identified skele- tons from their Indian collection to groups who could prove at least a \"cultural affilia- tion\" with the remains.

This group later devised a written language and a dictionary. They practiced a loose-knit form of democracy. Just as the people of Europe and Asia were aware of each other, so widespread groups in the Americas knew about each other and shared similar ideas. For exam- ple, despite their diversity, the native American people felt a close relationship with the land and their environment. They felt that all things, themselves included, were all part of one great spirit. In the 1400s native Americans contin- ued to develop their ways ot life isolated from other peoples of the world. The peo- ple of other continents were likewise unaware ol America. Then a chain of events began to move the peoples oi Europe, Asia, and Africa to increased com- munications and interdependence. The exchange of goods and ideas among civi- lizations on three continents intensified. By the late 1400s the world stood on the brink of enormous changes. European nations would soon initiate the ventures that led to the colonization of America. The native American way of life was one that the Europeans who arrived seeking wealth in the new world were not able to appreciate or understand. The Europeans' values, especially their love of gold, seemed strange to the Indians as well. For example, during the conquest of Peru, an Inca citizen asked a European, \"What do you do with gold? Do you eat it?\" Reportedly, during the conquest of Mexico, Cortes told the ambassador to the Aztec ruler Moctezuma, \"We have an illness only gold will cure.\" This love of gold was as impossible for the Inca and Aztec to understand as it was impossible for the Europeans to under- stand human sacrifices. The idea of own- ing land was as alien to the native people of North America as the idea of not own- ing land was to the Europeans. These two different viewpoints and the strong belief on both sides that their point of view was the only correct one would lead to continuing misunderstandings for centuries to come. fHIIIIIII Section One Review [»»! SUMMARY Twenty thousand years ago, small groups of hunters followed game across a bridge of land that connected Siberia and Alaska. Eventually they spread through- out the Americas. Some remained hunter-gatherers, but others began to farm and raise animals. They built cities and complex cultures. Mesoamerican cul- tures such as the Inca and Aztec centered around religion with majestic temples and complex rituals. They had written language, numbers, and calendars. Even- tually, the Aztec and Inca conquered their neighbors and built empires that included cities, trading centers, and roadways. Meanwhile, many North American peo- ples also became farmers, and some built villages with complex dwellings. Checking for Understanding 1. Identify Olmecs, Iroquois League, Mesoamerica 2.

On the morning of the twelfth day the people washed themselves well. The women dried themselves ivith yellow cornmeal. Soon after the ablutions were completed, they heard the distant call of the approaching gods. It was shouted, as before, four times — nearer and louder at each repetition — and, after the fourth call the gods appeared. Blue Body and Black Body each carried two ears of corn, one yellow, one white, each covered at the end coinplctcty with grains. The gods laid one buckskin on the ground with the head to the west; on Navaho weddi)ig basket east: buckskin with its head to the under the white ear they put the feather of a yellow eagle. Then they told the people to stand at a distance a)id alloiv the wind to enter While the wind ivas blowing, eight of the Mirage People came and walked around the objects on the ground four times, and as they walked, the eagle feathers, whose tips protruded from between the buckskins, were seen to move. When the Mirage People had li)iished their walk the upper buckskiti was lifted; the ears of corn bad disappeared, a man and a woman lay there in their gtead. The ivhite ear of corn had been changed into a man, the yellow ear into a woman. It was the wind that gave them life When this ceases to blow we die.

Powerful monarchs emerged in several countries, and contacts with the Middle East and East Asia stimulated trade, learning, and national rivalries. Western Europe experi- enced a profound cultural awakening. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe how European society was changed from medieval times. • Explain the significance of the Renais- sance and the Reformation. The collapse of the Roman Empire was nearly complete by A.D. 550. Small isolated king- doms replaced the once central- izing influence of Roman rule. When the Roman Empire ended, cities and city life also declined, and travel became dan- gerous because of the breakdown ol law. The empire's classical civilization nearly disappeared. The Roman Catholic Church remained as the only institution that held together the culture of western Europe. The Middle Ages During the Middle Ages, — A.D. 500 to 1500 — most ot European society was organized by the manorial system. The majority of the people of Europe were peasants who worked on farmlands that belonged to a manor, or large estate, held by a noble lord and lady. Peasants lived in a village on the manor. Most were serfs, who were \"bound to the soil;\" that is, they were considered part of the property. A manor also included woods, common fields and pastures, a church, and shops for weavers, blacksmiths, bakers, and others who made the manor nearly self-sufficient. In this period, the Church was the cen- ter of life in western Europe. Catholic clergy not only performed religious cere- monies but also participated in governing the small feudal manors, and the larger emerging kingdoms. In 1095 Pope Urban II, head of the Roman Catholic Church, called for a \"holy war\" against the Seljuk (sehl JOOK) Turks, a Muslim people who held the Christian shrines in Palestine. The Church began a series of holy wars called crusades to recapture the Holy Land, including Jerusalem. The First Crusade was the most successful. Over the next 200 years, other crusaders went to war in the Holy Land. By 1291, however, the Muslims had retak- en all the crusaders' kingdoms. While the crusades were a failure, their effects upon western Europe were enor- mous. They helped bring western Europe out of isolation into contact with other parts of the world. Trade to satisfy the demand for eastern luxury goods started a series of events that completely changed Europe's economic, political, and social life. When cities began to revive as centers for trade with the East, new opportunities in the city provided employment for wages. The manorial system began to break down as some serfs demanded higher 18 Unit 1 A New World: Prehistory- 1756"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"wages and benefits to stay on the manor. Eventually, many could afford to buy their own land. Others began to pay rent for land with money rather than labor or produce. Farming for profit increased agricultural production, and better conditions caused the population to grow. Because of their access to trade routes, towns along the Mediterranean Sea — in Italy, southern France, and Spain — grew first. As early as 1200, Venice and Genoa were strong ciry-states with busy ship- yards. By 1423 Tomaso Mocenigo, Doge (mayor) of Venice could report: . . . the Florentines send us every year, 16, 000 bolts of the finest, fine and mediuni cloth; we export these to. . . Syria, Cyprus, Rhodes, Egypt, Romania And the said Florentines bring in 7000 ducats weekly in all kinds of money, worth a total of 150,000 ducats a year Cities in northern Europe also emerged as centers for trade, shipping, and prof- itable craft industries such as weaving. Those with access to the sea would even- tually rival the growth of Italian cities. The Late Middle Ages The rise of commerce brought prosperity to much of western and central Europe. Ihe use of money and the need for credit turned some merchants into bankers. They lent money to finance new business ven- tures and provided credit for shipments of goods. The well-to-do bankers, merchants, and master craftsworkers made up a new town-based middle class that stood between the nobility at the top of the social system and the peasants at the bottom. All through the late Middle Ages, the middle cla,ss grew in numbers, importance, and power. It came to include lawyers, doctors, and minor government officials. The middle class commonly supported the king — who represented stable govern- ment — against the feudal nobility — who disrupted trade by conducting local wars. As towns grew in population and wealth, some townspeople were able to buy a charter from the local lord and win the right to control their own affairs. In England, townspeople and knights gained a voice in government, sending representatives to meetings of a parliament, or assembly. The power of the towns helped weaken the feudal system and strengthen national governments. Townspeople used their financial power to win rights and favors from an ambitious monarch. In return they supplied hinds for ships or soldiers. Some bankers became powerfiil enough to deal on almost equal terms with European rulers who needed to borrow money. Pros- perity, optimism, and an emphasis on human potential set the mood for tar- reaching social and cultural changes in the 1400s and 1500s. This period is known as the Renaissance, a French word for the \"rebirth\" of interest in the culture and learning of ancient Greece and Rome. The meaning of the Renaissance, however, went far beyond this definition. Even today, people marvel at the accomplishments of Renaissance artists and scholars.

How did this , trade bring a Renais- sance to northern Italy? The Renaissance began about 1350 in the wealthy cit}'-states of northern Italy. Trade wnth the East enriched merchant and banking families who used their wealth to collect books and paintings, hire architects to design buildings, and sup- port painters and sculptors. Because they saw ruins of Roman monuments and buildings all around them, these wealthv patrons were especially interested in clas- sical culture — the arts, literature, and knowledge of ancient Greece and Rome. This interest in the classics came to be called hiunanism. WhOe the Middle .Ages had emphasized the human inner or spiritual nature and the need for self-discipline, the Renais- sance awakened himian creativit}' and demanded an outward expression of tal- ent. Renaissance wTiters, artists, and thinkers admired ancient models, but thev were brimming with new and experimen- tal ideas. Writers tried new st}'les, writing in ever)-day language instead of scholarly Latin. Painters de\\'eloped new techniques and tried to ponray people realistically. Humanism took on a broader meaning, including an appreciation and concern for all aspects of human life. The Renaissance in Italy reached its height in the late 1400s. Three of the most famous of the many Italian artists working at that time were Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci. .\\round 1500, Renaissance ideas spread northward into France, the Holy Roman Empire, the Netherlands, and England. The new craft of printing with movable type, invented about 1440 by a German, Johann Gutenburg, helped spread Renais- sance ideas. ^Tiile only a few handwritten copies of books had been available earlier, by the l490s there were numerous presses in operation. Because more Europeans could afford books, xhey were exposed to new ideas. End of Religious Unity For most Europeans in the Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church was the center of life and the most stable and unihing influence. But by the late 1400s, Europe was in the early stages of an intense religious upheaval. ^'Tiat would later be known as the Protestant Reformation began simply with demands for reforms in the Roman Catholic Church. Among the leading early reformers were John WycUffe in England and John Huss in Bohemia, part of the Holy Roman Empire. These early 20 Unit 1 A Ne«- World: Prehistory- 1756"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"reformers criticized the Church's wealth and the luxurious lifestyles of some of the clergy. They also printed Bibles in the lan- guage of the common people rather than the official Latin. The Church feared widespread rebellion against its leadership. Compromises on such serious divisions were often impossible, and fighting broke out between Church supporters and reform groups. In the early 1500s, Martin Luther, a Catholic and a professor in a German university, challenged several Church practices. Luther believed that salvation was simply by faith, not by good works and acceptance by the Church. In 1521, when he was called before Emperor Charles V to answer charges brought against him by Church authorities, Luther declared: Unless I be convinced by Scripture and reason, I neither am nor dare retract anything, for my conscience is a captive to God's word, and it is neither safe nor light to go against conscience. This stand marked the separation of Luther from the Catholic Church. The first Protestant faith, Lutheranism, was born. Soon other Protestant sects developed and became the dominant religions in Scandinavia, parts of modern Germany, the Netherlands, and England. In other parts of Europe, particularly Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, Catholic rulers became the Church's defenders. The Reformation had tar-reaching results. The Catholic Church began its own internal reforms and to counter the spread ot Protestantism, encouraged its missionaries to travel and teach in distant parrs of the world. Differences in religious beliefs among European monarchs added intensify to national rivalries. The conflict also weakened Church authority, allowing some European rulers to assume more power. Some ol the new teachings made people think that it was sale to t]uesti()ii other forms of authority. Emerging Nations During most of the Middle Ages, Europe was splintered into many small states. Ruled by princes, dukes, barons, and other local lords, these small states were part of a feudal system. This system rested on interlocking ties of protection and obligation between landowning nobles and those who lived on their lands. During the late Middle Ages, strong monarchs and a sense of \"nationhood\" began to replace feudalism in western Europe. Rulers brought unity to their countries and gained authority over the powerful nobles. In England it took 30 years of bloody civil war from 1455 to 1485 to unify the kingdom. Hundreds of English nobles, old and young, died in the fighting, destroying some noble families and weakening others. The winning Lancastrian leader, Henry Tudor, came to the throne in 1485 as King Henry VII. He married Elizabeth of York, the daughter of one of his defeated rivals, unifying the kingdom. Henry VII's ruling house, or dynasty, produced several out- standing rulers. The monarchs ot France, too, gradually consolidated their power and territory.

France's victory in the war, aided by the heroism of Joan of Arc, increased the French people's feeling of patriotism and unity. A different motivation brought political unity to Spain. In about A.D. 711, Mus- lims, or Moors, from North Africa con- quered most of the Iberian peninsula — Spain and Portugal — estab- lishing an advanced culture there. Chris- tian rulers, led by the kingdom of Castile, tried continuously to drive the Moors out of Spain. By the mid-l400s, the Muslims held only the territory around Granada on the southeast coast. In 1469 Christian unity in Spain was aided by the marriage of the heirs to the largest kingdoms: Isabella of Castile and Leon, and Ferdinand of Aragon. \"The Catholic monarchs\" believed that Chris- tianity would unify the countr)'. In 1492 they ordered all Jews to leave Spain. In the same year, their armies took Granada from the Moors. Once part of Spain, Portugal won its independence in the twelfth century. Por- tugal also defeated the Moors, and by the late 1300s the country was unified under King John I. The Holy Roman Empire, which included the modern nations of Germany, Austria, and parts of Italy, remained the largest European territory. In the late 1400s, however, it faced both internal problems and outside invaders. Poland and Russia would likewise lack the unified direction to participate in exploration and discovery with the west- ern European kingdoms: Spain, Portugal, France, and England. All four had sea- ports on the Atlantic Ocean — soon to become a great avenue of trade and exploration. In a few hundred years, Europeans, once isolated from the rest of the world and bound by a rigid feudal system, developed a widespread spirit of curiosity and adven- ture. Unified monarchies and national rivalry led to competition for trade with Asia. The search for an all-water route to East Asia encouraged western European explorers to cross unknown oceans and seek new lands. Section Two Revie-w Summary During the 1300s and 1400s, Europe shifted from feudalism to nationalism. As towns and trade developed, a growing middle class of merchants and bankers accumulated wealth and power. They used this power to finance the activities of powerful monarchs, gaining political influence in the process. They financed some of the world's finest art and architec- ture during the Renaissance, a rebirth of interest in classical culture and the pursuit of knowledge. As nations unified, the unity of the Roman Catholic Church began to break down as reformers ques- tioned Church teaching and policy. Checking for Understanding 1.

Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the impact of Islam. • Describe the extent and importance of the Mongol Empire. • Identify some of the trading kingdoms ot Africa. Since ancient times, trade had linked the different peoples and cultures of the \"Old World\" — Europe, Asia, and Africa. Roth the Creeks and Romans had established profitable routes of trade with Asia and Africa. Seeking slaves and luxuries such as silks, spices, and precious stones, traders also carried ideas and information over great distances. With the fall ol ihe Rom.ui F.mpire, I'.urope's participation in foreign trade had declined. Roads and bridges fell into dis- repair and robbers preyed on travelers because there was no government to keep order. While most people in Europe lived in the country, isolated into small villages, trade between Asia and Africa continued. Spread of the Muslim World The most important influence in medieval Asia and Africa — with conse- quences for Europe as well — was the rise of the religion of Islam. Founded by the prophet Mohammed in the 600s, Islam spread quickly from the Arabian peninsula by conquest through the Middle East to Asia and North Africa, into Spain and the Mediterranean region. About 682 an Arab general, Achbar Ben Nafi Al-F;ihri, and his warriors had reached the Atlantic in North Africa. Achbar expressed his zeal for Islam: Did not these waters present an insuperable barrier, I would carry the faith and the law of the faithful to countries reaching from the rising of the sun to the setting thereof. The original Islamic empire led by Arabs was soon divided. Rival groups of Muslims — the name for followers of Islam — organized and took control over different areas in Asia, Africa, and parts of Europe. In some places — for example, Spain — they met fierce resistance and eventually lost power. By the late !400s, the rapidly growing empire of the Ottoman Turks was the leading Muslim power. From their base in Asia Minor — modern lurkey — the Ottomans had taken over Cjreece and much of the Balkan peninsula. As Islam spread, Muslims and C Christians came into direct conflict. Knights from ('hrisiian luirope fought to recapture lands that the Muslims occupied in Spain and Sicily.

Where did Arabic numerals originate? In the long run, these Crusades into the Holy Land, which was sacred to both Christians and Muslims, had a great influence on trade and learning. From Middle Eastern and Islamic cultures, the returning knights and soldiers learned about new foods and products — spices, sugar, silk, cotton, dyes, perfumes, tapestries, and fruits such as peaches and melons. Wealthy Europeans could afford to buy these luxuries from the East. Increased trade enriched the Italian city-states. Contact with the Muslim world also brought new ideas. Arab scholars had made important advances in medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and other sci- ences. While learning had declined in medieval Europe, the Arabs had preserved much of Greek and Roman science and philosophy. From the Arabs, Europeans learned algebra and the system of Arabic numerals, which the Arabs had learned in India. In Spain the Muslims introduced the Arabian horse as well as oranges and lemons. One of the early targets of Muslim expansion was the huge subcontinent of India. Beginning in A.D. 712, groups of Muslim invaders from Persia (Iran) and Afghanistan occupied parts of northern India. The beliefs of the Muslim con- querors clashed with the ancient Hindu traditions of India. While some Indians converted to Islam, religious conflict led to deep divisions within the country. In the late fifteenth century, a weak Muslim kingdom known as the Delhi sul- tanate was in power in northern India. The rest of the country was divided among many small states and kingdoms controlled by princes and rajas, most of whom were Hindu. Early in the 1500s, another group of Muslims established the powerful Mogul Empire, which would unite and rule India for several hundred years. Empires of the East In the early 1200s the ancient empire of China was conquered by the invading \"Golden Horde\" of Mongols from central Asia. Genghis Khan and his army of fierce, swift riders also swept westward across central Asia, through Russia, terror- izing the Slavic people in Poland, Hun- gary, and Austria. For nearly 200 years, the Mongols ruled one of the largest empires in history, including China, cen- tral Asia, Russia, and the Middle East. Although the Chinese considered the Mongols \"foreign barbarians,\" China prospered under their rule. Overland trav- el between Europe and China was safe while the Mongols controlled the huge central Eurasian plain. East-west trade was revived, along with cultural exchanges among China, Europe, and Muslim Asia. European traders, travelers, and mission- aries went to China. They returned not only with silks and spices but also with important inventions like the compass, printing, and gunpowder. European traders also brought back knowledge and exciting descriptions of the wonders they had seen in Asia. The most famous was a young merchant from Venice, Marco Polo, who traveled to the court of Kublai Khan in 1275 and stayed 24 Unit 1 A New World: Prehistory- 1756"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Examining Illustrations Marco Polo arrives at the court of Kublal Ktian in f/i/s illustration from a thirteenth-century manuscript.

Following the death oi the Great Khan in 1294, the Chinese overthrew their Mongol rulers. The conservative rulers of the new Ming Dynasty wanted to restore the old, purely Chinese heritage. New ideas were discouraged, and students studied only the ancient classic books. At first the Ming rulers did encourage trade.

They asked what he [the captain-major] sought so far away from home, and he told them that we came in search of Christians and of spices. — Vasco Da Gama Portuguese explorer, from his logbook, 1498 Section Focus By the last decades of the fifteenth cen- tury, technological and economic changes in Europe made long sea voyages possi- ble. The prime goal of these ventures was a sea route from Europe to Asia, in search of spices and luxury goods. Encouraged by their rulers, Portuguese sea captains were the first to find this route. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the changes in commerce and in technology that enabled Europeans to sponsor long ocean voyages. • State the importance of the Portuguese discovery of a sea route to Asia. The new spirit of curiosity and adventure that swept over Europe with the Renaissance helped launch the bold voyages of the Age of Exploration. Many other motivations sent these sailors across unknown oceans: Europeans wanted luxu- ry goods from Asia, as well as the spices — pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves — that preserved foods and made them taste bet- ter. European merchants hoped to break the monopoly that Arab traders and Vene- tian merchants had on the overland routes to Asia. European monarchs hoped to enrich and strengthen their countries — and themselves. When new lands were discovered, the Roman Catholic Church sent missionaries to bring Christianity to njillions of new souls. While six countries on the Atlantic coast — Portugal, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and England — would eventually undertake voyages of discovery, the pioneer in these ventures was Portugal. A Revolution in Commerce Italian city-states had proven that great profit awaited those willing to take risks to trade with the distant East. They had a monoply on trade through the Mediterranean, but northern European merchants and bankers would soon use their accumulated wealth to sponsor voyages. They would lend money to outfit ships and pay the captains and crew, and they would insure ships. The great expense of ocean voyages made new ways of raising finances necessary. In England, France, and the Netherlands, the joint-stock company became a useful form for raising money. The company would sell shares, called stock, to a number of investors, thus providing money or capital, for its venture. Each shareowner then received a portion of the venture's profits — or losses. The joint-stock company let small investors, who could not afi^ord to outfit an entire ship, take part in overseas commercial ventures by buying one or more shares of stock. It also enabled wealthy peo- ple to spread their risks by investing in sev- eral joint-stock companies at the same time. A joint-stock company might have hun- dreds of shareholders, thus creating strong organizations rich enough to support long expeditions or found colonies. No matter how strongly motivated or well financed, long voyages of discovery could not have succeeded without improve- ments in technology: new ship designs and better navigational instruments. 28 Unit 1 A New World: Prehistory- 1756"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"In the Mediterranean, for thousands of years, ship captains had tried to sail within sight of land, guided mainly by written descriptions of coasts and harbors, such as: The landmark for Barcelona is a high, abrupt, and isolated mountain called Monserrate.

By the fifteenth century, captains also had precise maps tor both the Mediter- ranean and the Atlantic coasts oi Europe and North Africa. In addition, they had learned trom Arab sailors how to use several improved navigational instruments. The compass, which was invented in China, reliably showed the direction of magnetic north — even at night or in cloudy weather. The astrolabe and the quadrant measured the positions ol the sun and stars, allowing the navigator to determine distance north and south from a given point. Ships built to new designs were faster and more seaworthy. The carrack, for example, had several masts and a rud- der. Smaller but easier to handle was the Portuguese caravel, a double-rigged ship with both square and triangular sails. On Columbus's first voyage, the flagship Santa Maria was a carrack of about 1 hundred tons; the Nifia and the Pinta were caravels.

Pioneering Portuguese Portugal was the first of the European kingdoms to send explorers in search of a sea route to Asia. This small nation had not been troubled by the wars that were ravaging France and England nor by the ongoing war against the Moors in Spain. In 1419 Prince Henry, a younger son of King John I of Portugal, set up a center lor astronomical and geographical studies at Sagres, on the southwestern tip of Por- tugal. There he invited mapmakers, astronomers, and shipbuilders from throughout the Mediterranean world to study and plan voyages of exploration. With this collected knowledge, Prince Henry sent expeditions beyond the safety of the Mediterranean. Portuguese ships Began to travel southward along the African coast. As expeditions returned, Henry's mapmakers corrected and improved their sailing charts, which the Portuguese kept secret. For people at that time, these were fear- some voyages. Europeans were convinced that- great dangers awaited in the open ocean: a Sea of Darkness, sea monsters, oceans that boiled at the equator. There were, in fact, some dangerous cur- rents and treacherously shallow waters along the African coast. By the time Prince Henry — known as \"the Naviga- tor\" — died in 1460, his ships had reached only Cape Verde, the westernmost tip of Africa. By this time, the Portuguese were already trading with African merchants for gold, ivory, pepper, palm oil, and slaves. Soon they had profitable trading posts on the West African coast and were establishing sugar plantations. Slavery and the slave trade were not new in the region. Using war captives and others as slaves had long been a practice in Muslim society in North Africa and in other parts of the world as well. The first African slaves were taken back to Portugal as servants in 1441. Probably 1,000 Africans were taken to Portugal over the next 5 years. But by the l490s, the growth and profits of the African sugar plantations had greatly increased the demand for local slave labor. To meet the new demand, slave traders turned to kid- napping and \"slave raids\" in the African interior. In 1487 and 1488 a Portuguese expedi- tion led by Bartholomeu Dias was caught in a storm that blew the ships off course near the southern tip of Africa.

Ten years later another Portuguese expedition set sail, headed by Vasco da Gama. After almost a year's travel, they rounded the Cape of Good Hope and sailed up the eastern coast ot Africa past the rich Muslim city-states of Kilwa and Malindi. With an Arab pilot, the expedition crossed the Indian Ocean to Calicut on the coast of India. The voyage home took another year and was much more difficult. So many sailors died of scurvy, a sickness caused by a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables, that there were only enough left to sail two ships. Da Gama finally returned home to Portugal in September 1499. It is said that the profits on his cargo of cin- namon, cloves, nutmeg, ginger, and pep- per covered the cost of his expedition 60 times over. The trade rivalry among Italian ciry- states had been intense. Now Portugal's successful sea venture would cost the Italian cities their monopoly on trade.

The idea led to discoveries that altered life in Europe and brought drastic change to those who lived on the continents that lay between Europe and Asia. Objectives After studving this section, you should be able to; • Compare the purposes and results of the four voyages of Columbus. • Discuss the purpose and results of Magellan's expedition. The first Europeans to arrive in the Americas were Norse seafar- ers from Scandinavia. Between .-\\.D. 800 and 1100 the Norse established settlements in Iceland, Green- land, and present-day Newfoundland, which they called Vinland. The Norse set- tlements in Vinland were unsuccessful because of conflicts with Indians and lack ol support Irom home. The Vinland settle- ments soon disappeared — forgotten except in Norse sagas, or long heroic stories. It was not until the voyage of Christo- pher Columbus in 1492 that the age of European discovery and exploration of the Americas began in earnest. After Europeans learned that Columbus had discovered continents not yet known to them, Spain, Portugal, France, the Netherlands, and England sent expedi- tions to the New World. They pursued a passage to Asia through or around the Americas in search of precious metals. In time these nations all established colonies in the Americas. Columbus's First Venture Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa, Italy, in 1451. His early interest in navigation led him to Lisbon, Portu- gal, in 1477. There, Portuguese explo- rations of the African-Atlantic coast brought him new knowledge of geogra- phy and cartography. Columbus had studied the atlas of the ancient Greek geographer, Ptolemy, who believed the earth was a sphere. But Ptolemy underestimated its size. In 1477, Columbus was one of the first to read the newly printed \"Travels\" of Marco Polo. On the basis of this information Colum- bus shrank Ptolemy's calculations. He fig- ured the distance between Japan and the Canary Islands, ofi^ the northeastern coast of Africa, at only 2,400 miles. His calcu- lations resulted in an obsession to under- take a voyage to Asia by sailing west. For years Columbus sought in vain for financial backing. Portuguese explorations had proven Ptolemy wrong on so many points that Columbus was promptly rejected in Portugal. Having no success with the kings of France or England, he spent six years trying to persuade Ferdi- nand and Isabella of Spain, that his scheme would bring them wealth, empire, and converts to Catholicism. Finally, Isabella and Ferdinand provided Colum- bus with three ships, the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria. Columbus left Spain in August 1492 with about 90 sailors. He sailed south to the Canary Islands where he repaired his ships and took on fresh supplies. Colum- bus then charted his course westward. 36 Unit 1 A New 'World: Prehistory- 1756"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Connections H STORY \"TwAS A Small World,\" Columbus Thought Around the sixth century B.C. Greek philosopher ThaJes proposed tiie idea that the earth was a disc floating in water. Shortly aher, Pythagoras advanced the idea that the earth was a sphere. Several centuries later Aristotle tested this idea by observing the circular shadow of the earth on the moon during eclipses. AND Geography The size of the earth was more difficult to determine than its shape. Greek geog- rapher Erastosthenes, however, almost correctly calculated the circumference of the earth at about 25,000 miles by mea- suring the angles of the sun's rays at sepa- rated points. This figure was known by Columbus, but he chose to use the calcu- lations made by a number of later scholars who underestimated the size of the earth by nearly one-half Mapmak- ers compounded the errors by showing Europe, Asia, and Africa much larger than they actually are and by showing the Atlantic Ocean as a narrow gulf Columbus died believing he had reached Asia.

The sailors were frightened and wanted to turn back. On October 9 the crew \"heard birds passing all night long\" and believed they were close to land. On October 1 1 Columbus wrote in his log: The crew of the Piiita spotted some. . . reeds and some other plants; they also saw what looked like a small hoard or plank.

In the early morning of October 12, 1492, the lookout aboard the Piiita saw white cliffs glistening in the moonlight. At dawn, Columbus went ashore onto a small island in the Bahamas (San Sal- vador) and claimed it for Spain. Believing he had reached the East Indies oft the coast ol Asia, he called the native people Indians. On the nearby coasts of Cuba and Hispaniola [HIS puhn YOH luh] — present-day Haiti and the Dominican Republic — Columbus found enough gold to raise his hopes for wealth and glory. In April 1493, Columbus returned tri- umphantly to the Spanish court. The king and queen gave him the titles \"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\" and \"Viceroy and Gover- nor of the Indies.\" All were fascinated by both the copper-skinned people ('oliun- bus brought back and his reports ot lands where every bird, tree, and flower were new to Europeans.

Despite his achieve- ments, he never found the wealth desired by Spain. Columbus died in 1506 a bro- ken, frustrated dreamer, unaware that he had reached new continents in the West- ern Hemisphere. Spain and Portugal Divide the World Accounts of Columbus's discoveries soon set off a flurry of exploration partic- ularly by Spain and Portugal. When sea- faring explorers realized that the lands reached by Columbus formed a barrier between Europe and Asia, they sought to find a way around them. They also want- ed to claim and conquer this New World. Columbus's 1492 discovery put Spain and Portugal in direct competition for trade and empire-building. In 1493, because of potential conflict. Pope Alexander VI convinced the two Catholic nations to divide the new overseas territo- ries between them. A line of demarcation, a north-south line drawn on a map through the Atlantic Ocean by the pope, gave Spain all the non-Christian lands to the west of the line and Portugal all those to the east. The Portuguese, objecting that the line favored Spain, threatened war. In 1494 Spain and Portugal resolved their differences \"for the sake of peace and con- cord\" in the Treaty of Tordesillas (TAWRD uh SEE uhs). The treaty moved the demarcation line nearly 1,000 miles further westward — about 48° west longi- tude — and extended it around the earth to secure Portuguese claims in Asia. In 1500 a fleet of Portuguese ships under the command of Pedro Alvares Cabral (PAY throo AHL vuh reesh kuh BRAHL) set out for India by going east around the coast of Africa. Swinging west to get favorable winds, Cabral's expedition was blown off course and unintentionally reached present-day Brazil. Because Brazil's eastern bulge lay to the east of the line set by the treaty, Portugal claimed it. In 1499 on another Portuguese expedi- tion, with an Italian-born navigator and merchant, Amerigo Vespucci (vay SPOO chee), sailed along the coast of South America. In a long letter Vespucci wrote about his voyage, he concluded that the land he had explored was a vast new conti- nent — a New World. In 1504 Vespucci's sensational account, which he purposely redated 1497, was published, and he erro- neously received credit for reaching the mainland of the New World before Colum- bus. German mapmakers named the New World \"America, \" and the name stuck. In 151 1 Vasco Niinez de Balboa (VAHS koh NOO nyayth day bal BOH uh) was the acting governor of a Spanish-built town on the northern coast of South America called Darien. On expeditions into what is now Panama, Balboa learned trom the native people of \"great waters\" to be found on the west side of this narrow strip of land. Balboa led an expedition to find this body of water, guided by the Indians who knew trails through the diffi- cult countryside. They did indeed reach a huge body of water, which Balboa claimed for Spain. Having climbed a peak alone to see the water first, Balboa indeed became the first European to see the eastern coast of the Pacific Ocean. It was now certain that the lands Columbus had reached were not part of Asia. They were separated from Asia by this seemingly endless ocean. 38 Unit 1 A New World: Prehistory- 1756"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"VOYAGES OF EXPLORATION Nofse (about 1000) Spanish Christopher Columbus (1492-1502) Amerigo Vespucci (1499) Portuguese Pedro Cabral (1500) English John Cabot (1497) Martin Frobisher (1576) French Giovanni da Verrazano (1524) Jacques Cartier (1534) Dutch Henry Hudson (1609) Examining IWaps Several European explorers visited the Caribbean area and the coast of the Americas following Columbus s voyages of discovery.

Today's sailors still take on the chal- lenge of circum- navigation — but not at Magellan's pace. The excite- ment now lies in setting — and breaking — speed records. One such recordholder is American Dodge Morgan. In 1986 Morgan sailed 25,671 miles around the world in 1 50 days: alone, nonstop, in a 60- foot sloop about half the size of Columbus's Santa Maria. Magellan's Voyage Balboa's expedition did, however, revive some hope of sailing west to reach Asia. Since only a strip of land, or isthmus, sep- arated the oceans in Panama, it was thought that perhaps there was a strait, or narrow waterway, between the two bodies of water. Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan believed he could find such a passage. Magellan hoped to sail around the world to the Spice Islands, a center for the valuable spice trade located in what is now Indonesia. After the king of Portugal refused to give him financial backing, Magellan approached King Charles I of Spain with his plan. A Spanish missionary to America, Bartoleme de Las Casas, described this meeting: Magellan brought with him a well-painted globe, and thereon traced the course he proposed to take. . . he intended to follow the coast up [south] until he found the strait [passage to the other ocean.] The Spanish king agreed to finance Magellan, and in 1519 Magellan set sail with 5 ships. By October 1520, Magellan had reached the strait that now bears his name at the southern tip of South Ameri- ca. The strait, with its fierce winds and strong tides, was so ditficult to navigate that it took over a month for the expedi- tion to finally enter the waters south of the isthmus. Because the ocean seemed so calm, Magellan called it the Pacific, mean- ing \"peaceful. \" During the voyage across the Pacific that followed, the sailors suf- fered extreme hardships from a lack of fresh food and water, and many died. Magellan met his own death in April 1521 as the result of a local war in the Philippines. Only one of his ships, carry- ing 18 survivors, finally reached Spain in 1522. These survivors and their ship were the first to circumnavigate the world. Magellan's expedition succeeded in reveal- ing the true size of the earth.

Four and a half centuries later, the first human to travel in space landed in a Russian field populated by a cow and two women. \"Have you come from outer space?\" the frightened women wanted to know. Yuri Gagaran assured them that he was a Soviet citizen, not a creature from another world. Early and modern explorers share more common experiences than one might expect. The level of technology has greatly changed during the course of history, but human nature has not. The basic theme of exploration is that it takes people into unknown realms. Test pilots have a phrase for it: pushing the envelope. Sailors of Columbus's time might have called it tempting tate. Columbus used only a compass and his knowledge of the seas to set a course. Aboard the Santa Maria was the most advanced nav- igational aid of the day, the astro- labe, but Columbus did not know how to use it. He calculated the ship's speed by timing how fast bubbles or objects on the ocean's surface passed astern. Lookouts at the top of the ship's mast — the fif- teenth-century version of radar — kept a sharp eye for signs of land. When Columbus landed at San Salvador, he thought he had found the East Indies. In 1969 Neil Arm- strong and Buzz Aldrin had land- ing radar, computers, and an autopilot to guide their descent to the moons surface. Yet despite Astronaut Robert Cnppeii in the cabin of Columbia their sophisticated gadgetry, they too did not know their precise location. Because they were headed for a crater, Armstrong manually piloted the Eagle to a smoother landing site. It took hours to pin- point their exact location using another ancient navigation aid, the sextant. Voyages of discovery throughout the ages have owed much to writ- ers who fired the imagination and inspired exploration. The findings of Creek geographer Ptolemy con- tributed to Columbus's inspiration through his calculating the circum- ference of the globe at 18,000 miles, making the distance between western Europe and east- ern Asia sound relatively short — and actually very much in error. By the time Columbus reached North America, he thought he had trav- eled far enough to be in India. Modern generations of explorers have been inspired and challenged by science fiction accounts of space travel. Fear of the unknown is another link between early and modern explorers. While well-read people of Columbus's day knew the world was round, there were nevertheless many unknown dangers awaiting them in vast uncharted areas beyond the primitive maps. So fearful were the sailors Columbus commanded that he kept two accounts of how far he estimated they had traveled. In a secret jour- nal he recorded how far he really thought the ship traveled each day. In the ship's log available to the crew, he put down a considerably lesser distance. Space travelers had worries like weightlessness and exposure to radiation in outer space. No one knew how the htunan body would react to floating for days where there was no up or down. Would the astronauts be able to swallow food? Would their hearts become weak from having to do less work? The problems facing early and modern explorers were different, but they all sprang from the same source — pushing the envelope. Making Connections 1.

Explorers heard stories of fabu- lously rich cities in the interior. Among the most vigorous in searching for trea- sure in the Americas were Spanish explor- ers. Their activities, along with those of the Christian missionaries who often accompanied them, would permanently change the world of the native peoples of the Americas. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe the Spanish exploration and conquest of the South and Central American mainlands. • Discuss life in the Spanish colonies. In the 25 years after Columbus's first voyage, Spaniards carved out small outposts through the West Indies — on Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and Hispariiola. Generally they were not inter- ested in creating permanent settlements in the Americas. Instead, they flocked to the islands in search of precious metals. The native Indians of these islands suffered greatly, however, because of Spanish ambition. The Conquistadores The many conquistadores (kohn KEES tub DOHR ays) — Spanish conquerors who made their way to the Caribbean islands in the late 1400s and early 1500s — were eager to find great wealth, especially gold and silver. They did not hesitate to use harsh means to obtain these precious met- als. The natives of the Caribbean, many of whom were enslaved and put to work washing for gold or raising crops, were virtually exterminated in less than 20 years. Many died of overwork. Most, however, succumbed to such European diseases as smallpox and measles, from which they had no immunity. By 1520 the Spanish were importing Africans as slaves to replace the Indian populations. The Spaniards did not confme them- selves to the Caribbean islands for very long. Stories of fantastic riches on the mainland soon sent bold Spanish adven- turers into the interior of Mexico, Central America, and South America. Among the most successful of these conquistadores was Hernan Cortes (kawr TEHZ). In 1519 Cortes led an expedition from Cuba to the eastern shore of Mexico. Although Cortes's army numbered only 600, the Spaniards had luck — and sophis- ticated weapons — on their side. The Spanish also had horses, which the Indi- ans had never seen, that they used in cav- alry charges. Cortes gained invaluable help from Doiia Marina, an enslaved native the Aztec had given to him. She may have told Cortes of Quetzalcoatl (keht SAHL KWAHT uhl), the legendary god who had promised to return as a fair-skinned man. When Cortes landed on the Mexican coast, reports of \"floating mountains bear- ing fair-skinned gods\" were sent to Moc- tezuma, the Aztec emperor. Moctezuma believed that Cortes may indeed have been Quetzalcoatl, and he sent the Spaniards dazzling gifts. Seeing this wealth, the Spaniards were determined to obtain more of it. 42 Unit 1 A New World: Prehistory- 1756"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"As Cortes marched inland toward the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan (tay Nt^HK tee LAHN), subjects of the Aztec allied with him, hoping to free themselves from Aztec rule.

The Spaniards soon feared that the Aztec would realize they were not gods. Therefore, to insure their salety, they took Moctezuma captive. They also looted the city of gold and silver. Eight months later, when Moctezuma was killed bv a stone thrown by one ot his subjects, the Aztec rose up against the Spanish. Many Spaniards were killed during a retreat. In 1521 Cortes returned to the Aztec capital, having amassed huge numbers ot Indian allies who wanted freedom from Aztec rule. He cut off supplies to Tenochtitlan and, after a long siege, clestroyed this city whose magnificence had so impressed him. Mexico City was built on its ruins, and the areas rich silver mines soon produced vast wealth. Ihe conquest of Mexico encouraged other conquistadores to seek vast riches in the Americas. One such co)iquistador was Francisco Pizarro, an illiterate soldier who had been stirred by rumors of fabulously rich cities on the Pacific coast of South America. In 1531 Pizarro set sail from Panama with an army of only 180 soldiers. His des- tiii.ition was the Inca empire in what is now Peru.

Born on an island off the Spanish coast, Juni'pero Serra became a Fran- ciscan priest and professor of philos- ophy. But he wanted to work as a missionary among American Indians, and in 1749 he left Spain for Mexico. At the age of 55, he was sent to take control of Upper California. He established a mission at San Diego, and later founded several missions stretching up the Calilornia coast to San Francisco. Taking as his motto \"Always go forward and never turn back,\" Juni'pero Serra traveled by foot Irom mission to mission, making sure that Indians were not abused. native tales of a wondrous fountain whose water would restore youth. In 1513 he set sail northward in search ol this magical fountain. When the Spaniards reached land near what is now the city of St. Augustine, they named the area Florida for the blooming wild flowers and fra- grant plants. De Leon never found the mythical \"Fountain ol Youth,\" but he claimed the land for Spain. After 1 542 the Spanish worked to con- solidate their empire in South America, Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Because the northern lands did not provide the riches the Spanish had found in the south, the northern bor- derlands were considered unsuitable for colonization. Colonial Life The people of Spain's American colonies formed a structured society, where posi- tion was determined by birth, income, and education. At the top were peninsulares — high government and church officials who had been born in Spain. Below the penin- sulares were Creoles — those born in the Spanish colonies of Spanish parents. Many Creoles were wealthy, but the high colonial positions were reserved only for peninsulares. Mestizos (meh STEE ZOHS), those born of Indian and Spanish parents, made up the next level of colonial society. At the lowest levels of society were Indi- ans, African slaves, and mulattoes — peo- ple of Spanish and African or Indian and African ancestry. Many people in the Spanish colonies lived under the encomienda system. Through this system the Spanish monarch rewarded conquistadores and others with vast tracts of land and the right to demand both taxes and labor from the Indians who lived on the land. The encomenderos were supposed to protect the Indians, teach them Catholicism, and pay them for their labor. In reality, the Span- ish colonists often treated the natives cru- elly, overworking them, and using their forced labor to gain vast personal wealth. The mingling of Spanish and Indian cultures produced a new kind of society in the Spanish colonies.

The Spanish introduced Euro- pean crops, such as wheat, alfalfa, oranges, and figs. Their livestock — horses, cattle, and chickens — were also introduced as well as iron products, wheeled carts, and firearms. Likewise, products from the Americas made significant changes in Europe when the Spaniards returned with plants they had first sighted among native cul- tures. For example, the American Indian potato radically decreased Europeans' reliance on flour — to the extent that towns whose economies centered around mills declined. Spain's system for governing its huge colonial empire included the appointment of viceroys — Spanish nobles appointed by the monarch to look after the interests ot the crown. The Spanish monarch also set up a special court in Mexico City known as the audiencia. The purpose of this court was to oversee the viceroys and con- trol the behavior of the conqtdstadores. It also was supposed to provide a lorum for justice to the native peoples. The Spaniards established missions in their colonies, from which clergy could convince Indians to become loyal Spanish subjects and Catholics. Some priests sought to protect the natives from the conquistadores. Father Bartolome de Las Casas insisted that, like all humans, Indi- ans were children ot God and therefore should be protected by the Church and the king. Spanish priests also founded missions in the northern part of Spain's empire. Beginning in 1769 Father Junipero Serra began a chain of missions in California. A road linking these missions was called The Royal Highway, or El Camiiio Real (EHL kah MEE noh ray AHL). Presidios, or forts, were generally built nearby to protect the missions. Native peoples were taken from their own settle- ments and brought to the missions to be fed, clothed, and taught F.uropcan meth- ods of agriculture and handicrafts.

Conquistadores such as Cortes in Mexico and Pizarro in Peru extended the Spanish empire by conquering and looting the Indian nations. The Spanish then mined vast amounts of gold and sil- ver, using native peoples and later Africans as slave labor. In the North American borderlands, Spanish explorers found little wealth, so colonization was very slow.

In this search they explored the northern regions of the con- tinent. Unlike the Spanish, though, they did not quickly establish colonies. For the first century or so, these nations' activities in the New World were neither as far- reaching nor as forceful as those ot Spain. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe early English exploration ol North America. • Discuss French and Dutch colonization in North America. Altiiough the Flnglish participated in early voyages of exploration, they failed to establish perma- nent colonies in America until the early 1600s. Poor finances, religious confiict at home, preoccupation with col- onizing Ireland, and the ihreat o[ war with Spain overshadowed English interest in ihe New World. Yet it was these early explorations by ihe English that gave them claim to land for later colonization in North America. In 1497 King Henry VII of England authorized John Cabot \"to sayle to all partes, countreys, and seas, of the East, of the West, and of the North\" and to dis- cover new lands unknown to Christians. English merchants hoped that Cabot would discover a route to Asia. Cabot explored the shores of present-day Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Labrador. Like Columbus, Cabot believed he had found Asia. But when a second expedition found only the barren coasts of Labrador and Greenland, English interest in west- ward exploration and settlement waned. Rivalry Between England and Spain By the 1570s, however, Queen Eliza- beth I became increasingly anxious about Spain's growing global power. Wishing to challenge Spain's influence in the New World — but tearing to do so openly — she secretly financed voyages by Martin Fro- bisher, whose purpose was to search for a northwest passage through North Amer- ica to Asia. Frobisher explored the Atlantic coast ol what is now Canada, but he too failed to find a route to the East. Elizabeth also gave her unofficial approval to piracy against Spanish ships and settlements. Daring English sea cap- tains, such as Francis Drake, cruised the shores of Spanish America, capturing trea- sure ships and looting towns. These English \"sea dogs\" inflicted heavy damage to the Spanish. Because Spain was still the strongest power in Europe, however, the English did not attempt colonization in America or take anv open action against the Spanish.

The Cajuns descended from French settlers driven from Acadia in 1755. Creoles are a mix of early French and Span- ish settlers. The eventual challenge to open conflict came from Spain rather than England. In 1588, seeking revenge for English attacks on Spanish ships and colonies, King Phillip II of Spain dispatched a huge fleet of ships, known as the Spanish Armada, to sail against the English fleet. The \"invincible armada\" included 130 ships, and 27,000 troops. Although the English fleet was greatly outnumbered, their ships were faster and far easier to handle than the slow, heavy Spanish galleons. The English ships attacked the Spanish vessels one by one. Before a Spanish galleon could get close enough for its soldiers to board an English warship, it was pounded by artillery. The result was devastating to the Spanish fleet. The badly damaged armada was forced up the English Channel and into the North Sea. A fierce storm off the coast of Scot- land further crippled the Spanish fleet. Only 60 to 70 ships returned to Spain. In a single battle, Spain had lost most ot its naval forces; they could no longer be con- sidered the dominant power on the sea. The way was now cleared lor English col- onization in the Americas. French Presence in America French colonization in North America began relatively late.

Verrazano sailed the Atlantic coast from Newfoundland south to North Carolina. In 1534 Jacques Carri- er made the first of three voyages to northern North America, searching for the elusive passage. Although he explored the St. Lawrence River as far as what is now Montreal, he also failed to find the passage. While French fishers sometimes visited North American waters, it was not until the early 1600s that the French made a serious attempt to establish a colony. In 1608 Samuel de Champlain founded Quebec on the banks of the St. Lawrence River. Few French settlers, how- ever, were attracted to this northern out- post. In 1609 Champlain joined the Algonquian and Huron peoples in a raid against the Iroquois confederacy. Cham- plain described the hostilities: When I saw them getting ready to shoot their arrows at us, I leveled my arquebuse [gun]. . . and aimed straight at one of the three chiefs. The shot brought down two and wounded another The Iroquois were greatly astonished and frightened to see two of their men killed so quickly. . . they abandoned the field and fled into the depth of the forest. As a result of this battle, the Iroquois, the most formidable warriors in eastern North America, became sworn enemies of the French. This enmity was to have far- reaching effects on American history. The French were generally confined to the northern part of North America until the late 1600s. In 1673 Louis Joliet, an American-born fur trader, and the K'suit priest Jacques Marquette embarked on a search for a river known to native Ameri- cans as the \"big river\" — the Mississippi. They canoed from St. Ignace on the northern tip of Lake Michigan to the Mississippi along inland waterways and followed it as far as the Arkansas River. In 1682 Robert de La Salle followed the Mis- sissippi to its delta and claimed the vast lands drained by it for France. He named the region Louisiana after the French king, Louis XIV. The colonies established by France in North America formed a long string of outposts, extending from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada. Although French explorers were disappointed when they did not find gold and silver in North America, they soon found another kind of wealth — fur. Beaver skins sent to France and made into hats were a particularly profitable item in the fur trade. Except with the Iroquois, the French generally had better relations with native Americans than did the Spanish.

Secondly, most French rulers were more interested in extending their rule over European territo- ry than in settling North America. In addition, the French missed an opportuni- ty to gain an energetic group of settlers when they forbade French Protestants, known as Huguenots, to settle in America. J Persecuted in France, many Huguenots would have gladly emigrated to America. The Dutch in America Like the French, the Dutch were late in setting up colonies in North America. By the 1600s the Dutch had ousted the Por- tuguese from the spice trade. They con- trolled the East Indies, set up the only trading post in Japan, maintained many West African slave ports, established a colony in Cape Town, South Africa, and had holdings in the Caribbean islands. Dutch ventures on the North American continent were not nearly so impressive. In 1609 the Dutch East India Company funded an expedition by an English navi- gator, Henry Hudson. He reached New York Harbor and sailed up the river, which today bears his name, as far as pre- sent-day Albany, New York. The Dutch soon set up trading posts on Manhattan Island, which they named New Amster- dam, and along the Hudson River. A profitable fur trade was established with the Indians. To attract settlers to New Netherland, the Dutch West Indies Company promised to give huge tracts of land along the Hudson and Delaware rivers to pro- prietors if at least SO people could be hired and kept on the land. Few settlers, however, were interested. Although the Dutch colony was small, it contained a remarkable ethnic mix.

Several cen- turies later — in search ot an ocean route to Asia — Columbus discovered the Americas, and Amerigo Vespucci recognized South America as a new conti- nent. An expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan finally circumnavigated the world and opened a water route around South America to Asia. Following their exploration, Spaniards exploited America for its gold and silver, conquering native Americans in Mexico and Peru. They used Indians and imported Africans as slave labor and relegated them to the bottom of the colonial class system. Although the Spanish borderlands of North America were not quickly settled, Spanish culture has influ- enced the language, religion, art and architecture of the American Southwest. In search of new lands and a northwest passage, English and French adventurers explored parts of North America.

To find this exact location on a map, simply find the correct latitudinal and longitudinal lines and follow them until they intersect. A gazetteer entry may also include other data such as historical information, population, altitude, and a map reference page.

Appointed for Forraigne [Foreign] Plantacons [Plantations], 1660 Section Focus In the century following Columbus's discovery, England's response to Spanish enterprise in America was nothing more creative than piracy of Spanish commerce on the seas. By 1600, however, England had a naval power in the Atlantic, ade- quate finances for colonization, and a sur- plus population willing to risk its life for religious, political, or economic reasons. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the effect of the environment on Virginia's settlement and lifestyle. • Describe the economic conditions that influenced the development of the Southern Colonies. As early as 1578, Sir Humphrey Gilbert and his half-brother Sir Walter Raleigh tried to plant a permanent English colony in North America. But on Gilbert's voyage back to England, his ships were lost at sea. In 1587 Raleigh sent 91 men, 17 women, and 9 children to settle on Roanoke Island near the coast of what is now North Carolina. He named the land \"Vir- ginia,\" in honor of the \"Virgin Queen, \" Elizabeth I. The effort failed because Spanish control of the Atlantic delayed Raleigh's efforts to resupply the colony until after England defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588. When English ships finally returned to Roanoke, they found none of the settlers. The only clue left behind was a word carved on a tree — CROATOAN, the name of nearby Indians and of a nearby island. The fate of the \"Lost Colony\" remains a mystery. Jamestown, 1607 In 1606 King James I created the Vir- ginia Company from two separate groups of merchants who had petitioned for per- mission to found colonies. Two divisions, the Virginia Company of London and the Virginia Company of Plymouth, were granted exclusive settlement rights in North America. The London group's charter permitted the planting of a colony in Virginia, where, it was believed, pre- cious metals abounded. In 1607 the London Company sent out 3 ships carrying 144 settlers. After being driven back by Indians on the first attempted landing in Virginia, they sought a more secure place for a settle- ment on a peninsula 60 miles up the James River. There they founded Jamestown, naming both the river and the town for their king. The long ocean voyage, an outbreak of disease in the swampy and unhealthy settlement site, Indian attacks, and star- vation worked against the Jamestown colonists. Captain John Smith led the 56 Unit 1 A New Wori.d: Prehistory- 1756"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"colony through some of its most trying times. Mixing friendship, force, bluff, and bargaining, he saved the starving colony by trading beads, knives, pots, and fish hooks for corn, vegetables, turkeys, and venison from the Indians. Yet the arrival of supply ships early the next year found only 38 colonists still alive. Some of Jamestown's difficulties result- ed from the London Company's poor management. Houses and buildings were the immediate need for the colonists, but the company had sent only four carpen- ters. Jamestown was a business venture tor the London Company, expected to make a profit for its shareholders. For this rea- son the company supplied jewelers and goldsmiths and \"gentlemen\" who wanted to look for gold — not carpenters to build houses or farmers to raise crops for sur- vival. The tragic result was that most of the 500 colonists who came in the first few years died. Only 60 survived the \"starving time,\" the winter of 1609 to 1610. George Percy, one of the survivors of the first settlement, wrote of the suffer- ings at Jamestown: Our men were destroyed with cniell diseases as Swellings, Flixes, Burning Fevers, and by warres, and some departed suddenly, but for the most part they died of mere famine.

To meet ttiis need planters often bought and sold slaves. How did Vir' ginia law make slavery a permanent condition? Effective leadership might have spared Jamestown these hardships. As it was, John Smith, injured in a gunpowder explosion, had returned to England in 1609 and not until 1611 was the compa- ny able to supply a new governor. Life of the Times Bride Ships The first colonists sent by the London Company in 1607 to Jamestown were men. Women did not arrive in the colony until sev- eral years later. The population remained heavily male for nearly two decades. A ratio of 15 men to 1 woman ivas the norm. Indeed, the lack of females hin- dered the London Company's plan for the colony's growth and economic success. Although the cultivation of robaccD assured the sta- bility of the Virginia colony, the London Com- pany decided that \"The Plantacion can never flourish till families be planted and the respect of wives and Children fix the people on the Soyle.\" In 1619 the members of the first legislative assembly agreed: \"In a newe plantation it is not knowen whether man or women be more necessary.\" To solve the problem of the shortage of women, the London Company sent the first \"bride ship\" to America. Its pas- sengers included nearly 100 \"young, hand- some, and honestly educated maids\" suitable for marriage. Cost of transport for these maidens was paid by the London Company. The average payment for a bride by a Virginia colonist was 120 pounds of tobacco, or about $20.00. After a few instances in which a woman became engaged to two men at the same time, the London Company stopped send- ing bride ships. Instead, a type of travel brochure was written boasting of the advan- tages of living in the New World. Mismanagement eventually cost the London Company its charter. By 1616 the investment made by company share- holders had brought no real profits. The company's reform program of 1618 expanded land sales, extended English law and rights to colonists, and allowed set- tlers to elect a representative assembly. Soon after, new recruits, including various craftspeople, arrived in Virginia. But even an additional 4,000 settlers did not end Virginias troubles. Poor treatment of nearby Indians resulted in an attack that cost 350 lives. A royal investigation found that the badly governed settlers were dying faster than they could be replaced. King James I dissolved the company and took control of the colony in 1624. Growth of Virginia The difference in climate between En- gland and Virginia meant that the settlers would learn to raise new crops. From the native peoples they learned to grow corn, beans, and squash, but these did not make money for the London Company share- holders. After the company lost its char- ter, Virginia found a profitable cash crop — tobacco. Introduced by the Indi- ans, the use of tobacco soon became pop- ular in England despite the fact that King James I wrote a book in which he called it \"a custom Loathsome to the eye, hateftil to the Nose, harmfulle to the Braine, daungerous to the Lungs.\" The native Virginia tobacco was of poor quality com- pared with that from the Spanish Caribbean islands, but in 1612 John Rolte secured and planted some West Indies tobacco seeds. After this, Virginia's tobac- co exports grew rapidly. In 1640 almost 1.5 million pounds of tobacco entered the port of London. Tobacco, a labor-intensive crop, pro- duced a great demand for colonists. Thou- sands of settlers came to Virginia, lured by the promise of free farmland. But this source of labor was not enough. Homeless children from the streets of London were sent to serve as apprentices to trades peo- ple in the colony. Convicts, farmers who had lost their lands, and the poor also came. Those who could not pay their own 58 Unit 1 A New World: Prehistory-1756"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"way became indentured servants, working from tour to seven years to pay off their passage across the Atlantic. Land was a source of wealth and social status in England. Consequently, the Lon- don Company's directors offered 50 acres to settlers who paid their own fare to Virginia or sent someone else. Wealthy settlers who acquired plantations used indentured ser- vants as laborers. After the period of inden- ture, they were free to start their own farms. In 1619 a Dutch warship brought 20 enslaved Africans to Jamestown. Virginians, desiring an additional source ot labor for their tobacco fields, purchased the slaves. At first Africans were treated somewhat like indentured servants, many earning their freedom by several years ot work. Slavery was first recognized in Virginia law in 166L The following year, Virginia law declared that the status of a newborn child depended on the status of the mother. Slavery became a permanent, inherited condition. From 1600 to 1850 Europeans brought 15 million enslaved West Africans to the Americas. Before 1600 Africans had used prisoners ot war and criminals as slaves. Europeans, however, sold enslaved people lor profit. Most enslaved Africans were taken to the plantations of the West Indies. Virginians continued to use indentured ser- vants as the primary labor supply until 1 670. Then changing economic conditions in Virginia made African slaves more desir- able than indentures.

Then the Lon- don brokers founded the first English stock exchange. Not all the trading companies made money. England's Virginia Company was a costly failure, as were other European companies.

Frontier settlers charged that the government, controlled by eastern planters, tailed to protect them from the Indians. In June 1676, Nathaniel Bacon, a freedman of the frontier, brought together many people who were angry with the government of Virginia in the largest popular revolt before the American Revolu- tion. In September Bacon's force burned Jamestown; Bacon died of dysentery, how- ever, in October. Leaderless, the rebellion lost its momentum, and the governor of the colony took revenge on 23 of Bacon's fol- lowers by hanging them. The potential menace of these unem- ployed people caused wealthy planters to rely less upon indentured servants and more upon enslaved people. Unlike inden- tures, slaves could be denied their freedom permanently and could be punished with- out appeal to the courts. Because they were black, identification was easy and escape difficult. African slavery expanded rapidly in Virginia after 1670. Planters with the most land and slaves soon held the highest social status and had the strongest influ- ence in Virginia's government. In the London Company's first charter of Virginia (1606) the king of England had agreed that: . . . all and every of.... Our subjects, which shall dwell and inhabit ...the said several colonies and plantations, . . . shall have and enjoy all liberties, franchises and immunities ...to all intents and purposes, as if they had been abiding and horn within this Our Realm of England. . . . 60 Unit 1 A New World: Prehistory-1756"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"While colonial charters extended the rights of the English people to the colonists, the government in England exercised only loose control over its Amer- ican colonies. Eventually the colonists enjoyed more self-government than the English at home. In the beginning Virginia had been strictly ruled by a council and an appoint- ed governor with almost absolute power. In 1619, however, the London Company gave the settlers a voice in the government by permitting the first representative assembly in America, the House of Burgesses. These burgesses and a council appointed by the governor together had power to make laws. When King James I took control from the London Company, making Virginia a royal colony, he appointed the governor but allowed the House ol Burgesses to continue. Over the years the House of Burgesses gained more power. Eventually it assumed control over taxes that paid the governors and other officials' salaries — the \"power of the purse.\" Other Southern Colonies In 1632 King Charles I gave his friend George Calvert, Lord Baltimore, a grant of 10 million acres north of Virginia. Calvert became proprietor ot the colony, meaning that he had authority over its government. By 1634 his son, Cecil Calvert, sent the first 200 settlers to Maryland, named at Charles Is suggestion after his Catholic queen, Henrietta Maria. From the beginning the Calverts intended Maryland to be a refuge for Catholics. Soon, however, more Protestants than Catholics were arriving. To protect Catholics from persecution, Cecil, the second Lord Baltimore, offered religious freedom to all Christian settlers. Later the legislative assembly ol Maryland affirmed this freedom by the Religious Toleration Act of 1649, the first of its kind in America. Necessity prompted religious toleration in Maryland, but nothing advanced women's rights. Margaret Brent was an able administrator of the Calvert estates, whose judgmeni had helped prevent an armed revolt. The assembly, however, denied her request for the right to vote. Like Virginia, Maryland grew tobacco. Because of extensive farming, its towns were few and small. Baltimore, the chief city, had only 7,000 inhabitants by 1765. Profits from tobacco in Virginia and Maryland enticed other English nobles to become proprietors of colonies farther south along the Atlantic coast. In 1663 eight nobles received from Charles II a grant to settle Carolina. Land in northern Carolina attracted pioneer farmers from Virginia. From the start, this was an area ol subsistence farming where farmers grew only enough to live on and sometimes a _p..» f o^ 7 Margaret Brent i6oi(?)-i67i(?)

As northern Carolina grew, its principal exports became naval stores — tar, pitch, and turpentine — products of its pine for- ests that are used in ship-building. Southern Carolina offered a better har- bor than in the north and attracted more settlers. The first English colonists came from the West Indies island of Barbados to found the only major city in the South, Charles Town — present-day Charleston — in 1669. Some of these settlers had used slave labor on their sugar plantations in the Caribbean. With the knowledge of rice-growing that enslaved Africans brought from their homelands, these set- tlers built great plantations, importing many more slaves to work the malaria-rid- den fields. Eliza Lucas, a settler from the West Indies, introduced the growing of indigo, a plant that produced a blue dye. By 1746 indigo had also become an important cash crop grown for export. Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, one of the proprietors, persuaded John Locke, an English political philosopher, to write a framework of government for South Car- olina. The result was The Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina, providing for a legislature of weathly nobles chosen by landholders. The proprietors surrendered control in 1729, and the king made both Carolinas royal colonies. Georgia, named after King George II, was the last of the 13 English colonies. Its proprietor, James Oglethorpe (OH guhl THAWRP), a wealthy philanthropist and soldier, wanted Georgia to be both a refuge for poor English debtors and a mil- itary outpost against the Spaniards in Florida. The first settlement, founded in 1733, was Savannah. At first, Oglethorpe governed with strict controls, forbidding slavery and rum and controlling land sales. These restrictions limited Georgia's growth, causing some unhappy settlers to move across the border to South Carolina. In the 1740s the trustees who controlled Georgia lifted the restrictions against slavery and rum. They also gave the colonists an elected assembly, but Georgia failed to prosper until after control was returned to the king in 1752. iJU Section One Review ••**••• Summary The London Company settled Virginia.

Its only accomplishment was sending Captain John Smith to explore the region north of Virginia, which he named \"New England.\" NXTien New En- gland was settled, it was by accident rather than design, by people seeking a religious haven, not investors seeking a fortune. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the relationship of church and state in the New England colonies. • List three reasons why self government developed in the New England col- onies. The Church of England — the Anglican Church — broke away from the Catholic Church in 1534. Some Anglicans, called Puritans, believed that the Church of England had not done enough \"to purify\" itself of all symbols of Catholic worship. Most Puritans wanted to reform the Church of England. One group, called Separatists, believed that it was better to separate themselves entirely and to form their own church. Because the Anglican Church was the official state church. Sep- aratists, like all other religious dissenters, or protesters, faced persecution, jail, and even death. Separatists Move to Plymouth In 1607 a group of Separatists, soon to be known as Pilgrims, left England to escape persecution. They settled in Hol- land, (known today as The Netherlands) where, despite the freedom to worship as they pleased, they were dissatisfied. Their children grew up speaking a different lan- guage and learning new customs. Where might they maintain their language, cus- toms, and lorm of worship? America beckoned. In 1619 the Pilgrims secured a grant of land in Virginia from the London Compa- ny. After much preparation, in September 1620, 73 men and boys and 29 women and girls set sail on the Mayflower from Plymouth, England. In November the ship landed far to the north of Virginia at Cape Cod on the Massachusetts coast. Because they had no charter for an area outside the control of the London Company, the Pil- grims drew up and signed the Mayflower Compact, an agreement to live under the laws of the community. The Pilgrims searched for nearly a month before they found Plymouth har- bor. On December 25, they began to build the first large house for common use. In the bleak, cold, snowy New En- gland winter, the Pilgrims, like the Vir- ginia colonists, had their \"starving time.\" By spring almost half of them had died. Even the few survivors might have starved if it had not been for Squanto, an Indian who taught them about their new envi- ronment. William Bradford, one of the colonists, wrote that Squanto \"directed them how to set their corn, where to take fish, and to procure other commodities\" and that he was also their pilot \"to bring them to unknown places for their profit, and never left them until he died.\" CiiM'ii'K 3 Coi.oNiAi.

In 1621 the survivors elected Bradford governor, a post that he would hold for more than 30 years. In the spring they planted crops. A good harvest in the autumn and the arrival of more provisions on the ship For- tune inspired a day of thanksgiving to God. Additional settlers from England built a cluster ot small villages near Plymouth, but the colony never became very large. It elected its own officials and ran its own affairs until 1691, when it became part of the larger Massachusetts Bay Colony. Puritan Massachusetts In 1625 when Charles I became king of England, he decided to rule without Parliament and to suppress Puritanism. When friends of the king within the Church of England deprived Puritan min- isters of their pulpits, the dissenters turned their thoughts to America. Several prominent Puritans bought a trading company, changed its name to the Mas- sachusetts Bay Company, and secured a charter directly from the king. Twelve members signed an agreement at Cam- bridge in 1629: . . . [I]t is fully and faithfully agreed amongst us, . . . that we will so really endeavour the execution of this worke, as by God's assistance we will be ready in our persons, and with such. . .familyes as are to go with us, ...to embark for the said plantation by the first of March next This marked the beginning of the great Puritan migrations to New England to build a Christian society they believed would be a lighthouse for all the world. The first governor of Massachusetts, John Winthrop, called the colony \"a city upon a hill.\" In 1630, 17 ships with about 1,000 Puri- tan settlers sailed for Massachusetts. Dur- ing the next 10 years, 20,000 settlers followed. Boston, the leading town, and surrounding settlements such as Dor- chester, Roxbury, Watertown, and Charles- town, flourished. When they left England, the Puritans thought of themselves as members of the Anglican Church. As they settled Mas- sachusetts, they organized their churches under ministers elected by each congrega- tion, or a body of church members. The ministers set about reforming religious ceremonies, while the congregation became the final authority on church decisions. Compared to the Anglican clergy, the New England minister had limited authority. He was to teach, preach, pray, and administer; but the congregation held power over member- ship and church discipline. In the Ameri- can colonies, the Puritans became known as Congregationalists. The Massachusetts Bay charter, unlike those of other colonies, did not specify the location of the company's headquar- ters or where its shareholders' meetings would be held. Taking advantage of this loophole, the shareholders voted to move the company from England to Mas- sachusetts. Winthrop carried the charter across the Atlantic Ocean, where share- holders would have more freedom from the king's control. Upon arriving in America, Winthrop transformed The Massachusetts Bay Company from a trad- ing company into a commonwealth, a self-governing political unit, the first of its kind in America. At first, the few shareholders of the Massachusetts Bay Company, called \"freemen,\" held all the power in the colony. Under Winthrop, they made up the General Court, or the lawmaking body. Soon, however, over 100 colonists demanded to be admitted to the compa- ny as freemen. Under pressure, Winthrop consented. A law passed in 1631 gave all Puritan men who were church members admission to the 64 Unit 1 A New Wori.D: Prehistory- 1756"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"General Court as freemen. When the population grew too large to operate the government in this way, the Mas- sachusetts Bay Company allowed the free men in each town to elect two represen- tatives to the General Court. What be- gan as a directors' meeting of a trading company ended up as a colonial legisla- ture with power to make law. Dissent and Division The Puritans who came to Mas- sachusetts to worship as they pleased had no intention of granting this freedom to others. They drove out Baptists, Quakers, and others who disagreed with them on religious issues. Others simply left to find more fertile farmland. Those who left Massachusetts founded other colonies in New England. Roger Williams arrived in the Mas- sachusetts Bay Colony in 1631. According to William Bradford, Williams was \"a man godly and zealous but very unsettled in judgment.\" When Williams became pastor ol a church in Salem, he began to raise embarrassing issues. He preached that the church and the government should be separate because concern with political affairs would corrupt the church, and he asserted that the colonists had no right to settle on the land unless they bought it from the Indians. Finally, he challenged the right of Puritan rulers to compel people to engage in religious ser- vices. Because Williams's views threatened basic Puritan ideas, Winthrop and the Examining Fine Art Several Indians are present in this painting of the first Thanksgiving in the Plymouth colony.

In 1636, with sev- eral followers from Massachusetts Bay, he started the colony of Rhode Island on land purchased from the native Ameri- cans. The new colony, chartered in 1644, welcomed Jews as well as all Christians, and guaranteed their religious freedom. In Rhode Island church and state were com- pletely separate, a principle that was to become an important part of America's political heritage. Not long after Williams departed, Mas- sachusetts faced a similar challenge. Anne Hutchinson began to openly challenge Puritan ministers and their interpretations of the Bible. When her teachings attracted a growing band of disciples and threat- ened the serenity of Boston, authorities brought her to trial. Ordered to leave the colony, she went to Rhode Island to begin a new settlement later called Portsmouth. In 1637 the Reverend John Wheel- wright, one of the few ministers Anne Hutchinson admired, was also expelled from Massachusetts for criticizing Puri- tan teaching. He and his followers settled in New Hampshire. Following the exam- ple of the Mayflower Compact, they cre- ated and signed the Exeter Compact and set up a civil government. In 1679 New Hampshire obtained a charter from King Charles II. Other pioneer settlers pushed farther north into Maine, which remained part of Massachusetts until 1820. In 1636 settlers who wanted richer farmland and more freedom followed Thomas Hooker, a Puritan minister, to the fertile valley of the Connecticut River. Hartford and a series of other \"river towns\" sprang up along the river from Saybrook to Springfield. In 1662 these communities annexed New Haven and other towns to form the colony of Connecticut. In 163') the colony adopted the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, the first written constitution, or plan of governmciu in America.

Pastorius German Settler in Pennsylvania, 1 700 Section Focus From 1640 to 1660 a bitter struggle for power between the king and Parliament postponed further colonization in Ameri- ca. Parliament overthrew King Charles I in 1649 and established a commonwealth under Puritan Oliver Cromwell. When the monarchy was restored in 1660, the new king, Charles II, revived English interest in starting new colonies. He rewarded some ot his supporters by grant- ing them proprietorships. These became the Middle Colonies. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe the role of proprietors in the development of the Middle Colonies. • Give reasons for Pennsylvania's rapid growth. England's neglect of ihe American colonies between 1640 and 1660 enabled traditions of self-govern- ment to firmly develop in Ameri- ca. Colonial legislatures in New England and the South made their own laws, and local courts enforced them. Colonists fre- quently defied or ignored orders from England and even from their own colonial governors. The Middle Colonies also developed a degree of independence from England, primarily because of the authori- ty the king gave his proprietors. These proprietors permitted their colonists to elect representative assemblies, not because they wanted to surrender power, but because they found it a good way to attract and keep settlers. Proprietors had learned that more settlers meant greater profits. Ne'w Netherland Becomes New York In 1664 King Charles II granted his brother James, the Duke of York, the land west and south of New England, from the Connecticut River to the Delaware River. He did this even though the territory had already been settled by the Dutch. For years the English had viewed the Dutch colony as a threat because of its trade, its expanding settlements, and its location as a wedge between New England to the north and Virginia to the south. Conse- quently, in 1664 the Duke of York sent a fleet of four English warships to capture the settlement of New Amsterdam. Peter Stuyvesant (STY vuh sant), the Dutch governor of New Netherland, tried to defend the colony. But he lacked the sup- port of his own colonists and was forced to surrender New Netherland without a struggle. The Duke of York did not hesi- tate to change the colony's name to New York. A series of governors appointed by the Duke of York ruled New York until 1683 when the Duke agreed to the colonists' demands for an elected representative assembly. Two years later, however, the Duke of York became King James II, making New York a royal colony. He pro- ceeded to dissolve the assembly and to return full power to the governor. When the English overthrew James II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Jacob Leis- ler, a German trader, led a rebellion in New York.

Among the sites found along its route are Wall Street, Times Square, and Span- ish Harlem. Examining Fine Art This view of Bethleiiem, Pennsylvania, was painted about 1757. Settled by German- speaking Moravians, Bettilehem had natural beauty, but life required hard work. What was the first major task in a new settlement? with an elected assembly that lasted until 1690, when a new British royal governor arrived in the colony. The new governor captured Leisler, tried him, and had him hanged. The governor, however, permit- ted the colony to continue to elect an assembly. New York's varied population included Dutch, Swedes, native Americans, Africans, Jews, some English and French settlers, and people of many other nationalities. But Dutch customs remained strong, and the Dutch Calvinist churches endured. The city, as it appeared in 1679, was described by a Dutch traveler, Jasper Dankers: [The fort] has only one gate, and that is on the land side, opening upon a broad plain or street, called the Broadway or Beaverway. Over this gate are the arms of the Duke of York We went on up the hill, along open roads and a little woods, through the first village, called Breukelen [Brooklyn], which has a small and ugly little church standing in the middle of the road. Several lactors delayed New York's rapid growth. Immigration was discouraged because large landowners called patroons still held much of the land along the f^udson River. The French in Canada prevented expansion to the north, and the powerftil Iroquois Confederacy blocked expansion westward. New York City's magnificent harbor made it a natural trade center, but for many years the small population of the colony did not supply enough goods for export. Ne'w Jersey Shortly after the Duke of York received his enormous grant of land in 1664, he started giving out parts of it to his friends. He gave New Jersey to John Lord Berke- ley and Sir George Carteret. Finding it sparsely inhabited, these proprietors offered religious freedom, large land grants, and the right for landowners to elect a legislative assembly. In 1674 Berkeley sold his proprietary rights in western New Jersey to a few members of a religious group called the Society of Friends, or Quakers, who were seeking refuge from persecution. In 1682 the heirs of Carteret sold eastern New Jer- sey to another group of Quakers. The English government created the royal colony of New Jersey by combining the two parts, placing it under the authority of the governor of New York in 1702. Not until 1738 was New Jersey given its own governor. Pennsylvania and Dela-svare William Penn started the most success- ful colony in America. The son of a British admiral, Penn won the favor of both King Charles II and King James II. But, to his father's dismay, Penn had joined the Quakers when he was a student at Oxford. Quakers were considered reli- gious radicals in England because they believed that paid clergy were unnecessary and that every person could know God's will through his or her own \"inner light.\" They also refused to perform military ser- vice, or to swear oaths. They were detest- ed in England and persecuted as anarchists in America. Neither his father's anger nor jail could make Penn give up his religious views, and King Charles II remained his friend. 70 Unit 1 A New World: Prehistory-1756"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Penn wanted to start a colony in America that would serve as a refuge for persecut- ed Quakers. After his father's death, Penn took advantage of a debt that Charles II owed Admiral Penn, asking the king for a grant of land in America. In 1681 Charles II made Penn the pro- prietor of a vast area west of the Delaware named \"Penn's Woods,\" or Pennsylvania. Arriving in Pennsylvania in 1682, Penn worked out a plan for a \"city of brotherly love,\" Philadelphia. His agents advertised for settlers in England, France, the Netherlands, and Germany. Their promises of religious freedom attracted many besides the Quakers, especially Germans. Because Penn believed in equality, he drew up a \"Frame of Government\" that provided for an elected council and an assembly. Pennsylvania gave the right to vote to a large number of colonists. Penn also insisted that the Indians be paid tor their land and be treated fairly. These measures meant rapid growth tor the colony. By the time Penn left lor En- gland in 1684, there were 7,000 colonists. When he returned in 1699, Philadelphia rivaled Boston and New York City as both a commercial and cultural center. Thou- sands of prosperous farms dotted the countryside. A boundary dispute with Maryland to the south led to the hiring of two surveyors. Mason and Dixon, to draw borders between the two colonies. This border, known as the Mason and Dixon line, later would become famous as the dividing line between slave states and nonslave states. In 1682 William Penn bought the three counties south of Pennsylvania along the Atlantic Coast from the Duke of York. These \"lower counties,\" known as Delaware, had first been settled by the Dutch, then the Swedes, before the English captured them in 1664. Although Delaware was not part of Penns grant from the king, he drew up a Charter ot Privileges, permitting the lower counties to elect their own assembly. Until the American Revolution, the governor of Pennsylvania also served as the governor ol Delaware.

A new environ- ment, a diversity of peoples, and new eco- nomic opportunities helped to produce a society uniquely American. The history of social development in colonial America is a story of progress for many, but it is blemished by the enslavement of Africans and the eviction of native Americans from their lands. It is not a simple tale — for social, political, economic, and reli- gious motivations all interacted to weave the fabric of colonial society. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe social class and the role of women in the colonies. • Identify the roles of indentured ser- vants and African Americans in the colonies. • Discuss the relationship between En- glish colonists and native Americans. By European standards the society ol Elizabethan England was remarkably mobile. An appren- tice might become rich and marry his daughter to a noble. In turn, a noble's younger son, who inherited no property, might become an apprentice or hire himself out as a soldier. English women were less restrained socially than the women on the Continent. Like En- gland, the colonies' social structure had many classes, but from the start it was more democratic. English society was aris- tocratic, dominated by great lords and ladies. Immigrants to America were most- ly common people, although social class in the colonies remained important. Colonial Social Classes In each of the 13 colonies there was an upper class, socially superior by law or custom. In New England, merchants, shipowners, and the clergy composed this class. In the South and along the Hudson River in New York, great landowners imi- tated the country gentry, or upper class, of England. Early colonial laws permitted only upper-class men to wear silver but- tons and upper-class women and girls to wear silk dresses. Social rank was indicat- ed on marriage certificates and even on tombstones. Near the bottom of society were inden- tured servants, bound by contract to work in the colonies in return for their passage to America. When the contract expired, the servant was free to work for wages. Because labor was scarce, wages in the colonies were 2 or 3 times those in Eng- land. In some colonies after the term of indenture, the law gave each person as much as 50 acres of land. Indentured ser- vants could move up in society. For exam- ple, in the 1660s 13 of 28 members of the Virginia House of Burgesses had come to the colony as indentured servants. For most people, life in colonial Ameri- ca was better than it had been in Europe. Still, many died within the first year because of hardships encountered during the ocean voyage. Frontier settlements faced conflict with Indians, starvation due to crop failures, disastrous fires, and epi- demics of smallpox, dysentery, malaria, diphtheria, and yellow fever. By the 1700s conditions had improved, although epidemics continued to make life uncertain. There was widespread pros- perity — a product ol cheap land, a ready 72 Unit 1 A New World: Prehistory- 1756"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"market for colonial exports, and hard work. Idleness was generally regarded as a sin like drunkenness or gluttony. There were few beggars and paupers. Organized crime was almost unknown, except tor occasional piracy on the high seas and banditry on the frontier. Just as there were few beggars at the bottom, thete were tew idle rich at the top. Many of the wealthi- est people, whether New England mer- chants, Hudson Valley patroons, or Virginia plantation owners, habitually rose at dawn and worked until dark. The population of the American colonies was diverse. By 1775 people ot English origin accounted for just under halt the population. The high birth rate — an average of seven births per woman in New England — and the long period of colonial history — 1607 to 1776 — meant that most of these were born in the colonies. From about the time of the founding of Pennsylvania in 1681, people of different European nationalities and religions — Scots, Irish Catholics, French Huguenots, Spanish Jews, and German Protestants — arrived in increasing num- bers. Together with the Dutch in New York, these accounted lor nearly one-third of the colonists. Beginning in Virginia in 1619, the first African slaves were brought by the Dutch from the West Indies. Africans, both slave and free, made up about 20 percent of the total population. Like the English, by 1775 most of these had been born in America. The proportion of African Americans was highest in the Southern Colonies because slave labor proved prof- itable on rice and tobacco plantations. In South Carolina three out of four people were African slaves. Women in the Colonies English colonial population grew rapidly because proportionately there were more women than in the Spanish and French colonies. Colonial women were considered fortunate because they easily found hus- bands. The only respectable career tor women at thai lime was thought to be marriage. As in all European societies of the time, women were denied higher education. Women generally married in their early twenties and had five or six children. Their principal task was rearing children, although most women died dur- ing the child-bearing years. The second occupation for most women was farming. A farm could not carry on without the skills of women in making cloth, garments, candles, soap, and bread- stuffs. Life on the frontier made women more self-reliant. A visitor to the North Carolina- Virginia backcountry in 1710 gave this description of a frontierswoman: . . . [S]he is a very civil woman and shows nothing of ruggedness or Immodesty in her carriage, yett she will carry a gunn in the woods and kill deer, turkeys, etc., shoot down wild cattle, catch and tye hoggs, knock down beeves with an axe and perform the most manful exercises.

When seafaring New England husbands left their wives, sometimes for years at a time, women were successful as merchants or storekeep- ers. Widespread home manufacturing allowed wives to learn trades. Some women were printers, newspaper publish- ers, druggists, and doctors. Colonial laws gave women more protec- tion than English laws. In England, for example, the common law allowed a hus- band to beat his wife but only with a \"rea- sonable instrument\"; according to Massachusetts law, he could beat her only in self-defense. Slavery in the Colonies At first it was not clear that enslaved Africans were to be treated differently from white indentured servants. Gradual- ly legal distinctions were adopted. Inden- tured servants retained the rights of English people and the protection of the law. Africans were protected by no law or tradition. While the Catholic Church in the Spanish colonies offered some protec- tion to enslaved people, no similar insti- tution protected them in the English colonies. The South gave slave marriages no legality and children could be sold away from their mothers. Slaves could own no property and had little legal pro- tection against irresponsible or cruel own- ers. Practically, their protection was only their value to the owner who provided food, clothing, and shelter to keep them reasonably healthy. Slave labor was well adapted to the southern plantation system, where the work was done in fields and easily over- seen. The profits of large plantations made slavery seem necessary to the Souths prosperity. Southern colonial laws declared blacks to be enslaved lor life, and their children after them. It was illegal to teach Africans to read for fear that learning would spoil them for physi- cal labor. There were, in the South, own- ers who disapproved of slavery but hesitated to ftee their slaves because free blacks faced serious discrimination. In addition, whites feared them as possible leaders of slave insurrections. So most southern colonies passed laws that made it difficult or impossible to give enslaved people their freedom. In the North, slavery was less profitable and enslaved people less numerous. New England, not only allowed, but required people who were enslaved to marry; they could acquire property' and testify in court. An owner might punish a slave, but an owner who killed a slave could be charged with murder. A growing number of people argued that slavery was a moral wrong. In 1700 Samuel Sewall, a Mas- sachusetts judge, published The Selling of Joseph, a pamphlet that maintained that slavery was contrary to the Bible. In Pennsylvania, Quakers and Mennonites, a German religious sect, denounced slav- ery. The number of free blacks increased, and a few even became prosperous. In Jaffrey, New Hampshire, Amos Fortune bought other blacks out of slavery and left money for the town school. But the northern colonies did not permit equali- ty to free blacks. Custom usually kept them in menial positions, and the laws denied them the right to vote or hold office. Native Americans and Colonists The first meetings between English set- tlers and Indians gave little evidence to the eventual destruction of the native Americans ways of life. A few colonial leaders, notably Roger Williams and William Penn, tried to treat them fairly, and some Protestant ministers regarded the Indians principally as souls to be brought to knowledge of Christ. The expansion of colonial farms into Indian lands became the principal cause of numerous conflicts. The colonists rea- soned that since the Indians did not have settled dwellings, but were on the move like \"the foxes and wild beasts... so it is lawful now to take a land which none useth; and make use of it.\" The historian James Truslow Adams wrote: 74 Unit 1 A New World: Prehistory- 1756"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"SK when a French trader or trapper phinged into the forest, and the green leaves closed behind him, it was to mingle with the life of the natives, which, in its main aspects, flowed on uninterrupted by his presence. When, on the other hand . . . the English frontier crept everfirthcr and farther inland, and town succeeded town, it was as if, adding stone to stone, great dikes were being built, which more and more dammed up the waters of native life. iJuBG Some of the conflicts resulted from great misunderstandings each culture had of the other's vakies. Europeans viewed land ownership as essential to an individ- ual's progress. Individual Indians did not own land, but jointly shared territory with all the members of the group. Native Americans who sold or by treaty gave up lands, did so without any authority, since no chief could dispose of land. Colonists justified wars against native Americans in many ways. Some Puritan ministers even claimed that Indians were children of the devil, so they could be killed in good conscience. Individually, a colonist may not have been a match for the Indian brave who had learned the art of war in struggles over territory with other Indians, but because ot sheer numbers and weapons the whites were destineci to win. They also had grim allies in diseases such as smallpox. European diseases sometimes wiped out whole Indian communities because the native Americans had not developed immunities. Of the estimated 120,000 native Americans who had lived in the area occupied by the 13 colonies, perhaps only 20,000 survived.

The indentured servants could improve their standing once free. Women could not vote, but they were full partners in running farms and sometimes businesses. Enslaved Africans became property, with no legal protection in the South. In the North, opposition to slavery began to grow. Thousands of native Americans perished in battles with colonists and in epidemics. Checking for Understanding 1. Identify Iroquois Confederacy 2. Discuss the social class system in the colonies. 3.

'Tis partly that so you may think on the Scriptures in the midst of your occupations. — Cotton Mather Puritan minister, in a sermon, 1701 Section Focus Colonial society developed from British foundations. By the mid- 1700s, however, colonial society differed from Britain in many ways. This was partly because the colonies were a haven for a variety of reli- gious beliefs. Religious toleration became necessary in colonies where no one church dominated. In many areas the church was at the center of community life and the clergy, in many cases, swayed political decisions. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain why religious toleration and freedom developed during the colonial period. • Identify three sources of democratic government and individual rights in the colonies. In the South the planter aristocracy usually belonged to the Anglican Church, while the middle and poorer classes included Roman Catholics, Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians. In New England the great majority of the people were Puritan Congregationalists, but there were small groups of other Protestant sects. The Middle Colonies had the greatest variety — Dutch Calvinists, German Lutherans, Scot Presbyterians, Mennonites, Jews, Quakers, and Presbyte- rians. In New England and the Southern Colonies, a single official church was \"established\" — that is, supported by taxes. The Colonial Mind Although many people came to Ameri- ca to worship as they pleased, this did not mean that they were ready to grant others the same privilege. Massachusetts Puritans believed that religious toleration was a weakness inspired by the devil. Anyone who advocated it must be \"either an athe- ist or a heretic or a hypocrite or at best a captive oi some lust.\" While they expelled many like Roger Williams, they hanged Quakers on Boston Common. Virginia, on the other hand, expelled ministers who came from Massachusetts. Some who were persecuted learned the value of religious toleration. In Rhode Island Roger Williams claimed that it was: . . . the will and command of God. . . that a permission of the most Paganish, Jewish, Turkish, or Antichristian consciences and worships be granted to all men. In the seventeenth century no other colony went that far, but, as we have seen, Maryland granted liberty of worship to Christians, and later Pennsylvania wel- comed anyone who worshiped God. In the 1740s the colonies experienced a religious revival called the Great Awaken- ing. Some Puritan ministers in Mas- sachusetts, concerned over declining religious fervor in their communities, began to preach sermons that warned of the impending dangers of hell. They were 76 Unit 1 A New World: Prehistory- 1756"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"influenced by Jonathan Edwards of North- ampton, who was one oi America's greatest colonial Christian theologians. Within a Few years, George Whitefield, an English evangelist and follower of John Wesley's revivals in Britain, came to America. In 7 trips from Britain, he preached from one end of the colonies to the other, some- times to outdoor crowds of 20,000. As ministers took sides favoring or opposing the revivalists, new churches sprang up. By the 1 770s, people felt free to shop around for a preacher and a religion that suited them. The diversity of churches helped to make religious toleration even more essential. Other products of the revival were new colleges such as Princeton, Brown, Rutgers, and Dartmouth. By the late 1700s, open religious perse- cution in the colonies was largely a thing of the past, although all religious groups were not equal before the law. Visitors from other countries were especially struck by the freedom granted Jews, who still suffered severe persecution in most European countries. A foreign traveler to New York in about 1750 was astonished to find that )ews owned prosperous shops, farms, and trading vessels. The Puritans believed that citizens should learn enough English to read the Bible and understand the laws. The Mas- sachusetts General School Act of 1647 stated two principles of education that remain today: local communities have a duty to set up schools, and this duty is enforced by law. In the Middle Colonies, schooling was not as universal as in New England, but it was widespread. In the Southern Colonies, formal education was generally limited to children of large landowners and profession- als. Governor William Berkeley of Virginia supported this belief in a letter to England: . . . there are no free sehools, or printing, it)ul I hope we shall not have them these hundred years, for learning has brought disobedience and heresy and sects into the world . . . God keep IIS from both! Even where schools were desired, the widely separated plantations and farms of the South made them impractical. By modern standards colonial schools were primitive. One New England teacher wrote of his schoolhouse, \"one might as well nigh as good keep school in a hog stie. \" There were few books, and instruction was given only two or three months a year. Most girls received little formal education. Two-thirds of the women whose names appear on Massachusetts legal documents in the early 1700s could not write their sig- natures. Despite the shortcomings of colo- nial education, no other region of equal size in the world had such a high proportion of the population that could read and write. Religion was the principal force behind most institutions of higher learning in the colonies. The earliest colleges Harvard, Wil- liam and Mary, and Yale were founded to train young men for the ministry. Colleges were also attended by sons of wealthy fami- lies and by ambitious poorer boys anxious to improve their situations in life. By the middle of the eighteenth centu- ry, the college curriculum began to change, as an interest in science and a demand for practical subjects increased or grew. Thus when King's College — later Examining Fine Art A Quaker Meeting gave each person the chance to speak. The Quakers' democratic and peace-loving ways brought persecution by less tolerant groups.

Linking Across Time Freedom of THE Press In 1735 John Peter Zenger faced charges of libel for printing a critical report about the royal governor of New York. Andrew Hamilton defend- ed Zenger in court by asking the jury to base its decision on whether the charges were true, not whether they were offensive. The jury found Zenger not guilty. When the nation became indepen- dent, freedom of the press was included in the Bill of Rights. In 1931 the Supreme Court expanded this right by declaring \"prior restraint\" laws against malicious or slanderous arti- cles unconstitu- tional. Columbia — was opened m New \\ork City in 1754, it announced that the com- prehensive scheme of studies would include not only the traditional Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, but also: Survey i)ig and Navigation, Geography, History, Husbandry, Commerce, Government, the Knowledge of All Nature in the Heavens above us and in the Air, Water, and Earth Around us. Meteors, Stones, Mines and Minerals, Plants and Animals, and of everything useful for the Comfort, Convenience and Elegance of Life. This interest in science, which produced a new confidence in human reason, origi- nated in Europe, where it was known as the Enlightenment. The English philoso- pher John Locke produced works that were widely read in America. In An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Locke maintained that people could best gain knowledge ot the universe by observing and by experimenting. This knowledge would guide them in developing a reason- able society. In the second ol two Treatises on Government, Locke tatight that people were born with certain natural rights to life, liberty, and property; that people lormed governments to protect these rights; and that a government interfering with these might rightfully be overthrown. Practical Americans readily accepted the idea that government was the agent of the people, not their ruler. The Press in America In addition to schools and colleges, newspapers, almanacs, books, and circulat- ing libraries all helped to raise the level of public information. Because paper and type were expensive and the reading public in America small, most books came from Britain. But by 1750 there were 25 or 30 American newspapers, mostly 4 pages long, printed weekly. The subscription lists con- tained only a few thousand names, but readers were more numerous. Printed on tough rag paper, these newspapers were passed from hand to hand at the local inn until half the men in a village often read a single copy. European travelers in the colonies were amazed to find that political discussions in public inns were joined intelligently by everybody from the college- educated to stable help. Colonial editors occasionally criticized British laws or officials. In 1735 Peter Zenger of the New York Weekly Journal accused the royal governor of corruption. As a result, copies of the paper were pub- licly burned by the sheriff, and Zenger was brought to trial on a charge of libel. His lawyer, Andrew Hamilton, argued that the editor was not guilty, since the charges were true, and since free speech was a basic right of English people. Zenger was acquitted. At the time the case attracted little attention, but today it is regarded as a landmark in the develop- ment of free press in America. Economy and Government By 1776, the close of the colonial peri- od, 30 percent of the ships in the British merchant marine were American, and most of these sailed from New England ports. New Englanders carried on a share of the African slave trade. They were the first to hunt whales in the Antarctic; in 1774, 360 whaling ships sailed from the island of Nantucket alone. While New England was a formidable competitor in 78 Unit 1 A New World: Prehistory- 1756"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"trade, no colon)' offered much competi- tion to the British in manufacturing. Colonists usually obtained manufactured goods from Britain . To pay for Fine European goods like clothing, books, wine, and cutlery the colonies had to trade staples that Euro- peans needed or to pay in gold or silver. Trade with the West Indies netted Spanish dollars, the common colonial currency. Later the new nation, the United States, would adopt the dollar instead of the British pound as its monetary unit. Grad- ually the colonies developed a culture dis- tinctly different from Europe. The degree of power exercised by British officials varied from colony to colony, but it was limited everywhere. In all colonies the voters elected their own legislature, and in charter colonies their governor as well. In proprietary colonies the governor was appointed by the proprietor or by his heirs; in royal or crown colonies the gover- nor was chosen by the king. The governor of a proprietary or crown colony had wide powers, such as a veto over the legislature and control of land grants. Yet he was often at the mercy of the legislature, which might refuse to vote him his salary. Government at the town and county levels was run entirely by the colonists themselves. In New England, the impor- tant local unit was the township. Deci- sions were made at the town meeting, which most heads ol families had a right to attend. The town meeting was the most direct form of democracy in the colonies. In the Southern and Middle colonies, local government was usually less democratic but, nevertheless, entirely independent ol British control. None of the colonies was so democratic as to allow full political rights to all men or to any women. Active citizenship and the right to vote and hold office were lim- ited to adult white males owning property, who usually had to be members ol the established church. In spite of these limiui- tions, a higher proportion of people was involved in government in the British colonies than anywhere in the l-.urope.m world. This wide participation gave Amer- icans training that was valuable when the colonies later became independent. • * • * * WIITIIi niE Section Five Review seiss HuuiaJUHuuy Summary Religious groups played important roles in shaping colonial values, institutions, and society. Established churches were tax-supported, and usually only male members of established churches could vote or hold office. Churches established most schools and colleges. Eventually, reli- gious diversity made religious toleration necessary.

Although there is almost no limit to the kinds of information that maps can show, most maps, depending on the type of information they present, fit into one of two broad categories. Maps that show general information such as countries, cities, rivers, and other features are called general reference maps. A second category of maps is thematic maps. These maps depict or emphasize more specific information than general reference maps. Often the information is on a single topic. The map below is a thematic map because it depicts information about a particular topic — land holdings in New England dur- ing the 1600s and early 1700s. Example To read this or any other thematic map, follow the guidelines below: • Read the title to determine the topic of the map. • Locate the map legend, or key, if one is given. Often the legend uses symbols and colors to represent the categories of information that can be found in the map. • Now look at the map itself. Locate and study the symbols and colors on the map. From this informa- tion, you can hypothesize or make generalizations about the map's theme.

Then Europe entered an age of discovery and exploration during the l400s and 1500s. Western Europeans crossed the Atlantic Ocean to find the Americas, vast continents rich in precious metals and other natural resources. They then pro- ceeded to explore and conquer lands that they previously had not known existed. In this \"New World\" the blending of diverse cultures gave birth to a unique American civilization. Chapter 1 The World in Transition The first Americans were immigrants who traveled across a land bridge that once connected Siberia and Alaska. Even- tually these people spread throughout North and South America. Although some remained hunter-gatherers, others learned agriculture and raised animals. In Central America the Olmec, Maya, and Aztec civilizations, and the Inca of South America, developed highly organized and sophisticated societies. In North .\\merica the Anasazi developed pueblos and the Hopewell constructed huge burial mounds. Elsewhere, the Iroquois language groups formed a strong, lasting political confederation. Meanwhile, in western Europe, a new Europe was emerging as Christianiu' uni- fied the people and strong monarchs uni- fied their territories. A wealthy middle class developed from the increase in com- merce and growth of cities. Peace, pros- perity, and optimism helped to set in motion a far-reaching rebirth of interest in the classical heritage of Greece and Rome called the Renaissance. The Renais- sance brought a profound cultural awak- ening in Italian, French, English, and German lands. Religious leaders like John Wycliffe, John Huss, Martin Luther, and John Calvin called for the reform ol the Roman Catholic Church. During the Reforma- tion, some groups broke entirely with the Church and founded Protestant churches. In Asia and Africa, Muslim leaders established empires and expanded their ' territories. The trade that had flourished on these continents since ancient times continued to grow. Traders carried ideas as well as goods between the East and the West, usually along overland routes or a combination of overland and water routes. China, however, turned inward, halting trade to free its people from out- side influences. The development of nation-states, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the growth of trade caused many Europeans to turn outward. Improved technology gave navigators the compass, the astro- labe, the quadrant, and faster, more seaworthy ships. Bankers, merchants, and joint-stock companies provided the money to finance expeditions. In search of spices and luxury goods, explorers braved the uncharted seas to find an all-water route from Europe to Asia. Portuguese sailors rounded the tip ol Africa and charted an eastern waterway to India. Chapter 2 European Discovery and Exploration Soon European nations other than Por- tugal were looking to establish direct trad- ing links with the East. Not until the voyages of Christopher Columbus in the late 1490s, however, were Europeans aware that North America and South America existed. Yet by 1500, Spain and Portugal were competing for territory in the Americas. The pope drew a line of demarcation between Portuguese and Spanish lands in South America. Soon this line was shifted and extended around the earth. Meanwhile, Portugal grew rich because it controlled the eastern route to the Indies. In 1519 Spain made its bid for 82 Unit 1 A New World: Prehistory to 1756"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"wealth from Asia by sending Ferdinand Magellan to find a westerly route. His expedition was the first to circumnavigate the world. Commerce led to empire building. The Spaniards wanted wealth fi'om the New World, but also glory and an opportunity to spread Christianity. In 1519 Hernan Cortes began his conquest of the Aztecs. He defeated their emperor Moctezuma and shipped huge amounts of Aztec gold to Spain. His success encouraged other conquistadores, such as Francisco Pizarro who conquered the Incan empire, to seek their fortunes in the Americas. In the pro- cess, the Spaniards claimed vast territories that eventually formed a great colonial empire. The people of Spain's colonies formed a structured society, with govern- ment officials at the top and native Amer- icans and African slaves at the bottom. Other countries envied the riches that Spain's conquests in Central and South America brought. As a result France, Eng- land, and the Netherlands searched for a northwest passage to the East and made claims in the New World during the 1500s and the 1600s. The French estab- lished a permanent colony at Quebec in 1608 along the St. Lawrence River and developed a lucrative trade in beaver furs. By 1682 French explorers had claimed the Mississippi River basin. The Dutch settled in the rich Hudson River valley. Chapter 3 Colonial America After the English destroyed the Spanish invasion fleet, the Armada, in 1588, their interest in the Americas deepened. The first English colony on Roanoke Island failed in 1578. But in 1607 the English founded Jamestown in Virginia — their first permanent settlement in the New World. Despite many hardships, the Jamestown colonists survived. Profits from the tobacco they grew lured new settlers to Virginia. In time, the colonists there formed the first representative govern- ment body in North America, the House of Burgesses. The first Africans were brought to Jamestown in 161'). The Jamestown settlers came to Ameri- ca looking for wealth. Others, like the Pil- grim and Puritan settlers in New England, wanted freedom from religious persecu- tion. Upon arrival in North America in 1620, the Pilgrims signed the Mayflower Compact and established the Plymouth colony in what is now Massachusetts. With the help of the American Indian Squanto, they adapted to their environ- ment. By 1629 thousands of Puritans, hoping to build a model Christian society, had migrated to Massachusetts. However, religious differences soon forced some of them to move on and found settlements in Rhode Island and Connecticut. Other colonies were created when the king granted huge tracts of land to propri- etors. These proprietorships included the southern colonies of Maryland, the Car- olinas, and Georgia, and the middle colonies of New York, New jersey, Penn- sylvania, and Delaware. Although many diverse groups of peo- ple populated the colonies, their values and beliefs, government, and educational institutions grew out of English tradi- tions. By the mid- 1700s, these aspects of colonial society had a unique, and many times religious, character. Over time, the social and political structure of the colonies became more democratic than in England. For example, the House of Burgesses, not the English Parliament, controlled the taxes that paid the gover- nor's salary, and the Act of Toleration in Maryland protected the religious freedom of all Christian settlers there. In short, the colonies offered a better life to most of the people who settled there. However, many women, Africans, and native Americans did not share in this better life. Women were given little for- mal education and were banned from par- ticipation in government. Most Africans in the colonies were slaves. And native Americans fought constantly with the colonists over territory. Although few colonists were as skilled as Indian warriors at fighting, the colonists' numbers and superior weapons gave them an ativantage. European diseases wiped out whole native American communities because they had not developed immimities. Synthesizing Unit Themes Relating Ideas 1.

A chance meeting with Benjamin Franklin in London provided Paine the motivation he needed to immigrate to the colonies. The first essay from his collection. The American Crisis, issued in December 1776, was read by Washington at Valley Forge to buoy the spirits of his beleaguered troops. As you read this passage, notice the language Paine uses to rally support for the American cause. Tho Paine from The American Crisis, Number 1 hese are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis, shrink from the service ot his country; but he that stands it NOW deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; 'tis dearness only that gives everything its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed, if so celes- tial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated. Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right {not only to TAX) but \"to BIND us in ALL CASES WHATSOEVER,\" and if being bound in that manner, is not slavery, then is there not such a thing as slavery upon earth. Even the expression is impi- ous, for so unlimited a power can belong only to God I have as little superstition in me as any man living, but my secret opinion has ever been, and still is, that God Almighty will not give up a people to military destruc- tion, or leave them unsupportedly to per- ish, who have so earnestly and so repeated- ly sought to avoid the calamities of war, by every decent method which wisdom could invent. Neither have I so much of the infi- del in me, as to suppose that he has relin- quished the government of the world, and given us up to the care of devils; and as I do not, I cannot see on what grounds the king of Britain can look up to heaven for help against us: a common murderer, a highwayman, or a housebreaker, has as good a pretense as he — I once felt all that kind of anger which a man ought to feel against the mean [small-minded] principles that are held by the Tories.

We are obliged to take fivrn Great Britain commodities that we could purchase cheaper elsewhere. — John Adams Delegate to the First Continental Congress, 1774 Section Focus Altiiough the American colonies were prosperous and produced most of the food and goods they needed to survive, they were by no means self-sufficient. The colonies needed the benefit of trade with one another as well as with other countries. When Parliament passed a series of laws restricting their right to trade freely, the colonists found ways to evade the restrictions. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the economic motives that shaped British colonial policy. • Discuss the development of an Ameri- can character and way of life during the colonial period. While allowing the colonies to run local affairs with little interference, Great Britain attempted to con- trol their foreign trade. From the British point of view, the colonies existed to sup- ply raw materials and to provide markets for British goods. Guided by these ideas. Britain tried to tighten its control over the colonial economy. The Acts of Trade and Navigation Beginning in 1651, Parliament passed a series of laws known as Trade and Nav- igation Acts. The Navigation Act of 1651 stated that all goods shipped between England and the colonies had to be carried in ships built either in En- gland or in the colonies. Then in 1660 Parliament listed, or enumerated, specific colonial products that could be shipped only to Britain. These enumerated com- modities included tobacco, cotton, indi- go, and sugar. This was a profitable arrangement for British merchants, who could resell the goods not used in England to other countries. Another measure required American ships return- ing from Europe to make a \"broken voy- age,\" stopping at an English port on the way home to pay a duty, or tax, on the goods they had purchased on the Euro- pean continent. As a result, the colonies received less for some of their exports and paid more for some of their imports than if they had been permitted to trade freely. A number of other laws were designed to help special groups at the expense of the 13 colonies. For example, the Molasses Act of 1733 helped the owners of sugar plantations in the British West Indies by putting a heavy tax on the importation of sugar and molasses from any other place. Development of colonial industry was slowed by the Woolen Act of 1699, which forbade the colonies to export woolen goods; the Flat Act of 1732, which made it illegal for hatmakers in the colonies to sell their goods outside the colonies; and the Iron Act of 1750, which restricted the manufacture of iron goods in the colonies. More often than not, these restrictions were the result of pressure on Parliament by British manufacturers who wanted to kill colonial competition. Benjamin Franklin's reaction was typical of the views of American manufacturers: 94 Unit 2 The Struggle for Independence: 1650-1789"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"A colonist cannot make a button, a horse shoe, nor a hobnail but some sooty ironmonger or respectable buttonmaker of Britain shall bawl and squall that his honor's worship is . . . maltreated, injured, cheated and robbed by the rascally Americans. Enforcing the Laws Despite these laws Britain regulated colonial trade less strictly than did other European nations. Colonists could ship fish, lumber, and grain — products for which Britain had no need — wherever they could find a market. A few naviga- tion laws actually helped the colonists. One law required British merchants to buy tobacco only from the colonies. Another prohibited tobacco-raising in Britain itself Most of the navigation laws, however, restricted colonial trade. Had Britain exer- cised a policy of strict enforcement from the beginning, events might have ttirned out differently. During the early colonial years, Parliament opted for a policy ot salutary neglect, or non-interference, which allowed the colonists to do what they wished. One reason for the policy was distance — it was simply too difficult to control a situation 3,000 miles away. Another reason was that few revenue offi- cers bothered to go to America; instead they appointed deputies who were often lax in their duties. Soon colonists got into the easy habit of evading British laws, and smuggling became an accepted practice. Even when smugglers were brought to trial, sympathetic colonial juries seldom found them guilty. Although British trade regulations were designed to place restrictions on the colonies, in practice they may have helped as much as they hindered. The colonists took advantage of those regulations that tavored them and ignored those that hurt them. After a time it became clear that stricter enforcement ot the laws by Parlia- ment would have serious repercussions in the colonies. The Making of Americans The colonies had been founded with lit- tle help from the British government and had developed their prosperous agricul- ture and extensive trade on their own. In a fertile area many times larger than En- gland, they were doubling their popula- tion every 25 or 30 years. They had learned to govern themselves, but above all, they had developed an American char- acter different from that of the Europeans. Linking Across Time Free Trade American's desire for free unlimited trade with other countries sparked revolution. This desire did not end when America separated from Great Britain. From the Confed- eration period to today, people have disagreed over how much protec- tion from foreign competition American industry needs. Today tax- ing foreign auto- makers to protect the American automobile indus- try is an issue that Congress and the President fre- quently debate. Examining Fine Art Benjamin Franklin journeyed to London to present the colonists' views on taxation to the Lords of the Privy Council. Why was it difficult for the British government to enforce laws strictly in the colonies?

Still, the colonists needed British pro- tection. Without it colonists could not defend themselves from the French in Canada. Not until France was expelled from North America did the 13 colonies start on the road to revolution. IJU »» Life of the Times Colonial Dance Even though the colonists gradually moved toward conflict with Britain, there was still time for recreation. The long work week of most colonists was filled with physically drain- ing Libor. The jew moments spent on leisure activities gener- ally centered around quiet activities such as reading or card games. Spectator sports for men — horse racing and turkey shoots — were also popular. The major exception to sedentary pastimes for men and women was dancing. From rural farms to urban man- sions, dance in colonial America was one of the most common forms of recreation. While some clerg)' con- demned dancing as evil, others recommended it as healthy exercise. \"Danc- ing masters\" — teachers — opened schools in communities throughout the colonies and were employed by wealthy families to demonstrate the latest steps. Taverns were often the site of impromptu dances. Couples performed line dances such as the reel to the accompaniment of a fid- dler. The reel soon gave way to a more dar- ing dance called fhe cotillion, a dance imported from the courts of France. In this forerunner of modern square dancing, four couples — who under these circumstances were permitted to enjoy publicly some phys- ical contact — formed a group and moved to the directions of a \"caller.\" Section One Review Summary Between 1650 and 1750, Parliament passed laws regulating colonial trade. By doing so, it hoped to establish a system that served the best interest of the British Empire. The colonists were less interested in British interests than in their own eco- nomic development. For a time, the colonies and Britain were able to pursue their separate interests without serious problems. Sooner or later, those interests would have to clash. Checking for Understanding 1.

War was on a world-wide scale with active military operations in Europe and the Mediterranean, in the East Indies and India, in the Caribbean, and in North America. The long rivalry tor the control of North America was a drama played against the backdrop of a vast wilderness. This conflict had a direct impact on the future of the 13 colonies. The outcome would determine whether the British or French would control the western territories. Obj ectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the causes and describe the stages of the French and Indian War. • Summarize the results of the war. The Anglo-French contest for North America had two phas- es. The wars lought between 1689 and 1713 were known in the 13 colonics as King William's War (1689-1697) and Queen Anne's War (1702-1713). In Europe they were called the War of the League of Augsburg and the War of the Spanish Succession. At the close of this first phase. Great Britain gained Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Hudson's Bay Territory. The second phase, from 1742 to 1763, included the wars known in the colonies as King George's War (1742-1748) and the French and Indian War (1754-1763); in Europe they were called the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War. This struggle ended in victory lor Great Britain — with the French losing all their holdings on the North American mainland. Strengths of Britain and France It is not as difficult to see why Great Britain won the war in America as it is to understand why France was able to hold out lor so long. The French were out- numbered by British colonists by at least 20 to 1 , and the British navy generally had control of the sea. Still, the question of how much assistance the 13 colonies would contribute to the British war effort remained. Distrusting the motives of one another, the colonies had argued bitterly over boundary claims and rarely aided one another in Indian wars. Could they now set aside their diflerences? The Albany Plan In 1754 on the eve ot the Seven Years' Wtr, delegates from seven northern colonies met with representatives of the Iroquois nations in Albany, New York. The stated purpose ot the meeting was to persuade the powerful Iroquois to ally with the British against the French. But many delegates harbored another pur- pose — to create a union ot the colonies. Benjamin Franklin presented to the con- ference the Albany Plan ot Union, in which he proposed that the colonies form a Grand Council with the power to levy taxes, raise troops, and regulate trade with the Indians. The actions of this Grand Council would be subject to veto by the British crown.

Although Franklin's plan was adopted b\\' the delegates, it was rejected by both the colonial and British governments who feared loss of power. The lack of cooperation seriously handicapped the war effon. Ameri- cans seldom consented to fight outside their own colonies and colonies ignored taxes imposed by Britain for their own defense. Nor would they tax themselves. The French and Indian War The final round of the struggle between England and France for control ot North America began in the Ohio Valley. Deter- mined to possess this rich area, the French drove out English fur traders, and in 1754 built Fort Duquesne (doo KAYN) at the point where the Monongahela (muh NAHN guh HEE luh) and Allegheny rivers meet to form the Ohio River. The fort, located in territory claimed by both Virginia and Pennsylvania, was a threat to the safet)' of these colonies and a barrier to expansion. Facing this threat the colonists sent a force of Virginia militia — a group of civil- ians trained as soldiers to fight in emer- gencies — to attack the fort. Under the command of an inexperienced 22-year- old major from Virginia named George Washington, the militia advanced on the fort, and in 1754 ambushed a French scouting part)'. The French retaliated by capturing Washington's entire force at Fort Necessit)', but later released them. War had begun even though there had been no formal declaration. In the summer of 1755, British General Edward Braddock led 1,450 British and colonial soldiers, including Washington and Daniel Boone, in another attack on Fort Duquesne. Once more, the British forces were driven back. More than 900 of Braddock's soldiers were killed or wound- ed, and Braddock himself was killed. Braddock's defeat caused many native Americans to switch their support from the British to the French. The French were winning the war, and French fur traders, who mixed peacefiiUy with the native Americans, seemed less a threat to their wav of life than did the land-hungry English settlers. Along the Ohio Valley, native American allies of the French attacked outlying settlements. Disasters continued after Great Britain and France formally declared war in 1756.

The complexion of the war changed, however, when William Pitt became Britain's minister of war in 1758. Supremely selt-confident, Pitt declared, \"I know that I can save this country and that no one else can.\" By giving aid to France's enemies in Europe, Pitt forced France to split its forces. Pitt also sent talented, young officers to lead the campaigns in North America. Through his maneuvers Pitt quickly reversed the course of events. By the end of 1758, Louisburg and Fort Duquesne were in British hands; and in June 1759, a British army of 9,000 was encamped on the St. Lawrence River a few miles below the great French fortress of Quebec. For more than two months, British commander James Wolfe had tried in vain to find a weak spot in the French defenses at Quebec. Time was running short, for the winter would soon set in. Finally, Wolfe outlined a daring plan to his skepti- cal staff Fie proposed to have his troops land at night and scale a wooded cliff located under the guns of the fortress. Wolfe had hit upon the idea when he observed Canadian women washing clothes in the river and hanging them to dry on the cliffs above. He realized that there had to be a pathway up the sheer cliffs to the fortress! Gambling on the element of sur- prise, Wolfe suspected that the French would not have a strong guard at a point considered safe from attack. Led by Scottish Highlanders, Wolfe's soldiers climbed the cliffs and overpowered the few guards.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1763, Britain secured control of the largest amount of territory ever gained by one nation in a single treaty. From France, Great Britain obtained all of Canada they did not already control and all the land east of the Mississippi River. From Spain, Frances ally. Great Britain gained Florida. To repay Spain for its losses and to protect France from losing it to Great Britain, France transferred the Louisiana Territory to Spain. North America was now divided between Great Britain and Spain with the Mississippi River forming the boundary. For the French, defeat was bitter. France was left with no land on the continent of North America. After 150 years ol colonization, the enterprise and heroism of French pioneers, missionaries, and sol- diers were halted. There was only one small crumb of comfort — the 1 3 colonies might revolt. A French leader likened them to a \"ripe truit,\" ready to drop off the branch. Within two years after the Treaty of Paris, French agents would travel secretly through the English colonies investigating the chances of a revolution. In 1763 Benjamin Franklin celebrated the loyalty of the colonies to the British crown: Know ye, bad neighbors, who aim to divide The sons from the mother, that she's still our pride, And if ye attack her, we're all on her side. Which nobody can deny, deny, Which nobody can detiy. By 1776 Franklin would completely reverse himself; he would be a member ol the Continental Congress declaring America's independence of Britain and fighting a war to make it good.

Freed from the danger of French attack, the Americans no longer needed British regiments and warships. The Brit- ish Parliament, on the other hand, was convinced that it had to exercise stricter control over the colonies. With the pas- sage of each new law, the colonists be- came more outraged and resentful. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • List and explain British attempts to tighten control over the colonies after the French and Indian War. • Identify the ways in which the colonies resisted British control. With the end of the French and Indian War, Britain turned its attention to America. Victory had brought Britain vast new territories — and a host of new problems. I'he British government first had to cope with the huge debt left by the war. Then it needed to decide what to do with the recently acquired western territory beyond the Appalachian and Allegheny mountains. The Proclamation of 1763 In 1763 Pontiac's Rebellion broke out in the West. Pontiac, chief of the Ottawas, had foreseen that Britain's defeat of France meant a hard tate for his people. The French had traded with the native Ameri- cans, protected them, and intermarried with them. By contrast, the ever-advanc- ing settlers of the British colonies threat- ened to wipe them out. Pontiac welded several native American peoples into a fighting force and formed a confederacy of native Americans in the Ohio Valley. Pontiac's forces captured a chain of British forts northwest of the Ohio River, but failed to drive the settlers back across the Appalachian Mountains. During Pontiac's Rebellion, the British government issued the Proclamation of 1763, which ended all settlement west of a line running along the crest of the Appalachian Mountains. The government also maintained thousands of troops along the frontier — as much to protect the Indi- ans from the settlers as the settlers from the Indians. Although Americans at first accepted the Proclamation of 1763, they soon resented it. Colonists protested that the Proclamation deprived them of land they had a right to settle and interfered with charter rights of colonies whose grants extended \"from .sea to sea. \" Perhaps the biggest outcry came from land specula- tors — people who purchased land to resell it for profit. They claimed American interests were being sacrificed to fill the pockets of British fur traders who wished to leave the native Americans undisturbed.

It required that stamps be placed on many kinds ot articles and doc- uments, including wills, playing cards, newspapers, dice, almanacs, and licenses. Duties ranged from 1 cent on newspapers to $10 for college diplomas, and payment had to be made in specie. While Grenville's previous tax laws had affected those engaged in foreign trade, namely New England merchants and shippers, the Stamp Act affected colonists everywhere. It especially offended the most powerful and articulate groups in the colonies: lawyers, newspaper editors, and ministers. Because of the Stamp Act, colonists were drawn to the realization that their interests were not necessarily the .same as British interests. On the day the Stamp Act was to go into effect, men and women wore mourning clothes and church beils lolietl ail the way from i'ortsniouth. New H.impsiiire, to Savan- nah, Cjeorgia. Colonists backed their protests with a boycott — a refusal to buy British goods. Men and women made solemn promises to wear homespun clothing instead of British woolens. C'olonial merchants signed nonimportation agreements, promising not to buy British goods until Parliament repealed the unpopular law. Soon imports from Britain dropped, and British mer- chants, saying that they were faced with \"utter ruin,\" besieged Parliament with peti- tions against the Stamp Act. Under such pressure. Parliament backed down and repe;iled the law in 1766. The next year Parliament tried to raise revenue through the Townshend Acts, which placed import duties on tea, paper, glass, and paint, liic British could not effectively collect these taxes cither, and all the Townshend duties were repealed in 1770, except the tax on tea, which was retained to assert tiie principle of Parlia- ment's authoritv.

These troops were sent, it was said, to protect the Americans. But to protect them from whom? The French had been defeated, and the native Ameri- cans were at peace. Colonists noted that the British soldiers, called redcoats because of the color of their uniforms, were not stationed in frontier posts, but in towns such as Boston and New York where there was no more danger from native Americans than in London. But the presence of the redcoats served other pur- poses — to strengthen the hand of colonial governors and to frighten colonial legisla- tures into line. It was also clear that the British wanted to free royal officials from colonial con- trol. For this reason, the British govern- ment shifted customs cases to the admiralty courts and ruled that royal judges and governors were to be paid out of customs revenues that British revenue officers col- lected. Now colonial legislatures could no longer check the power of royal governors by holding up their salaries. Disobedience of British Laws The efforts of the British government to tighten control met such determined resistance that it surprised even the Amer- icans themselves. The resistance took a variety of forms, including disobedience of British laws, protests, increased cooper- ation among the 13 colonies, boycotts, and violence. The Americans, long accustomed to evading British revenue laws, did not hesi- tate to disobey new ones. In spite of a stronger British customs service, smug- gling went on much as usual. The long coast of America prevented revenue offi- cers from inspecting all incoming ships, especially when the local inhabitants were constantly trying to thwart them. In 1765 Parliament passed the Quarter- ing Act directing the colonies to provide barracks and supplies for the British troops ordered to America. The New York and Massachusetts legislatures regarded the act as concealed taxation and flatly refused to provide funds. Most of the other colonies found other ways to dis- obey the law. After 1765 many colonists crossed the Appalachian Mountains and began to establish settlements in the western lands. Led by Daniel Boone and others, settlers spilled into western New York, Kentucky, and Tennessee, staking their land claims on native American land. Although this westward movement met the colonists' need for expansion, it violated the Procla- mation Act of 1763. Governor Dunmore of Virginia advised Parliament that it was very nearly impossible to control the set- tlers' movement: / have learnt from experience that the established authority of any government in America, and the policy of government at home, are both insufficient to restrain the Americans they do not conceive that Government has any right to forbid their taking possession of a Vast Tract of Country, either uninhabited, or which serves as a shelter to a few scattered tribes of Indians. The Question of Representation One of the first public colonial protests took place in Virginia in May 1765 when the House of Burgesses met to consider the Stamp Act. Patrick Henr\\' introduced the Virginia Resolutions protesting Parlia- ment's action. Henn,' claimed that, since Americans elected no members to the British Parliament, they could not be taxed by that body. The House of Burgesses had \"the only exclusive right and power to lay taxes\" upon Virginians. This bold stand by the largest of the colonies encouraged the other colonies to follow suit, and the prin- ciple of \"no taxation without representa- tion\" was accepted as a basic right. 104 Unit 2 The Struggle for Independence: 1650-1789"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"To most people in Britain the argument against \"taxation without representation\" was faulty. The colonies were represented under the principle of \"virtual\" represen- tation, k did not matter that Americans did not elect members to the House of Commons, the only branch of the govern- ment that could tax. Many other citizens were not directly represented either. It did not matter where these citizens lived or even if they had the right to vote because the House of Commons was pledged to represent every person in Britain and the empire. Americans had little regard for the idea of virtual representation, largely because, since the time of the earliest set- tlements, the people had always had direct representation — electing colonial assem- bly members to represent their interests. Resistance to the Stamp Act brought about the first real cooperation among the 13 colonies. A committee of the Mas- sachusetts legislature sent letters to leaders of the other colonial legislatures urging them to send delegates to a convention to decide on a common policy toward the British government. As a result, the Stamp Act Congress met in New York in Octo- ber 1765. Nine colonial legislatures were represented, and the colonies that did not participate sent messages of support. The delegates drew up resolutions and organized a boycott of British-made goods. In 1768 the Massachusetts legisla- ture issued a Circular Letter calling on all the other colonial legislatures to join in protest against the measure. John Dickinson helped promote colo- nial unity in his Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, published in the Pennsylva- nia Gazette \\n 1767 and 1768. Dickinson argued that the people of the 13 colonies, \"separated from the rest of the world, and firmly bound together by the same rights, interests, and dangers,\" formed \"one political body of which each colony is a member.\" Along with this new spirit of coopera- tion came a rising spirit of patriotism.

The Stamp Act Crisis During the decade between the passage of the Stamp Act in 1765 and the outbreak oi the Revolution, colonial resistance to Parliament took several torms. Colonial legislatures sent numer- ous resolutions and petitions to the Crown criticizing their per- ceived loss oi rights and \"taxation without representation.\" But early colonial successes — notably the repeal of the Stamp Act — came from boycotting English goods and other acts ot defiance by ordinary citizens. Open protest by commoners against unjust rulers and laws had long been an accepted part of English political life. In the colonies, efforts to bring about political change through protest was significantly aided by weak British control. Although colonial officials had the authority to suppress \"disttirbances of the peace,\" they frequently did not have the means to do so. In rural areas, police power consisted only of a county sheriff and, sometimes, a deputy. In towns, the sheriff might have had a night watch, but this was seldom effective. In New York, for example, the night watch was described as a \"parcel of idle, drinking vigilant snorers, who never quelled any nocturnal tumult in their lives.\" The hated Stamp Act placed a tax on every type of legal docu- ment, newspapers, almanacs — even playing cards and dice. Colonists, taking advantage of a weak law enforcement system, reacted swiftly.

This respite ended when Parliament granted a monopoly on the sale of tea in the colonies to the East India Company. After that every British action triggered an American response — the Boston Tea Party, the Intolerable Acts, and the First Continental Congress. Even as late as the winter of 1775, colonists hoped for a rec- onciliation with Britain but events were leading to separation. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • List the Intolerable Acts, and describe how the colonists responded to them. • Describe the events that led to war between Great Britain and the Ameri- can colonies. Although most colonial leaders who opposed efforts of the British Parliament to tax Amer- icans were from the wealthy planter and merchant classes, they were supported by shopkeepers, clerks, and laborers. These colonists were the driving force behind two vital resistance groups — the Sons and Daughters of Liberty. Boycotts and Violence The Sons of Liberty carried out orga- nized resistance by keeping watch on shopkeepers suspected of selling British goods. They publicly denounced or threat- ened those they caught. When the Sons of Liberty learned that Andrew Oliver was going to be appointed Distributor of Stamps for Boston, they hung his effigy, or likeness, on the Liberty Tree and stoned it. Then they looted his house and coerced him to refuse the job. When Mas- sachusetts Lieutenant-Governor Thomas Hutchinson defended Oliver, a mob at- tacked Hutchinson's home and destroyed the finest collection of books and docu- ments in the colonies. Although such actions forced British sympathizers into silence, they also frightened many sup- porters of the American cause. Some colo- nial leaders attempted to prevent the use of violence; still the colonies took no action against the Sons of Liberty. American and British opposition to the Stamp Act forced Parliament to repeal it. In an effort to save face. Parliament passed the Declaratory Act, which affirmed its right as the supreme legislator of the British empire \"to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever.\" Parliament was following the principle of this law when it passed the Townshend (TOWN zehnd) Acts in 1767, but the colonists argued that any law designed to raise revenue from them without their consent was a violation of their liberties. Again they drew up nonimportation agreements. Again the Sons of Liberty patrolled docks where English goods might be landed and shops where they might be sold. Colonial women organized the Daugh- ters of Liberty to boycott British goods. The Daughters of Liberty gave up import- ed clothes, made tea out of local herbs, and produced homespun cloth. New En- gland ministers organized the women of their congregations in great spinning contests.

Americans, often impatient with their political lead- ership, have orga- nized groups to protest or support such issues as abo- lition, women's suffrage, child labor, and abor- tion. With the exception of the Second World War, groups have opposed every war the United States has fought. How- ever, this right to voice grievance is so basic to Ameri- ca it is enshrined in the Bill of Rights. Examining Fine Art Mercy Otis Warren of the Daugtiters of Liberty was a witty and sl<illful propagandist. In wliat ottier way did ttie Daugtiters tielp ttie resistance? Daughters of Liberty ran spinning wheels all day, while hundreds of spectators cheered them on. One of the most influ- ential of the Daughters was Mere)' Otis Warren who published political pamphlets supporting the resistance — although she had to use a man's name to be published. The Boston Massacre In the same year that Parliament repealed the Townshend duties, the hrst clash between Americans and British troops took place. Two regiments of red- coats had been sent to Boston to support the governor and to intimidate the Sons and Daughters of Liberty who were mak- ing Massachusetts a center of opposition to Britain. On the night of March 5, 1770, a crowd of 50 or 60 men and boys gathered to taunt British soldiers outside the Boston Customs House. When the crowd threw sticks and snowballs at the redcoats, the soldiers panicked and opened fire, killing five men. News of the event, which became known as the \"Boston Massacre,\" spread throughout the colonies. It soon became a symbol of British force and tyranny. An Uneasy Calm From 1770 to 1773 a lull quieted the controversy between Great Britain and the 13 colonies. Part of this was because of prosperous times, largely a result of increasing demand for American farm products. Having won relief from some taxes, the Americans allowed the British to collect others. Imports of British goods rose — from $8 million in 1768 to $21 million in 1771. Despite the calmer relations, basic issues had not been settled. Parliament still maintained its right to legislate for the colonies \"in all cases whatsoever.\" The Americans, on the other hand, insisted that they were no more obliged to pay taxes levied by Parliament than the British had to pay taxes levied by the Virginia House of Burgesses. The calm was interrupted periodically by acts of violence. In 1771 a British cus- toms schooner that had taken a smugglers' ship into custody was attacked at night. The captive ship was released, the customs officials locked into the hold, and their schooner badly damaged. When another British revenue boat, the Gaspee, ran aground off Rhode Island, \"persons unknown\" attacked and burned it. Meanwhile, leaders of the American resistance were busy forming a variety of organizations to translate popular discon- tent into action. The most effective of these were the committees of correspon- dence. Under such able leaders as Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams, the commit- tees sought to inform colonists of events throughout the colonies. They were great- ly assisted by the efficient postal service that Benjamin Franklin had organized. Keeping in contact with each other, these committees helped keep the resistance movement going. The Boston Tea Party The period of calm between the colonies and Britain came to an end with the Boston Tea Party. This dramatic event started a chain reaction that led to war and broke the ties between Great Britain and the colonies. 108 Unit 2 The Strugle for Independence: 1650-1789"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"By 1773 the British East India Compa- ny was experiencing severe financial prob- lems because ol famine in the Indian province of Bengal, the shrinking of the American tea market, and mismanage- ment. Facing bankruptcy, the company appealed to Parliament for assistance. Par- liament quickly voted to relieve it of most of its import and export duties to grant it a monopoly, or sole control of the trade, for tea in the American market. Despite the 3-cents-per-pound Townshend dury the East India Company had to pay, the company would still be able to sell its tea at a lower price in the colonies than tea brought in from France and Holland, the colonies' main sources of tea. Announcement ol the plan produced an outcry in America. Colonists argued that if Parliament could give the East India Company a monopoly of trade in tea, it could arrange monopolies for other prod- ucts as well. Above all, colonists objected to the tea monopoly because they suspect- ed its real purpose was to bribe them into acknowledging Parliament's right to tax the colonies. \"The baneful [harmful] chests [of tea] contain a slow poison,\" wrote Benjamin Rush ol Philadelphia, \"something worse than death — the seeds ofSLAVERY.\" Opposition groups mobilized to prevent the sale of the East India tea. Ships arriv- ing in the Atlantic ports were unable to sell a pound ol tea. At Charleston the tea was kept in a warehouse until after the Revolutionary War broke out. At New York and Philadelphia the tea ships were forced to turn back. In Boston, however. Governor Hutchinson ordered that no ship could leave the harbor without unloading its tea. Colonists led by Sam Adams were just as determined that no tea would come ashore. For days crowds milled in the street and attended rallies where the sole topic of conversation was what action to take. Then on December 16, about 8,000 people attended a public meeting in and near the Old South Church. There the colonists learned that Hutchinson had no intention of backing down. On a signal Irom Sam Adams, a group of colonists, disguised as Mohawks, rushed to the wharf. In kill sighl ot a cheering crowd, they boarded the tea ships and heaved 342 chests of tea valued at $75,000 into the harbor. The Intolerable Acts Benjamin Franklin called the Boston Tea Parry \"an act of violent injustice, \" and some Boston merchants were willing to start a collection to pay tor the damage. To the British government, however, it was an act of lawlessness that deserved swift and severe punishment. In March 1774, Parliament passed a series of laws known as the Coercive Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until Crispus Attucks i723(?)-i77o Little is known about the life of Crispus Attucks before the evening of March 5, 1770. Attucks may well have been a runaway slave in Boston, where he probably worked on the docks. But for one brief moment that night, Attucks stood at the forefront of American resistance to British rule. After Attucks finished his dinner in an inn, he joined a nearby crowd that had formed on King Street. Young boys were taunting British soldiers, hurling snowballs and sticks. Tensions grew between the soldiers and the unruly mob. A soldier's musket sud- denly fired, and Attucks fell to the ground and died instantly. Four others were also killed, and several were wounded in what has become known as the Boston Massacre. Attucks became a marryr to the patriot cause — a black man who gave his life in the name of lihert\\'.

The Association did its work effectively; imports ol British goods into New York, for example, dropped from more than $2 million in 1774 to $6,000 in 1775. Lexington and Concord Meanwhile, in every colony a volunteer army was organizing, and military supplies were being collected. In New England, minutemen assembled to drill on village greens, while town officials collected ammunition, uniforms, and food. In the Southern Colonies, planters undertook to recruit and equip companies of soldiers at their own expense. It appeared that the dispute between Great Britain and the colonies would be settled only by force. Fighting between the Americans and the British broke out near Boston, which had been occupied in 1774 by a British army under General Thomas Gage. Early on April 19, 1775, a detachment of' 700 British soldiers was secretly sent to destroy the military supplies colonists had collected at Concord, 21 miles from Boston. Learn- ing of the soldiers' destination, the Boston Sons of Liberty sent Paul Revere and William Dawes to alert the minutemen in the towns and villages along the way When the British reached ihe town of Lexington, about 70 armed minutemen awaited them. The colonists were ordered to drop their weapons and disperse. Then someone fired a shot. A spontaneous skirmish ensued, and the colonists fled. Eight colonists were killed, and ten were wounded; only one British soldier was wounded. The British pushed on to Concord and burned what litde gunpowder the colonists had not used for themselves. By the time the British began their march toward Boston, the countryside was swarming with minutemen, who fired at the redcoats from behind trees, buildings, and stone walls. Only a brigade sent out from Boston saved the British from annihi- lation. About 250 British and 100 Ameri- cans were killed or wounded at Concord. The Colonists Mobilize News of Lexington and Concord, carried by riders on horseback, electrified the colonies. The Massachusetts Committee of Public Safety, which directed the resistance organizations in the colony, called for an army of 30,000 men \"to defend our wives and children from the butchering hands of an inhuman soldiery.\" Groups of militia from all over New England marched toward Boston, one New Hampshire com- pany covering 54 miles in 18 hours.

The American army could easily have been trapped from behind, but the British commander decided to make a frontal attack uphill. The redcoats advanced in close order, each carrying a heavy pack in addition to a 15-pound musket. Because the range of a musket was scarcely more than 50 yards, the Americans were ordered to hold their fire until they could see the \"whites of their enemies' eyes.\" The Americans turned back two attacks, inflicting heavy losses, but were finally driven back when they ran out of ammu- nition. The Battle of Bunker Hill, as it came to be called, was a moral victory for the Americans because their untrained militia had stood up to professional troops. The British, whose casualties in the battle were more than 40 percent, made no further attempt to attack. Meanwhile, in May 1775, a handful of volunteers from Vermont known as the Green Mountain Boys captured the small garrisons guarding the fortresses of Crown Point and Ticonderoga on the vital Lake George-Lake Champlain route. The forts were not only strategically placed but rich in military supplies. On May 10, 1775, the day that Fort Ticonderoga fell, a Second Continental Congress met in Philadelphia. Originally called to plan further protests against British actions, the Congress assumed the powers of a central government and took steps to con- duct the war that had, in fact, begun at Lex- ington. The Congress voted to ask the colonies for supplies and troops, to send agents to France to obtain financial assis- tance, and to encourage rebellion among French Canadians. It also voted to dignify the motley group of volunteers besieging Boston with the name \"Continental Army. \" For commander in chief Congress chose George Washington. It valued his experience and ability, but the fact that he was a Vir- ginian was also important because it would keep the Southern and Middle colonies from thinking of the conflict as New En- gland's war. Although it would be more than a year until independence was declared, the American Revolution had begun.

Explanation Everything that happens does so because something makes it hap- pen. What happens is called the effect. The person, condition, or event that makes the thing happen is called the cause. The connection between what happens and what makes it happen is known as a cause-and-eftect relationship. The following guidelines will aid you in identifying cases of cause- and-effect relationships in written material: studied. These are major forces in history that make things happen. CONFLICT IN BOSTON, 1773 Causes • Britain granted East India Com- pany a monopoly on tea sales in America. • Colonists boycotted tea. • Tea ships not allowed to unload in colonial harbors.

A map can give you a visual representation that helps you \"see\" what you are reading. The map that follows shows the battles of Lexington and Concord. By study- ing it, you might be able to picture Paul Revere racing down the road on his famous midnight ride. You might also see the minutemen who lived in the countryside, getting ready to meet the British at Lexington. Military maps, besides giving you a visual represen- tation of an event, can provide helpful information that sometimes the text does not include. For exam- ple, a map might show what kind of terrain is involved. You could tell if the soldiers had to march over hills or through rivers. A military map could also show which ports had to be protected, how much area the soldiers covered, and what their advances and retreats were. Military maps usually use symbols to show battle sites. From this, you might be able to determine how one event might have led to another. Color is also importani on military maps. On the following map, red shows the British troops' routes and black and blue shows the Americans' routes. To help yoti read military maps, follow the guide- lines explained below. • Look at the title to determine the subject. • Find the legend. It will include symbols to help you find routes and battle sites. • Study the mileage chart to get an idea of how much land they covered. For example, in this map, you can see that it is about 21 miles from Boston to Concord. Remember that Paul Revere and the other riders were covering this on horseback. • If the map is topographical, or shows land features, consider what the soldiers had to deal with in marching and fighting battles.

Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • List the arguments for American inde- pendence. • Explain the purposes and principles of the Declaration of Independence. After the bloodshed in Mas- sachusetts, people like Patrick Henry of Virginia appealed tor separation from Great Britain. But most colonists were not ready for independence and neither was the Second Continental Congress that convened in Philadelphia in May 1775. Instead, most of the members wanted the colonies to remain part of the British empire and at the same time rule themselves through their own legislatures. Even after selecting George Washington of Virginia as the commander in chief of the new Conti- nental Army, the Congress declared, \"We have not raised armies with ambitious designs of separating from Great Britain, and establishing independent states.\" In a petition that tried to appease the king, the delegates blamed all their troubles on his ministers, \"those artful and cruel enemies who abuse your royal confidence and authority for the purpose of effecting our destruction.\" But the British government adopted an inflexible attitude. King George III refused to read the conciliatory petition from the Continental Congress and denounced the \"diverse wicked and desperate persons\" leading the rebels. He called on loyal sub- jects to charge the American leaders with treason, or attempting to overthrow the government, and to punish them accord- ing to British law: . . . that the offender be drawn on a hurdle to the place of execution, that there he be hanged by the neck but not till he be dead, that while yet alive he be disembowelled and that then his body be divided into four quarters, the head and each quarter to be at the disposal of the crown. The king then took direct action. In October 1775, a British naval force burned to the ground the defenseless port of Falmouth, Maine. Finally in December, George III declared the American colonies entirely outside his protection and placed all their ports under blockade by the British fleet. Unable to raise sufficient troops in Great Britain because the war was unpopular, the king hired mercenar- ies, or paid soldiers, from the rulers of small German states.

Moving Toward Independence At this critical moment, a most persua- sive and widely read pamphlet was pub- lished. Entitled Common Sense, it was written in January 1776 by Thomas Paine, an English radical who had recently arrived in America. Paine attacked the strongest bond still keeping America tied to Britain — loyalty to the king. He assaulted monarchy in general and George 111 in particular, discrediting hereditary kingship as a superstition that had been sold to the ignorant by means of lies and fables. In Common Sense Paine stated that a king was usually \"the principal ruffian ol some ruthless gang,\" and George III, \"the royal brute ol Great Britain,\" was typical ol his breed. Paine pointed to the advan- tages Americans might gain it they were free ol British commercial restrictions and ol Britain's quarrels with its European neighbors. He appealed to the Americans' beliel that they were a chosen people, pio- neers of liberty: Freedom hath been haunted around the globe, Asia and Africa have long expelled her Europe regards her like a stranger, and England hath given her warning to depart.

On what grounds could the colonists argue that English subjects had the right to overthrow a king? Common Sense had a large circulation and served to divide Americans into either Patriots, who favored separation, or Loy- alists, who supported the British govern- ment. The early successes of American Patriots supported Paine's arguments. In Virginia they expelled the royal governor and the soldiers defending him; in North Carolina the militia, the colony's emer- gency forces, repulsed an attempted land- ing of redcoats; in South Carolina a full-scale British attack on Charleston was brilliantly driven back. The greatest American success occurred in New England. When Washington arrived to take charge of the Continental Army near Boston, he had almost no artillery, or large guns, but during the winter the rebels seized over 50 cannons from Fort Ticonderoga. Weighing two to six tons apiece, they were lashed to sledges and dragged by oxen 200 miles over snowy trails and frozen rivers to Dorch- ester Heights overlooking Boston. During the night of March 4, 1776, about 2,000 militiamen positioned groups of these cannons. In the morning this threat greet- ed General William Howe, who had replaced General Thomas Gage as com- mander of the British force, leaving him no choice but to abandon the city. On March 17 he sailed north for Halifax, Nova Scotia, carrying with him 1,000 Loyalists who preferred exile to rebellion. Colonists made strong arguments for independence from their need for military supplies and for reopening foreign trade. The Americans lacked guns, gunpowder. ammunition, uniforms, tents, and medical supplies as well as the facilities to produce them in quantity. The cutoff of trade with the British Empire caused acute distress among American shippers and merchants who had to scramble to find new markets. Commercial treaties with other nations had to be arranged and such treaties could only be written by an independent nation — not by rebellious colonies. Furthermore, the members of the Con- tinental Congress hoped for aid from France. Since 1763 the French had desired revenge on Great Britain for the terrible defeat they suffered in the Seven Years' War. As early as November 1775, a French agent secretly conferred with members of the Congress. Within a few months the French government started to smuggle arms to the Americans. Never- theless, France refused to enter into a for- mal alliance or sign a commercial treaty until the Americans declared themselves an independent nation. Beginning with North Carolina in April 1776, the colonies advised their delegates in Congress to vote for independence. On June 7, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia introduced a brief \"Resolution of Inde- pendence.\" The delegates debated for nearly a month while the moderates in Congress made a last stand for reconcilia- tion. On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted Lee's resolution \"that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent states.\" The official Declaration of Independence had been in preparation for almost a month before it was agreed upon by Congress on July 4. Its purpose was to justify the revolution, to notify the world and Great Britain that the colonies were independent, and to state the principles upon which the new nation was founded. The Declaration of Independence The Declaration of Independence is principally the work of Thomas Jefferson, a young Virginian who had been an inconspicuous member of Congress. A poor public speaker and shy by nature. 124 Unit 2 The Struggle for Independence: 1650-1789"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Jefferson was known as an able writer. When Congress appointed a committee to draw tip a public statement justifying independence, he was naturally included. Two prominent and busier members ot the committee, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, asked Jefferson to write the first draft of the declaration. Since time was so limited, Jefferson did not write an entirely original document. He drew upon several sources — a declara- tion of grievances, or complaints, he had written earlier, the new Virginia Bill of Rights, Lee's resolution, and writings of European political philosophers. Begin- ning in the 1600s scientists such as Isaac Newton had promoted a belief in an orderly universe governed by scientific principles. This thinking became the foundation of \"Enlightenment\" philoso- phy that spread from Europe to America. Jefferson was one of many Americans who accepted and built upon principles derived from these thinkers. In particular, he was influenced by the ideas of \"natural rights\" and government by social contract written by the English philosopher, John Locke. Jefferson gave the idea of natural rights its most eloquent expression in the Declaration of Independence. When Jefferson submitted his draft to Franklin, the old scholar made a few changes before the committee finally sent the document to Congress. There, additional changes were made before its final acceptance. The Declaration has four main parts: the preamble, or introduction, which states why the Continental Congress chose to explain their separation from Britain formally and publicly; a declara- tion of rights which describes the general theories of government upon which the American Revolution was founded; a long list of grievances against George III; and finally, the formal resolution of indepen- dence. The declaration of rights sets forth a philosophy of human rights that has influenced generations of people around the world. Much was derived from John Locke's Second Tiratise on Government that was originally intended to justify the right of the English to overthrow King James II in the \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688. After a statement in the preamble that the Americans were publishing the Declaration out of \"a decent respect to the opinions of mankind,\" Jefferson wrote the famous sen- tence, the basis for all that follows: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.

True equaUty of condition for men and women was not a subject for consideration by even the most enlightened leaders of the eighteenth century. Many delegates to Congress, including Jefferson himself owned slaves. Equal rights and equality before the law were distant dreams that would unfold over the next two centuries in America. The self-evident truths to which Jefferson referred were that rights are God-given or \"natural,\" not subject to the whim of a monarch or even an elected government. The next lines of the Declaration set forth the idea of government by social contract: That to secure these rights. Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Like Locke, Jetferson suggested that the purpose ol government is to secure natu- ral rights. Locke had argued that in a \"state of nature\" people were all free, equal, and independent. They gave up their complete freedom in order to join a communit)' for their own safety and comtort. Jetterson agreed that the origin of government was a social contract in which people granted power to the rulers in exchange for protection of their rights. In truth, most eighteenth-century gov- ernments had their origin in conquest or seizure of power in the distant past, not in any agreement by the people to pro- tect their rights. This passage, however, notably insisted that the only rightfitl aim of government is to protect the indi- vidual, and that government is the agent of the people. II a just government rests on popular consent, the document continues, the people may refuse their consent to an unjust government, may \"alter or abolish it,\" and may set up another government. This passage, then, justified revolution. In the twentieth century it has sometimes been called the right of self-determina- tion, meaning the right of people to be free from foreign rule. Having its founda- tion in such a principle, the United States has been challenged throughout its histo- ry about conducting its foreign relations accordingly. Whether it has done so has often caused heated debates about Ameri- can foreign policy. Next the Declaration charges that the British government had attempted to put Americans under the king's power. An early version of the document blamed British misdeeds on Parliament, but this was altered to read \"the present King of Great Britain.\" This change increased the effectiveness of the Decla- ration because revolt against a tyrannical monarch was politically more acceptable than revolt against representatives in Parliament. The largest section of the Declaration is a list of grievances against this \"present King of Great Britain.\" Relentlessly, Jef- ferson heaped wrong upon wrong. Note his use of monotonous repetition: \"He has refused.... He has forbidden.... He has utterly neglected.... He has obstruct- ed.... He has plundered.... He has.... He has.... He has....\" These charges were not entirely fair. George III did not begin the quarrel with the colonies nor did he play an important role in shaping policy toward America until 1774. From that point on, however, the king resisted con- ciliation. The Declaration of Independence clos- es by maintaining that the Americans did everything possible to preserve peace with \"our British brethren\" and were spurned. There was nothing left for them but to declare that \"these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be. 126 Unit 2 The Struggle for Independence: 1650-1789"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Free and Independent States.\" To defend this action, the Americans pledged their hves, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. Influence of the Declaration Even though it contained few original ideas, the Declaration of Independence became one of the world's most important political documents. In it Americans made a commitment, as Lincoln later stat- ed in the Gettysburg Address, \"to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" As a result, the Declaration has been a continual lever for change in American society — toward equal rights, equal opportunities, and equal voice in government. At different times in our his- tory, it has operated toward ending slav- ery, giving women the right to vote, enlarging job opportunities, and extend- ing opportunities for education. With a genius for simple and eloquent prose, Jef- ferson managed to plant the ideals of equality and self-government in the American tradition. Up to 1776 colonists based their claims to self-government within the British Empire on colonial charters and on the traditional \"rights of English- men.\" The Declaration demanded inde- pendence from Britain on the basis of the natural, inborn rights of all persons. Thus, the Declaration of Independence acquired worldwide significance. When the Marquis de Lafayette returned to France after fighting for the American cause in the Revolutionary War, he hung a copy of the Declaration in a niche in his dining room; another empty niche beside it awaited a similar French declaration of human rights. When the Spanish-American colonies revolted in the early nineteenth century, several drew up declarations based on the United States' model. In the twenti- eth century, Jawaharlal Nehru (juh WAH huhr LAHL NAY ROO), the first prime minister of India, called the Dec- laration of Independence a \"landmark in human freedom.\" Section One Review iiiiiiiiiTimTTTra Summary Despite the efforts of moderates in the colonies and in Parliament, a war no one really wanted was declared in 1776. Americans used theories of natural rights and contract government to declare their independence from the British empire. After compiling a long list of grievances against a tyrannical George III, they con- cluded that separation was their only pos- sible course of action. The United States of America came into being.

More important, the committee needed to explain why separation was the only fitting solution to long standing disputes with Parliament and the British Crown. Thomas Jefferson was assigned to prepare a working draft of this document, which was then revised. It was officially adopted, July 4, 1776.

Leading political think- ers in the two countries shared humankind. The Marquis de Lafayette, a French nobleman who fought for the American cause, returned to his native land and Storming the Bastille, July 14, 1789 championed freedom. At his sug- gestion French revolutionaries in 1789 adopted a Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. This document proclaimed ideas that were at the foundation of the American Revolution, namely, that laws are an expression of the gener- al will. All persons born equal in the eyes of the law and in opportu- nity, have rights to liberty, property, security, and to resist oppression; and they have freedom of opinion, religion, speech, and writing. When French insurgents wrenched open the doors of the Bastille prison in 1789 and freed its prison- ers, Lafayette symbolically ac- knowledged French debt to the American Revolution by sending President Washington the key to the prison. Soon a wave of revolution swept through Spain's colonies in revolutionaries drew inspiration from both the American and French examples. Antonio Nar- ino, a hero of Colombian inde- pendence, was exiled for translating and publish- ing a copy of the French Declaration. Simon Bolivar, the great South American lib- erator, echoed revolu- tionary French and Amer- ican ideals when he said in 1815 that \"South Americans have made efforts to obtain. ..civil societies founded on the principles of justice, liberty and equality. \"In so doing, Bolivar restated once again the dream made reality by volley fire from New England Patriot farmers in April 1775.

The British would not willingly surrender so large a part of their colonial empire to a band of rebels. Dur- ing the early stages of the war, it was all Washington could do to prevent the cap- ture of his entire army. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • List two reasons why the American vic- tories at Trenton and Princeton were important. • Compare the difficulties faced by the Americans and the British in the Revo- lutionary War. Early in 1776 Parliament autho- rized an army of 35,000, includ- ing 30,000 German mercenaries. In August 1776, perhaps the largest single military force ever sent from Europe to America appeared off the coast of New York City — more than 400 trans- ports bearing 32,000 troops, guarded by 30 warships, under the command of Sir William Howe. With his brother, Admiral Richard Howe, he addressed a conciliatory letter to \"George Washington, Esq.,\" offer- ing to pardon the rebels if they laid down their arms, restored the local governments that existed before 1775, and accepted royal governors and councils. When Wash- ington refused to consider proposals that ofilered nothing but pardons, the British war machine moved into action. Easily defeating an ill-trained militia of 20,000 under Washington's command, the British took New York City and held it until the war ended seven years later. They followed Washington's army up the Hudson River and, when he crossed to New Jersey, pur- sued him southward to the Delaware River. Through desertions, deaths, and captures, the American army was now reduced to 5,000, and the Continental Congress was forced to flee from Philadel- phia to Baltimore. Trenton and Princeton When all seemed lost, Washington plan- ned a bold move. On the evening ot December 25, the first issue of The Crisishy Thomas Paine was read to the troops. \"These are the times that try men's souls \" Hoping to win at least one battle before his troops' terms were up, Washing- ton ferried his soldiers back across the Del- aware River in a freezing winter wind. Nine miles away lay Trenton, held by 1 ,300 Hes- sians imder the command of Colonel Johann Gotdieb Rail, who regarded the Americans as \"country clowns. \" Rail had taken lew precautions against attack. Wish- ington guessed correctly that these German troops would celebrate Christmas by get- ting thoroughly drunk and took a chance on surprising them the morning after. He attacked at dawn on December 26, killing or capturing more than 1,000 Hessians in only three-quarters ol an hour. Rail, gravely wounded, was carried back to his headquar- ters. As doctors cut away his clothes to treat his wounds, they found an unopened note from a Loyalist who had tried to warn him the night belore that Washington was com- ing.

Arriving in New York in 1772, he soon joined the Patriot struggle. A Jewish businessman of remark- able ability, Salomon acquired wealth, all of which he risked during the American Revolution. Twice arrested as a spy, he was condemned to death for plotting to burn British ships at anchor outside New York City. He escaped by bribing his jailer and fled to Philadelphia.

He also worked with Robert Morris to secure loans for the war effort. As a result of his devotion to America — and business problems after the war — Salomon died penniless. gave him more power, and new enlist- ments joined his army as it moved to win- ter quarters at Morristown, New Jersey. Financial Problems Victory was sweet, but harder tests of Patriot endurance lay ahead. Raising a volunteer army for short-term duty was difficult enough; keeping troops in service was nearly impossible. Although some 300,000 persons eventually took up arms as Patriots, Washington could never count on more than 20,000 under his command at any point. Most soldiers served during the winter months, then returned home tor the spring planting, and many refused to fight outside their own home areas. Throughout the war Washington begged for more troops, but Congress was power- less to do anything more than pass these requests along to the states. Paying for the war was equally difficult. Lacking the power to tax, Congress issued paper money. These \"Continentals,\" which had nothing to support their value, soon became nearly worthless. Fortunately Robert Morris, a Pennsylvania merchant and banker, personally pledged large amounts of money for the war effort. A member of the Continental Congress, Morris was elected superintendent of finance in 1781, a position that earned him the title \"financier of the American Revolution.\" Largely through his efforts, sufficient funds were raised to move Washington's army from New York to the final campaign at Yorktown. American Advantages Washington's leadership was undoubt- edly America's greatest asset, even though he lost more battles than he won. He may have been mistaken in training his army on strictly European lines. He sometimes annoyed his troops by his stiff manner and a tendency to talk as though all were lost. But no one did more to win the war. While British commanders often returned to England for the winter, Washington remained at his post. He saw his home at Mount Vernon only once during the war, and then only for a few hours. He alone 134 Unit 2 The Struggle for Independence: 1650-1789"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"commanded sufficient respect to keep the frail Continental Army from dissolving. As one former soldier later told his grand- children, \"He was a fine man, General Washington — he was everything a man should be.\" Great Britain's military strength should have been sufficient to defeat the rebels. The British government had hard cash to pay its troops and to buy food from I^oy- alist farmers. The disciplined army, well- trained officers, and a strong navy kept supplies flowing. But the British faced several major hurdles. First, the war was unpopular in Britain. General Gage, who was relieved of his command in 1775, observed: They [colonists] give out that they expect peace on their own terms through the inability of Britain to contend with them; and it is no ivonder that such reports gain credit with the people, when letters from England and English newspapers give so much encouragement to rebellion. In addition, Britain's sprawling colonial empire, threatened by other European powers, demanded that troops stretch around the globe. While American sol- diers defended their homes, the British, thousands of miles from home, fought for a cause that many did not understand or even support. Finally, in order to win, the British had to gain control of a vast Amer- ican territory. This task was especially dif- ficult because the American's hit-and-run tactics frustrated British generals, and Washington established an effective spy system that brought information from behind British lines at critical times. Despite these problems, British generals believed that they could defeat the poorly equipped Americans. Lieutenant General John Burgoyne devised a plan that would divide and conquer the rebels. Neither he nor the Americans could foresee that this effort would backfire, resulting in Ameri- ca obtaining the key ingredient for its suc- cess — French aid. « Section Two Revie'w Summary At the outset, the United States had serious problems carrying out a revolution they were ill-prepared to execute. George Washington had to raise, train, and equip a colonial army to face the most powerful military establishment in the world. With no power to tax or draft professional sol- diers. Congress could only ask states for help, which they generally refused. Despite early losses, Washington's victo- ries in 1777 boosted morale and offered Americans hope. Checking for Understanding 1.

The middle class admired him because of his successful publishing career and the say- ings of Poor Richard's Almanac. Intellectu- als admired him as a scientist. To liberals, he represented the way a free society allowed people to rise by their own tal- ents. The French officials, whom he pressed for more troops, money, and sup- plies, were won over by his ability, courage, cheerfiilness, and tact. But Franklin's charms may have been wasted had not the Americans proved that they could win a crucial battle. France, its trea- sury already strained, would not provide funds for the American struggle unless there was some hope of success. News of the British defeat at Saratoga settled the issue. British Attack from Canada Although an American attempt to con- quer Canada in 1776 had failed, it forced the British to divert to Canada troops that might have been better used in New York and New Jersey. In 1777 General John Burgoyne planned a great three-pronged attack that would divide the colonies along the line ot Lake Champlain and the Hudson Valley. According to the plan, while General Howe moved up the Hud- son River from New York City, Bur- goyne's army would move south from Montreal. A lesser force under British offi- cer Barry St. Leger would invade by way of Lake Ontario and the Mohawk River. The three armies would meet near Albany. Because the British war office failed to keep in touch with him, Howe's army never participated in the plan. Hoping to catch Washington, Howe led an expedi- tion from New York to Philadelphia, the 136 Unit 2 The Struggle for Independence: 1650-1789"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"capital. He captured Philadelphia in September, overcoming Washington at the Battle of Brandywine and inflicting a further defeat on the Americans at Ger- mantown, Pennsylvania, in October. This time Congress fled to York, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, Burgoyne's force of 8,000 troops, unaware that Howe's army would not meet them — started south toward Albany. They easily recaptured Fort Ticonderoga in midsummer. Their com- fortable success was primarily because American soldiers opposing Burgoyne were poorly trained and badly equipped. Their officers employed so much energy quarreling among themselves they could scarcely direct the troops. After such an effortless victory, however, Burgoyne faced one obstacle after another. A force of 1,000 Americans felled trees across the only road to Albany, so that Burgoyne's army could move no more than 1 mile a day. A British force sent toward Bennington, Vermont, for rations was surrounded by volunteers under Gen- eral John Stark who inspired his troops with: My men, yonder are the Hessians. They were bought for seven pounds and ten pence a man. Are you worth niore? Prove it. Tonight, the American flag floats from yonder hill or Molly Stark sleeps a widow! To further delay Burgoyne's master plan, St. Leger's advance from Lake Ontario was slowed by his own troops\" bloody ambush of Americans at Oriskany, New York. The stage was set for a dramatic American victory.

Eventually, Burgoyne was surrounded by a force nearly twice as large as his own. He was unable to get food, to retreat to Ticonderoga, or to advance on Albany. After making one unsuccessful attempt to cut through the American lines, his force surrendered at Saratoga in October 1777. The victory at Saratoga proved crucial.

In 1876, the centen- nial of the Ameri- can Revolution, France gave the United States a monument to freedom, the Stat- ue of Liberty. One of General John J.

From 1778 on, the Continental Army was partly supplied and paid with French gifts and loans and reinforced by disci- plined French regiments. The French navy prevented the British from moving troops as they pleased up and down the Atlantic Coast. Following the lead of France, Spain and the Netherlands entered the war against England, while Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, and Portugal formed a League of Armed Neu- trality to resist British sea power. The Winter at Valley Forge Before French aid reached America, Washington's army had to endure the unusually harsh winter of 1777 and 1778 encamped at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Many of the soldiers lacked food, shoes, and coats and had no money to purchase them. Some did not have a single shirt or pair of pants. F4uddled together in small huts, they wrapped themselves in blankets and walked barefoot through the snow to haul water. On duty, some stood with their feet inside their hats. When a soldier's feet froze, they were amputated. By spring nearly one-fourth of the original 10,000 soldiers had died. Others had deserted. While the American army was freezing and starving, farmers around Valley Forge sold their meat and grain to British troops in Philadelphia who paid not in \"Continen- tals' but in silver coin. The Prussian Baron Friedrich W.A. von Steuben and the French Marquis de Lafayette joined Washington at Valley Forge, bringing discipline and encourage- ment. By spring, the tattered army began to regain morale as new provisions arrived from France. Several European nations joined with France to lend financial and military support. Individual volunteers such as Count Casimir Pulaski of Poland, von Steuben, and Lafayette were evidence ol the widespread sympathy generated by the Revolution. Difficult Choices When the Declaration of Independence called the United States \"one people, \" it expressed a hope rather than a fact. Only about one-third of the American people actively supported the war. Another third were indifferent to the Patriot cause, except when fighting reached their doorsteps. The rest supported the British. The American Revolution was a civil war as well as a war against Great Britain. In every one of the 13 colonies, Loyalists, sometimes called Tories by the Patriots, refused to abandon allegiance to George III. In some areas Loyalists remained in control, and thousands joined the British army. The struggle between the Patriots and the Loyalists was as bitter as the 138 Unit 2 The Struggle for Independence: 1650-1789"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"struggle between the rebels and the British. Patriots thought ot the Loyalists as traitors to the American cause. Loyalists thought of Patriots as traitors to Britain. Many Loyalists were wealthy; some were royal officials, military officers, Anglican ministers, college presidents, large landowners, doctors, lawyers, and merchants. They found rebels like the Sons of Liberty threatening. Said one Loy- alist: \"If I must be devoured, let me be devoured by the jaws of a lion [Britain], and not gnawed to death by rats.\" But not all the Loyalists were wealthy. In upstate New York, poor tenant farmers joined the Loyalists because the landowners support- ed the Revolution. In some southern states, backcountry farmers became Loyal- ists because they disliked the Patriot mer- chants and planters of the coastal areas. It is not surprising that Loyalists were most numerous in British-occupied cities such as New York, Philadelphia, Charleston, and Savannah. To prove their loyalty to the crown, they sometimes spied and informed on the rebels. Later, when the British army withdrew from these areas, the Loyalists feared for their lives. Over 400 Loyalist families fled from Savannah to Jamaica, taking with them more than 5,000 slaves. From all the colonies, perhaps 100,000 Loyalists packed their belongings, sold whatever they could, and left hurriedly for Canada, Bermuda, and Great Britain. Those who remained behind were often persecuted by their neighbors. Many lost their property; others were imprisoned or tarred and feathered. A few were executed. Many women actively served the Amer- ican cause. As secret agents they supplied Washington and other generals with information about British positions and plans. They raised money to equip troops. They ran farms and businesses while their husbands were away at war. John Adams's family would have gone bankrupt had not Abigail Adams capably managed their lamily farm in Braintree, Massachusetts. During the war it was common for women to accompany the troops — both American and British — serving as cooks, medics, laundresses, and guides. Sarah Osbiun went with her husband's regiment from West Point to Yorktown, washing, mending, and cooking for the soldiers. Once, while carrying food supplies, she met General Washington, who asked her if she was \"not afraid of the cannonballs.\" \"No,\" she replied, \"it would not do for the men to fight and starve too.\" A few women fought in the ranks, the most famous being Mary Ludwig Hays, better known as Molly Pitcher. Carrying water to the gunners during the battle of Monmouth, New Jersey, in 1778, she saw her husband fall and took his place at the cannon. For her services she later received a pension of $50 a year. Deborah Samp- son disguised herself as a man and enlist- ed in a Massachusetts regiment.

Peddlers — traveling hawkers of dry goods — canvased the countiy- side ivith pack horses and wagons laden with merchandise. Such Yankee voidors dated fi-om early colonial times and were a prominent fixture in rural America for gen- erations. Wherever crowds assem- bled — at political events, reli- gious gath- erings, or other meet- ings — a peddler sell- ,^ ing wares was also likely to be present. In between times the peddler traveled house to house and was a welcome visitor. His sundry inven- tory varied, of course, but goods ranged from such notions as pins, combs, buttons, and ribbon to necessities such as clocks, tin- ware, drugs, shoes, spices, cloth, even books. The peddler, who was a careful observer of human nature as well as a shrewd trader, brought news and gossip, gave advice, and sometimes even treated the sick. Due to cus- tomary shortages of currency and coin, barter for goods was the usual practice. Some successful peddlers eventually established themselves with a general store. For others the appeal of the road was simply too great to resist.

When John Adams was serving in the Continental Congress, his wife Abigail sent him this message: By the ivay, in the new Code of Laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make, I desire you woidd remember the Ladies and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors! Do not put unlimited power in the hands of husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they cotdd. If particular care and attention is not paid to the Ladies, we are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice or Representation. Abigail Adams's words went unheeded. The American Revolution did very little to change the political rights of women. Although new state bills of rights declared all people equal, they reserved full privi- leges of citizenship for white males. When the colonies rebelled against Great Britain, African Americans and native Americans were faced with difficult choices. Each side in the conflict wanted their support, but which side should they join? Would the British or the Americans give African Americans their freedom? Which side would protect the territorial rights of native Americans? From the beginning of the war, at Lex- ington, Concord, and Bunker Hill, black soldiers fought for the American cause. But slave owners were afraid to give guns to black people, whether slave or free. In November 1775, orders went out to dis- charge all African American soldiers in the Continental Army and not to permit oth- ers to enlist. Soon after, the royal governor of Virginia promised to free any slave or indentured servant who joined the British army. Many slaves were reportedly cross- ing into the British lines. As a result, the Continental Congress reversed its policy and allowed free blacks to reenlist and to be recruited into the army and navy. Most African American soldiers served in inte- grated regiments, although some states organized all-black companies.

Other slaves who were recruited into the army either won freedom from the start or at the end of their military service. In 1775 the Continental Congress sent a message to the Iroquois Nation. \"This is a family quarrel between us and old En- gland.\" It asked the native Americans \"to remain at home, and not join on either side....\" Some groups of native Americans remained neutral, but many joined the British. They knew the Americans opposed the British Proclamation ot 1763, which reserved the land west ol the Appalachian Mountains tor the native Americans. British agents encouraged the native Americans to attack frontier settlements. They provided weapons and ammunition to Cherokees to raid the Virginia, Geor- gia, and Carolina frontiers. These actions diverted many state militia from fighting against British troops. The British stirred up similar trouble in Ohio and through- out the Northwest and enlisted native Americans into the British army. In New York four nations of the Iroquois Confederation supported the British. Washington sent troops against the Iro- quois and broke their confederation. Many Indians — including most of the Mohawks — moved permanently to Canada. mm m^td Summary With superior land and naval forces, adequate financing, and experienced mili- tary leadership, the British were assuming a victory.

Yet the rebels held on, continuing to frustrate redcoat generals by avoiding direct con- frontation and capture. The rebellion had broken out in the north, but the conclu- sion would be played out in the south in dramatic fashion at Yorktown, Virginia. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify the problems that the British and Americans faced in continuing the war effort. • Explain the military strategy that defeated Lord Cornwallis. In 1778 the British evacuated Philadelphia and marched across New Jersey toward New York. On their way, Washington attacked Gen- eral Henry Clintons 12-mile baggage train at Monmouth. A mistaken order and perhaps treachery prevented an American victory, but CHnton was not able to take advantage ot American blun- ders. He escaped to Manhattan where he would remain until the end of the war. While New York City remained in British hands, Washington kept an eye on the enemy from his camp in nearby White Plains, New York. British Focus on the South Unable to capture Washington's army or to put down the rebellion in the north, the British turned their main military efforts to the south. For three years, beginning in 1778, the redcoats marched through Georgia, the Carolinas, and Vir- ginia, their main forces never suflering defeat. The British were not as successful in the southwest. General Bernardo de Galvez, the governor ol Spanish Louisiana, gave secret assistance to the Americans, allow- ing them to ship arms, ammunition, and supplies up the Mississippi River. When Spain officially entered the war in 1779, Galvez's troops defeated the British at Baton Rouge, Natchez, and Pensacola. These battles were important because they forced the British to divert troops away from their campaigns along the Atlantic coast. . The American cause suffered a year of gloom in 1780. When 6,000 French troops landed at Newport, Rhode Island, a British fleet promptly blockaded them. The Continental Army had not been paid lor a month and was on the verge of mutiny. Civilians suffered from high prices as a result ol the flood of paper money that had been printed by states and the Continental Congress. American morale received its most severe blow when a major general turned traitor. Benedict Arnold, a brilliant military leader, had won several battles lor the American cause. After Arnold was wound- ed at Saratoga, Washington assigned him the post of military governor of Philadel- phia. In February 1779, the Council of Pennsvlvania brought charges against Arnold for abuse of power and self-serving 142 Unit 2 The Struggle for Independence: 1650-1789"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"business dealings. Washington issued a mild rebuke but continued to include Arnold in plans tor the coming campaign. Arnold, however, had already decided to join the British Army. In 1780 he attempted to turn over to the British the American fort on the Hudson River at West Point. Arnold tried to deliver a secret message to Major John Andre, head of British secret service, but three Ameri- can militiamen intercepted his notes. Washington was given the evidence in Arnold's own writing. \"Arnold has betrayed me,\" he said, \"Whom can we trust now?\" The British were having their troubles, too. Ireland had rebelled, and pro-Ameri- can riots erupted in London. The British armies could not keep their conquests in the south because they could not win the loyalty of the inhabitants. A British officer compared his company to a ship at sea: it moved in any direction it wished but left no trace behind. The British were also harassed by guerrilla fighters under the leadership oi Francis Marion, \"the Swamp Fox.\" Sometimes commanding as few as 30 men, sometimes as many as 900, Mari- on repeatedly surprised and defeated small British forces. Beginning of the End Believing that Georgia and Sotith Car- olina were secure, Lord Cornwallis, the British commander oi forces in the south, moved into North Carolina. At King's Mountain, on October 7, 1780, back- country rebels ambushed an army ol 1,100 Loyalists. After this victory Daniel Morgan and General Nathaniel Greene defeated part of a British force under Cornwallis at Cowpens in January, but were forced to retreat at Guilford Court- house in March 1781. The most serious setbacks for the British in 1780 and 1781 were naval defeats at the hands of the French, causing them to lose command of the Atlantic. This made possible the capture of the principal British force in the south under Lord Cornwallis, who had moved out of North C^arolina to what he believed to be the safety of Yorktown, Virginia. General Washington, outside New York with the main body of the Continental Army, learned that a French fleet under Admiral de Grasse was heading for the Chesapeake Bay. At the urging of General Jean Baptiste Rochambeau (Rc:)H SHAHM BOH), commander of the French troops in America, Washington agreed to a remarkable combined operation against the British. Leaving a few troops behind to fool Clinton, Washington sped south with a large force. The French fleet blocked the entrance to Chesapeake Bay, beating back a British fleet sent to relieve Cornwallis. Meanwhile, a French army sailed from Rhode Island to Virginia. Additional forces under Anthony Wayne and Lafayette con- verged on Yorktown. Besieged on land and hemmed in by sea, Cornwallis was forced to surrender on October 19, 1781. Upon learning the news.

Years of bombing and fighting against the Vietcong did not weaken the enemy's will to fight. Just as many British protested against their gov- ernment over the Revolutionary War, as Americans protested against the war in Viet- nam. American leaders, convinced that a military vic- tory was too costly, followed the same course the British adopted in 1783, a negotiated peace. It was not quite over. Because the war included French and Spanish alliances, the fighting in Europe dragged on for two more years. But there were no significant battles in America after Yorktown. The Treaty of Paris, 1783 A combination of events, positions, and interests enabled the United States to achieve a favorable peace settlement. The British knew that Spain was not eager to see the United States extend its bound- aries beyond the Appalachians and threat- en Spanish control of Louisiana and Florida. Great Britain hoped to drive a wedge between the United States and its allies by offering generous peace terms. Originally Congress instructed the Ameri- can commissioners to conclude no settle- ment unless the French agreed. However, when it was discovered that the French might secretly encourage the British to offer the Americans a boundary well east of the Mississippi, the commissioners vio- lated their instructions. They negotiated directly with the British representatives, played on British desires to destroy the American-French alliance, and were able to secure valuable western territories. A brilliant war-time expedition of 180 Virginia soldiers under George Rogers Clark in 1778 had helped to establish the American position. Clark's capture ol the British posts of Kaskaskia (kas KAS kee uh) and Vincennes (vihn SEHNZ), locat- ed in present day Illinois and Indiana, established the United States' claim to the trans-Appalachian West. The Treaty of Paris in 1783 acknowl- edged American independence and grant- ed the new nation land from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. Although several provisions ol the treaty led to later disputes, it was a great diplomatic victory. The United States gained an area four times the size of France and nearly ten . times that of the British Isles. Influence of the American Revolution When British troops marched out of Yorktown to lay down their arms, Ameri- can bands played a march called \"The World Turn'd Upside Down. \" Perhaps it had. The American victory gave new hope to the oppressed in Europe and endan- gered the old system of monarchy and aristocracy. The American Revolution was one of the causes of the French Revolution. The large sums ot money France poured into the American Revolution brought its gov- ernment to the verge of bankruptcy. When the king's ministers proposed new loans or taxes to balance the budget in 1778, French people raised the familiar cry of \"no taxation without representa- tion\" and forced King Louis XVI to call representatives of the people together in a body known as the Estates-General. The American example of rebellion against a tyrant inspired French revolutionaries.

The other sentences explain or give detail about the main idea. When the m.iin idea is expressed in the first sentence, it is known as the topic sentence. If the main idea is expressed in the last sentence, it is known as a summary sentence. At times, however, the main idea is stated in a sentence in the middle of the paragraph or is not stated directly at all. The following steps will help you identify the main idea of a paragraph: • Read the paragraph carefully, and determine the general focus or subject. • Read the paragraph again, sentence by sentence. For each, ask yourself what would happen if that sen- tence were not in the paragraph. Would the rest of the sentences tie together and make sense? If the answer to the question is no, you probably have found the sentence that contains the main idea. In that case, identify the idea. • Check the remaining sentences to determine if they support the idea put forth in the sentence you have just chosen. Do they describe, explain, or give details about what you have identified as the main idea? Example Read the following statement by Jehu Grant, a slave who joined the American army during the Revolutionary War: But ivhen I saw the liberty poles and the people all engaged for the support of freedom, I could not but like and be pleased with such thing (God forgive me if I have sinned in so feeling). And living on the borders of Rhode Island, where whole companies of colored people enlisted, it added to my fears and dread of being soM to the British. These considerations induced me to enlist into the American army, where I served for about ten months, when my master found me and took me home. In this example, the first sentence tells why Jehu liked the idea of joining the American army. The sec- ond sentence gives another reason why he wished to enlist and why it was possible for him to enlist. But it isn't until the last sentence that the reader is told that Jehu enlisted and served in the American army.

While soldiers on the battlefield fought for freedom, their leaders struggled to create a government to replace British authority. The result was a unique blend ot British political heritage and the American experience. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe the governments that resulted from state constitutions. • List the strengths and weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation. As the fighting spread from Mas- sachusetts in 1775, royal gover- nors throughout the colonies watched their authority col- lapse. Although at first a few tried to orga- nize Loyalist resistance, eventually all royal governors abandoned their offices and fled. In May 1776, Congress urged the colonies to \"adopt such government as shall best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents.\" For most colonies that meant replacing their colo- nial charters with new constitutions. New State G#vernments Most state constitutions established state governments similar to the colonial governments they replaced. All states except Pennsylvania and Georgia created bicameral, or two-house, legislatures. Members of each house represented geographic districts and, in nearly all the states, were directly elected by the voters. Major changes were made in the execu- tive branch, however. Many Americans had come to distrust strong executive power, the result of their unhappy experi- ence with royal governors and George IIL So most state governors were elected to one-year terms by their legislatures and had no power to veto, or reject, bills passed by the legislature. For the most part, citizenship was restricted to white male property-owners. Neither women nor blacks could vote in most states, and all states established strict property requirements for officeholders. Some Americans, especially in the North, compared their state constitutions to the promise of equalirv' expressed in the Dec- laration of Independence and questioned whether the franchise, or right to vote, should be so limited. Although the Revolution did not win for all Americans the full equality and democracy promised in the Declaration of Independence, it did move American soci- ety in that direction. Because it was diffi- cult to claim that \"all men are created equal\"' in a society where some people were owned by others, many Americans began to question the institution of slav- ery. Some states passed laws to prohibit the importation of more slaves, and by 1804 every state north of Maryland had provided for the emancipation, or freeing, of black slaves. The states accomplished this in different ways. New York simply declared that children of enslaved parents were free at birth. Pennsylvania required 150 Unit 2 The Struggle for Independence: 1650-1780"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"that all slaves born afteriff78(M)e freed at age 28. Some merely paid^aveholders to free their slaves. An enslaved person in Massachusetts sued for his freedom because the state constitution declared \"all men are born free and equal.\" The state court agreed and declared slavery uncon- stitutional in Massachusetts in 1783. In the South there also were those who felt slavery was wrong. In 1782, when Virginia passed a law allowing emancipa- tion of slaves, 10,000 were freed within 8 years. Despite personal feelings, however, little was done elsewhere. In the North the economy did not rely on slavery. In tJie South, however, enslaved people were a large proportion of the wealth, and the plantation system depended on their labor. Even Thomas Jefferson, who hated slavery, did not free his slaves until his death. Like others, Jefferson could see no practical way to end slavery in the South. Another significant victory of the Revo- lution was an increase in religious free- dom. As the Southern colonies gained independence, the Church of England was disestablished — that is, no longer supported by taxation. In Virginia a bill for religious freedom written by Jefferson proclaimed that: . . . [N]o man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place or ministry. . . nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief, but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinion in matters of religion. In New England, however, the descen- dants of the Puritans continued t;ix sup- port of the Congregational Church and allowed only Protestants to vote. In addi- tion, Roman Catholics could not hold office in five states, and lews were barred from office in nine. Although states discriminated against their residents on the basis of race, sex, religion, and economic standing, most state constitutions included bills of rights spelling out the \"unalienable rights\" that government must recognize and protect. State bills of rights guaranteed trial by jury, freedom of the press, and other rights to be protected against tyranny. The Articles of Confederation When the Revolution began, the Second Continental Congress simply assumed most functions of a central gov- ernment, such as appointing army officers and conducting diplomacy, even though it had no legal basis to exercise such powers. While the individual states were drafting their constitutions. Congress developed a plan to unite the states and establish its own legal authority. In 1777 Congress completed the document, called the Arti- cles of Confederation, and proposed that it go into effect only after every state had approved it. Not until 1781, however, did all the states ratify, or agree to, the Articles of Confederation. The main reason for delay was that several states claimed large tracts of western land. Based mainly on colonial charters that had granted land \"from sea to sea,\" these claims often overlapped, causing confusion and conflict. In addi- tion, the six states without western land claims, led by Maryland, argued that the West should become public land, or land belonging to the national government. Maryland refused to ratify the Articles Examining Fine Art Churches played a cen- tral role in the lives of most early Americans.

Until Franklin Roosevelt was elected to four terms as President, custom had restricted Presi- dents to two terms. In 1951 die Constitution was amended to limit Presidents to rwo terms in office.

Therefore, states without western lands refused to agree to a central government until the other states surrendered their land claims. Which state had the largest land claims in the West? until this demand was met. But Virginia, which had huge claims — what is now Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin — refused to cooperate. Finally, in 1781, with Lord Cornwallis and the British army moving toward Virginia, the state agreed to give up its land claims. Mary- land ratified the Articles, and at last the rebelling states were united. Most members of the Continental Congress were quite wary of a strong central government. They took Benjamin Franklin's Albany Plan of Union as their guide and created what John Dickinson, the main author of the Articles, called a \"firm league of Iriendship\" among the states. Governing authority was placed in a unicameral, or one-house. Congress in which each state had one vote.

It could raise an army and navy, borrow money, estabhsh a postal system, and manage native American affairs. The states agreed to \"give full taith and credit to the public acts ot other states,\" such as wills and legal decisions, so that citizens of one state could do business in another. Each state also agreed to return escaped criminals and runaway slaves. There was freedom of movement across state lines. No passports were required tor travelers from one state to another, and there were no barriers to immigration. Finally, the states agreed to settle their dis- putes by arbitration rather than by war. Despite these features, the national gov- ernment under the Articles proved too weak to operate effectively. There was no executive branch to carry out laws, and no federal courts existed to interpret them. Executive power was divided among sev- eral congressional committees. Two important functions, both related to the dispute with Great Britain, were denied to Congress — the power to tax and the power to regulate commerce. Having thrown off their British masters, the states did not intend to put themselves under another. Unable to collect taxes. Congress had to depend on the generosity ot the states tor its income — \"government by supplica- tion,\" or begging, as one frustrated mem- ber observed. Between 1781 and 1789, however, the states gave Congress only about one-sixth of the funds it requested. Without money or real power over the states, the Confederation Congress com- manded so little respect that its members often did not bother to attend sessions. In 1783 it was difficult even to convene enough members to ratify the treaty end- ing the Revolutionary War. That same year, the threats of a few hundred unpaid soldiers drove Congress out of Philadel- phia. For a time it moved Irom city to city, like a company of actors, finally .set- tling in New York.

Bills of rights in each state guaranteed trial by jury, religious freedom, and free- dom of the press. Universal liberty was not granted since many new governments did not abolish slavery. Although the Arti- cles of Confederation created a central government to deal with national and international matters, real power rested with the states that maintained authority to tax, regulate interstate commerce, and coin money. The inability of the Confed- eration government to provide strong leadership emphasized its weakness both at home and abroad. Checking for Understanding 1.

America expanded westward, but it con- tinued to have problems with other nations. There was constant bickering among the states and many groups in society were discontented. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss the problems between the United States and other nations. • Explain the process of settling the West. • Identify the domestic problems ot the new nation. One of the blessings of indepen- dence predicted by Thomas Paine in Common Sense was that America would at last be free of European rivalries that had dragged the colonies into war. Even before the Treaty of Paris was ratified, the Confederation Congress resolved that \"the true interest of these states requires that they should be as little as possible entan- gled in the politics and controversies of European nations.\" Yet total isolation from Europe was impossible. The pros- perity of the United States depended, as before the Revolution, on trade with European nations and their colonies. Sat- isfactory trading arrangements required that the United States make commercial treaties with those nations. There also were problems with the Spanish in Florida and New Orleans to the south, and with the British in the north. These, too, could be settled only by diplomacy. Foreign Relations Predictably, the United States did not enjoy good relations with its recent toe, Great Britain. The British agreed to receive John Adams as minister from the United States, even though he had been a prominent rebel during the war. They refused, however, to send a minister to the United States, explaining that they did not know whether to send 1 or 13. Neither country carried out the terms of the Treaty of Paris. The United States had agreed that British creditors could recover prewar debts by suing in American courts, and that Congress would ask the states to cease persecution of Loyalists. But when British merchants sued in state courts, unfriendly judges and juries usually sided with American debtors. The states also ignored Congress and continued to treat Loyalists harshly, subjecting them to con- fiscation of property, exile, and even lynching. The British government used these treaty violations as an excuse to remain in northern forts they had agreed to abandon. These posts were the centers 154 Unit 2 The Struggle eor Independence: 1650-1789"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"NORTH AMERICA, 1783 XEizo^' TC^^V ^ PACIFIC OCEAN United States Spanish territory Britisti territory Forts in US territory held by British until 1796 Examining IVIaps The Treaty of Paris in 1 783 established the boundaries of the new United States. The newly Independent nation shared the North American continent with British territory to the north and Spanish territory to the west and south. What boundary dispute did the United States have with Spain after the Treaty of Pahs? oi a million-dollar annual fur trade with the Indians that Great Britain was deter- mined to keep. American trade suffered because the for- mer colonies now lay outside the British Empire. American tobacco and naval stores no longer enjoyed a preferred posi- tion in British markets. American ships were banned from the British West Indies, and they were allowed to enter English ports only with the products of their home states — a ship from Massachusetts could not carry New York furs or North Carolina turpentine to London. When the United States tried to negotiate a trade treaty, Great Britain showed little desire to grant economic privileges to its former colonies. Difficulties with Spain during the Con- federation period were as serious as those with Great Britain. The Spanish were unhappy about the vast western lands the United States acquired in the Treaty of Paris, fearing that the future expansion of the United States would threaten the Spanish empire in America. Spain insisted that the southern boundary of the United States was not the border described in the Treaty of Paris, but a line nearly 100 miles to the north. To protect its claims, Spain formed alliances with the Cherokee, Creek, and Chickasaw Indians and incited them against American settlers in the dis- puted territory. They also found American citizens who were willing, for a price, to act as Spanish secret agents. By controlling the mouth of the Missis- sippi River, Spain also was able to threaten western trade. Bulky goods from the West — lumber, grain, and deerskins — could not be easily carried over the moun- tains to the east coast, but had to float down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers on rafts and flarboats. Westerners wanted the right of deposit at New Orleans — that is, permission to put goods ashore for trans- fer to ocean-going ships without paying duties.

Although a treaty was proposed, it paid no attention to western interests. Relations with France were not entirely happy either. During the Revolutionary War, French loans helped keep American armies in the field. Now rising debt inter- est on loans and the extravagance of the court created serious problems in France. Hoping to stave off bankruptcy, the gov- ernment introduced reforms and universal land taxes. The French were also disap- pointed that few commercial opportunities resulted from American independence. Benjamin Franklin had predicted that with the end of British trade regulations, American commerce would be largely transferred to France. But, in general, postwar trade returned to old patterns. By 1789 the British were exporting as much to the United States as before, while the French share of the American market increased only slightly. The most humiliating foreign relations problem for the nation was its treatment by the Barbary Pirates. Four North Af- rican states — Morocco, Tunis, Tripoli, and Algiers — made a practice of capturing the ships and crews of nations who refused to pay them an annual tribute, a payment to sail in their waters. No longer protected by the British fleet and treasury, American ships were subject to attack. Having neither funds for tribute nor a fleet for defense. Congress could not pre- vent American commerce from being driven out of the Mediterranean Sea. Settling the West Until the end of the 1800s, \"the West\" was not a specific geographic region of the United States. Instead, it was a term for the next area of settlement, as pioneers invaded the territor\\' of native Americans and moved them off the land. During the Confederation period, the West lay just beyond the Appalachian Mountains. Only three roads connected this region with the east coast. Yet so many settlers crossed the mountains between 1780 and 1790 that the population grew from 2,000 to Examining Fine Art In this painting by George Caleb Bingham.

Congress was powerless to meet these westerners' needs. It could not dislodge the British from their forts in the north or persuade Spain to grant the right of deposit in the south. It could prevent neither the Spanish nor the British from arming the Indians against western pio- neers. Without money. Congress could neither purchase Indian land nor provide troops to protect settlers. Westerners had other grievances with the national government as well. Many resented that eastern speculators held large tracts of western land. In 1785 a convention of Kentucky settlers declared: ...To grant any Person a larger quantity of land than he designs. . . to seat himself or his Family on, is a greevance. Because it is subversive of the fundamental Principles of a fee republican Government to allow any individual or Company or Body of Men to possess such large tracts of Country in their own right as may at a future Day give them undue influence. In 1784, after making a journey to the West, George Washington reported that the region was hanging to the Confedera- tion by a thread. In what is now Ten- nessee, settlers created a government called the State of Franklin, paying their governor in whiskey and deerskins. Unable to obtain statehood from Congress, some Tennessee leaders consid- ered seceding, or withdrawing, from the Union. Settlers in the Kentucky territory also talked of secession. The Confederation Congress was alarmed about the problems some west- erners were causing in its territories. To protect against \"uninformed, and perhaps licentious people, as the greater part of those who go there are,\" its president urged \"that a strong toned government exist\" in the West. Congress responded with two laws that established a precedent for the future growth of the nation. Life of the Times Home Remedies There were few medical doctors in the thinly settled West Even if medical help had been available, recovery from sickness and disease in the early nineteenth century was often nwre a matter of chance than scientific treatment, h an age before germs and proper sanitation were understood, home remedies for illness became an everyday, and perhaps necessary, part of pioneer life. While some folk reme- dies, such as herbal teas, might have had positive effects, others aires could make the patient worse. Consider these examples. For ven- omous snakebite, a part of the reptile that inflicted the wound was placed on f^^ top of the incision. This, it was ^;^^ thought, would draw out the poi- son. Mumps were treated by rubbing the afflicted person's spine with garlic. One cure for measles was to make a warm broth of water and sheep dung. The patient sipped the broth until recovery. Indigestion was a common problem. A mixture of Cayenne pepper and alcohol applied to the stomach supposedly spelled relief Worms in children could be treated by boiling sage in milk, turning it to whey with vinegar or alum, then having the child drink it. If the worms did not harden in the stom- ach, the child would live. Some of the best cures were learned from the native Americans, who used native plants in pastes and teas. Determined not to repeat the problems in Kentucky and Tennessee — and also to raise money — Congress passed the Land Ordinance of 1785. This law provided a more orderly method tor settling public land north of the Ohio River. The land would be surveyed and divided into town- ships six miles square. Every township was to contain 36 sections of one square mile, 640 acres, each. The land would sell for $1 per acre. To attract land speculators, the law required that buyers take at least one whole section. Spectilators could divide their sections into smaller rectan- gular tracts and sell them to settlers at a proili. The ordinance also provided the first federal subsidy to education.

To provide for \"strong toned govern- ment,\" Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The region bounded by the Ohio River, the Great Lakes, and the Mississippi River was to be divided into not fewer than three territories nor more than five. Whenever 5,000 adult male citi- zens settled in a territory, they could set up a territorial government modeled on a British royal colony. The settlers would elect a territorial legislature. The national government appointed and paid judges and a territorial governor so that the territorial legislature could not control them. Although Congress was trying to govern its western territories as tightly as Great Britain had tried to control the colonies, the Northwest Ordinance provided a democratic model for national expan- sion that has been followed ever since. When the population of a territory reached 60,000, its people could orga- nize a new state and apply for admission to the Union as the equal of the other states. Never before had a nation promised political equality to its colonies or set up a procedure to carry out such a promise. The Northwest Ordinance also extend- ed into the territories personal rights guar- anteed in the constitutions of the original 13 states, such as freedom of religion, speech, and assembly.

Disputes Among the States While the Confederation Congress was providing for stability in the West, the eastern part of the nation was moving closer to crisis as the states engaged in dis- putes with one another. There were even struggles between groups within some states. These difficulties resulted from suspicion and rivalry, from the postwar depression — or economic slowdown — , and from the weak central government. Serious conflicts erupted over territory as states engaged in boundary disputes. For example, parts of present-day Ver- mont were claimed by New York, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. A conflict between Connecticut and Pennsylvania .ilmost resulted in war. In the spring of 1784, Connecticut settlers living in the disputed territory were attacked and driv- en out by the Pennsylvania militia. Because C>ongress was powerless to reg- ulate commerce, each state passed laws taxing goods lrt)ni its neighbors. New York taxed firewood from Connecticut and cabbage from New Jersey. New Jersey retaliated by charging New York for a har- bor lighthouse on the New Jersey side ot the Hudson River. Virginia taxed Pennsyl- vania farmers who shipped wheat through the state to North Carolinian customers.

Because the value of these paper notes differed from state to state, they often were not accepted as payment outside the states issuing them. This situation pre- sented yet another obstacle to trade. In Massachusetts the economic situa- tion became explosive. Unable to pay their debts, farmers in western Mas- sachusetts were jailed or had their proper- ty seized by the courts. Having recently fought the British, these farmers felt the new government was just another variety of tyranny. In September 1786, led by former Continental Army captain Daniel Shays, they closed the courts in 2 Massa- chusetts counties and stopped land confis- cations. In early 1787, wearing his faded blue Continental Army uniform, Shays led 1,000 men against the Springfield arsenal to get more guns. Only through donations from wealthy merchants was the state able to raise a militia force strong enough to meet Shays at Springfield. Although his rag-tag band was easily defeated by the militia, Shays's Rebellion caused great alarm throughout the United States, and people who believed in orderly government were fearful. Most of the nation's leaders shared the horror of George Washington, who shared his con- cern in a letter to his friend Henry Lee: 9SK «g»MI Kb Section Two Review Let us have a government by which our lives, liberties, and properties will be secured, or let us know the worst at once To be more exposed in the eyes of the world, and more contemptible than we already are, is hardly possible Let the reins of government then be braced and held with a steady hand. . . . In 1787, as the young nation began its sixth year under the Articles of Confeder- ation, it seemed that the prophecies of those who said the United States could not form an effective system of govern- ment were coming true. Summary The United States suffered a number of humiliating experiences under the Articles of Confederation that pointed to the need for a stronger central government. Britain refused to give up northern trading posts and would not negotiate a commercial treaty with its former colonies. Spain formed alliances with the Indians and refused to allow right of deposit at New Orleans. States quarreled with each other over commerce and boundaries.

One pro- posed solution was to strengthen them, and a meeting was called for that pur- pose. Out of that meeting came a new constitution. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain how each of the conflicts at the Philadelphia Convention was resolved. • Explain how the Constitution corrected the weaknesses of the Confederation government. After the war, George Washing- ton had retired to Mount Ver- non, his Virginia estate on the Potomac River. But concern about tlic nation's problems moved him to action once again. In 1785 he invited rep- resentatives of Virginia and Maryland to Mount Vernon to discuss their differences. At this meeting the two groups agreed on joint control of currencies, import duties, and navigation on the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay. This success inspired Maryland and Virginia to invite all states to meet at Annapolis, Maryland, to dis- cuss common problems. When the Annapolis Convention met in September 1786, delegates from only five states were present, so they could do little. Included in this group, however, was Alexander Hamilton of New York, an outspoken supporter of a strong national government. With Shays and his followers threatening the government of Mas- sachusetts, Hamilton persuaded the dele- gates to propose another convention. Its purpose would be to regulate commerce and to propose measures making the national government more effective. Congress responded by calling a meeting of the states in Philadelphia, \"for the sole and express purpose of revising the Arti- cles of Confederation.\" The Philadelphia Convention The date set for the Philadelphia Con- vention was May 14, 1787, but it was May 24 before enough delegates arrived to do business. Eventually 12 of the 13 states were represented, although some delegates did not arrive until midsummer. The 55 delegates included many of the most able political leaders in the United States. Most were lawyers or judges; 21 had college degrees, a high number in a time when few people had any formal education. Nearly all the delegates had practical experience in government. Most had helped write their state constitutions. More than half had sat in the Continental Congress or the Confederation Congress and so had seen the consequences of a weak central government. Several important leaders of the Revolu- tion were missing. Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Thomas Paine were in Europe. Massachusetts did not send Samuel Adams or John Hancock.

Jefferson acquired his life- long love of books on science, philosophy, and literature from his childhood teachers, and as a student at William and Mary College. Jefferson's effectiveness as a writer went way beyond his literary style. His writings reflected careful reading and study. Jefferson loved ideas — as well as book collecting. His enormous library later became the basis of the Library of Congress. As minister to France from 1785 to 1789, he shipped nearly 200 volumes to his good friend James Madison. These books — mostly works on political the- ory — had a profound impact on Madison's thinking about a new gov- ernment for the United States. convention sessions. Most others were less conscientious. Rarely were more than 30 in attendance at any one time. Despite a late start and poor attendance, the delegates worked hard. They were in session almost every day for sixteen weeks, usually both morning and afternoon. It was agreed that the meetings would be private, and members were forbidden to let the public know the content of the debates. Although this secrecy aroused public suspicion, it made compromise easier by shielding the delegates from out- side political pressures. James Madison, a 36-year-old Virginian, was the first delegate to arrive at the con- vention, and he was the most prepared. He came to Philadelphia with a draft of a com- pletely new framework of government. As soon as the convention was ready for busi- ness, Virginia governor Edmund Randolph immediately rose and presented Madison's proposal, known as the Virginia Plan. This document became the basis for discussion in the convention; it is the foundation for the Constitution of the United States. Conflicts and Compromises Although almost all delegates at the convention agreed that the Articles were hopelessly weak, there were two serious conflicts that proved difficult to resolve. Differences developed between large states and small states over representation in Congress, and between northern and southern states over economic issues and the institution of slavery. The dispute between large and small states nearly broke up the convention. The large states demanded that each state be represented by population in the bicameral Congress Madison had proposed. By what possible right, they asked, should Delaware's 59,000 inhabitants have equali- ty with Virginia's 692,000? The small states insisted that they would never give up the equal power they enjoyed under the Articles of Confederation to be swallowed up by the large states. William Paterson of New Jersey said his state would \"rather submit to a monarch, to a despot, than to 162 Unit 2 The Struggle for Independence: 1650-1789"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Examining Fine Art This portrait of James Madison was painted about ttie time of ttie Ptiiladelptiia Convention. Wfiat contribution did Madison mal<e to tfie Constitution? such a fate.\" He presented an alternative proposal, known as the New Jersey Plan, which would have merely strengthened the Articles of Confederation. Disagreement also arose over the struc- ture of the new government. Large-state delegates generally favored Madisons plan for a national government with separate executive, legislative, and judicial branch- es and with the states subordinate to the national government. Most small-state delegates supported the New Jersey Plan, which continued the Confederation and left the states supreme. For two weeks, bitter debate raged over these differences. There seemed no middle- ground between the large and the small states. Washington wrote a friend that he had lost all hope for the convention and regretted having anything to do with it. Franklin proposed that each session be opened with prayer, to ask divine guid- ance in finding an acceptable compromise. The deadlock was broken when the delegates took a day off to celebrate the Fourth of July. During the recess, a committee worked out whai became known as the \"Great C^onipromise.\" According to iliis agreement, state representation in the lower house of Congress would be based on population; in the upper house each state would have an equal vote. The delegates' ability to resolve this dispute increased their confi- dence in compromise as the key to a suc- cessful convention. For this reason, the Constitution that emerged from Philadel- phia has been called a \"bundle of compromises.\" Compromise can be found in nearly every section of the document. A dispute arose between the commercial interests of the North and the plantation interests of the South. Southerners wanted to count slaves to determine representation to Congress but not for direct taxation. The North wanted to count slaves for tax- ation but not for representation. A \"three- fifths compromise\" established that five slaves would be equal to three free persons for both representation and taxation. South Carolina and Georgia, afraid that a strong national government might act against slavery, insisted that the Constitu- tion forbid interference with the slave trade. The delegates agreed that for 20 years the national government would not prevent the importation of slaves nor charge an import duty of more than ten dollars a head. Another dispute between North and South concerned commerce. Northern merchants and shippers wanted a govern- ment with power to protect shipping from foreign competition.

Consequently, he believed that there were \"natural laws\" that governed human behavior, much like the laws that governed the physical universe. Madison was much impressed by an intri- cate working model of the solar system, an orrery (AWR uh ree), built in 1767 by Philadelphia Rittenhouse's Orrery astronomer David Rittenhouse. Ritten- house used this ingenious device to illus- trate the theories of Isaac Newton. Newton believed that the solar system was held in place by a balance between centrifugal force and the power of gravity. Just as the solar sys- tem was stabilized by equal but opposing forces, Madison rea- soned, so might a stable government result from a bal- ance of political powers. Thus Madi- son found in the theo- ries of Isaac Newton support for federalism — a strong national government balanced by the power of the states. semsiisK Making The Science Connection 1.

What other examples of bal- ances in power are there in national government today? immmmmwwi shipping their products abroad, insisted that a two-thirds vote in both houses ot Congress be required to pass such laws, a provision that would have given the South veto power over such legislation. South- erners also feared that the new government would raise money by placing duties on exports such as tobacco, creating an unfair tax burden on their section. Here too, a compromise was arranged. Trade laws might be passed by a simple majority in Congress, but the national government was forbidden to tax exports. These compromises allowed the dele- gates to complete their two essential tasks: to give the national government more power and to provide a framework for a workable government. The delegates granted to the central government the powers it had needed most under the Articles of Confederation. The new gov- ernment could levy and collect taxes, provided such taxes were \"uniform throughout the United States.\" Thus it would be able to pay its own way rather than begging from the states. It could reg- ulate commerce with foreign nations and between the states. Thus it could write and enforce commercial treaties that would increase foreign trade, and it could keep trade among the states free of barri- ers. It could coin money and regulate its value, so there could be a national stan- dard of money instead of state currencies with differing values. Many of the other powers granted the central government were not new but were simply carried over from the Articles of Confederation. For example, the Arti- cles had granted power to Congress to raise armies and navies and borrow money. But because the Confederation Congress could not raise money by taxa- tion, such powers existed only on paper. The new national government could carry out all the powers given to it. 164 Unit 2 The Struggle for Independence: 1650-1789"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Although the greatest disptites at the convention were over the structure and powers ot the legislative branch, the dele- gates also disagreed about the executive branch. Everyone at the convention agreed on the need for an executive branch to operate the government, but some delegates favored a group executive, so that no one individual could become too powerlul. However, the executive committees of the Confederation Congress had not worked out well, and Hamilton's proposal for a single executive chosen by Congress for life was not acceptable either. It smacked too much ot monarchy. In the final weeks of the con- vention two more compromises were achieved. A single executive would serve a four-year term. This person would not be chosen directly by the people, but by spe- cial electors named by the legislature of each state. As the long hot summer drew to a close, the exhausted delegates merely roughed out the framework ot the judicial branch. In so doing, they created only a Supreme Court and empowered the new govern- ment to create \"such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\" Their work concluded, the delegates reviewed their efforts. No one was com- pletely happy with the final plan, but most agreed it was a vast improvement on the Articles they hoped it would replace.

If the nation were to continue, a union would have to be forged based on shared powers bet- ween the states and the central govern- ment. Although there was disagreement over representation in Congress, how slaves were to be counted, methods of taxation, and the nature of the chief executive, the Framers overcame their differences and worked out compromises that resulted in the Constitution.

The Constitution Opposed The Framers of the Constitution antici- pated that ratification would be difficult. Rhode Island, which had boycotted the convention, certainly would not approve. So it seemed foolish to insist on the unan- imous approval required to amend the Articles. Instead, the Constitution provid- ed that \"the ratification of nine States shall be sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution. \" To get even nine states to ratify the Con- stitution was no small task. Some states objected to surrendering their power and independence to the national government. Mercy Otis Warren, an influential political writer, observed: Not one legislature in the United States had any idea when they sent delegates to the convention at Philadelphia that it would destroy their state governments and offer them a consolidated system instead. On September 17, 1787, after four months of exhausting effort, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention gathered one last time to sign their work. Of the 55 who had come to Philadelphia that spring, 42 were still on hand, and all but three agreed to sign the document. Then the delegates adjourned to a nearby Nor were supporters of states' rights pleased that the new Constitution bypassed state governments in the ratification process. Ratification was to be decided by special conventions to be called in each state, a process implement- ing the idea expressed in the Declaration of Independence that governments \"derive their just powers from the con- sent of the governed.\" 166 Unit 2 The Struggle for Independence: 1650-1789"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Even among the \"governed,\" however, opposition was strong. Debtors and paper-money advocates were opposed to any plan forcing full payment of debts and restoring sound currency. There was certainly suspicion of a powerful central government. Why revolt from Great Britain, people asked, simply to fall under a new kind of tyranny? Popular leaders, such as John Hancock and Samuel Adams in Massachusetts, opposed it. In Virginia, Patrick Henry warned: This proposal oj altering our federal government is of a most alarming nature you ought to be extremely cautious, watchful, jealous of your liberty; for instead of securing your rights, you may lose them forever. . . a wrong step made now will plunge us into misery, and our republic will be lost. Those who favored the new plan of government called themselves \"Federal- ists.\" They took this name to emphasize that the Constitution was based on the principle of federalism, a system in which power is divided between a central gov- ernment and regional governments, and to remind Americans that the states would retain many of their powers. Of course, those who opposed the Constitution were \"federalists\" too, because the league of states created by the Articles also was based on federalism. The real issue was whether the national government or the state governments would be supreme. By taking the name \"Federalists,\" however, the supporters of the Constitution caused their opponents to be tagged with the negative-sounding label \"Anti-Federalists.\" The Ratification Campaign Although the two sides were almost equally divided, several factors work- ed against the Anti-Federalists. Their campaign was a negative one. They attacked almost everything about the Constitution, complaining that the cen- tral government had too much power, that there was no mention of God in the document, and that it failed to protect basic liberties such as freedom of speech and religion. But the Anti-Federalists had nothing to offer other than to con- tinue with the hapless Articles of Con- federation or to call a new constitutional convention. The Federalists, on the other hand, pre- sented a definite program to meet the dif- ficulties facing the nation. They promised that if the Constitution were ratified, amendments, or additions and changes, would be made to provide a Bill of Rights to protect the people. The Federalists also made better use of communications. They were supported by most of the nation's newspapers. They presented their case more convincingly in sermons, pamphlets, and debates in state conventions. The Federalists\" campaign for ratifica- tion produced one of the finest pieces of political writing in the history of the world. The Federalist — a collection of 85 essays written by Hamilton, Madison, and John Jay. Originally published as newspa- per articles in the New York Journal, the essays explained in detail the importance of the Constitution to the success of the nation. The Federalists succeeded in getting the Constitution ratified not merely because they were good writers and speakers, but also because the were politically shrewd.

The committee members had heard Richard Henry Lees original proposal of a confed- eration. No doubt, while they were listening to Lee, delegates dashed down notes about the plan and their opinions about it. Explanation Experts agree that one of the best ways to remember something is to write it down. Taking notes — writ- ing down information in an orderly and brief form — not only helps you remember but it also makes your studying easier. There are several styles of notetaking, but all clarify and put information in a logical order. When taking notes in class or as you are reading your text, it will help to keep in mind these guidelines: • Identify the subject, and write it at the top of the page. In your text, for example, look for chap- ter or section headings. • Be selective in what information you include in your notes. For example, anything your teacher writes on the chalkboard or shows you from a transparency should be included. If your teacher emphasizes a point or spends a considerable amount of time on a given topic, this is also a clue to its importance. Similarly, if your textbook covers a single topic over several pages, take notes by seek- ing the topic sentences of para- graphs on the topic. Be certain to write down all words in bold type in your text. Your major goal is to listen or read carefully, paying attention to the main ideas or key points. That way you won't be furiously writing down every word your JzLXample becomes \"dvlp\". Use symbols, arrows, or rough drawings: \"+\" for \"and. \" Practice your shorthand in all of your classes. Make sure your notes are legible and neat so that you will be able to understand them when you read them again.

But later, as you study the driving laws in your state, you read that driving across double lines is a traffic violation. Which source should you believe — your drivers' education teacher or the book of traffic laws? The laws themselves are a primary source. Your teacher, who must read the laws and then interprets them to the class, is a secondary source. Usually, a primary source is more reliable than a secondary .source but not always. In this case, however, you should believe the book of traffic laws and not your teacher. In written material a pr'niiary souycc is the original source of information, usually an original document or first-person account. Laws, contracts, diaries, auto- biographies, and scripts are examples ot primary sources. A secondary source is a secondhand account by someone who is retelling, interpreting, or summa- rizing the information provided in the primarv source. Textbooks, brochures, lectures, nonfiction by historians, or anv accounts that give information thai was originally from another source are secondary sources. Based on the definitions given above, you can deter- mine whether any source of information that you consult is a primary source or a secondary source. The following tests will help you analyze either a primary source or a secondary source in order to determine its dependability, and to assess the accuracy of the infor- mation that it provides. • If the material comes from a secondary source, determine if the author is qualified to interpret the primary source from which original information is drawn. • For either a primary source or a secondary source, decide if the account has been influenced by emo- tion, opinion, exaggeration, or for some special pur- pose. Even authors of original sources can have reasons to distort the truth to suit their personal purposes. • Look for good documentation of the primary or sec- ondary source, that is, evidence or other informa- tion that supports the account given. • Try to consult more than one primary or secondary source. If they agree, the account is more likely to be accurate. • If possible, compare the information in a secondary source to the primary source on which the account is based. Example The following examples demonstrate how these tests can be applied to analyzing primary and secondary sources: 1. You watch a TV documentary movie about Admiral Robert E. Peary's expedition to the North Pole. Later you read excerpts from his diary that seem to disagree with the information provided by the movie. (The diary, a primary source, usually would be the more reliable source. ) 2. Your uncle insists that the limit on walleyes is seven in your state, but a game warden who spoke to your class, and a brochure the warden handed out, say the limit is six fish. (Although all sources are sec- ondary, the warden and the brochure are more reliable sources. Also two accounts say the limit is si.xjish, while oidy one source says the limit is seven fish.)

The path was marked by a revolu- tion in which the colonists demonstrated to the world their belief in independence, individual rights, and democracy. These cherished values formed the basis for their Constitution, which would serve as the law of the land. Chapter 4 The Road to Revolution The road from colonies to nation was a gradual one that began with Parliament's attempt to control the colonies' foreign trade. The first efforts toward this goal were a series of laws, beginning in 1651, known as Trade and Navigation Acts. This legislation was intended to ultimate- ly kill colonial competition. Most of these laws, however, were not enforced — in part because of the distance that separated Britain from the colonies and in part because the appointed revenue officers were lax in their duties. Parliament's concern about colonial trade was part of a larger issue, the strug- gle between Britain and France over con- trol of North America. In the final round, the French and Indian War, Britain emerged victorious after William Pitt became minister of war in 1758. With the Treaty of Paris in 1763, France was elimi- nated as a contender for power in North America. Britain's victory brought it a host ol new problems, among them a huge war debt and a question of how to administer their newly acquired territory. To solve the former problem. Parliament levied new taxes that shifted part of the financial burden onto the colonies. To solve the lat- ter problem. Parliament passed the Pro- clamation of 1763, which forbid all settlement west of the Appalachians. The colonist's protested through petitions and representatives in London. They telt their rights as subjects of the Crown had been violated. As tensions grew, so did the means of protest. After the 1765 Stamp Act, the colonists staged boycotts, and sometimes became violent. In their chal- lenge to British authority, the colonies dis- covered a sense of unity and patriotism and began to act together. As time progressed the breach between Britain and the colonies gradually widened. Then, in 1773, colonists reacted to a monopoly granted to the British East India Tea company by throwing thou- sands of pounds of tea into the Boston Harbor. Parliament responded with the Coercive Acts, which the colonists dub- bed the \"Intolerable Acts.\" King George III refused to compromise, arguing that the colonies must \"submit or triumph.\" The colonists responded by calling the First Continental Congress and organizing volunteer armies. Soon fight- ing broke out between Massachusetts \"minutemen\" and British troops near Boston at Concord. News of the battle spread quickly and electrified the colonies. Although it would be another year before the colonies formally declared their inde- pendence, the American Revolution had begun. Chapter 5 War for Independence Most colonists were not ready for inde- pendence. They wanted to remain part of the British empire as long as they could govern themselves through their own legislatures. The British government, though, was inflexible and wanted to pun- ish the rebels. The move toward independence go: a boost from Thomas Paine, a political philosopher who in January 1776 pub- lished the persuasive and widely read pamphlet. Common Seme. In it, Paine argued against monarchy in general, for separation from Britain, and appealed to the American belief that they were a select people. 172 Unit 2 The Struggle for Independence 1650-1789"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The Patriots, supporters of separation, began to prevail. Beginning with delegates from North Carolina in April 1776, the colonies advised their delegates in Congress to vote for independence. The Declaration of Independence, drafted by Thomas Jefferson, formally notified the world on July 4 that the colonies were indeed independent. Announcing their independence was not as challenging as maintaining it. Britain, unwilling to surrender its large territory in North America, dispatched perhaps the largest single military force ever sent from Europe to America. The success of these troops and short-term enlistments reduced George Washington's ill-prepared forces. Two early victories at Trenton and Princeton helped save the American cause. The Americans faced a long struggle with a volunteer army and insufficient funds to pay for the war. The struggle was eased when France allied itself with the American cause following a major victory over British forces at Saratoga. Soon Spain and the Netherlands also entered the war against Britain. Women courageously served the Ameri- can war effort, acting as secret agents, rais- ing money, and running farms and businesses while their husbands were away. A few women even fought in the ranks. African Americans and native Americans also served in the Revolution- ary War; the former were more likely to support the Patriot army, and the latter, the British. The fighting gradually moved from north to south. For three years, beginning in 1778, the main British forces did not suffer a defeat in the South. Then in 1780, British General Cornwallis surren- dered at Yorktown, Virginia, marking the last significant battle of the war. The colonies were, at last, independent. Chapter 6 A More Perfect Union With independence, the colonies need- ed new constitutions to replace colonial charters. Most adopted a bicameral legis- lature and restricted the executive branch. The right to vote, however, was restricted to white males who owned property. Some of the new states also began to ques- tion the institution of slavery. Other changes included an increase in religious freedom. While the states were writing new con- stitutions. Congress developed a plan to unite them. Known as the Articles of Confederation, this document placed gov- erning authority in Congress in which each state had one vote. It also curtailed the executive branch, which was a com- mittee of delegates. Under the Articles, the national govern- ment was weak. Domestically, the govern- ment was unable to collect taxes, enforce the laws, or interpret them. It also faced difficulties dealing with settling the West, although the Congress passed two impor- tant documents — the Land Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. In addition, there were disputes between the states over boundaries, com- merce, and currency, all of which the Congress was powerless to solve. Interna- tionally, the new nation experienced diffi- culties with Britain, Spain, France, and Barbary States. As a result, trade declined. Because of these problems, it became apparent that the Articles were inadequate and that a new framework for government was needed. A convention was called, which met in Philadelphia over the sum- mer of 1787, to resolve these problems. For a time differences between large states and small states over representation in Congress, and between northern and southern states over economic issues, including slavery, threatened to break up the deliberations. Ultimately, a series of compromises was reached that created a powerful two-house Congress, a strong chief execiuive, and a national judiciary. Most delegates believed that the new plan — the Constitution — was a vast improvement over the Articles. Ratification of the C'onstitution was dif- ficult, however, primarily because some states were cautious about surrendering their power, finally, though, supporters ol the Constitution, the Federalists, emerged victorious. The new government was set to be launched in 1789. Synthesizing Unit Themes Relating Ideas 1. How did the new state constitutions strive fot democratic ideals? Identifying Trends 2.

In the city they found lodging in private homes and boarding houses to await the arrival of a quorum to do business. The representatives waited a full month before the House, with 30 members, was ready to convene; the Senate did not have a sufficient number to begin until April 6. Some members of Congress worried that the new government would lose credibility, or at least respect, if they did not organize soon. On April 1 the House of Representatives opened its first session at New York's old City Hall in lower Manhattan, remodeled and renamed Federal Hall. It met downstairs and was open to the public. The Senate convened April 6, on the second floor where noisy spectators would not disturb deliberations. The House elected its first speaker, Frederick Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania, and began to establish rules and procedures. The Senate chose a temporary president until the electoral vote count for President and Vice President could be counted, because the Constitution named the Vice President as permanent president of that body. When the Senate announced that it was ready, House members climbed the stairs for the first Joint Session of Congress. The first task was counting the Electoral College votes and declaring George Washington President.

It has served as the \"supreme law ot the land\" for more than 200 years, making it the oldest writ- ten constitution in the world. Institutions that we take for granted — the Congress, the President, the Supreme Court — were created by the Constitution. Major gov- ernmental decisions that are made every day depend upon constitutional authority. Yet, many Americans, whose rights are protected by the Constitution, know little of its structure or development. Examining Photographs Tourists gather in ttie rotunda of the Capitol to view art depict- ing the history of the United States. How has United States history been affected by the Constitution? National Powers Before 1789 some compared America to a barrel without a hoop — in desperate need of something to hold it together. Sharing , this sentiment, the authors of the Consti- tution created a strong central government. Article I, Section 8, which has been called the \"heart of the Constitution,\" gave the new Congress various powers not possessed by the Confederation Congress, including the critical ones of levying taxes and regu- lating interstate commerce. The power to levy taxes enabled Congress to finance the federal govern- ment. It was briefly challenged by a rebel- lion in western Pennsylvania against a tax on whiskey, but Washington used the army to enforce the law. When the Congress decided to levy an income tax, objections that it was unconstitutional led to the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913. The power that the Constitution gave Congress over interstate commerce and the \"elastic clause\" both strengthened the national government at the expense of state power. The interstate commerce power grew alongside the development of a national economy beginning in the 1800s. Through its authority over inter- state commerce. Congress has been able to enact laws ranging from prohibitions against racial discrimination to regulations on consumer credit transactions. The \"elastic clause\" that appears in Article I, Section 8, says that Congress shall make all laws \"necessary and proper\" for putting into effect its enumerated powers. Determining what laws are neces- sary and proper has provided an arena for ongoing debate over the years, beginning with the debate over the National Bank in 1790. Those who wish to restrain the power of the central government empha- size the word \"necessary.\" These strict constructionists interpret the Constitu- tion as narrowly as possible. Those loose constructionists who wish to expand the central government emphasize the word \"proper.\" They interpret the Constitution more broadly, to ;illow the government to exercise both the powers explicitly listed in Article I, Section 8, and the \"implied\" powers of that provision. 178 Constitutional Handbook"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Examining Photographs The Idea of representative democracy works well when the legislature Is responsive to the will of the people. Congress- man John Conyers lis- tens to the opinions of some of his l\\/llchlgan constituents in his Washington office. Which chamber was not originally elected by the people? House and Senate The first senators and representatives to Congress were educated and politically experienced. Of the original 88 members of Congress, 54 had already served the national government; 20 had helped write the Constitution in Philadelphia. Although Article I imposes some requirements for election to Congress, such as a minimum age of 25 for the House, most members of Congress have historically been over 40 years of age and have been above average in wealth and education. The Senate was originally intended to resemble the British House ot Lords in its separation from popular control. Its mem- bers were given a longer term of office, and it was looked upon as the quieter, more deliberate chamber. Originally, Sen- ators were chosen by state legislatures, but the Seventeenth Amendment, adopted in 1913, opened their election to popular vote. Originally each state determined how it would elect its House members. But in 1842 Congress passed a law requiring each state to divide into districts for the purpos- es of House elections. The districts, having nearly equal populations, would assure that people were equally represented. Many states ignored this rule, however, as political parties sought advantages for their own candidates. District boundaries were drawn in such a way as to assure the election of the controlling party's candi- dates. In Wesberry v. Sanders in 1964, the Supreme Court ruled that large differ- ences in population among Georgia's dis- tricts failed to meet constitutional guidelines for fair representation. Since 1970 new districts formed in every state are of nearly equal population. Legislative Powers The Constitution not only established different qualifications and terms for the Senate and House, it provided different legislative powers for each chamber. The Senate approves treaties and presidential appointments and tries all impeach- ments, or cases in which a government official has been formally accused of wrongdoing in office; the House origi- nates all revenue bills, and has the power to impeach members of the executive and judicial branches. Legislation must pass both Houses before it can be sent to the President to be signed into law. Many of the enumerated powers that the Constitution gives Congress leave lit- de room for interpretation. When the Constitution says that Congress has authority to provide punishment for counterfeiting, it is quite clear. There have been, however, lengthy national debates over other powers. Congress may autho- rize the sale of savings bonds as a means of borrowing money, but in the 1980s, when the nation's debt from borrowing seemed out of control, some government leaders sought a remedy in a constitutional amendment. Such an amendment is unlikely, as members of Congress are not inclined to vote for an amendment that would, in effect, restrict their control of the national budget. 180 Constitutional Handbook"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Another area where the division between the powers of Congress and the President is unclear is in control of the military. The Constitution gives Congress power to declare war and to raise and sup- port armies. It makes the President, how- ever. Commander in Chief of these forces. How far can the President go in using the army without an official declaration of war? The War Powers Act of 1973 attempted to clarify this issue, but the question arose again in 1990 when Presi- dent Bush sent American troops to Saudi Arabia in response to Iraq's invasion of nearby Kuwait. Separation of Powers When the constitutional authority of Congress seems to conflict with the authority of the President, it is often because of a deliberate effort by the Con- stitutional Convention to limit the power of government. The Framers of the Con- stitution, fearing unrestricted power in the hands of government, chose to divide government powers among three separate branches. This separation of powers is one of the most distinctive features of the Constitution. The federal government is separated into legislative, executive, and judicial branches. These branches, described in the first three articles of the Constitu- tion, are each given separate authority. Article I ensures this separation by pro- viding that no member of Congress may serve simultaneously in the executive or judicial branch. Under this separation of powers, each branch exercises a check on the powers of the other two because each branch's pow- ers counterbalance the others. Consider the power to enact legislation. The law- making authority of Congress is checked by the President's power to veto laws that Examining Charts The balance of powers and the system of checks and balances are fun- damental principles found throughout the Constitution.

What might happen if a budget bill is not passed? Congress has passed (Article I, Section 7). Tile President's power to veto is checked, in turn, by Congress's power to override a veto by a two-thirds vote (Article I, Sec- tion 7). Congress's power to pass laws, whether with the Presidents approval or over a veto, is also checked by the Supreme Court's power to declare laws unconstitutional. The Supreme Court's power to declare legislation unconstitutional is checked, in turn, both by Congress's power to determine the types of cases the Court has authority to hear, or the Court's jurisdiction, (Article III, Section 2), and by the President's power to appoint jus- tices, or members, of the high court (Article II, Section 2). Finally, the Presidents power to appoint Supreme Court justices is checked by the requirement that all appointments have the consent of the majority ot the Senate (Article II, Section 2). These and many other checks and bal- ances in the Constitution maintain a care- ful balance among the three branches. This protection, however, has a price. If two branches ol government disagree, decisive action may be difficult, even impossible. Thus, if the President and Congress cannot agree on a federal bud- get, the entire federal government may be forced to shut down — as almost hap- pened as recently as 1990. Process of Lawmaking The Constitution describes the duties of the three branches, but it does not detail how those duties are to be carried out. To handle the heav)' volume of legislation efficiently, both houses of Congress from the very beginning divided into commit- tees. These smaller units do most ol the work of both houses. Each committee deals with particular problems, such as labor, banking, agriculture, foreign affairs, and armed services. Each has a full-time staff of experts to assist it with its work, and committees often hold hearings to get the views of the public. Some committees, because of their assigned duties, are more prestigious than others. The House Appropriations Com- mittee, for example, is especially promi- nent because of its key role in shaping the national budget. Some committees are permanent, or standing committees, while others are temporan,', formed to deal with a specific issue. Legislation begins with written propos- als called bills. Any member of Congress may introduce a bill on any subject. Long before going to the full membership of each house for a vote, however, the bill must pass through the committee (or sub- committee) with responsibility for the 182 Constitutional Handbook"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Examining Photographs Although some of the work of the legislature is done on the floor of Congress, most of it is done outside the chambers by committees.

Why does Congress need elaborate administrative support and rules? subject in question. The two main politi- cal patties in the United States are both tepresented on virtually all congressional committees but one party — and this could be one party in the Senate and a different one in the House — will always have a majority, and hence voting control, on each committee. Because all bills must pass through a committee, the committee's chair who has substantial control over the commit- tee's daily schedule, has immense power to expedite or prevent passage of a given bill. The chair is usually the member oi the majority party with the most seniori- ty, that is, the one who has served on the committee for the longest time. The Constitinion provided hir a delib- erate and sometimes slow method of passing legislation by establishing two legislative houses. One factor that may slow down passage of a bill is the require- ment that the legislation passed by both houses be exactly the same. At times a bill passed by one house is altered slightly by the other. In these instances Congress may turn to a conference committee. This committee composed of members of both houses, usually drafts a compromise proposal that the House and Senate can vote for or against. In a recent term, over 11,000 separate bills were presented to Congress. While only 534 of these were passed into law, it is easy to see why Congress has needed an elaborate set of administrative rules to handle its work- load. Fortunately, the Framers, who could not foresee the increasing workload of Congress, allowed the Congress to develop its own rules for procedure. Linking Across Time The War Power The issue of whether the Presi- dent can legally send troops into combat without a declaration of war by Congress is still unsettled. When President Bush sent American troops to Saudi Arabia in 1990, his defense secretary told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the President, as Commander in Chief has that authority. The House Democratic Caucus, however, said no. In a non- binding resolution, they said the Presi- dent must have congressional approval for offen- sive action in the Persian Gulf The legal dilemma was sidestepped when Congress approved action against Iraq earlvin 1991. CoNS'iirt niciNAi Hanoikiok 183"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"The Presidency The presidency may seem common- place today, but the Framers of the Con- stitution engaged in lengthy debates over almost every aspect of the office. The method of election, the length of a presi- dential term, and the powers of the office caused such controversy that the conven- tion finally turned to a committee consist- ing ot one delegate from each state to prepare a final proposal. Most of this committee's proposals were written into the Constitution. Executive Powers The Constitution gives the President extensive powers. Four of the most important are: the command of the coun- try's military forces, the power to conduct foreign affairs, the power to appoint the cabinet and other executive officers, as well as all federal judges, and the legisla- tive veto power. Examining Photographs Presidents use the annual State of ttie Union Address to outline yearly goals. How many such addresses may a President give? There are, however, checks and balances on the President's power. Article I, Section 8, gives Congress the power \"To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces.\" As men- tioned earlier. Congress alone has the power to declare war. The President's power to conduct foreign affairs is limited by the requirement that all treaties have the approval of two-thirds of the Senate, and the power to appoint executive offi- cers and judges is subject to the approval of the majority of the Senate. Originally the Constitution allowed the President a term ot tour years with- out limiting the number of consecutive elections — a generous provision since many state governors in the 1780s could hold office for only one year and were not allowed to run for reelection. In addition, many governors had no veto power. Little wonder the Anti-Federalists made the presidency a principal point of attack during the battle over ratification. The presumption that George Washing- ton would be the first President served to calm many fears about the potential power of the office. Washington, as Presi- dent, exercised caution in nearly every decision that he made because, as he said, \"As the first of everything, in our situa- tion, will serve to establish a Precedent, it is devoutly wished on my part, that these precedents may be fixed on true princi- ples.\" As a result, the presidency from the beginning was a respected institution. Washington's refusal to serve more than two terms in office established a precedent that was not broken until Franklin Roo- sevelt won four elections beginning in 1932. In 1951 the Twenty-second Amendment officially limited Presidents to two terms. Expansion of Presidential Po'wers Virtually all the President's stated pow- ers have expanded since the Constitution first took effect. For example, the first 6 Presidents exercised the veto power only 10 times. But Andrew Jackson vetoed 12 bills, prompting critics to dub him \"King 184 Constitutional Handbook"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Connections History Ranking the Presidents Americans expect greatness trom every person they choose as President. History reveals, however, that not all Presidents are esteemed as equal. In 1948 historian Arthur M. Schlesinger asked 55 historians to rank the past Presidents by rating them as great, near great, average, below average, or fail- ures. They rated Lincoln, Washing- ton, F. D. Roo- sevelt, Wilson, and -' Jefferson as great. As near great were T. Roosevelt, Cleveland, J. Adams, and Polk. Grant and Harding were rated failures. AND Government Presidential seal Schlesinger's 1962 poll added two new Presidents — Truman as near great and Eisenhower as average. The other results were much the same as the first poll. In 1 98 1 Eisenhower moved from aver- age to near great, an indica- tion that historians' views of a President may change over time. Critics of presi- dential ratings point out that Presidents rated as great or near great have served at times of national crisis. When average citi- zens rate the Presi- dents, however, the residts are different. A recent Harris Poll ranked Kennedy first, followed by F. D. Roosevelt, and Reagan. nhKmmBiHmHUih Making the Government Connection 1. How did histori- ans' views of Eisen- hower change? 2.

How would you rate the last four Presidents? lyiiiifTiii Andrew the First.\" His successors have used the veto power even more frequently. Other presidential powers have also been magnified. Abraham Lincoln used his authority as commander-in-chief of the military to take the extraordinary step of issuing the Emancipation Proclama- tion, which freed the slaves in the states that rebelled against the Union. This kind of decision normally falls within the responsibilities of Congress. During the wars in Korea and Vietnam, Presidents stretched the commander-in- chief's power to even greater lengths by engaging American soldiers in combat without a declaration of war by Congress. A similar constitutional challenge was mounted against George Bush's transfer of troops to Saudi Arabia following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. So far the Supreme Court has declined to rule on such challenges, citing its policy of not getting involved in political disputes, only legal ones. The Constitution did not foresee the development of political parties, one source of additional presidential power. As head of one of the two major political parties, the President can exert pressure for legislation and can give or withhold support for a senator's or representative's reelection. In addition, as Grover Cleveland put it, \"The presidency is the people's office.\" That is, while members of Congress rep- resent particular states or districts within states, the President represents the whole coimtry. Every presidential action attracts nationwide attention by the press and electronic media. The personality and goals of those who hold the office affect the extent of its power. Andrew Jackson, Fhcodore Roo- sevelt, and Franklin D. Roosevelt used the force of personality to enhance their power. In contrast, because of his less assertive personality. President ('alvin Coolidge wielded less inHuence.

Within the first few days, however, news reporters began to complain of the military's censorship of information. They were reminded of an earlier time of censorship during the war in Viet- nam, when even Congress was unaware of certain vital information. The issue of the people's or their representatives' rights to informa- tion conflicts with the administra- tion's need to keep its war strategy secret. Examining Photographs Presidents sometimes visit troops who are engaged in war in order to lend encouragement. Most Presidents, tiowever leave war strategy to the military. Why is the President usually better informed about wars than Congress is? Times of crisis often present opportu- nities for enhancement of presidential power. Abraham Lincoln took great lib- erties with the Constitution during the Civil War. On his own authority he increased the size of the federal army — something Congress alone is permitted to do (Article I, Section 8, paragraph 12). He ordered payment of federal funds to private citizens for military pur- poses — which the Constitution autho- rizes only Congress to do (Article I, Section 9, paragraph 6). He even sus- pended the writ of habeas corpus, which protects against wrongful imprisonment, despite a Supreme Court ruling that Congress alone could take such action (Article I, Section 9, paragraph 2). Congress eventually took action to bring the President's powers back in line with peacetime norms. Presidential power increases during crises involving actual or perceived danger from abroad. It is affected by the tendency of Congress to yield much of its power to the President for the duration of the crisis. For several decades beginning in 1941, American Presidents governed a country at war: first the struggle against Germany and Japan, then the Cold War against the Soviet Union, then two \"police actions \" in Korea and Vietnam. The President, who has access to a vast military and foreign service network, can control information that Congress receives. This factor has contributed to the increase in presidential power over foreign affairs, especially in the twentieth century. In addition, Congress, working as a whole or through committees, is inherently less capable of exercising deci- sive action quickly. In domestic policy the Constitution clearly gives \"the power of the purse \" to Congress. Over time, the President has come to dominate many processes of rais- ing and spending the government's money. The creation of the Bureau of the Budget in 1921 (now called the Office of Management and Budget), whose director was appointed by the President, heralded the transfer of major budgetary power out of the hands of Congress. Since its creation by the Constitution, the office of the presidency has grown greatly. Its expanded power and its role, however, continue to be limited by consti- tutional checks and balances. 186 Constitutional Handbook"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The Courts The judiciary is only briefly described in the Constitution. Article III provides that there shall be \"one Supreme Court\" and such lower courts as Congress may establish. The Framers left the details to be worked out later.

The federal judiciary may be envisioned as a three-tiered pyramid, with many district courts at the bottom, a small- er number of circuit courts in the middle, and one Supreme Court at the top. The comparatively numerous district courts are spread around the country. Cases from a district court may be appealed, or taken for review (where one side believes the district judge has made an error) to the circuit court for the area in which the district court is located. There are 12 circuit courts around the country. The Supreme Court Cases may be appealed from the circuit courts to the Supreme Court, which cur- rently consists of nine members: eight associate justices and one Chief Justice. Because the cases that reach them are so complex and time-consuming, the justices must decline to rule upon all but a small fraction of the cases they are asked to hear. Thus, although someone who believes he or she has been wronged may vow to take the case \"all the way to the Supreme Examining Photographs In the front row. left to rigfit. are Associate Justices John Paul Stevens and Byron White, Chief Justice William Rehnquist. and Associate Justices Harry Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor In the second row are Justices David Souter Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas.

The principal purpose of the federal judiciary is to provide a forum for dis- putes involving federal laws. The Framers did not want the federal government to rely on state courts to enforce its laws. The most important power of the feder- al courts, that of judicial review, is not stated in the Constitution. This is the power of the Court to decide whether a given law, federal or state, conflicts with the Constitution. If the Court decides that it does, the law is declared unconsti- tutional, or invalid, and ceases to have John Marshall 1755-1835 The Supreme Courts rapid rise to equality with Congress and the presi- dency is due mainly to the influence of one man, John Marshall. The first born of 14 brothers and sis- ters, Marshall was raised on a family farm in Virginia. In the Revolutionar)' War, he spent the difficult winter at Valley Forge with George Washington. After a brief study of law, Marshall was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1780. He then served in the Virginia legislature until he was called by Presi- dent John Adams to join a mission to France. Marshall returned as one of the heroes of the XYZ Affair. Elected to the House of Representatives, he quickly became the leader of the mod- erate Federalists. In 1801, Adams appointed Marshall Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. For the next 34 years Marshall led the Court in land- mark decisions. effect. This amounts to a form of veto power over all laws. Judicial review has been a fundamental part of our government since 1 803, when it was first announced by Chief Justice John Marshall in the famous case of Mar- bury V. Madison. Marshall, who presided over the Supreme Court for 34 years, ruled in this case that part of the Judiciary Act of 1789 conflicted with the Constitution and was therefore invalid. This was bold indeed, in a young nation where no one had ever nullified an act of Congress. The Constitution is a law, Marshall courageous- ly declared, and it is the job of the courts \"to say what the law is.\" This assumed power of the Court remains unchallenged. The power of judicial review does not necessarily mean the Supreme Court always has the last say. If the Supreme Court rules a law unconstitutional, the Congress or the states may initiate an amendment to the Constitution. This, in fact, happened when the Sixteenth Amendment provided for an income tax. There are additional limits on the Supreme Court's power. First, the Court cannot rule on just any law, but only on those that come before it. In this sense its role is passive; it cannot take the initiative to correct problems that the justices see or hear about, but must wait for others to file lawsuits charging that an injustice has been done. Second, lacking any army or police force, the Court must rely on the President to enforce its rulings. During Andrew Jackson's administration, a dispute arose over Georgia's attempt to evict the Cherokees from its borders. When the Supreme Court, under Chief Justice John Marshall, voted to uphold the rights of the Cherokees, Jackson, a veteran Indian fighter, reportedly declared, \"John Marshall has made his decision. Now let him enforce it.\" Such a refusal, or threat- ened refusal, by a President to enforce a court decision has been used sparingly because of its obvious disregard for the constitutional powers of the federal courts. Another way to override a Supreme Court ruling is to limit federal courts' juris- diction. The Constitution gave Congress control over jurisdiction — another aspect of the system of checks and balances. Constitutional Handbook"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"In 1868 Congress used this power to limit the Supreme Courts authority. William McCardle, an antiblack publisher in Vicksburg, Tennessee, advocated violent opposition to Congress's Reconstruction laws. When the army arrested him, McCar- dle's lawyers sought his release on a writ of habeas corpus. Congress, fearing that the Supreme Court would side with McCardle and thus damage its reconstruction efforts, passed a law withdrawing jurisdiction from the Supreme Court in all habeas corpus cases. Having no authority to rule, the Court dismissed McCardle's appeal. More recently, congressional opponents of the Supreme Court have proposed sev- eral bills that would withdraw the Court's jurisdiction over such cases as those involving school prayer, busing, abortion, and gender discrimination. It, however. Congress could remove jurisdiction in any or all cases that it chose, it could effective- ly block any provision of the Constitution from being enforced. Such action is not likely because it would disregard the sepa- ration of powers, a basic principle of the United States constitutional government. Federal Judiciary Unlike Congress and the President, fed- eral judges do not have to face the people at election time. The Constitution pro- vides that they shall hold office \"during good behavior\" — which generally means for life or until they choose to resign — and that their salaries may not be reduced. The Framers wanted to insulate federal judges from political pressures so they could rule fairly and wisely, without fear that popular hostility could cost them their jobs or salaries. Indeed, one of the main functions of any court is to stand against the popular tide, such as by pro- tecting unpopular individuals against \"the tyranny of the majority.\" A federal judge can be removed through the difficult process of impeachment by Congress (the same process as that required to remove a President). Ihis is .mother aspect of the system of checks and balances. The fact that very few federal judges have faced impeachment is evi- dence of the care taken in selecting them. The Constitution Today When the Constitution reached its bicentennial year in 1989, it inspired a fresh interest in the meaning and signifi- cance of the document. Two broadly dif- ferent views emerged. Some people saw the limitations and problems that the fed- eral government faced and suggested a new constitutional convention to restruc- ture the government to meet today's diffi- cult challenges. Others emphasized the remarkable enduring quality of the Con- stitution and its basic principles that remain important today. It is likely that if changes are to be made in basic principles of government, they will come by amendment or interpreta- tion. Amendment, however, has histori- cally been approached with caution. The Founders wanted the Constitution to be safe from the unruly passions of the pub- lic and schemes of the politicians. When the Supreme Court ruled that the burning of the United States flag was a form of free expression protected by the First Amendment, President George Bush sought an amendment outlawing the des- ecration of the flag. Many viewed this idea as the kind of manipulation that the Framers wanted to prevent when they provided for the amending process. One amendment, the Fourteenth, has provided a broad basis for interpretation by the courts. Originally written to make former slaves citizens, the amendment set forth the \"equal protection\" and \"due pro- cess\" clauses. It is striking that two short rules — that everyone shall receive the equal protection of the laws, and that no one may be deprived of life, libert)', or property without due process of law — could accomplish so much, as well as gen- erate so much controversy. The original intent of the Fourteenth Amendment was obstructed for many years. In 1883 the Supreme Court in the CoNsrnuTioNAL 1 Iandhook KS')"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Examining Photographs When a suspect is arrested, police read a list of rights to the accused. What court case set these guidelines? Civil Rights Cases rejected the Fourteenth Amendment as a basis for protecting indi- vidual rights, ruling that the equal protec- tion clause applies only to the states, not to \"private action.\" In 1896 the Court decided in Plessy v. Ferguson that \"separate but equal\" public facilities for blacks and whites were constitutional, denying the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, in 1954 the Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education ofTopeka that separate educational facilities were not equal. Since then the Supreme Court has often used the due process and equal pro- tection clauses in decisions to support basic individual rights. In a landmark ruling in 1965, the Supreme Court held that \"due process,\" in conjunction with the personal protec- tions of the Bill of Rights, implies a right of privacy. Then, in Roe v. Wade (1973), the Court ruled that the right of privacy includes abortion within limits. Since the 1960s the Court has incorporated most ot the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment. The due process and equal protection clauses have been the basis ol decisions regarding racial discrimination and many personal freedoms. Court decisions constantly define con- stitutional amendments. In 1966, in Miranda v. Arizona, the Supreme Court set strict guidelines tor police question- ing — a decision that further defined the Fifth Amendment protection against self- incrimination. Court interpretations limit the need for continual constitutional amendment. The last change in the Constitution was adopted in 1992 — the Twenty-seventh Amendment, concerning congressional pay raises. The Constitution's adaptability to new circumstances has made it a lasting framework of government. It has permit- ted, perhaps even encouraged, debate over the proper role of each branch of government, or of government itself Through the first two centuries of federal government, the Constitution has served to moderate change in government.

The Legislative Branch Section 1. Congress The power to make laws is given to a Congress made up of two chambers to represent different interests: the Senate to represent the states; the flouse to be more responsive to the people's will. Section 2. House of Representatives 1. Election and Term of Office \"Electors\" means voters. Every two years the vot- ers choose new Congress members to serve in the House of Representatives. The Constitution states that each state may specify who can vote. But the 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th Amendments have established guidelines that all states must follow regarding the right to vote. 2. Qualifications Representatives must be twenry-five years old, citizens of the United States for seven years, and residents of the state they represent. 3. Division of Representatives among the States The number of representatives from each state is based on the size of the state's population. Each state is divided into congressional districts, with each district required to be equal in population. Each state is entitled to at least one representative. The number of representatives in the House was set at 435 in 1929. Since then, there has been a reapportionment of seats based on population shifts rather than on addition of seats. Only three-fifths of a state's slave population was to be counted in determining the number of repre- sentatives elected by the state. Native Americans were not counted at all. The \"enumeration\" referred to is the census, the population count taken every ten years since 1790. 4. Vacancies Vacancies in the House are filled through special elections called by the state's governor. 5. Officers The Speaker is the leader of the majority parry in the House and is responsible tor choosing the heads of various House committees. \"Impeachment\" means indictment, or bringing charges against an official. Preamble We, the people of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to our- selves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Con- stitution for the United States of America. Article I Section 1 All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Sen- ate and House of Representatives. Section 2 1. The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature. 2. No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenry-five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen. 3. Representatives and direct Taxes shall be appor- tioned among the several states which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Num- bers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persona, including those bound to Scr vice for a Term of Years, and excluding Indiana not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term often Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each state shall have at Least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampahirc shall be entitled to chuse three; Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and Providence Planatations one. Con nccticut five. Now York six, ^Jew Jersey four, Pcnnsylva nia eight. Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten. North Carolina five. South Carolina five, and Georgia three. 4.

The Senate 1. Nutnber of Members, Terms of Office, and Voting Procedure Originally, senators were chosen by the state legisla- tors of their own states. The 17th Amendment changed this, so that senators are now elected directly by the people. There are 100 senators, two from each state. 2. Staggered Elections; Vacancies One third of the Senate is elected every rwo years. The terms of the first Senate's membership was stag- gered: one group served two years, one four, and one six. Ail senators now serve a six-year term. The 17th Amendment changed the method of filling vacancies in the Senate. 3. Qtialifications Qualifications for the Senate are more restrictive than those for the House. Senators must be at least 30 years old and they must have been citizens of the United States for at least nine years. The Framers of the Constitution made the Senate a more elite body in order to produce a firrther check on the powers ot the House of Representatives. 4. President of the Senate The Vice President's only duty listed in the Consti- tution is to preside over the Senate. The only real power the Vice President has is to cast the deciding vote when there is a tie. However, modern Presidents have given their Vice Presidents new responsibilities. 5. Other Officers The Senate selects its other olficers, including a presiding officer (president pro tempore) who serves when the Vice President is absent or has become President ot the United States. 6. Trial of Impeachments When trying a case ot impeachment brought by the House, the Senate convenes as a court. The Chief lustice ot the Supreme Court acts as the pre- siding judge, and the Senate acts as the jury. A rwo- thirds vote ot the members present is necessary to convict officials under impeachment charges. 7. Penalty for Conviction If the Senate convicts an official, it may only remove the official from office and prevent that per- son from holding another federal position. Howev- er, the convicted official may still be tried tor the same ottense in a regular court ot law. Section 4. Elections and Meetings 1. Holding Elections In 1842 Congress required members oi tbe i louse to be elected from districts in states having more than one Representative rather than at large. In 1845 it set the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November as the d.i\\- lor selecting presidential electors. 2.

Organization Until 1969 Congress acted as the sole judge ot qualifications of its own members. In that year, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could not legally exclude victorious candidates who met all the requirements listed in Article I, Section 2. A \"quorum\" is the minimum number of members that must be present for the House or Senate to conduct sessions. For a regular House session, a quorum consists of the majorit)' ot the House, or 2 1 8 of the 437 members. 2. Rules Each house sets its own rules, can punish its members for disorderly behavior, and can expel a member by a two-thirds vote. 3. Journals In addition to the journals, a complete official record of everything said on the floor, as well as the roll call votes on all bills or issues, is available in the Congressional Record, published daily by the Govern- ment Printing Office. 4. Adjournment Neither house may adjourn for more than three days or move to another location without the approval of the other house. Section 6. Privileges and Restrictions 1. Pay and Privileges To strengthen the federal government, the Founders set congressional salaries to be paid by the United States Treasury rather than by members' respective states. Originally, members were paid $6 per day. Salaries for Senators and Representatives are $129,500. The \"immunity\" privilege means members can- not be sued or be prosecuted for anything they say in Congress. They cannot be arrested while Congress is in session, except for treason, major crimes, or breaking the peace. 2. Restrictions \"Emoluments\" means salaries. The purposes of this clause is to prevent members of Congress from passing laws that would benefit them personally. It also prevents the President from promising them jobs in other branches of the federal government. Section 7. Passing Laws 1. Revenue Bills \"Revenue\" is income raised by the government. The chief source of government revenue is taxes. All tax laws must originate in the House of Representatives. This insures that the branch of Congress which is elected by the people every two years has the major role in determining taxes. This clause does not prevent the Senate from amending tax bills. Section 5 1. Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majorit}' of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Busi- ness; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may provide. 2. Each House may determine the Rules of its Pro- ceedings, punish its Members lor disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two-thirds, expel a Member. 3. Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the desire of one-fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal. 4. Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting. Section 6 1. The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other place. 2. No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased, during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member ot either House during his continuance in Office. Section 7 1. All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other bills. 2. Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his objections, to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and 194 Constitutional Handbook"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two-thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds oi that House, it shall become a Law.

How Bills Become Laws A bill may become a law only by passing both houses ot Congress and by being signed by the Pres- ident. If the President disapproves, or vetoes, the bill, it is returned to the house where it originated, along with a written statement of the Presidents objections. If two-thirds of each house approves the bill after the President has vetoed it, it becomes law. In voting to override a President's veto, the votes ot all members ot Congress must be recorded in the journals or official records. If the President does not sign or veto a bill within ten days (excluding Sun- days), it becomes law. However, if Congress has adjourned during this ten-day period, the bill does not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto.\" 3. Presidential Approval or Veto The Framers included this paragraph to prevent Congress from passing joint resolutions instead ol bills to avoid the possibility of a presidential veto. A bill is a draft of a proposed law, whereas a resolution is the legislature's formal expression of opinion or intent on a matter. The Capitol in Washington, D. C, houses the seat of the nation's government. Congressional lawmakers meet in the Capitol to hear arguments and vote on bills put before them that even- tually become part of the nation 's law.

Habeas Corpus \"Habeas corpus\" is a Latin term meaning \"you may have the body.\" A writ of habeas corpus issued by a judge requires a law official to bring a prisoner to court and show cause for holding the prisoner. The writ may be suspended only during wartime. 3. Bills of Attainder A \"bill of attainder\" is a bill that punishes a per- son without a jury trial. An \"ex post facto\" law is one that makes an act a crime after the act has been committed. 4. Direct Taxes The 16th Amendment allowed Congress to pass an income tax. 5. Tax on Exports Congress may not tax goods that move from one state to another. 6. Uniformity of Treatment This prohibition prevents Congress from favoring one state or region over another in the regulation of trade. 7. Appropriation Law This clause protects against the misuse of funds. All of the President's expenditures must be made with the permission of Congress. 8. Titles of Nobility Ibis clause prevents the development of a nobili- tv in the United States. Section 10 1. No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Rills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a lender in Payment ot Debts; pass any Bill ol Attainder; ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obliga- tion of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility. 2. No State shall, without the ( Consent ol the C^on- gress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary tor executing its inspection Laws: and the net Produce ot all Duties and Section 10. Powers Denied to the States 1. Limitations on Poiver Ihe states are prohibited from conducting for- eign affairs, carrying on a war, or controlling inter- stale and foreign commerce. States are also not .illowed to pass laws that the federal government is prohibited from passing, such as enacting ex post facto laws or bills of attainder. These restrictions on the states were designed, in part, to prevent an overlapping in functions and authority with the federal govcrniiieni thai could create conllici and chaos.

Export and Import Taxes This clause prevents states from levying duties on exports and imports. If states were permitted to tax imports and exports they could use their taxing power in a way that weakens or destroys Congress's power to control interstate and foreign commerce. 3. Duties, Armed Forces, War This clause prohibits states from maintaining an army or navy and from going to war, except in cases where a state is directly attacked. It also forbids states from collecting fees from foreign vessels or from making treaties with other nations. All of these powers are reserved for the federal government. Imposts, laid by any State on Imports and Exports, shall be for the Use of the Treasury of the United States; and all such Laws shall be subject to the Revision and Controul of the Congress. 3. No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with anoth- er State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay. Article II. The Executive Branch Section I. President and Vice President 1. Term of Office The President is given power to enforce the laws passed by Congress. Both the President and the Vice President serve four-year terms. The 22nd Amendment limits the number of terms the Presi- dent mav serve to two. Article II Section 1 1. The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office dur- in2 the Term of four vears, and, together with the Vice-Pres- ident chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows: 2. Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal 198 Constitutional Handbook"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector. 3. The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with them selves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certifv'. and transmit sealed to the Seat oi the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Prcs cncc of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then bo counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such Majorit\\', and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately chue by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have a Majorit)'. then from the five highest on the List the said House shall in like K4anner chuse the President. But in chusing the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from each State having one Vote; a quo rum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member of Nicmbers from two thirds of the States, and a Majority' of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President. 4. The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States. 5. No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citi- zen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of Presi- dent; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States. 6. In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to dis- charge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the same shall devolve on the Vice-President, and the C'ongress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resigna- tion or Inability, both of the President and Vice-President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a President shall be elected. 2. Election The Philadelphia Convention had trouble decid- ing how the President was to be chosen. The system finally agreed upon was indirect election bv \"elec- tors\" chosen for that purpose. The President and Vice President are not directly elected. Instead, the President and Vice President are elected by presi- dential electors from each state who form the elec- toral college. Each state has the number of presidential electors equal to the total number of its senators and representatives. State legislatures deter- mine how the electors are chosen. Originally, the state legislatures chose the electors, but today they are nominated by political parties and elected by the voters. No senator, representative, or any other fed- eral officeholder can serve as an elector 3. Former Method of Election This clause describes the original method of elect- ing the President and Vice President. According to this method, each elector voted tor two candidates. The candidate with the most votes (as long as it was a majorit)') became President. The candidate with the second highest number of votes became Vice President. In the election of 1800, the two top can- didates received the same number of votes, making it necessary for the House of Representatives to decide the election. To prevent such a situation from recur- ring, the 12th Amendment was added in 1804. 4. Date of Elections Congress selects the date when the presidential electors are chosen and when they vote for President and Vice President. All electors must vote on the same day. The first Tuesday after the first Monday in November has been set as the date for presiden- tial elections. Electors cast their votes on the Mon- day after the second Wednesday in December 5. Qualificatiotis rhe President must be a citizen of the L'nited States by birth, at least thirty-five years old, and a resident of the United States for fourteen years. See Amendment 22. 6. Vacancies If the Pre.sidem dies, resigns, is removed Iroiii office by impeachment, or is unable to carry out the duties ot the ollice, the Vice President becomes President.

Salary Originally, the President's salary was $25,000 per \\ear. The President's current salary of $200,000 plus .1 $50,000 taxable expense account per year was enacted in 1969. The President also receives numer- ous fringe benefits including a $120,000 nontaxable allowance for travel and entertainment, and living accommodations in two residences, the White House and Camp David. However, the President cannot receive any other income from the United States Government or state governments while in office. 8. Oath of Office The oath of office is generally administered by the chief justice, but can be administered by any official authorized to administer oaths. All Presi- dents-elect except Washington have been sworn into office by the chief justice. Only Vice Presidents [ohn Tyler, Calvin Coolidge, and Lyndon Johnson in succeeding to the office have been sworn in by someone else. Section 2. Powers of the President 1. Military, Cabinet, Pardons Mention of \"the principal officer in each of the executive departments \" is the only suggestion of the President's Cabinet to be found in the Constitution. The Cabinet is a purely advisory body, and its power depends on the President. Each Cabinet member is appointed by the President and must be confirmed by the Senate. This clause also makes the President, a civilian, the head of the armed services. This established the principle of civilian control of the military. 2. Treaties and Appointments The President is the chiel architect ot American foreign policy. He or she is responsible for the con- duct of foreign relations, or dealings with other countries. All treaties, however, require approval of rwo-thirds of the senators present. Most federal positions today are filled under the rules and regula- tions of the civil service system. Most presidential appointees serve at the pleasure of the President. Removal of an official by the President is not sub- ject to congressional approval. But the power can be restricted by conditions set in creating the office. 3. Vacancies in Offices The President can temporarily appoint officials to fill vacancies when the Senate is not in session. 7. The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them. 8. Before he enter on the execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Con- stitution of the United States.\" Section 2 1. The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment. 2. He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two- thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nomi- nate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be estab- lished by Law.

General Jurisdiction Use of the words \"in law and equity\" reflects the fact that American courts took over rwo kinds of traditional law from Great Britain. The basic law was the \"common law,\" which was based on over five centuries of judicial decisions. \"Equity\" was a special branch of British law developed to handle cases where common law did not apply. Federal courts deal mosdy with \"statute law,\" or laws passed by Congress, treaties, and cases involving the Constitution itself \"Admiralty and maritime jurisdic- tion\" covers all sorts ot c;ises involving ships and ship- ping on the high seas and on rivers, canals, and lakes. 2. The Supreme Court When a court has \"original jurisdiction\" over cer- tain kinds of cases, it means that the court has the authority to be the first court to hear a case. A court with \"appellate jurisdiction\" hears cases that have been appealed from lower courts. Most Supreme Court cases are heard on appeal from lower courts. 3. Jury Trials Except in cases of impeachment, anyone accused of a crime has the right to a trial by jury. The trial must be held in the state where the crime was committed.

In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make. 3.

Definition Knowing that the charge of treason often had been used by monarchs to get rid of people who opposed them, the Framers of the Constitution defined treason carefully, requiring that at least two witnesses be present to testify in court that a trea- sonable act was committed. 2. Punishment Congress is given the power to determine the punishment for treason. The children of a person convicted of treason may not be punished nor may the convicted person's property be taken away from the children. Convictions for treason have been rela- tively rare in the nation's history. Article IV. Relations Afnong the States Section 1. Official Acts This provision insures that each state recognize the laws, court decisions, and tecords of all other states. For example, a matriage license or corpora- tion charter issued by one state must be accepted in other states. Section 2 1. The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States. 2.

Section 2. Mutual Duties of States 1. Privileges The \"privileges and immunities,\" or rights of citi- zens, guarantee each state's citizens equal tteatment in all states. 2. Extradition \"t^xtradition\" means that a person convicted of a crime or a person accused of a crime must be returned to the state where the crime was commit- ted.

Article V. The Amending Process There are now 26 Amendments to the Constitu- tion. The Framers of the Constitution deliberately made it difficult to amend or change the Constitu- tion. Two methods of proposing and ratifying amendments are provided for. A two-thirds majorit)' is needed in Congress to propose an amendment, and at least three-fourths of the states (38 states) must accept the amendment betore it can become law. No amendment has yet been proposed by a national convention called by the states, though in the 1980s a convention to propose an amendment requiring a balanced budget had been approved by 32 states. Article V The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two-thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitu- tion, when ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no j\\mcnd mcnt which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article ; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate. Article VI. National Supremacy 1. Public Debts and Treaties This section promised that all debts the colonies had incurred during the Revolution and under the Articles of Confederation would be honored by the new United States government. 2. The Supreme Law The \"supremacy clause\" recognized the Constitu- tion and federal laws as supreme when in conflict with those of the states. It was largely based on this clause that Chief Justice John Marshall wrote his historic decision in McCullocb v. Maryland. The I4th Amendment reinforced the supremacy of fed- eral law over state laws. 3. Oaths of Office This clause also declares that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for holding pub- lic office. This principle is also asserted in the First Amendment, which forbids Congress to set up an established church or to interfere with the religious freedom of Americans. Article VI 1. All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution as under the Confederation. 2. This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authori- ty of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. 3. The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States. 204 Constitutional Handbook"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Article VII The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the same.

Quartering Troops (1791) This amendment is based on the principle that people have a right to privacy in their own homes. It also reflects the colonists' grievances against the British government before the Revolution. Britain had angered Americans by quartering (housing) troops in private homes. Amendment 4. Searches and Seizures (1791) Like the 3rd Amendment, the 4th Amendment reflects the colonists' desire to protect their privacy. Britain had used writs of assistance (general search warrants) to seek out smuggled goods. Americans wanted to make sure that such searches and seizures would be conducted only when a judge felt that there was \"reasonable cause\" to conduct them. The Supreme Court has ruled that evidence seized ille- gally without a search warrant may not be used in court. Amendment 5. Rights of Accused Persons (1791) To bring a \"presentment\" or \"indictment\" means to formally charge a person with committing a crime. It is the function of a grand jury to see whether there is enough evidence to bring the accused person to trial. A person may not be tried more than once for the same crime (double jeopardy).

Members of the armed services are subject to mil- itary law. They may be tried in a court martial. In times of war or a natural disaster, civilians may also be put under martial law. The 5th Amendment also guarantees that persons may not be forced in any criminal case to be a wit- ness against themselves. That is, accused persons may rehise to answer questions on the ground that the answers might tend to incriminate them. Amendment VI In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trail, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascer- tained by law, and to be informed ol the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining wit- nesses in his tavor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence. Amendment 6. Right to Speedy, Fair Trial (1791) The requirement of a \"speedy\" trial insures that an accused person will not be held in jail for a lengthy period as a means of punishing the accused without a trial. A \"fair\" trial means that the trial must be open to the public and that a jury must hear witnesses and evidence on both sides before deciding the guilt or innocence of a person charged with a crime. This amendment also provides that legal counsel must be provided to a defendant. In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled, in Gideon v. Waiii- wright, that if a defendant cannot afford a lawyer, the government must provide one to defend the accused person. Amendment VII In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no tact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Courts of the United States, than according to the rules of common law. Amendtnent 7. Civil Suits (1791) \"Common law\" means the law established by pre- vious court decisions. In civil cases where one per- son sues another for more than $20, a jury trial is provided for. But customarily, federal courts do not hear civil cases unless they involve a good deal more money. Amendment VIII Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. Amendment 8. Bail and Punishment (1791) \"Bail\" is money that an accused person provides to the court as a guarantee that he or she will be present for a trial, ibis amendment insures that nei- ther bail nor punishment hir a crime sh.ill be unre.i- sonably severe.

This \"reserved powers\" provision is a check on the \"necessary and proper\" power of the federal government provided in the \"elastic clause\" in Article I, Section 8, Clause 18. Amendment 11. Suits against States (1795) This amendment provides that a lawsuit brought by a citizen of the United States or a foreign nation against a state must be tried in a state court, not in a federal court. This amendment was passed after the Supreme Court ruled that a federal court could try a lawsuit brought by citizens of South Carolina against a citizen of Georgia. This case, Chishobn v. Georgia, decided in 1793, was protested by many Americans, who insisted states would lose authorit}' if they could be sued in federal courts. Amendment 12. Election of President and Vice President (1804) This amendment changes the procedure for elect- ing the President and Vice President as outlined in Article II, Section 1, Paragraph 3. To prevent the recurrence of the election of 1800 whereby a candidate running for Vice President (Aaron Burr) could tie a candidate running tor Pres- ident (Thomas Jefferson) and thus force the election into the House of Representatives, the Twelfth Amendment specifies that the electors are to cast The Constitution did not provide for the existence of political parties, which today play a major role in the election of the President and Vice President.

Amendment XI The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, com- menced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.

Other changes include: (Da reduction from five to the three highest candidates receiving votes among whom the House is to choose if no candi- date receives a majoriry of the electoral votes, and (2) provision for the Senate to choose the Vice President from the two highest candidates if nei- ther has received a majority of the electoral votes. The Twelfth Amendment does place one restric- tion on electors. It prohibits electors from voting for two candidates (President and Vice President) from their home state. Amendment 13. Abolition of Slavery (1865) This amendment was the final act in ending slavery in the United States, h also prohibits the binding of a person to perform a personal service due to debt. In addition to imprisonment for crime, the Supreme Court has held that the draft is not a violation of the amendment. This amendment is the first adopted to be divided into sections. It is also the first to contain specifically a provision granting Congress power to enforce it by appropriate legislation. The cannon on the bat- tlefield at Gettysburg stands as a reminder of the nation's struggle over slavery, abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment.

Rights of Citizens (1868) The clauses of this amendmenc were intended 1 ) to penalize southern states that refused to grant African Americans the vote, 2) to keep former Con- federate leaders from serving in government, 3) to forbid payment of the Confederacy's debt by the federal government, and 4) to insure payment of the war debts owed the federal government. Section 1. Citizenship Defined By granting citizenship to all persons born in the United States, this amendment granted citizenship to former slaves. The amendment also guaranteed \"due process of law.\" By the 1950s, Supreme Court rulings used the due process clause to protect civil liberties. The last part of Section 1 establishes the doctrine that all citizens are entitled to equal protection of the laws. In 1954 the Supreme Court ruled, in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional because it denied equal protection. Section 2. Representation in Congress This section reduced the number of members a state had in the House of Representatives if it denied its citizens the right to vote. This section was not implemented, however. Later civil rights laws and the 24th Amendment guaranteed the vote to African Americans. Section 3. Penalty for Engaging in Insurrection The leaders of the Confederacy were barred from state or federal offices unless Congress agreed to revoke this ban. By the end of Reconstruction all but a few Confederate leaders were allowed to return to public lite. Section 4.

Yet, despite this prohibition, African Americans were denied the right to vote by many states by such means as poll taxes, literacy tests, and white primaries. Section 2.

New Dates of Terms This amend- ment had two major purposes: 1 ) to shorten the time between the President's and Vice President's election and inauguration, and 2) to end \"lame- duck\" sessions of Congress. When the Constitution first went into effect, transportation and communication were slow and uncertain. It often took many months after the election in November for the President and Vice President to travel to Washington, D.C., and pre- pare for their inauguration on March 4.

The 25th Amendment is unusually precise and explicit because it was intended to solve a serious constitutional problem. Sixteen times in American history, before passage of this amendment, the office of Vice President was vacant, but fortunately in none of these cases did the President die or resign.

Because it is flexible, it has been able to endure for more than 200 years. The Constitution establishes a federal system, with a strong central government and separate state governments. State and popular sovereignty are retained by the Tenth Amendment and by the amending process itself. The three branches of the national government balance power between the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. Occasionally the powers ol one branch comes into conflict with the others. The power of the President grows in times ot crisis, but over the years power tends to return to balance. Changes that have been made in the Constitution sometimes come by amendment, but more ohen they are the result of Court decisions or the flexibility of the Constitution itself The Supreme Court constantly reinterprets the Constitution as it decides cases. Many of these cases apply guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment to provisions in the Bill ot Rights. Ihe Constitution has served to moderate change in the United States for more than 200 years. * Using Vocabulary Use each of the following terms in sentences that relate to the Constitution: strict construction judicial review loose construction quorum * Reviewing Facts 1. Discuss the development ol the method of selecting members of the House of Representatives from 1842 to 1979. 2. Describe the idea of \"separation of powers.\" 3. Summarize the work of committees in the House and Senate. 4. Compare the Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Fcrgtiiou to its decision in Brown v. Boanl oj Hduca- tion of lopeha. 5. List three ways in which the power of flu- federal government has been expanded. 6. Report three examples of the expansion of prcsi- ilenti.il powers in time of crisis. * Thinking Critically 1. Recognizing Effects Describe three historic developments in which the power of Congress over interstate commerce and the \"elastic clause\" have expanded the authority of the federal government. 2. Analyzing Ideas The Preamble to the Constitu- tion begins with \"We the People.\" How does the Constitution assure that the people have sovereignty over the government? 3. Determining Motivations The delegates to the Constitutional Convention intended that the Sen- ate be a more dignified body than the House. Why did the delegates believe this was important.' What provisions in the Constitution give the Senate high- er status than the House? 4. Supporting an Argument Some people believe that the separation of powers into three branches has led to a slow and often ineffective government, as each branch contends for dominance. Others believe that this separation is essential to protect the people from tyrannical government. Choose one of these opinions and support it with evidence from history. 5. Applying Concepts judicial review has played an important role in shaping the laws under which we live. As a matter of course, the Supreme Court interprets the law, determining whether it is consti- tutional. This great power of the Court has been challenged, sometimes by individuals or groups, sometimes by one of the other branches of govern- ment. Trace the application of judicial review to the Fourteenth Amendment during the period from the Civil War to the present. * Linking Past and Present The rights of citizens have developed gradtially since the Constitution went into effect in 1789. Amend- ments to the Constitution, laws, court decisions, and presidential actions have served to clarify, define, or even limit rights. Choose one of the following rights and trace its historical development in the United States from the time the Constitution was ratified to ihc present: suffrage freedom of religion freedom of speech freedom of the press line process of law equal protection of law CONS'lllUIIONAl.

To solidify this position, in 1823, Presi- dent James Monroe issued a warning that came to be known as the Monroe Doc- trine. This doctrine became the foun- dation of American foreign policy for many years and was expanded upon by later United States Presidents.

Romanticism, a movement that emphasized imagination and inner feelings, won adherents among many writers of the era. One of the most celebrated ivas James Fenimore Cooper. Largely regarded in his own day as a producer of \"pop\" fiction, Cooper left a legacy of five novels whose central character. Natty Bumppo, is a trapper forced increasingly westward by the encroachment of civilizatiofj on his beloved frontier. In the following excerpt. Natty Bumppo, surrounded by the Pawnees who have become his family, is near death. from The Prairie hen he had placed his guests in front of the dying man, Hard-Heart... [a young 'awnee chief and Natty Bumppo's adopted son] leaned a little for- ward and demanded: \"Does my father hear the words of his son?\" \"Speak,\" returned the trapper, in tones that issued from his chest, but which were rendered awfully distinct by the stillness that reigned in the place. \"I am about to depart from the village of the... [Pawnees] and shortly shall be beyond the reach of your voice.\" \"Let the wise chief have no cares for his journey,\" continued Hard-Heart with an earnest solicitude that led him to forget, for the moment, that others were waiting to address his adopted parent; \"a hundred ...[Pawnees] shall clear his path from briars.\" \"Pawnee, I die as I have lived, a Chris- tian man,\" resumed the trapper with a force of voice that had the same startling effect upon his hearers as is produced by the trumpet when its blast rises suddenly and freely on the air after its obstructed sounds have been heard struggling in the distance: \"as I came into lite so will I leave it. Horses and arms are not needed to stand in the presence of the Great Spirit of my people. He knows my color, and according to my gifts will he judge my deeds....\" A little disappointed, the young parti- san stepped modestly back, making way for the recent comers to approach. Middleton [an army officer whose life Natty Bumppo has saved] took one of the meager hands of the trapper, and, strug- gling to command his voice, he succeeded in announcing his presence. The old man listened like one whose thoughts were dwelling on a very different subject; but when the other had succeeded in making him understand that he was present, an expression of joyful recognition passed over his faded features. }duii'i FoiiDiorc Cooper ;iiniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiMiniiininiiiiiiiiiiiMiinii(iiinii(iiiiiiMniiiMinMiiMUiiiiiiniiniiMiinMMiiiiiiiuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiMiiiiMiiiiiiiiiiniiMiiniiiiiiiiiiiii(iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiriiiriiiiiii(iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii 222 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1789-1824"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii[iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiriKiiiiiiniiiiiiuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii' \"I hope you have not so soon forgotten those whom you so materially served!\" Middleton concluded. \"It would pain me to think my hold on your memory was so light.\" \"Little that 1 have ever seen is forgot- ten,\" returned the trapper; \"I am at the close ot many weary days, but there is not one among them all that I could wish to overlook. I remember you with the whole of- your company; aye, and your gran'ther that went before you. I am glad that you have come back upon these plains, for I had need of one who speaks the English, smce little raith can Mt. be put in the traders of these regions. Will you do a favor to an old and dying man?\" \"Name it,\" said Middleton; \"it shall be done.\" \"It is a journey to send such trifles,\" resumed the old man, who spoke at short intervals, as strength and breath permitted; \"a far and weary jour- ney is the same; but kindnesses and friendships are things not to be forgot- ten. There is a settlement among the Otsego hills — \" \"I know the place,\" interrupted Middleton, observing that he spoke with increasing difficulty; \"proceed to tell mc what you would have done.\" \"Take this rifle and pouch and horn, and send them to the person whose name is graven on the plates of the stock — a trader cut the letters with his knife — for it is long that I have intended to send iiini such a token of my love.\" \"It shall be so. Is there more that you could wish?\" \"Little else have I to bestow. My traps I give to my Indian son; for honestly and kindly has he kept his faith. Let him stand before me.\" Middleton explained to the chief what the trapper had said, and relinquished his own place to the other. \"Pawnee,\" continued the old man, always changing his language to suit the person he addressed, and not infrequently according to the ideas he expressed, \"it is a custom of my people for the father to leave his blessing with the son before he shuts his eyes forever. This bless- ing I give to you; take it, for the prayers of a Christian man will never make the lath of a just warrior to the blessed prairies either longer or more tangled. May the CJod of a white man look your deeds with friendly eyes, and may you never commit an act that shall cause him to darken his face. I know not whether we shall ever meet again. There are many traditions concerning the place of Good Spirits. It is not for one like me, old and experienced though I am, to set up my opinions against a nation's. You believe in the blessed prairies, and I have faith in the sayings of my fathers. If both are true, our parting will be final; but if it should prove that the same meaning is hid under different words, we shall yet stand together. Pawnee, before the face of your Wahcondah, who will then be no other than my God.

But then the fault has been my own, seeing that it could not have been His....\" The old man made a long and apparent- ly a musing pause. At times he raised his eyes wistfully, as if he would again address Middleton, but some innate feeling appeared always to suppress his words. The other, who observed his hesitation, enquired in a way most likely to encourage him to proceed whether there was aught else that he could wish to have done. \"Not so, not su, Captain. Let mc sleep, where I have lived, beyond the din of the settlements! Still I see no need why the grave of an honest man should be hid, like a redskin in his ambushment. I paid a man in the settlements to make and put a graven stone at the head of my father's resting place. It was of the value of twelve beaver skins, and cunningly and curiously was it carved! Then it told to all comers that the body of such a Christian lay beneath; and it spoke of his manner of life, of his years, and of his honesty....\" \"I am without kith or kin in the wide world!\" the trapper answered; \"when I am gone, there will be an end of my race. We have never been chiefs; but honest, and useful in our way. I hope it cannot be denied, we have always proved ourselves. My father lies buried near the sea, and the bones of his son will whiten on the prairies — \" \"Name the spot, and your remains shall be placed by the side of your father,\" interrupted Middleton. \"And such a stone you would have at your grave?\" \"I! no, no, I have no son, but Hard- Heart, and it is little that an Indian knows of white fashions and usages. Besides I am his debtor, already, seeing it is so little I have done since I have lived in his tribe.

The stone shall be put at the head of your grave.\" The old man extended his emaciated hand, and gave the other a squeeze of thanks Middleton and Hard-Heart placed themselves on the opposite sides of his seat, and watched with melancholy solici- tude the variations of his countenance. For two hours there was no very sensible alteration. The expression of his faded and timeworn features was that of a calm and dignified repose. From time to time he spoke, uttering some brief sentence in the way of advice, or asking some simple questions concerning those in whose for- tunes he still took a friendly interest. During the whole of that solemn and anx- ious period each individual ol the tribe kept his place, in the most self-restrained patience. When the old man spoke, all bent their heads to listen; and when his words were uttered, they seemed to pon- der on their wisdom and usefulness. As the flame drew nigher to the socket, his voice was hushed, and there were moments when his attendants doubted whether he still belonged to the living. Middleton, who watched each wavering expression of his weather-beaten visage with the interest of a keen observer of human nature, softened by the tender- ness of personal regard, fancied he could read the workings ol the old man's soul in the strong lineaments ot his counte- nance. Perhaps what the enlightened sol- dier took for the delusion ot mistaken opinion did actually occur — tor who has returned trom that unknown world to explain by what forms, and in what man- ner, he was introduced into its awful precincts?. ...Suddenly, Middleton felt tile li.iiui which lie lieUl, grasp his own wiih incredible power, and the old man, sup- ported on either side by his friends, rose upright to his feet. For a moment he looked about him, as if to invite all in presence to listen (the lingering remnant of human frailty), and then, with a fine military elevation ot the head, and with a voice that might be heard in every part of that numerous assembly, he pro- nounced the word: \"Here!\" A movement so entirely unexpected, and the air of grandeur and humility which was so remarkably united in the mien of the trapper, together with the clear and uncommon force of his utter- ance, produced a short period of confu- sion in the faculties of all present. When Middleton and Hard-Heart, each of whom had involuntarily extended a hand to support the form of the old man, turned to him again, they found that the subject of their interest was removed for- ever beyond the necessity of their care. They mournfully placed the body in its seat, and Le Balatre [an aging Pawnee chief] arose to announce the termination of the scene to the tribe. The voice of the old Indian seemed a sort ot echo from that invisible world to which the meek spirit of the trapper had just departed. \"A valiant, a just, and a wise warrior has gone on the path which will lead him to the blessed grounds of his people!\" he said. \"When the voice of the Wihcondah called hi in, he was ready to answer. Go, my children; remember the just chief ot the palefaces, and clear your own tracks trom briars!\" The grave was made beneath the shade of some noble oaks. It had been carefully watched to the present hour by the Pawnees of the Loup, and is often shown to the traveler and the trader as a spiit where a just white man sleeps. In due time the stone was placed at its head, with the simple inscription, which the trapper had himself requested, llie only liberty, taken by Middleton, was to add, \"May no wanton hand ever disturb his remains! \" Interpreting literature 1 .

The obvious choice as leader of the new government was the hero of the Revolution, George Washing- ton. Although he was reluctant to take the job, his reputation and stature were critical to the nation's success. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • List the precedents set by Washington as first President. • Describe the first Congress under the Constitution. G eorge Washington accepted the presidency reluctantly. On the day he left for his inauguration, he confided in his diary: About ten o'clock I bade adieu to Mt. Vernon, to private life, and to domestic felicity, and with a mind oppressed with more anxious and painful sensations than I care to express, set out for New York. At almost every town and village on the way from Virginia to the nation's temporary capital, Washington was met by welcoming speeches, cheering crowds, and troops of cavalry. When he reached New York on April 23, 1789, he was rowed across the Hudson River on a barge built especially for the occasion and staffed with 13 harbor pilots in white uniforms. Most of New York's 33,000 residents lined the wharves and cheered as the barge neared shore. Seven days later, Washington took the oath of office and gave the first inaugural address. In reporting the event, a corre- spondent for the Federal Gazette of Philadelphia wrote: . . . [T]he concourse of spectators, the devout fervency with which he repeated the oath, and the reverential manner in which he bowed down and kissed the sacred volume — all these conspired to render it one of the most august and interesting spectacles ever exhibited on this globe. It seemed, from the number of witnesses, to be a solemn appeal to Heaven and earth at once. After the inauguration ceremony con- cluded, the festivities began with the ring- ing ol church bells and the firing of cannons. Throughout the land there was public rejoicing for the man many believed to be the United States' greatest national asset. Washington as President Washington's background was as plan- tation manager and soldier. Because he lacked experience in government and had only limited knowledge ol political theo- ry and history, he felt he was unprepared to be the chief executive. Although Wash- ington doubted his own qualifications, 228 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1789-1824"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"many Americans regarded him with admiration bordering on awe. As early in his career as his first mihtary victories at Trenton and Princeton, a Philadelphia newspaper wrote of Washington: \"It there are any spots in his character they are like the spots on the sun, only discernible through a telescope.\" Such hero worship had its value to the new government. As a visible symbol of unity and power, Wash- ington provided a locus for loyalty to the nation. Yet Washington was far more than a national symbol or figurehead. He knew the United States as well as any person alive, having traveled in every state except Georgia and having met or exchanged let- ters with most of the nation's prominent Examining Illustrations Washington's first cabinet included, (left to right) Henry Knox. Thomas Jefferson. Edmund Randolph, and Alexander Hamilton. Washington (far right) held no regular meetings with these officers, but did rely on their expert opinions. Hamilton became the most influential because the Treasury post gave him a strong position in propos- ing legislation. Washington claimed to have no particular political expertise.

From the time he took charge of the Continental army in 1775, he worked, as he said, to \"discourage all local attachments\" and to substitute \"the greater name of American.\" Even with Washington in office and Congress in session, the Constitution was still little more than a paper plan. It would be months before the government could be functioning effectively. Laws had to be passed to establish executive depart- ments such as the Treasury and the Post Office. A federal court system was needed to fill the gap left by the Framers of the Constitution. Once federal offices were established, hundreds of people had to be found who were willing to give up their current jobs to serve as judges, tax collectors, and post- masters. Here, Washington's wide range of acquaintances and his reputation were invaluable in helping him find competent government officials. Washington himself proved to be a first- rate administrator. On important matters, he sought the advice of his department heads, establishing what became known as the cabinet, a group of advisers to the President that continues to serve the same function today. Creating a cabinet was only one of several precedents set by Washington in areas where the Constitution was silent or unclear. He determined that the Sen- ate's approval power over presidential appointments did not extend to their removal from office. He took control of foreign affairs, limiting the Senate's role of advice and consent to ratifying or rejecting treaties only after they were made. Although he headed the executive branch, Washington assumed leadership in legislative affairs as well. In written messages to Congress, and indirectly through reports prepared by his secretary of the treasury, Alexander Hamilton, Washington urged passage of laws he believed were in the public interest. With such encouragement Congress almost invariably followed his lead. Later Presidents would follow suit and become what some have called \"chief legislator.\" The First Congress When the Confederation came to an end in 1788, it left behind 70 unpaid clerks, a military of 672 soldiers, and mil- lions of dollars in debts. Before it dis- banded, the Confederation Congress had arranged for the new government to be elected in November 1788, and start work on March 4, 1789. When March arrived, however, less than one-third of the sena- tors and one-quarter of the representatives had reached New York. \"The people will forget the new government before it is born,\" lamented a senator from Mas- sachusetts. Not until April did each house of Congress have a quorum, or a majority ot its members present in order to con- duct business. The Senate was a small body consisting of two members from each state elected by their state legislature. The Framers of the Constitution had expected the Senate to serve as an advisory body to the President. With this in mind, Washing- ton came to the Senate in August 1789 with an Indian treaty and asked for the senators' advice as well as their consent to the treat)'. Because some senators felt tmcomfortable discussing the treaty in the presence of the President, they instead referred it to a committee for study. Senator William Maclay described Washington's reaction in his personal journal: / rose and supported the mode of doing business by committees;. . . As I sat down, the President of the United States started up in a violent fret. \"This defeats every purpose of my coming here, \" were the first words that he said. . . . He cooled, hoivever, by degrees. Washington then left the Senate, depart- ing, wrote Maclay, \"with a discontented 230 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1789-1824"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"air.\" Although he returned later to watch the Senate debate, amend, and ratify the treaty, it was the last time that any Presi- dent formally sought the advice of the Senate. The Senate was a quiet and formal body Its members dressed in powdered wigs, lace, and velvet. For its first five years, the Senate conducted its business in private. Not until 1794 was a gallery built for the public and the press. By contrast, the House of Representatives was more informal. Elected by the people, the House welcomed the public and the press from the beginning. Debate was loud, and members often wore their hats inside the chamber. The House took the lead in leg- islative matters, especially in dealing with the nation's troubled finances and in pro- viding a Bill of Rights. After debates that lasted through the summer of 1789, Congress established three executive departments: a Depart- ment of State to take charge of foreign affairs, a Department of the Treasury to handle the nations finances, and a Department of War to manage the military. Congress also created the posi- tion of Attorney General to handle the government's legal matters. None of these offices were specifically called tor in the Constitution. Congress then turned its attention to the judicial branch and passed the Judicia- ry Act of 1789, setting up the Supreme Court and lower federal courts as called for by the Constitution. President Wash- ington quickly named the first Supreme Court Justices, deliberately choosing three from northern and three from southern states. Although a majority in both the Senate and the House had supported ratificatit)n of the Constitution, the Anti-Federalist minority insisted that Congress quickly provide the Bill ol Rights promised din- ing the ratification campaign. In his inau- gural address, Washington also urged that careful attention be given to such tlemands. finally in September 17<S'', aher much debate, C^ongress proposed 12 amendments. Of these, 10 were ratifietl bv the states ami .nUled to the Constitu- tion in 179] . Section One Review liTiWiWil mziE Summary The period from 1788 to 1796 was characterized by the precedent-setting leadership of George Washington and by the establishment of a new government. Washington took control of both foreign and domestic affairs. To assist him he set up a cabinet and made key appointments. He acted with wisdom and authority to assure the success of the Constitution. Chixking for Understanding 1 . Identify Judiciary Act of 1 789 2. Define cabinet, quorum 3.

Wash- ington was acutely aware that his every act would be scrutinized. \"Few... can realize the difficult and delicate part which a man in my situation has to act I walk on untrodden ground. There is hardly any part of my conduct which may not hereafter be drawn into prece- dent.\" As soon as Washington was elect- ed, he was beset with requests for jobs. His reftisal to hire friends and relatives established the idea that the office is public, not private. Washington's use of the cabinet as a source of advice set a precedent that continues today. So too did his appearance in person before Congress to deliver his State of the Union addresses, although this method was abandoned by Thomas Jefferson and not renewed until Woodrow Wilson. Future Presidents took another cue from Washington's periodic tours of the country, although today such tours often assume political overtones, as when the President campaigns for fellow parry members. Later Presi- dents also modified the precedent by taking frequent vacation trips, a practice for which they have some- times been criticized. In 1990 George Bush, for example, was flayed by critics for taking a sched- uled month-long vacation at the same time he was sending Ameri- can troops to Saudi Arabia. The thorny problem of whether to recognize new governments, especially ones that overthrew regimes with which the United States had diplomatic ties, also pre- sented itself to Washington. He argued that \"we surely cannot deny to any nation the right whereon our own government is founded, that Washington's Inaugural every nation may govern itself according to whatever torm it pleas- es. \" This precedent has been modi- fied as well. Presidents still exercise the power to grant recognition, but by implication they also have the power to withhold it. The denial of diplomatic recognition was made a powerful tool of international diplomacy by later Presidents. In 1794 the Whiskey Rebellion presented Washington with one of his strongest challenges — and yet another precedent was set. His use of federal troops to enforce the law fell within his right as commander in chief of the armed lorces. Wash- ington chose to lead the expedition personally. While President Eisen- hower did not personally lead the force in 1957, he did send troops to Little Rock, Arkansas, to enforce school integration. Washington's first administration began with a mere skeleton crew of clerks. In appointing workers to carry out the functions of the exec- utive office, Washington indirectly assumed the role of party leader, appointing only those he perceived to be sympathetic with his political views. Future Presidents took increasingly active roles in the leadership of political parties. Perhaps Washington's strongest legacy was the idea that a President should serve no more than two terms in office. It was not broken until World War II, when Franklin D. Roosevelt persuaded American voters to elect him President four times. So strong was Washington's precedent that it was made part of the basic law of the land by the Twenty-second Amendment to the Constitution. Making Connections 1.

The support of government — the support m ' of troops for the common defense — the pay- ment of the public debt, are the true final causes for raising money. — Alexander Hamilton Secretary of the Treasury, 1 79 1 Section Focus The United States needed money to pay its war debts and to finance national growth. Raising these funds was the huge but vital task of the secretary of the trea- sury, Alexander Hamilton. His plans would bring financial stability to the new government. The plans, however, also would rekindle debate over the amount of power exercised by the national gov- ernment. Obj ectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss Hamilton's financial program for the United States and the opposi- tion to it. • Describe the problems settlers faced during western expansion. If the United States were to survive, the new government had to be able to pay its way. All members in both houses of Congress agreed that as soon as possible the federal government should begin to collect tariffs, or t;ixes on imports. But a tariff law was not passed until July 1789 because some sections of the nation wanted a protective tariff — a high tax on imports to protect their products from foreign competition — while they opposed protection for goods produced in other sections. For example, the South wanted a high tariff on imported hemp, which was used in making rope, to protect its own hemp crop. But New England opposed this because it would cost more to rig ships. New England, in turn, wanted a high tariff to protect its rum distilleries, while the South preferred to import rum directly from Jamaica. The tariff of 1789 represented a com- promise between the South and New England. Representatives to Congress from both sections of the country dropped their demands for protection and agreed to a revenue tariff, a low tax on imports designed to provide income for the government rather than protection for private business. Akhough there were a few exceptions, tariffs on imports aver- aged between 5 percent and 8 percent. Hamilton's Program Most of the money raised by the tariff was needed to pay off the United States' $54 million national debt. The nation owed $12 million to France and the Netherlands for loans made during and after the Revolutionary War.

In addition to regulating curren- cy and supervising banking, the \"Fed\" is charged with maintaining a sta- ble economy, a high level of employment, and a favorable balance of trade with other landowners. He distrusted small farmers and laborers and expressed this view by writing: All communities divide themselves into the few and the many. The first are the rich and well-born, the other the mass of the people. . . . The people are turbulent and changing; they seldom judge or determine right. Give therefore to the first class . a distinct permanent share of the government. When Congress asked Hamilton to pre- pare a financial plan, his proposals reflected his attitudes about wealth, power, and government. In a two-part Report on the Public Credit and a Report on Manufactures, he convinced Congress to pass a series of laws in 1790 and 1791. His recommendations, however, produced conflict and controversy. Hamilton believed it was vital to the nation that the government have enough income to operate, pay the interest on the national debt, and gradually reduce the debt itself So, in addition to the tariff, Hamilton proposed an excise tax on American whiskey. An excise tax is a tax paid by the manufacturer of a product and passed on to those who buy the prod- uct. In 1791 Congress approved Hamil- ton's proposal by enacting an excise tax on whiskey. In dealing with the national debt, Hamilton proposed that foreign creditors be paid at once. As long as the United States owed money to other nations, he argued, it could not be truly independent. Congress responded by repaying France and the Netherlands in full by 1796. Hamilton believed that the domestic debt also should be paid in full, even though the value of the bonds issued by the Continental Congress had fallen in value to as little as 20 cents on the dollar. Hamilton argued that in paying these bonds in full, the United States would tell its citizens and the world that its promises were good. After much debate. Congress passed the Funding Bill in 1790. Hamilton proposed that the federal government also pay the states' debts.

Hamilton also believed that federal payment of state debts would give the states a strong and selfish interest in the success of the central government. Congress agreed and in 1790 passed the Assumption Act. A key element of Hamilton's financial proposals was that the federal government establish a national bank modeled on the Bank of England. The bank would be a place for the federal government to deposit its tax receipts, as well as a place where tax revenues and private deposits could be used for large loans to govern- ment and to businesses. Most importantly, the proposed bank would issue paper money backed by gold and silver in the bank's vaults. The public could have confidence in this currency because it could be exchanged for coins on demand. The notes of a Bank of the United States, circulating throughout the country, would provide a national curren- cy that would stimulate commerce and promote business growth. Hamilton believed that the federal gov- ernment should encourage development of American industries. In his Report on Manufactures he argued that industrial growth would make the country wealthi- er, because investing in manufacturing often yielded higher profits than did agri- culture. Industrial growth would also encourage the immigration of skilled laborers to the nation. He proposed pro- tective tariffs and government aid to new or expanding businesses. Although Congress did not act on this part of Hamilton's program, later events would prove that his vision was a clear one. On the whole, Hamilton's program had immediate success in restoring the credit of the United States. By 1792, for exam- ple, bonds that had sold at a discount just four years earlier, were selling for 1 20 per- cent to 125 percent of face value. There was another, more personal motive behind Hamilton's proposals. Because he believed in governnieni by the wealthy and distrusted common people, his plans were intended to enlist the \"rich and well-born \" to support the federal gov- ernment. He hoped to make such people selfishly interested in its survival. Although most of his proposals were enacted by Congress, the debate over many of them became bitter and divisive. Opposition to Hamilton Despite its merits, Hamilton's program encountered great opposition, much of it led by Thomas Jefferson, Washington's secretary of state. Although tensions between Hamilton and Jefferson involved a personal struggle for power in Washing- ton's cabinet, they also reflected larger dif- ferences in the vision each man had of the nation. The self-made Hamilton called democra- cy \"poison\" and characterized the general public as selfish, unrca.sonabic, and violent.

As time had passed, the original holders of these bonds, facing hard times and fearing that they would never be paid, sold their bonds to speculators at a dis- count. Madison was outraged that New England merchants who had paid as little as $10 for a $100 bond now would receive full value while the Patriot who bought the bond during the Revolution got nothing. In addition, because federal funds would pay these speculators, tax money from the South would end up in New England pockets. Madison's objection to the Assumption Bill was based on similar sectional con- cerns. Most of the southern states had already paid their debts and did not want their taxes to pay the debts of the north- ern states. This dispute was settled when Hamilton, Madison, and Jefferson struck a deal. Southerners in Congress would vote for Hamilton's debt assumption plan. In return, the nation's capital would move from New York to Philadelphia for 10 years, and then to a new federal city on the Potomac River between Maryland and Virginia. When Congress debated the bill to establish a national bank, Madison attacked it on constitutional grounds. Congress had no power to establish a bank, he argued, because it was not among the enumerated powers, or powers mentioned specifically, in the Constitu- tion. Nor was it an implied power, a power that, while not directly stated in the Constitution, is suggested and does allow Congress to exercise its stated pow- ers. If the federal government were allowed to establish a national bank, he feared there would be no limits to federal power. Despite Madison's arguments, Con- gress passed the Bank bill by an almost two-to-one majority. But Washington hesitated to act, realizing that whether he signed this controversial bill or vetoed it, he would be setting an important prece- dent. Instead, he asked Attorney General Edmund Randolph and Secretary of State Jefferson, both fellow Virginians, for written opinions on the con- stitutionality of a national bank.

Washington passed Jef- ferson's and Randolph's opinions on to Hamikon. Wori<ing day and night, Hamikon composed a reply that con- vinced President Washington he should sign the Bank bill. In a classic statement of implied powers, Hamilton argued that because the Bank's functions were among the powers given Congress, the Constitu- tion gave Congress the right to choose any legal means to carry out those func- tions. In 1791 the Bank of the United States was established for a 20-year peri- od with a capital investment of $10 mil- lion. Within two hours after shares in the Bank went on sale, wealthy investors had purchased $8 million worth of its stock. Problems in the West In addition to the financial problems left by the Confederation Congress, the new government faced continuing con- cerns about the western territories. The most immediate cause for alarm was rela- tions with Indian nations, to which Presi- dent Washington devoted most of his annual message to Congress in 1791. Armed to defend their lands, encouraged by the British and Spanish, and unim- pressed by the Confederation govern- ment, the Indians battled settlers over frontier land. Thousands of people were killed in almost constant conflict. Wash- ington hoped to improve relations, but the bloodshed had to stop. South of the Ohio River, treaties were signed with the C'herokees in 1791 and the Chickamaugas in 1794 — and the Creeks asked the federal government for protection from the settlers. Once these Indians in southern regions had been approached, the bluegrass meadows of Kentucky and the rich bottom lands along the rivers of Pennessee drew more than .3()(),()00 settlers between 1790 and 1800. With such great population increas- es, Kentucky gained admission to the Union in 1792 and Tennessee in 1796. Relations in parts north of the Ohio River were not as conciliatory. In 1791, after a military expedition into the North- west Territory was badly beaten by the Miami chief Little Turtle, Washington ordered the governor of the territory. General Arthur St. Clair, to the area with the largest force the West had ever seen — 2,300 regular troops plus several companies of militia. As St. Clair moved north from Cincinnati, desertion and disease reduced his army to 1,400. But lacking respect for his enemy and reject- ing the pleas of his weakened troops, St. Clair continued into Indian territory. In November 1791, near what is now the Ohio-Indiana border, he was attacked. Only 500 of his command survived one of the worst defeats in American military history. Life of the Times Frontier Weddings Weddings were major social events on the frontier. Unlike mar- riage celebrations in more settled areas and in the East, western settings frequen tly lacked a religious ser- vice. Traveling clergy were scarce, and a resi- dent minister even more uncommon. Instead, a justice of the peace would hear the couple's vows.

Wayne pursued his foes all the way to Fort Miami, near present-day Tole- do, Ohio, a British fur post that had been supplying weapons to the Indians.

Whiskey was also used as currency in the West, where gold and silver coins or bank notes were scarce. Westerners believed that Hamilton's excise tax on whiskey, first levied in 1791, was aimed directly at them. There may have been some truth to this claim. Hamilton viewed the excise tax not only as a source of revenue for the national government but also as a way to get the West to recognize federal authority. Anti-tax sentiment was especially strong in western Pennsylvania, where citizens refiised to pay the tax, attacked revenue officers, and burned the barns of neighbors who told authorities where stills were locat- ed. Known as the Whiskey Rebellion, this revolt was as much a challenge to law and order as Shays's Rebellion had been eight years before. The outcome under the new government, however, was very different. The Massachusetts militia had suppressed Shays without help from the nearly bankrupt Confederation government. When the governor of Pennsylvania hesi- tated to take action against the Whiskey Rebellion, the federal government stepped in and crushed it. President Wishington, with Hamilton at his side, personally led 12,000 militia into western Pennsylvania, a force so overwhelming that when it approached, resistance to the whiskey tax melted. Some rebellion leaders were seized and taken to Philadelphia for trial. Two were found guilty of treason, but Washing- ton pardoned both of them. The new gov- ernment had shown its strength, he felt. Now it could afford to be merciftil. The rapid settlement of the West had a profound effect on politics. Reflecting the spirit of tliL- frontier, the new western states extended sufifrage, or voting rights. Because land was so plentiful in the West, the constitutions of Kentucky and Ten- nessee required no property qualifications for voting. All white ni.iles over 21 years of age had the fr.iiKhise. The argument for extending suflrage was that any man who helpetl clear the land and light Indi- ans had a rigiit to a say in the govern- ment.

Along with new domestic policies, the nation had to forge a response to overseas pressures as well. Treaties brought improved relations for a time. But the end of Washington's presi- dency found the United States facing renewed problems with other nations. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe the effects of the French Rev- olution on the United States. • Explain the importance of the Jay and Pinckney treaties. Shortly alter Washington was inau- gurated in 1789, the French Revo- liuion began. At first, Americans sympathized with the revolutionar- ies because they were demanding the same rights that Americans had won a few years earlier. The French \"Declaration of the Rights of Man and the C'itizen\" pro- claimed that all \"men are born and remain free and equal in rights,\" and declared the rights of \"liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression.\" The French rev- olutionaries readily acknowledged their debt to the United States in the expression and delense ol these rights. In this country, popular enthusiasm for France became for a time almost a mad- ness. Americans sang French revolution- ary songs such as the \"Marseillaise,\" erected \"liberty poles\" and wore \"liberty caps,\" and even took to calling each other Citizen and Citizeness instead of Mr. and Mrs. In New York, King Street was renamed Liberty Street, and in Boston, Royal Exchange Alley became Equalitv Lane. Cheers for France were often joined with damnation of Britain. Not only was the memory of the American Revolution still strong, but there was resentment because of the British refusal to give up the tur posts and to stop arming the Indi- ans of the Northwest. America's European Problems When war broke out between France and Great Britain in 1793, the French expected American aid. According to treaties signed in 1778 between France and the American revolutionaries, France would have been justified in asking for American military assistance against Great Britain. They did not go that far, but they hoped to recruit American volunteers lor the French army and navy and to use American ports as bases to attack British merchant ships.

He envi- sioned a rationally laid-out metropolis that would embody the new nation's republican ideals, with wide boulevards connecting the branches of government, national monuments, parks, and entry gates. L'Enfant began by choosing the spots for the Capitol and President's house. The Congress building became the central point in a square grid of streets occupying the terrain between the Potomac and Ana- costia rivers. The grid was slashed by avenues that radiated from the capitol hill like spokes on a wheel. These avenues provided a direct route to different parts of the city.

Three-fourths of America's trade was with Britain, and tariff duties on British products provided the bulk of federal revenues. Because the British fleet controlled the seas, war would have ended foreign trade and meant bankruptcy for the new govern- ment. Upon hearing of the outbreak of war in Europe, Washington called a cabinet meeting to discuss whether he should issue a declaration of neutrality. All cabi- net members supported neutrality, even though Jefferson did so reluctantly. JefTer- son, who had served as American minister to France and greatly respected the French people, believed that a formal declaration of neutrality would help Britain, and so he cautioned Washington against it. Hamilton, who despised the democracy of the French Revolution, argued that Britain was more to be feared than France, and he urged Washington to announce America's neutrality. Again, Hamilton's arguments prevailed, and in April 1793, Washington issued a Procla- mation of Neutrality. The President declared that the conduct of the United States toward the warring powers was to be \"friendly and impartial.\" He warned that Americans who helped either side would be denied the protection of the government and would be subject to punishment. The arrival of a new French minister, Citizen Edmond Genet (zhuh NAY), put Washington's neutrality proclamation to the test. Arriving in South Carolina, Genet traveled overland to the capital at Philadel- phia. Along the way he was invited to so many dinners and pro-French celebrations that his journey became a triumphant pro- cession. He arranged to place American crews on French privateers, or armed pri- vate ships, and offered George Rogers Clark a commission in the French army. 242 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1789-1824"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Arriving confidently in Philadelphia, Genet demanded that the United States advance him money to pay his new recruits. The French ministers efforts to involve the United States in war were soon thwarted. Washington received him with icy politeness. Hamilton used all his influ- ence against Genet. Even Jefferson flatly refused Genet's demands and came to dis- like him intensely. Finally, an outraged Washington demanded that he be recalled to France. Genet, however, begged to remain in the United States, because changes in France's revolutionary govern- ment caused him to fear for his life. Washington granted his request, and he spent the rest of his life in obscurity. Great Britain also tested American for- eign policy. When the British realized that the new federal government was more powerful than its predecessor, they at last consented to send a minister to the Unit- ed States. But once war began in Europe, they issued a series of orders forbidding neutral ships to trade with the French West Indies, to carry French West Indian produce, or to carry any weapons or food to France. These restrictions fell most heavily on the United States, which had the largest neutral merchant marine. British warships seized htindreds of Amer- ican vessels and confiscated their cargoes, a clear violation of the rights of a neutral nation under international law. In the spring of 1794, these provoca- tions, coupled with news of British involvement with the Indians in the Northwest Territory, pushed C'ongress to the brink of war. Hamilton urged Wash- ington to make one last effort to come to a peaceful solution to the outstanding United States-Britain disputes by sending John Jay, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, as a special envoy lo CSreat Britain. The British were willing to sign a treaty. A war with the United States would onlv make it harder to carrv on the war with France. And the United Slates was Britain's best market. Jay got rather poor treaty terms, however, partly because Alexander 1 i.iiiiilioii committed a serious mistake; he k-l the British know |a\\''s iiisiructions. Treaties with Britain and Spain The Jay Treaty was completed late in 1794 and was presented by Washington to the Senate the next year. The British promised once again to evacuate their forts in American territory if the United States let them keep the fur trade with the Indi- ans. American ships were allowed into ports in the British Isles on the same terms as British ships in American ports. The treaty permitted the United States a very limited trade with the British West Indies, but none with Canadian ports. On the whole, it seemed that the British gave fewer conces- sions than they received. There was no promise that the violation of American neu- tral rights at sea would cease. Nor was there any assurance that British agents would stop giving weapons to American Indians. When the news of the Jay Treaty became known, there was a tremendous public out- er)' against it. Jay's effigy was hanged, burned, and guillotined in city squares throughout the nation. Hamilton, speaking in support of the treaty in New York City, Examining Illustrations The Arch Street Ferry engraving by William Birch shows a busy trade center In Philadel- phia.

Despite the public's outrage, the Senate narrowly ratified the treaty by a two-thirds vote, 20 to 10. Dis- satisfied with the treaty and dismayed by public reaction, Washington hesitated but finally signed it. Resistance continued in the House, where opponents of the treaty, led by Madison, refiased to vote hinds nec- essary to put it into efi^ect. But a growing fear that the alternative to an unsatisfactory treaty was war with Britain resulted in a 50 to 49 vote to release the funds. Ironically, Jay's treaty helped the United States win concessions from Spain. When the treaty's pro-British terms became pub- lic, Spain's government suspected that a secret agreement had been made providing British support for an American attack on Spanish New Orleans and Florida. Thomas Pinckney was sent to Spain to try once again to setde longstanding differences between the two nations. In 1795 the Pinckney Treaty granted the United States all the concessions it had been seeking since the end of the Revolutionary War — free navigation of the Mississippi River, the right of deposit at New Orleans, acknowledgement of the United States' southern boundary at the 31st parallel and western boundary at the Mississippi. Washington Steps Down Washington had wanted to retire after his first term as President, saying he would rather dig ditches than continue. He agreed to serve a second term only after prominent leaders, including both Jeffer- son and Hamilton, urged him to do so, saying it was his patriotic duty. In 1792, as in 1789, he received no opposition in the electoral college. But Washington enjoyed his second term even less than his first.

This address was Washington's explanation for not seeking a third term as President. But more impor- tantly, in this famous document, he gave the young republic his best advice on the conduct of politics and foreign affairs. Upon returning to his beloved Mount Vernon, Washington had every reason to feel proud of his achievements during eight years as President. Most of the major difficulties of the Confederation had been overcome. As a result of Hamilton's finan- cial program, America's credit was as good as any nation in Europe. The suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion had demon- strated the power of the new government. The major demands of the West had been fulfilled.

UHUHl tfUHrf Summary The United States proclaimed neutrality in the war between France and Britain in 1793. Britain tried to block American trade with France, and preyed upon American ships. While many in Congress clamored for war, Washington relied on diplomacy to ease tensions. The Jay and Pinckney treaties improved trade relations and enhanced America's public image abroad.

And shall flourish, till liberty slinnher forever! — Robert Treat Paine Adams and Liberty, 1 794- 1 796 Section Focus It was inevitable that a nation of people holding different political philosophies and ideologies would sooner or later establish political parties. Foreign affairs provided further reasons for partisan poli- tics. Led by a new President, the govern- ment would soon have to deal with problems on foreign soil as well as sus- pected treason at home. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain why political parties arose. • Describe the problems John Adams encountered as President. The origins of America's two- party political system are found in the conflicts within Wash- ington's cabinet and in Con- gressional debates over Hamilton's financial program. Shortly after Washing- ton took office, it became clear that Hamilton had the President's ear on almost every government matter. To counter Hamilton's strong influence, Madison and Jefferson began to gather support tor their views both inside the government and out. From their effort emerged America's first political party. The Formation of Parties Washington's first administration was nonpartisan — that is, there were no perma- nent divisions based on politics or causes. Differences arose over specific issues, which were hotly debated. But harmony returned after a cause triumphed or lost. Jefferson's resignation from Washington's cabinet, however, signaled a formal split in the ranks of the nation's political leadership. After resigning, Jefferson openly allied with Madison, who was already opposing the Washington administration in Con- gress, to form what they called the \"Republican\" interest. They chose this name to suggest that they were defending freedom and self-government from the anti-democratic influence of Hamilton. Hamilton's supporters retaliated by tak- ing the name \"Federalists,\" the label previously used by supporters of the Con- stitution during the ratification campaign. This clever maneuver was intended to imply that the Republicans were the Anti- Federalists and that they did not support the Constitution. The Federalists included people who stood to profit from Hamilton's financial program — creditors, merchants, and bondholders. Federalists gained mass sup- port from wage earners in the shipping industry and from residents of states that benefited when the federal government assumed state debts. Reflecting Hamil- ton's distrust of the people, the Federalists hoped to put the direction of government into the hands of the \"rich, well-born, and able.\" The Republicans' strength was among southern planters, subsistence farmers of the backcountry, and \"mechan- ics\" such as carpenters, shoemakers, and masons. The Republicans advocated lim- iting the power of the central government. As the presidential election of 1796 drew near, both sides increasingly acted like traditional political parties. Under Madison's leadership, the Republicans 246 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1789-1824"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"tried to gain public support by opposing the unpopular Jay Treaty. Washington gave the Federalists an election advantage by delaying his retirement announcement. The Republicans were unwilling to offer any candidate to oppose a national hero. When Washington withdrew two months before the election, the Federalists selected Vice President John Adams, who was highly respected in the countiy at large and had solid support from his native New England. The Republicans countered with a candidate of equal national reputa- tion and sectional strength — Thomas Jef- ferson. In selecting its candidate for Vice President, each parry tried to achieve geo- graphic balance between its candidates. The Federalists chose Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina, who was currently popu- lar because of his successftil treaty negotia- tions with Spain. The Republicans balanced Jefferson, the Virginian, with Aaron Burr of New York. Because the Framers of the Constitu- tion had not anticipated political parties, the nations first partisan presidential elec- tion was a confusing contest. The Consti- tution provided that the candidate with the highest number of votes in the elec- toral college woidd become President, and the runner-up. Vice President. Therefore, some New England Federalist electors left Pinckney off their ballots in order to make sure that Adams would get the highest vote. The result was that Adams, a Federalist, was elected President with 71 electoral votes, while Jefferson, a Republi- can, became Vice President with 68. Adams as President John Adams had spent most of his life in public service. An early leader of the revo- lutionary movement in Massachusetts, he was a prominent member of the First and Second Continental Cx)ngresses. During the war, he served as envoy to France and I lolland. i le was one of the American rep- resentatives ,11 the lieaiy of Paris ending the Revolutionary War, and later became the nation's first minister to Great Britain. Under Washington, he served two terms as Vice President. In each office, he served with distinction. Despite his many administrative talents, Adams was not a successful President. For one thing, he was too aware of his own virtues. During the Revolution he had written of himself \"At such times as this there are many dangerous things to be done which nobody else will do, and therefore I cannot help attempting them.\" Enemies satirized both his love of ceremo- ny and his roly-poly figure by nicknaming him \"His Rotundity.\" He was difTicult to deal with because he was reluctant to compromise, often being as suspicious of others' motives as he was sure of his own. Adams inherited the dispute with France. French disappointment over Washington's Neutrality Proclamation turned to hostility after the Jay Treaty. During the election of 1796, the French minister to the United States actively campaigned against Adams. When Charles C. Pinckney was sent as minister to France in 1796, he was ordered out of the coimtry. Meanwhile, the French navy started to prey on American shipping. Adams was anxious to make peace. Immediately after taking office, he .sent envoys to Paris to negotiate a trearv'. When the Americans arrived, they were ap- proached by representatives of Charles Maurice de lalleyrand, the French minister of foreign affairs, who refused to meet with Examining illustrations John Adams's influence in tiie Constitutional Convention helped to produce the strong office of the President.

Talleyrand. ^^ ^o^, Benjamin Banneker I73I-I806 Born into a free black family in Maryland, Benjamin Banneker at- tended a private school, but he was largely self-educated. When his father died, Banneker sold the family farm and devoted the rest of his life to mathematics and natural science. Banneker's skill in mathematics prompted Thomas Jefferson to secure him a job surveying the land for the new national capital at Washington, D.C. When the French architect — Pierre L'Enfant — was removed horn the project, he took his detailed maps with him. Banneker amazed everyone by redrawing the missing maps from memory! From 1791 to 1796 he made astronomical and tide calculations for a yearly almanac. Known as \"the sable genius,\" Banneker became a symbol for racial justice in a land not yet ready to grant him rights of citizenship. Unwilling to pay this bribe, the Ameri- cans broke off negotiations. Because their reports labeled Talleyrand's agents as X, Y, and Z, this situation came to be known as the XYZ Affair, and it produced an out- , burst of popular anger against France. Adams was cheered in Congress when he declared that he would never send another minister without France assuring its respect to \"the representative of a great, free, powerful, and independent nation.\" The slogan of the day became: \"Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute.\" Congress created a Department ot the Navy in May 1798, and soon warships and privateers were waging an undeclared naval war with France. War fever suited Federalist party leaders. The national emergency strengthened the federal government, made the Federalists popular, and discredited the pro-French Republicans. If war continued. Federalists expected to win reelection in 1800. But President Adams refused to let election pol- iticking dominate American foreign policy. When Talleyrand changed his mind and was willing to receive American diplomats, Adams sent to the Senate a nomination for an American minister to France. Federalist senators were fijrious, but they coiild not long oppose an efifort to make peace. By the end of Adams's presidency, peace with France had been restored. Adams's action in making peace against the wishes of most of his party was an extremely courageous act. Proud of his nonpartisan accomplishment, Adams later wrote that he wished his gravestone to be inscribed, \"Here lies John Adams who took upon himself the responsibility of the peace with France in the year 1800.\" Partisan Legislation Many Federalists were convinced that prominent Republicans were actively in league with France \"to burn all our cities and cut the throats of all our inhabitants,\" as one Federalist newspaper reported it. So in 1798, in the midst ol war fever, the Federalist majority in Congress pushed through three laws designed to hurt the Republican party — a Naturalization Act, an Alien Act, and a Sedition Act. 248 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1 789- 1 824"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Many French and Irish refugees had recently come to America. Because they were anti-British, most supported the Republican party. The Naturalization Act tried to weaken this Republican strength by extending the residency requirement for citizenship from 5 to 14 years. The Alien Act reflected an almost hysterical fear that French agents were using Repub- licans as dupes. It required all immigrants to register with the federal government and allowed the President to deport with- out trial any alien whom he considered \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States.\" The Sedition Act attempt- ed to muzzle the Republican press by making it a crime to speak or publish any- thing false or malicious against the federal government or any of its officers. Both Adams and Hamilton had warned fellow Federalists against abusing their power. Instead of weakening the Republi- can party, Federalists — through these laws — gave Republicans the issues that broadened their public support. Republi- cans were horrified by the Federalist attack on the Bill of Rights, which gtiar- anteed freedom ot speech and press. In 1798 and 1799, the Republican legisla- tures of Kentucky and Virginia passed res- olutions, secretly written by Jefferson and Madison, denouncing the Sedition Act as unconstitutional. The Kentucky Resolu- tions are especially important because they first presented the theory of nullifi- cation. According to this theory, the Con- stitution was an agreement among the states to establish a central government. If an act of this government exceeded the powers given it in the Constitution, a state had the right to refuse to obey. The nullification theory was denounced by other state legislatures as threatening to the Union.

They transformed a Constitution on parchment into a workable instrument of government. They opened the West for settlement and made it pos- sible for western farmers to get their produce safely to market. They established the reputation and power of the United States among other nations of the world. They created a sound economic and financial system. Much of their success was due to the character of George Washington, the genius of Alexander Hamil- ton, and the integrity of John Adams. As one historian said, they \"found America disunited, poor, insolvent, weak, discontented, and wretched. It hath left her united, wealthy, respectable, strong, happy, and pros- perous.\" But by 1800 their usefulness was over.

Some differences, such as Hamilton's and Jef- ferson's, are now quite famous. In order to present a clear view of what actually happened hundreds of years ago, historians use historical reasoning to write their opinions and to support the stories they tell. Reasoning is the process by which one judgment is deduced from others that are given. This means that to support an argument (or in this case, to tell a story from history), certain techniques can be used to prove a point. When historians write about history, they often use certain words to connect the facts to other words that help the reader understand their meaning. The.se clue words point out the deductions they have made. The chart that follows lists four kinds of historical reasoning. By learning to recognize these four meth- ods, you can better determine for yourself whether or not an historian has supported his or her argument adequately. Four kinds of historical reasoning are: • Cause-aiid-cjfect reason ingcx'pXixns why things might have happened. • Analogies, or comparisons, show how ivvo things are alike or different. • Generalizations point out how one aspect of the story relates to the whole pictiue. • /Vr)r;/us(.'s spi'cifk flits or tkiails. KINDS OF HISTORICAL REASONING KIND CLUE WORDS Cause and Effect led to, brought on, resulted in Example: The ratification of the Constitution in 1788 resulted in a new framework for government. Analogies like, as, similar to, different from Example: Westerners tended, lil<e Jefferson, to believe in common people. Generalizations some, most, all, few Example: Most people were opposed to the Jay Treaty. Proof for example, this statement shows Example; Washington made it clear that he wanted to retire after his first term. For example, he pointed out that he would rather dig ditches than continue.

For the first time, the Federalist party was not in power. Its political philosophy of rule by \"the good, the wise, and the rich\" was considered outdated. The growing demo- cratic spirit of the nation found its expression in the Republican party. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Compare the views of the Federalist and Republican parties on economy, democracy, and the role of government. • Explain Thomas Jefferson's views on government. During his vice-presidency under John Adams, Thomas Jefilerson became the active leader of the Republican party. He was in an ideal situation for the task — at the center of the government, and yet his job as Vice President carried with it very few official duties. Through personal contact with members of Con- gress and through thousands of letters, he kept in touch with Republicans all over the country. Above all, however, Jefferson spread his views and ideas through newspapers. He once said that if he had to choose between government without newspapers or news- papers without a government, he would choose the latter. Jefferson raised money to start dozens of Republican newspapers, and these newspapers were a tremendous force in turning public opinion toward the Republican viewpoint. The Election of 1800 As the presidential election of 1800 approached, the Federalists selected John Adams and Charles Pinckney as their can- didates; the Republicans, Jefferson and Aaron Burr. During the campaign, Jeffer- son suggested that his followers concen- trate their fire on the Sedition Act and heavier taxes brought on by the unde- clared war with France. The Federalists countered by predicting that Jefferson would cancel the public debt and abolish the navy. Speakers for both parties made deceitful charges. Republicans pictured Adams as a tyrant who wanted to be king. Federalists, on the other hand, portrayed Jefferson as a drunkard, an atheist, and a French agent. One of the leading Federal- ist newspapers. The Hartford Courant, voiced the opinion that: Mr. fefferson has long felt a spirit of deadly hostility against the Federal Constitution. . . . If he should be elected President, the Constitution will inevitably fall. . . . The result will be dreadful to the people of the United States. Realizing that lack of support in all the states north of Pennsylvania had cost them the election in 1796, the Republicans worked hard in 1800 to gain the backing of laborers and recent immigrants in northeastern cities. The contest was close; so close that the voters in the state of New York would ultimately determine which party would win the election. Here the 254 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1789-1824"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Republicans had a stroke of good fortune. Aaron Burr's organization was so effective in getting out the vote in New York City that the Republicans carried every district in the city. That victory gave them the state and, with it, the national election. The election results posed a new ques- tion: the Republicans had won but which Republican candidate became President? There was no doubt that the party had intended Jefferson as President and Burr Vice President. But unlike today's election practices, candidates in 1 800 were not des- ignated as the candidate tor President or the candidate tor Vice President. Because every Republican elector had two votes and voted separately tor both Jefferson and Burr, each candidate received 73 electoral votes. In such a situation where there was no majority, the Constitution stipulates that the House of Representatives selects the President. A group of die-hard Federal- ists schemed to deny Jefterson the presi- dency and elect Burr — and came close to doing just that. The House was so evenly divided that it took 6 days and 36 ballots to reach a decision. The deadlock was bro- ken only after a group of Federalists led by Hamilton threw their support to Jefferson because they considered him better suited for the job and abler than Burr. Although the Federalists were unhappy at losing the presidency, they accepted it and surrendered control of the federal government. This marked the first time in modern history that the political control of a country had been transferred through a democratic election. Despite animosity between Federalists and Republicans, the party system was beginning to work for the nation. The political parties that Washington had feared and warned against had developed national organiza- tions that selected competent candidates tor public office, maintained communica- tions between federal otficials and their constituents, and dealt ettectively with tactional and sectional differences. Although the election of 1800 marked the end ot the Federalist party as a viable political force, the party had made some lasting and important contributions.

This description only begins to list Jef- ferson's skills and accomplishments. Jeffer- son's interest in agriculture led him to import hundreds ol foreign plants into this country and to send hundreds of American plants abroad. One ot the finest architects of his day, Jefferson designed his own home, Monticello, and was the chief architect of the Virginia Capitol and a complex of buildings for the University of Virginia. His many inventions included an improved plow, a swivel chair, and a folding carriage top. A lover of English, French, and classical literature, he collect- ed a library that eventually became the nucleus of the Library of Congress. In appearance and manner, Jefferson had little of Washington's dignity. He deliberately tried to reduce the ceremony surrounding the office of President because he felt both Washington and Adams had acted too much like British royalty. For example, instead of riding in a coach, Jefferson chose to walk the 200 yards from the boarding house to his inauguration. He also sent written mes- sages to Congress instead of appearing in person, beginning a custom that lasted more than a century. Visitors from other countries were amazed to see him riding through the dusty streets of Washington on horseback, dressed in faded corduroy overalls, with a bag of clover seed in front of the saddle. A British diplomat described Jefferson as having the appear- ance of a \"tall, large-boned farmer. \" J efferson and Government Jefferson brought both a political and a philosophical change to the presidency. He believed the people were the source of a government's power, an idea he expressed in his Inaugural Address. In rel- atively few words, Jefferson explained his theory of government. Pleading for national harmony after the bitter election, Jefferson said: Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists. By this he meant that despite their dis- trust of democracy. Federalists recognized the principle that problems are finally set- tled by the will of the people, and that despite their distrust of centralized power, the Republicans did not propose to destroy the federal government. Jefferson addressed three issues in his address that he considered to be of great importance. First, there was the question of what to do with persons who wished to dissolve the Union or change its republi- can form. Should these persons be jailed or exiled? Or should they be forced to reg- ister with the police as the Alien and Sedi- tion Acts had required? There was genuine and widespread fear of disloyalty 256 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1789-1824"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"and foreign influence, but Jeff^erson had such a strong beUef in human treedom and such faith in human reason that he refused to be alarmed. He recommended letting those who wish to alter or destroy the Union \"stand undisturbed as monu- ments of the safety with which error ot opinion may be tolerated. \" Jefferson also addressed whether or not a government by the people would be strong enough to meet crises. The federal govern- ment lacked a strong police system and a large standing army, and many Americans feared the government was too weak to last. Jefferson said that he thought it was, on the contrary, the strongest in the world because each citizen had a personal interest in fighting to keep it free. Finally, Jefferson addressed the question of the ability of human beings to govern themselves. Jefferson turned the question around by asking who was good enough to govern someone else. He asked if peo- ple \"had found angels in the form of kings to govern?\" King in Jefferson's time meant dictator. Jefferson described what he thought were the principles of \"wise and frugal government.\" In contrast to Hamilton's idea that the federal government should actively promote banking, commerce, and industry, Jefferson advocated his belief in a \"hands-off\" policy called laissez-faire, meaning literally, \"let people do as they choose.\" Governments adhering to laissez- faire should not control the way people do business or farm but should keep its role to restraining people from injuring each other and allowing them to be \"free to regulate their own pursuits. \" Jefferson's views on democracy and indi- vidual freedom quieted the fears of the Federalists. He called for \"the preservation of the General Government in its whole constitutional vigor,\" which surely did not suggest his earlier theory of nullification presented in the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions of 1798 and 1799. He also spoke of \"the honest payment of our debts.\" This came as a great relict to own- ers of federal bonds who feared that, as an opponent of 1 lamilton's financial policies, letferson would prevent repayment to the bondholders. UBW Section One Review UHM »» Summary The election of 1 800 officially marked the end of the Federalists in power. Jeffer- son brought to the presidency a different set of political values. His interests in agri- culture, architecture, inventions, and liter- ature contributed further to changing values in government. In his address to the nation, Jefferson described his views on the principles of government, democ- racy, and individual freedom. Jefferson regarded the election of 1800 as a \"revolu- tion, \" in the sense that, with the defeat of the Federalists, people who did not trust democracy were replaced by those who believed strongly in democracy.

They began to de- mand a greater role in pub- lic life and seek more edu- cation for themselves. An organized movement for women's rights, with a sub- stantial number ot sup- porters however, did not begin until the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848. Prior to this a few public leaders attempted to both satisfy these women and to contain them at the same time. For example, Mas- sachusetts minister Thomas Bernard urged women to stay in their \"sphere,\" where, as mothers, they wielded \"extensive power over the fortunes of man in every generation.\" The following letter shows a young woman trying to make sense of the contradictory doc- trines of temale subordination and sexual equality.

Jefterson realized that his primary task was to unite the nation and prove that he would represent not only the members ol his party but all Americans. Partly for this reason, Jeffer- son left intact many Federalist programs. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Compare similarities and differences between Jefferson's administration and those of Washington and Adams. • Discuss the significance of judicial review. Jefferson liked to speak of his elec- tion in 1800 as a \"revolution.\" Perhaps it was a revolution in the sense that leaders who distrusted democracy were replaced by those who believed in it; but it was surely one of the mildest revolutions ever. Not t)nly was there no violence, bur surprisingly few laws passed by the Federalists were repealed. I he Alien and Sedition Acts had expired and were not renewed; the waiting period necessary lor immigrants to become American citizens was reduced from 14 years to 5; and the excise tax on whiskey was abolished. The major fea- tures of Hamilton's financial program — the Bank of the United States, the Funding Act, and the assumption of state debts — remained untouched. Jefferson the Leader Once in office. President Jefferson and the other Republican leaders found they had to modify their views on governing. Before he became President, Jefferson argued that the executive branch held too much power. In his Inaugural Address, he hinted that he would allow Congress to guide policy. As President, Jefferson reduced the outward signs of his authority and made gestures toward giving Congress more control over day-to-day affairs of government. He soon found, however, that he had to provide strong leadership or watch his parry divide into factions. For this reason Jefferson used his posi- tion as party leader to influence legislation. By working with Republican leaders in Congress and by giving his supporters key positions, Jefferson became just as much chief legislator as Washington had been. The congressional elections of 1800 gave the Republicans solid majorities in both the House and Senate, putting them in the position to repeal any Federalist legislation they disliked. The only change Examining Illustrations Some Federalists feared that the Jeffer- son administration would reverse every Federalist policy and possibly destroy the young government.

Whether rich or poor, urban or rural. Americans measured their activity pri- marily in days, months, and sea- sons — not in hours or minutes. they attempted to make, however, was to cut back the power of the federal judiciary and remove some federal judges from office. Republicans feared the judiciary for three reasons. One was that federal judges, holding their positions \"during good behavior,\" or life, were beyond the control of the people. Another was that federal courts had declared several state laws unconstitutional, thereby strengthening the power ol the federal government while reducing that of the states. Finally, Feder- alists had \"packed\" the judiciary during their last month in office. The number of federal judges was increased by the Judi- ciary Act of 1801, and Adams promptly filled several positions with members of Most families in the early 1800s could afford neither clocks nor watches. Although accu- rate clocks existed, the few timepieces within a com- munity often told different times. People used the posi- tion of the sun during the various seasons to estimate time during the day and to determine when they slept and rose from bed. Church bells tolled to announce worship services and town meetings, not the hour of the day. The routine of daily life moved at a differ- ent pace without standardized time. Nature, for example, arranged the farmer's schedule. Farm families planted, cultivated, and harvested their crops according to the cycle of the seasons. Weather patterns influ- enced when families could set out for town or market — by wagon, over dirt roads — or when visitors were likely to arrive. A storm could easily upset plans by turning the roads to mud. his party. These new judges were known as \"midnight judges\" because Adams sup- posedly signed appointments until mid- night of his last day in office. One of the first acts of Congress after Jefferson took office was to repeal the Judiciary Act of 1801. After doing away with the \"midnight judges\" by abolishing their offices, the Republicans tried to remove other Federalists from the judicia- ry by impeachment. In 1804 a Federalist district judge named John Pickering was impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate for actions that indicated he was mentally unstable. The House then impeached Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase, who had attacked democracy in general and Jefferson in particular while addressing a Baltimore jury. The Senate, however, refused to convict Chase because it was not convinced that he had been ptoven guilty of \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" Judicial Review In 1801, shortly before leaving office, President Adams appointed John Marshall Chief Justice of the United States. Mar- shall was an ardent Federalist and detested his cousin and fellow Virginian, Thomas Jefferson. In Marhury v. Madison (1803), one of the first cases to come before him, Marshall greatly strengthened the power of the federal judiciary. In his decision he claimed that the federal courts had the power of judicial review over acts of Congress — that is, the power to decide whether or not laws passed by Congress were constitutional. When James Madison took over as sec- retary of state in the Jefferson administra- tion, he fotmd on his desk the commissions of a number of justices of the peace for the new District of Columbia. President Adams had signed the commissions, but they had not been delivered, and Jefferson instructed Madi- son to withhold the commissions. One of the appointees, William Marbury, peti- tioned the Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus — a court order requiring spe- cific action — instructing Madison to give him his commission. 260 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1789-1824"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"The Supreme Court was faced with a difficuh decision. If it ruled that Marbury was entitled to be a judge and issued a writ, Jefferson and Madison could simply ignore it, diminishing the power and pres- tige of the Court. It the Court did not issue a writ, the Republicans would win by default. Marshall came up with a brilliant solution. Acknowledging that Marbury had a legal right to his commission, Mar- shall argued that the Supreme Court could not issue the writ because the Constitution specifically listed the cases in which the Court had original jurisdiction. The writ of mandamus was not among them. In attempting to extend the Court's original jurisdiction to issue writs, the Judiciary Act of 1789 was in direct conflict with the Constitution, so the law was void. Marshall went on to say that the Con- stitution was the supreme law of the land. It could not be changed at the whim of the legislative branch. By this decision Marshall had neatly sidestepped his politi- cal dilemma. He gave the Republicans the final result they sought by not issuing the writ. He even limited the original jurisdic- tion of the Court. Far more importantly, however, he managed to lay down the very cornerstone of the Supreme Court's power, judicial review, the authority to interpret the Constitution, which gives the judicial branch a \"check ol the legisla- tive branch\" in the system ol checks and balances. Aside from this setback, Jefferson viewed his first term as tranquil and a suc- cess. War had broken out in Europe, but its first effect in the United States was to increase foreign trade. Taxes had been reduced, and the income of the federal government from tariffs was sufficient to pay everyday expenses and reduce the national debt. Nearly everything that had happened during President Jefferson's first term added to the popularity of the Republican party, and Jefferson's reelec- tion was a foregone conclusion. Runtiing against Charles Pinckney of South Caroli- na, Jefferson received 162 of 176 electoral votes. The prt)spccts for continuing what he had started looked good, but |efferson's second term was to be far less successdil than his first. Section Two Review Summary Jefferson viewed his first term as tran- quil and successful. Like Washington, he became a chief legislator, but his attempt to limit the judiciary failed. Not only did Chief Justice John Marshall establish the principle of judicial review in Marbury v. Madison., but he also confirmed the judi- ciary as the third great branch of govern- ment and gave the judiciary a check in the system of checks and balances. From that point on, the judicial branch, with the power and authority to interpret the Con- stitution, was provided with a veto over federal laws. Checking For Understanding 1.

Yet the decision to make the purchase was not an easy one. Committed to interpreting the Constitution in its strictest sense, Jeffer- son doubted that he possessed the power to make the purchase. On the other hand, the opportunity to gain the land west of the Mississippi River might never come again. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the significance of the Louisiana Purchase. • Identify the reasons why unrest between native Americans and the American government was increasing. Napoleon increased France's power in Europe and planned to create a new French empire in North America. Jefferson was alarmed at the prospect of New Orleans being in French hands. The city was a major trade center for the Unit- ed States, especially as a market for west- ern goods. Jefferson feared that the French might close New Orleans to American trade, thus blocking the development of the American West. He wrote Robert Liv- ingston, United States minister stationed in Paris, that: The news that Spain had ceded Louisiana, including New Or- leans, to France in 1800 was of great concern to the United States. The French were now ruled by Napoleon Bonaparte, whose conquests kept Europe in turmoil for many years. . . . there is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our national and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans, through which the produce of three-eighths of our territory must pass to market. Jefferson feared that French control of New Orleans meant that the United States would have to \"marry\" itself to the British navy for protection. Before allying with Britain, however, Jefferson autho- rized Livingston to offer France $10 mil- lion for New Orleans and West Florida and sent James Monroe as a special envoy to Paris to negotiate the purchase. The Louisiana Purchase It is unlikely that American arguments, threats, or dollars would have moved Napoleon if his plans for a French empire had not suffered a great defeat in the most valuable of France's American colonies, Sainte Domingue (Haiti). During the 1700s, its exports of sugar, indigo, coffee, and cotton were almost equal in value to the combined exports of the 13 colonies. In 1791 its enslaved blacks rebelled. Under the leadership of a remarkable gen- eral, Pierre Toussaint L'Ouverture, (TOO sahn LOO vehr tyoor) \"the black Napoleon,\" Haitian blacks attempted to make their island an independent state. In 1801 Napoleon sent soldiers to put down the Haitian revolt. Toussaint 262 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1 789- 1 824"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"L'Ouverture organized such effective resis- tance that the French expedition failed, although he himself was captured. The disaster was so complete — the French lost almost all their troops to battle and yellow fever — that Napoleon was forced to aban- don his American ambitions. Meanwhile, Livingston had been urging the French to sell New Orleans. In April 1803, Talleyrand, the French foreign min- ister, asked Livingston how much the United States would give for the entire Louisiana Territory. Livingston, who had been joined by James Monroe, took only a few days to reach an agreement by which the United States was to pay about $15 million for the territory — about 4 cents an acre. When news of the French offer reached the United States, Jefferson was torn between a desire to extend the boundaries of the United States west of the Mississip- pi River and concern over whether the federal government had the legal power to acquire foreign territory. Since the Consti- tution does not specifically grant this power, he wanted a constitutional amend- ment to assure that the sale was legal. Liv- ingston warned the President and the Senate, which must approve all treaties, that Napoleon might change his mind. Jefferson asked the Senate to ratify the treaty and the Senate gave its consent, despite opposition from New England Federalists. Although this action did not follow Jefilerson's belief in strict construc- tion oi the Constitution, he justified the acquisition on the grounds that it was part of the Presidents implied powers to protect the nation. The Louisiana Pur- chase doubled the size of the United States and opened the way for westward expansion by removing the threat of French interference. Lewis and Clark Very little was known about the area west of the Mississippi, and ii excited |eL ferson's curiosity. He sent an expedition led by two otficers in ihe U.S. Army, Meri- wether Lewis and Willi.un ('lark, up the Missouri River (o explore the new territory. Ihe expedition was the first scientific project to receive federal fiinds, and Jeffer- son himself drew up their instructions. He told Lewis and Clark to find the sources of the Missouri River, to try to find a usable route across the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, and to observe the customs of the Indians they met. They were also instructed to carefiilly note features of the land, the weather, and the plants and ani- mals they saw. The expedition left St. Louis in May 1804. It returned over two years later with its mission accomplished, having sur- mounted hardships ranging from \"ticks and musquiters\" to near-starvation and floods. Among the members of the expedition was York, a black slave. York's skills in hunting and fishing made him a valuable member of the expedition. He was partic- ularly successful in making friends with the Indians they met along the way. Saca- jawea (sak uh juh WAY uh), a Shoshone woman, and her French-Canadian hus- band later joined the patty as interpreters and guides. Her role was important because Lewis and Clark wanted to build peaceful relations with the Indian peoples living in the newly acquired territory. The Lewis and Clark expedition added immensely to the knowledge of the huge area that had been purchased. It also helped the LJnited States lay claim to the northern region between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean known as Oiegon. Within a few years, fur traders based in St. Louis were traveling to the Rockies, and by 1812 there were about 70,000 people living in the southern sec- tion of the Louisiana Territory. Burr's Conspiracies The Louisiana Purchase troubled die- hard Federalists in the Northeast. I hey feared that westward expansion would weaken New F'ngland's power in national affairs and would subordinate its commer- cial interests to the agricultural interests of the South and West. A group of Federal- ists drafted a plan to take New F'ngland out of the L'nion and form a northern confederacy. The plotters realized that, if the confederacy were to last, it had to Linking Across Time The French in North America Rivalry between Britain and France for domination of North America and Europe helped the young United States. France, fol- lowing the loss of its North Ameri- can empire in the French and Indian War, was anxious to aid the 1 3 colonies in their struggle against Britain. Later, after France took Louisiana from Spain, the young United States acquired this vast inland domain. In 1803, following the defeat of French troops in Haiti, Napoleon sold Louisiana, partially to prevent the British from CllAI'll l; <S |l I 1 1 KSON AND nil' RM'I'BI icans 263"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"include New York as well as New En- gland. They found an ally in Aaron Burr, who was willing to desert the Republican party and run for governor of New York on the Federalist ticket in 1804. The plan went awry, however, when Burr was soundly defeated, in large part, because Alexander Hamilton, who had worked to prevent Burr's election to the presidency in 1800, campaigned against him. When Hamilton continued after the election to criticize his integrity, Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel. Even though Hamilton had a wife and young children, was burdened with debts, and his eldest son had recently been killed in a duel, he accepted the challenge. On a July morning in 1804, Hamilton, Burr, their assistants, and a physician rowed across the Hudson River to a rock shelf at the foot of the Palisades. At the signal Burr, an excellent shot, fired a bullet into Hamilton's body. Hamilton died the next day. When a New York coroner's jury indicted Burr for murder, he escaped from New York but not from his troubles. He headed west and took part in arranging a conspiracy. Sometimes Burr talked of secession of the western territo- ries, sometimes of the conquest of Mexi- co — with himself as emperor. Whatever Burr's final goal, he collected arms, bought flatboats on the Ohio River, and floated down toward New Orleans with between 80 and 100 followers.

At the trial, Chief Justice Marshall, following the Constitution's provisions regarding the rights of a person accused ot treason, insisted that the prosecution produce two witnesses to an \"overt act \" on Burr's part. Because there were no trustworthy wit- nesses against him, Burr was acquitted and went into exile. Conflict -with the Indians During both Jefferson's administration and James Madison's that followed, set- tlers, hunters, and land speculators pres- sured hard on the Indians. Jefferson, himself, favored moving the Indians who lived east of the Mississippi River to imoc- cupied lands in the Louisiana Territory. He insisted that the Chickasaw and Cherokee nations give up their lands in Alabama and Georgia and move to wh.u is now Arkansas. North of the Ohio River, the Treaty of Greenville had not satisfied the pioneers' desire tor land. By persuasion, force, and fraud, native Americans were forced to give up more and more land. In spite of treaty promises that were to last \"as long as the sun shall climb the heavens or the waters shall run in the streams, \" white set- tlers persisted in moving into Indian land. William Henry Harrison, governor of the Indiana Territory, has been described as \"the most talented American at depriving the native Americans from their ancestral lands.\" In the 15 treaties he negotiated, Indians gave up nearly all of present-day Indiana and Illinois. During these difficidt times, a remark- able leader named Tecumseh (Tuh KUM suh) became chief of the Shawnees.

In 1811 Har- rison launched a war against Tecumseh's followers, knowing that the great Indian leader had journeyed south to persuade Indian communities to join the confeder- ation. Harrison became a national hero after leading American troops in battle at Tippecanoe near what is today West Lafayette, Indiana.

Section Three Revie'w TITITIIIHIflllllf Summary Jefferson went against his own political philosophy of strict construction of the Constitution and limited executive power when he approved the Louisiana Pur- chase — the greatest achievement of his presidency. This acquisition, along with vast amounts of territory in the South and Midwest ceded by the Indians, paved the way for extensive frontier expansion, while the expedition of Lewis and Clark added to the nation's knowledge of the North American continent.

Yet the United States and Europe had grown economically depen- dent upon each other. When Britain and France tried to manipulate trade with the United States as a weapon against the other, the United States sought ways to fight back.

Jefferson hopcti that \"nature and a wide ocean\" would keep the United States entirely isolated from Euro- pean rivalries. \"Peace,\" he wrote lo an English liieiul, \"is out passion.\" As his Federalist ociponents had forecasted years before, Jellerson prt)posed to do away with the navy and entrust the defense of the United States to militia instead of a standing army. For the United States to remain unarmed, however, proved impossible. The first threat to peace came not from one of the great powers of Europe, but from Tripoli (part of present-day Libya), a small country on the north coast of Africa. Piracy, or preying on ships at sea, was a principal business of Iripoli and the other Barbary Coast states of Morocco, Algiers, and Tunis. The ships of countries that did not pay tribute to the Barbary states were likely to be captured and their sailors enslaved. Between 1789 and 1801, the United States paid over $1 million in tribute. At the time of the XYZ Affair, when Americans were chanting \"Millions fof defense, but not one cent for tribute,\" a United States warship was on its way to Algiers carrying 26 barrels of silver dollars to pay the pirates for \"protection.\" Despite his desire for peace, Jefferson was determined that the United States would not be robbed by the Barbary pirates. Consequently, he carried on a four-year war with Tripoli. The American navy eventually had 14 ships stationed in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1805 the American counsel in Egypt, William Eaton, put together a small force of American, Greek, and Arab mercenar- ies. Crossing 500 miles of the desolate Sahara, they invaded and captured a small fort in Tripoli. The ruler of Tripoli made peace after receiving a ransom of $60,000 for captured American sailors. For a time, this discouraged the other Barbary Coast states from asking for additional tribute. But in 1807, after President Jefferson withdrew the American navy, attacks on American ships started again. The piracy of the Barbary states did not end until 1815, when an American fieet of ships under Stephen Decatur, joined by war- ships of European nations, once and for all, put an end to the practice.

Napoleon issued the Berlin and Milan decrees, which forbade any country under French control to import British goods or to allow British ships to enter its harbors. Neutral ships bringing British goods, stopping at British ports, or even submitting to search by British naval ves- sels, were to be seized. Great Britain answered the Napoleonic decrees with the Orders in Council, which were directed mainly at the United States. British traders were already alarmed at the increase in the United States' merchant marine. If American ships now took over the trade with Europe forbidden to the British by Napoleon, the United States might replace Britain as the greatest trading nation in the world. Therefore, the Orders in Council of 1807 forbade neu- tral ships to trade with Europe unless they stopped in Britain first. If enforced, the Napoleonic decrees and the Orders in Council might have ended American trade with Europe. An Ameri- can ship that entered a British harbor was likely to be seized by the French after- ward; if it sailed directly to Europe, it was likely to be seized by the British on its way home. British warships cruised out- side American harbors to search ships and learn their destinations. French officials confiscated hundreds of United States' ships in European ports. Neither blockade was complete, and the profits made from successful evasion were so great that the merchant marine prospered. Even more distressing than the attempt to cut off the United States' trade was the British practice of taking sailors from American ships. Discipline in the British navy was so strict and the pay so low that it was impossible to get enough volun- teers. For centuries Britain had secured sailors by a legalized form of kidnapping known as impressment. Sailors were impressed in port and taken off merchant ships at sea. British sailors frequently deserted and signed on American vessels, where the conditions and pay were better. Sometimes a British warship calling in an American port found it difficult to sail away because so many of the crew desert- ed. To combat this problem, Britain 268 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1789-1824"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"claimed the right to stop American ships, search for former British subjects, and force them back into service. In June 1807, a United States' warship, the Chesapeake, was leaving the United States for the Mediterranean Sea when it was stopped by a British naval vessel, the Leopard. The commander ol the Leopard demanded that he be allowed to search the Chesapeake for British deserters. When he was refused, the British ship fired three broadsides at the Chesapeake, killing 3 and wounding 18. After the Chesapeake sur- rendered, the British boarded the ship and carried off 4 sailors. The attack on the Chesapeake aroused great anger, and American newspapers clamored for war. Jefferson, however, delayed calling Congress into session until tempers had time to cool. Although the President did not intend to let these actions by the British go unanswered, he sought a course of action other than war. Jefferson thought he had found a substi- tute for war in the use of an economic boycott. Jefferson reasoned that both Britain and France were so dependent upon American goods that if the United States cut off trade with them, they would stop violating the nations neutral rights. With the President's urging. Congress passed the Embargo Act in December 1807, forbidding United States' ships to sail for foreign ports anywhere in the world. The Embargo Act caused some suller- ing in Britain, hurt France very little, but was nothing short of disastrous for the United States. Stores of wheat, cotton, and tobacco piled up on wharves. Thou- sands of sailors were put out of work. Ships rotted at the docks. Exports fell from $198 million in 1807 to $22 million in 1808. Imports fell from $138 million to $55 million. Seldom has a law been so bitterly resist- ed. Merchant ships made secret runs to European ports. Smuggling between the northeastern states and Canada grew by leaps and boLuids. To stop violations of the embargo, |efferson stationed militia along the (\".an.tdian border ,iik1 permitted officials to seaich for smuggled goods without proper warrants. Ironically, President Jefferson was accused of using his great power at the expense of the Bill of Rights, which he himself had champi- oned years before as a check against tyranny. Drifting Into War After two terms, Jefferson was glad to retire to Monticello. During his tenure he had often been compelled to violate prin- ciples he held dear, such as individual freedom and limited federal power, for the good of the country as a whole. In the epitaph he wrote for himself, Jefferson asked to be remembered only as the author of the Declaration of Indepen- dence and the Virginia Bill for Religious Freedom and founder of the University of Virginia. Jefferson used his influence to secure the nomination of his close friend and secretary of state, James Madison.

British attempts to control colonial trade had sparked the Revolution and led to Ameri- can independence. Now, in the early 1800s, Britain and France were at war. Each tried to weaken the other by cutting its trade with the United States. How could the nation maintain free trade with both countries while those two great European powers were at war? Jefferson's answer was strict neutrality. election oi 1808, Madison easily defeated the Federalist candidate, Charles Pinck- ney. This was in spite of the fact that, because of opposition to the Embargo Act, all oi New England except Vermont went Federalist. Even betore Jefferson left office in March 1809, Congress had repealed the unpopular Embargo Act. This measure was replaced by another, the Non-Inter- course Act, which banned trade with ports under British or French control but allowed trade with the rest of the world. Although less harmful to American trade than the Embargo Act, the Non-Inter- course Act was no more successful in forc- ing France and Britain to respect the rights ot the United States. In May 1810, Congress tried another tactic and passed Macon's Bill No. 2, which stated that, if either France or Britain agreed to respect neutral rights, the United States would cut off trade with the other nation. In August Napoleon responded with offers to remove his decrees. Not even waiting for the actual repeal ot the French decrees, Madison cut off trade with Great Britain, effective March 2, 1811. Napoleon revealed how insincere his offer was when the French navy continued to seize American ships. Although neither Britain nor the Unit- ed States really wanted war, their actions steered them in that direction. In May 1811, an American ship attacked a British warship. Americans saw it as revenge for the British attack on the Chesapeake. Some young members of Congress, most of them Republicans from the West and the South, called for an all-out con- frontation. Fiunger for land heightened this war fever. The Westerners were eager to take Canada while the Southerners wanted Spanish Florida. Alone, the War Hawks did not have enough votes in Congress to pass a decla- ration of war. But as more Americans became angry over British seizure of American sailors and ships, pressure to fight increased. Finally, the Republican majority in Congress decided that the United States must accept the risks of war rather than allow itself to be pushed arotmd. mmd Section Four Review Summary Foreign policy dominated Jefferson's second term in office. Barbary pirates were attacking American ships along the North African coast and demanding trib- ute. The United States was being forced into the hostility between England and France as both interfered with American shipping and impressed the nation's sailors. When an embargo proved ineffec- tive, a group of young Midwesterners in Congress began calling for war. Despite the fact that neither the United States nor Great Britain wanted war, conflict was on the horizon. Checking For Understanding 1.

Yet the war that some hailed as the \"Second War tor American Independence\" was not a pop- ular one, especially in New England. The fighting ended in 1814 with the Treaty of Ghent, but the agreement did nothing to settle the issues that had caused the war. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe the major campaigns of the War of 1812. • Summarize the results of the War of 1812 and the Treaty ol Ghent. The British government rejieaied the Orders in Council on hme 23, 1812. British harvests had been poor, and ihe British iles- perately needed grain hoin ihc United States. British manulactiners had bom- barded Parliament with pleas that they faced utter ruin unless trade with the United States was reestablished. The repeal came too late, however. The United States had declared war 4 days earlier. Declaring war against Great Britain did not suggest an alliance with France. A proposal to also include France in the dec- laration was defeated in the Senate by a vote of 18 to 14. The War in Canada General Andrew Jackson expressed a popular opinion when he predicted that the conquest of Canada by the United States would be a \"mere military prome- nade.\" There were indeed a number of reasons why an attack northward was fea- sible. Canada was sparsely populated, and the French Canadians were lukewarm toward their British rulers. The narrow strip of settlement running up the St. Lawrence River and north of Lake Ontario was so close to the United States that it was open to attack at all points. Montreal, the strategic center of Canada, was only 30 miles from New York State. Yet the conquest of Canada proved to be an exercise in frustration, mainly because the military forces ol the United States were almost totally unprepared. The regular army, numbering about 6,000 soldiers, was scattered throughout the frontier posts. The top commanders, vet- erans ol the Revolution, were too old lor warfare. There was no single commanding general and no overall plan ot how the war should be fought. To compensate lor the small size ol the army, Madison called on the states to ftir- nish militia. Some New England governors refused to supply any troops at all because they were opposed to \"Mr. Madison's War.\" Members of New York's militia refused to cross the Niagara River into Canada, maintaining that they had enlisted only to defend their state from invasion. The United States' lack ot preparation w.is immediately evident. Small bin ably led Canadian forces took Detroit and two forts on Lake Michigan. On the other li.uul, an American attack across the Ni- agara River was ttuned back. No serious attempt was made to take Montreal.

Commodore OUver Hazard Perry, having constructed a small fleet, won a brilliant victory over a British squadron and established Ameri- can control of Lake Erie. Perry's victory made possible an invasion of Canada by way of Detroit. A group of Kentucky vol- unteers under William Henry Harrison advanced into Canada and defeated a British army at the battle of the Thames, about 60 miles northeast of Detroit. In the East, however, incompetent com- manders failed dismally in attempted invasions of Canada from Sackett Harbor and Lake Champlain. DoLLEY Madison 1768-1849 Born in North Carolina, Dolley Payne grew up in Virginia until, at age 15, she moved with her parents to Philadelphia. There she married John Todd, Jr. Dolley Todd gave birth to two children, but in the yellow-fever epidemic in 1793, she lost one of her children and her husband. The following year Dolley Todd mar- ried James Madison. When James be- came secretary of state, Dolley served as unofficial first lady, entertaining White House guests of widower Thomas Jef- ferson. As official first lady from 1809 to 1817, Dolley was known for her elaborate parties — including the first inaugural ball. She also displayed re- markable bravery during the War of 1812. Packing up Gilbert Stuart's f.unous painting of George Washington and White House belongings, she con- veyed them safely out of town before the British burned the White House in 1814. During 1812 and 1813, the British, preoccupied with the war against France, had put little effort into the war against the United States. But when Napoleon was defeated and forced into exile in 1814, the British were free to strike hard at the United States. In late summer an army of more than 14,000 British veter- ans advanced southward from Montreal to invade New York. Blocking its way was an American army stationed at Plattsburg on Lake Champlain. Although outnumbered nearly 3 to 1 , American forces drove back the attacks, and the British retreated to Montreal. The northern border of the United States was safe. The British Offensive In 1814 the British sent two other expe- ditions into the United States — one to attack Washington and Baltimore; the other to take New Orleans. In August British transports landed an army of about 4,000 soldiers at Chesapeake Bay. It marched into the capital and very nearly captured Madison. To retaliate against the burning of public buildings in York (now Toronto) in 1813, the British burned the public buildings of Washington, destroy- ing the Capitol and the White House. From there the British proceeded to Balti- more but were turned back by the forces guarding the city. It was during the bom- bardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore harbor that Francis Scott Key wrote what became the national anthem, the \"Star- Spangled Banner.\" Unable to crack the defenses at Balti- more, the British army joined forces with the expedition attempting to capture New Orleans. The British, now almost 10,000 strong, reached the mouth of the Missis- sippi River in December 1814. Awaiting them were 4,500 Americans under the command of Andrew Jackson. His army consisted of regular soldiers and militia, with a few pirates recruited for their abili- ty to handle artillery. Jackson also called upon the free blacks of New Orleans to volunteer for service, promising them the same wages as the white soldiers. Two all- black battalions contributed to the Ameri- can victorv at New Orleans. 272 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1789-1824"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"When the final British attack came on January 8, 1815, American lorces were shekered behind a barricade of cotton bales. The British, advancing in the open, were no match for Jackson's well-protect- ed soldiers. More than 2,000 soldiers were killed or wounded before the British sur- rendered. However, the battle of New Orleans, the greatest American victory of the war, was a useless slaughter. News traveled slowly in those days and it was learned only after the battle that a peace treaty had been signed in Europe two weeks earlier. The War at Sea At the beginning of the war, the pitifully small navy of the United States appeared to be no match for the British fleet. Only four small ships plus a few small gunboats for coastal defense were built during the administrations of Jefferson and Madison. During John Adamss administration, how- ever, half a dozen excellent frigates — medi- um-sized warships — had been built. These frigates had more firepower than any Euro- pean ships of the same size and were speedy enough to escape from larger warships. When war broke out, the frigates put to sea and within a few months had won a series of victories in battles with British vessels. The victories had little effect on Britain, however, since its navy outnum- bered that of the United States at least 20 to 1. Still, Britain had ruled the sea so long that even a few defeats to the United States came as a shock to British leaders.

In addition to the frigates, the United States sent more than 500 privateers to sea. They captured more than 1 ,300 Brit- ish vessels, some within sight oi Britain. As the war went on, however, American victories at sea grew fewer and fewer. With overwhelmingly superior numbers, the British fleet was able to blockade the entire Atlantic coast from Boston to Savannah. United States trade with other countries virtually ceased, and the United States' navy, bottled up in port, never again enjoyed its early successes. The War's End As the war dragged on, opposition grew. Nowhere was opposition stronger than in New England where people balked at buy- ing United States bonds issued to cover the cost of the war and held public meetings to protest the conflict. New Englanders believed that no navy was strong enough to protect them and disliked fighting on the same side as \"the monster\" Napoleon. 274 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1789-1824"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Above all, they foresaw that the war would be damaging, even ruinous to their economies: About three fourths of our townsmen depend on the sea for the means of subsistence for themselves and their famihes.

In December 1814, delegates Irom the New England states met in secret sessions at Hartford, Connecticut, to recommend action. The Hartford Convention did not insist that New England leave the Union, but it did demand seven constitutional amendments to increase the region's polit- ical power. The Convention insisted that southern states no longer be allowed to count three-fifths of their slaves in deter- mining representation in Congress. More- over, it urged a two-thirds vote of Congress for admitting new states and for declaring war. The Hartford Convention sent commis- sioners to present its demands to President Madison and Congress. Their arrival in the capital coincided with the news of the victory at New Orleans and the signing of the treaty ending the war. Amidst the great celebrations, the commissioners had no choice but to return to their homes. Almost from the moment the ^X^lr of 1812 began, both sides tried to end it.

Together, the lines form a sort of imaginary grid on the earth. Latitude lines, also called parallels, run east and west on the grid. The equator is at 0° latitude and is at the midpoint between the North and South poles. Latitude lines are measured in degrees north and south of the equator. Places north of the equator, from 0° to 90°N, are said to be located in the north- ern latitudes, and places south of the equator, from 0° to 90°S, in the southern latitudes. Longitude lines, also called meridians, are the lines of the global grid that run north and south. Ihey are numbered based on how lar east or west they are of the prime, or first, meridian that runs through Green- wich, England. Meridians are numbered from 0° at the Prime Meridian to IHO'^E and 180°W. Areas of the globe east of the Prime Meridian are east longitude. Areas west of the Prime Meridian arc west longitude. The meridians meet at the International [\")ate Line in I he Pacific Ocean. Example Geographers use lines of lalilude and longitude to locate places on Earth's surface. The degrees at which the latitude and longitude lines meet is the exact location of that place. For example, to describe the exact location of a city, geographers would first find on the map the line of latitude nearest to the city. Then they would follow this line until it intersects the nearest line of longitude. The latitude and longitude coordinates together provide the city's exact location. On the map of the Barbary States, the exact location of Tripoli is 32°N and 13°E. Besides exact location, places also have relative location. Relative location is indicated by using the cardinal directions — north, south, east, and west — as well as the intermediate directions — northeast, south- east, northwest, and southwest — to describe the loca- tion of one place in relation to another. For example, Tripoli is located west of the city of Derna and south- east of Algiers. The use of latitude and longitude can also be helpful in determining the relative location of one place to another.

At the same time, a sandal of sorts decorated with bows and ribbons became all the rage among women. High heels, which had once been high fashion, were now flat out. Pastimes Americans of leisure devoted themselves to 2 pastimes: billiards and horse racing. In 1796 Francis Baily, an English traveler in America, noted that Norfolk, Virginia, alone boasted 12 billiard tables. The next year the Williams Race Track was erected near Lexington, Kentucky. Soon after, several winners of the English Derby were brought over for breeding. The price per horse: about $250.

Because long-range com- mercial activity was difficult, most Ameri- cans traded close to home. As industry grew in northern cities, manufacturers wanted to expand their markets, receive protection from overseas competition, and enjoy conditions at home that encouraged growth.

Objectives After studying this section you should be able to: • Identify events after the War of 1812 that showed a spirit of nationalism. • Explain how the Supreme Court in- creased the national government's power. Nationalism is a feeling ol intense loyalty and devotion to one's country, k is a spirit that unifies diverse groups who share a geographic area into one nation. Nationalism can be demonstrated by people's actions, illustrated by such symbols as a flag and expressed in a nation's art, literature, and music. Nationalism has been one of the most powerful forces in the history of the mod- ern world. In the nineteenth century, nationalism was the glue that cemented numerous small states into the nations of Germany and Italy. In the twentieth cen- tury, nationalism inspired colonies in Africa and Asia to break away from their European rulers and declare indepen- dence. Eastern Europe's rejection of Soviet control and the recent reunification of Germany demonstrate the continuing power of nationalism. Nationalistic Legislation In the United States, the spirit of nationalism has not always been evident. It declined after the Revolution but was revived by the War of 1812. The conduct of the war revealed the dangers of dis- union, and the war's outcome increased national pride and self-confidence. Albert Gallatin, one of the United States commis- sioners at the peace conference in Ghent, recognized the revival of nationalism in a letter written shortly after the war's end: The war had renewed & reinstated the National feelings & character, which the Revolution had given, & which were daily lessened. The people. ..are more American: they feel & act more as a Nation, and I hope that the permanency of the Union is thereby better secured. In 1816 James Monroe, a Virginia Re- publican, was elected President over New York Federalist Rufus King. On a national goodwill tour the new President promoted a spirit ol unity everywhere he went. His warm reception by cheering crowds in Boston caused a local Federalist newspaper to proclaim that an \"Era of Good Feel- ings\" had begun.

Postwar nationalism was revealed in leg- islation as well as in jjolitks. The War ot 1812 had clearly demonstrated that Jeffer- son's ideal of a central government with strictly limited functions could not meet the needs of a nation in crisis. After the war, a Republican Congress passed a series of laws that sounded as though they had been written by Federalists. Henry Clay of Kentucky and John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, nationalist leaders in Congress, proposed an ambitious program that Clay called the \"American System,\" based on protection and internal improvements — roads, canals, and other transportation needs. They advocated a protective tariff for manufacturers, an improved market for farmers, and better transportation for agricultural and industri- al goods. Transportation improvements would be financed with money raised by the tariff. Both leaders wanted to reinstate the national bank to create a national cur- rency and encourage economic growth. They hoped that this nationalistic program would bring prosperity to all sections ol the country and, to the nation, economic inde- pendence from the rest ot the world. Republicans traditionally had opposed the idea of a national bank. They blocked the recharter of the first bank ot the Unit- ed States in 1811 and substituted nothing in its place. The results were disastrous because the notes of the Bank ol the Unit- ed States had become the national curren- cy. Without a currency and lacking sufficient gold and silver tor coins, the country had only the notes of state-char- tered banks. These notes were backed by inadequate resources, which gave them lit- tle or no value. They generally were accepted only in the localities where they were issued. Without a national bank, the federal government also had a difficult time borrowing money during the War ot 1812. Because of the nation's financial prob- lems, the Republicans changed their minds after the w.u .ind supported creation ol a new national bank. In 1816 Congress passed a bill to establish a second Bank ot the United States. Like its predecessor, the second Bank of the United States could issue notes to be used as national currency and act in a number of ways to control state banks. President Madison, who in 1791 had opposed the first national bank as unconstitutional, signed the legislation. Protection for manufacturers was anoth- er example of postwar nationalism. During the War of 1812 Americans had difficulty obtaining British products, thus encourag- ing the growth of American industry. But once the war was over, Britain dumped goods in the United States at such low prices they threatened to put American companies out ot business. Protecting ^1^^> Henry Clay 1777-1852 Virginia-born and raised, Henry Clay moved to Kentucky, a state that kept him in Congress — and in the forefront of national politics — tor nearly SO years. A fierce political rivalr)' soon devel- oped between Clay and another west- erner, Andrew Jackson of Tennessee. The two first clashed in 1819 when Clay blasted Jackson's Florida invasion. The election of 1824 made them bitter enemies.

Henry Clay (left) plays cards for \"U. S. Bank\" and \"Tariff. \" What role did these issues have In his plan for national growth? American industry meant that consumers would pay more for imported products, but to business leaders and nationalists alike, this price seemed a fair exchange for economic independence. Congress responded with the Tariff ol 1816. Unlike earlier revenue tariffs, which provided income for the federal govern- ment, this tariff was designed to protect American manufacturers by placing high taxes on imports. To opponents of a protective tariff, the nationalists explained that by discourag- ing the sale of imported goods they were helping the entire nation become more prosperous and self-sufficient. Manufac- turers would buy raw materials from American sources and in turn sell their products within the country. Even as the Federalist party faded away, Republicans were carrying out their old opponents' plans for a strong national gov- ernment encouraging and protecting pri- vate business. Indeed, Federalist ideals would outlast both the Era of Good Feel- ings and Jefferson's Republican party. Long after Federalists disappeared from Con- gress, their influence continued to be felt. Supreme Court Nationalism Nationalism in the years after the War of 1812 also was demonstrated in a series of Supreme Court decisions by Chief Justice John Marshall. Marshall was appointed in 1801 as one of the last acts of President John Adams, a Federalist. By 1815 the majority of the justices had been appointed by Republican Presidents, but Marshall still dominated the Court. He was a brilliant debater and possessed such strong convic- tions, friendliness, and persuasiveness that, according to one historian, he \"molded his fellow judges like putty. \" During his 34 years as Chief Justice, Marshall was in the minority on only one case dealing with a constitutional issue. Between 1819 and 1824, Marshall ruled in three important court cases that established the dominance of the nation over the states and that shaped the future of American government. McQdbch V. Maryland {1819) involved an attempt by Maryland to tax the Balti- more branch of the newly created second Bank of the United States. The case answered basic questions about the federal government's power and its relationship with the states. The national bank was constitutional, Marshall said, even though the Constitu- tion did not specifically give Congress the power to create one. He repeated Alexan- der Hamilton's 25-year-old argument that the federal government was not limited to the powers listed in the Constitution: Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate. . . which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional . . . Marshall observed that the Constitution specifically permitted Congress to issue money, borrow money, and collect taxes. He noted that the national bank would assist in exercising these enumerated pow- ers. Therefore, he concluded, the federal government could choose any method that was \"necessary and proper\" to exer- cise the powers the Constitution had given it. 286 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1789-1824"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Marshall noted that the people, acting collectively, had created the federal gov- ernment. Thus it was a truly \"national\" government, not created by the states or subordinate to them. Therefore, he rea- soned, no state had the power to tax the national bank, a legal creation of the fed- eral government. A heavy tax would make it difficult or impossible for the Bank to operate in that state because, he noted, \"The power to tax involves the power to destroy.\" Thus Marshall established that a state could not interfere with any federal agency within its borders. The second important decision, of the Marshall court during this period was Dartmouth College v. Woodward. (1819). This case was one of several in which the Supreme Court handed down decisions protecting contracts and property rights from state power. Dartmouth College was a private school chartered in 1769 by King George III. In 1815 the New Hampshire state legislature passed a law to change the charter, allowing Dart- mouth to become a state college. But Dartmouth officials did not want to give up their private school, and they refused Examining Tables Long after the Federalist party ceased to exist, tlie Supreme Court con- tinued to express the party's ideals.

THE MARSHALL COURT AND THE NATIONAL INTEREST"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"to turn over college records and funds to the state. When New Hampshire courts upheld the legislature, Dartmouth ap- pealed to the Supreme Court. In writing the Court's decision, Marshall noted that in the Constitution \"the state legislatures were forbidden 'to pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts,' that is, of contracts respecting property. \" A college charter is a contract, he said, and a state has no right to interfere with it. Thus, the state's attempt to seize this private college was unconstitutional. The Gibbons v. Ogden (1824) case became known as a landmark decision on interstate commerce. The case involved a company that operated steamboats in New York. The company had been given a monopoly over steamboat traffic in New York waters. The company took it upon itself to extend its monopoly to include traffic across the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey. Marshall declared this monopoly unconstitutional. The decision stated that in allowing the extension, the state legislature overstepped its power according to the Constitution, which gave the federal government control over interstate commerce. In writing the Court's decision, Mar- shall defined interstate commerce in a way that went far beyond the mere exchange of trade goods between states. By ruling, in effect, that anything crossing state boundaries comes under federal control, Marshall provided the federal government with the constitutional basis for many of the broad and sweeping powers it exercis- es today. In this 1824 Supreme Court decision may be found the constitutional authority for such diverse federal activities as licensing radio and TV stations, setting standards for clean air and water, pursuing criminals who flee across state lines to avoid prosecution, inspecting and grading of meat, and protecting migratory birds. In these cases and others, Marshall's nationalism strengthened the power of the federal government at the expense of the states. Although he was bitterly attacked for his decisions by defenders of states' rights, Marshall's views made the Consti- tution flexible enough to meet the chang- ing needs of a growing country. fllllllllll ***•*• Section One Review WW Summary Monroe's presidency was marked by a revival of nationalism. Laws passed by Congress were aimed at national rather than local concerns. Thus, the American System advocated building better trans- portation links between the country's dif- ferent sections, imposing protective tariffs to promote American manufacturing, and chartering a new national bank. Supreme Court decisions upheld the authority of the federal government, the sanctity of contracts against state interfer- ence, and federal jurisdiction over inter- state commerce.

Calhoun Representative, in a speech to Congress, 1817 Section Focus The United States had a need for better transportation. The number of states nearly doubled by 1820, and 9 of the 1 1 new states were west of the Appalachians. Yet there was no easy way to move indus- trial and farm products long distances. As a transportation network began to criss- cross the country, it stimulated move- ment of people and products and helped build a stronger nation. Obj- ectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the advantages and disadvan- tages of each type of transportation improvement. • Discuss the ways that internal improve- ments changed the nation. The War of 1812 made the need (or a better transportation sys- tem clear. It had been extremely dilficult to move armies, can- non, and supplies Irom one place to anoth- er. Indeed, American plans to invade and annex Canada during the war had failed, in part because America lacked good roads. Now, in peacetime, the only way to move proikicis long distances overland was in wagons on roads that weather made impassable much of the year. With the steamboat in its infancy, travel on the Mis- sissippi River was still one-way. Goods could be floated downriver on flatboats or keelboats, but very little could be powered upstream. Some Americans, especially in the West, felt it was the federal govern- ments responsibility to improve trans- portation. One such westerner was Henry Clay Although a protective tariff and nation- al bank were acceptable to Clay's fellow Republicans, not all were ready to support federal financing of internal improve- ments. In 1816 Representative John C. Calhoun of South Carolina proposed a \"Bonus Bill\" to build roads and canals with the $1.5 million fee paid by the Bank of the United States for its charter. The bill passed but President Madison vetoed it, arguing that to spend money improving transportation was an uncon- stitutional extension of federal power. Transportation by Road An east-west national road, already underway when Madison vetoed the Bonus Bill, was the first major step in the creation of a national transportation sys- tem. In 1806 Congress funded the National Road from the sale of western lands, and construction started from the Potomac River at Cumberland, Maryland, in 1811. By 1818 the road reached Wheeling, Virginia, spanning the Ohio River on the longest suspension bridge in the world — an engineering marvel. Ihe bridge was 1 ,010 feet long and hung from towers rising 153 feet above the river. The National Road went west to Van- dalia, Illinois, cutting a path 80 feet wide through the wilderness. The center 30 feet were \"paved \" with crushed stone, and the road crossed streams and rivers on stone Chai'tir 9 Nationalism and Chancf. 289"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Examining Fine Art A Conestoga wagon travels the National Road In this 1814 painting by Ameri- can landscape artist Thomas Birch. What problems did travel by road present In early America? Linking Across Time Federal Highways Another great federal road pro- ject was completed much later for the same reasons as the National Road. In the 1950s truckers complained that the nation's high- ways were only two lanes. Even main routes passed through small towns, making travel slow. Truck- ers asked Congress for modern, high- speed highways. To finance the interstate highway system with federal funds, Congress decided that inter- states were neces- sary for defense. Never again would the army face diffi- cult}' moving troops overland, as it had during the War of 1812. bridges. Great Conestoga wagons drawn by oxen or teams of four, six, or eight horses moved westward along this route. The National Road turned out to be the only great federal transportation project. In general, states or private businesses undertook such improvements in trans- portation. State-chartered private com- panies constructed hundreds of miles of turnpikes, roads that were barricaded at intervals by poles that stopped travelers until they paid a toll, or fee. However, turnpikes were profitable only on main routes, such as between Albany and Lake Erie, or in populated areas where traffic was heavy. In the West, highways usually were constructed by the states themselves, at times with the aid of federal funds. Although by 1 840 the country was criss- crossed with roads, they did not provide satisfactory transportation. Except in the East few were surfaced or spanned by ade- quate bridges. When the routes passed through woods, foot-high stumps remained in the road bed. Spring rains turned roads to mud and mired wagons up to their axles. In swampy places, \"corduroy\" — logs laid sideways across the road bed — hurt horses' legs and jolted wagons to pieces. David Stevenson described a journey by stage- coach along a t)picaJ route of the time in his book Sketch of the Civil En^neering of North America '^v^Xx^^A in 1838: Sometimes our way lay for miles through extensive marshes, which we crossed by corduroy-roads At others the coach stuck fast in mud, from which it could be extricated only by the combined efforts of the coachman and passengers; and at one place we traveled. . . through a forest flooded with water, which stood to a height of several feet The distance of the route from Pittsburg to Erie is 128 miles, which was accomplished in forty-six hours. . .although the conveyance by which I travelled carried the mail, and stopped only for breakfast, dinner and tea, but there was considerable delay by the coach being once upset and several times \"mired. \" 290 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1789-1824"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Such difficult travel was necessary for families moving west with their belongings and for farmers herding cattle and hogs to market. But bulky goods, such as farm crops or man- ufactured products, could not be quickly or profitably moved long dis- tances by land. The price of products was out of reach for many people, because merchants passed shipping costs on to consumers. Far more important to commerce, therefore, were America's inland waterways. Transportation by Water Rivers had long been the primary means of moving commercial goods. But travel was one-way — flatboats and rafts floating downstream. Trips against the current were slow and difficult. When steamboats became commonplace the country's rivers were transformed into highways. Although steamboats were built before 1800, they initially did not attract much attention. In 1807, however, Robert Fulton's steamboat, the Clermont, Examining Maps /n the early nineteenth century, inland travel in America was generally lim- ited to navigable rivers.

What improvements did the steamboat bring to river travel? made its first voyages on the Hudson River, chugging the 150 miles trom New York City to upstream Albany in an amazing 32 hours. By demonstrating the practicality ot two-way river travel, Ful- ton launched the steamboat era. In 1811 the first steamboat in Western waters steamed down the Ohio and Mis- sissippi rivers fi'om Pittsburgh to New Orleans and then returned upriver as far as Louisville. Steamboats proved their ability to carry passengers and goods quickly and efficiently, and by 1850 near- ly 800 of them regularly traveled the Mis- sissippi and its tributaries. Flat-bottomed steamboats were developed to navigate on rivers less than three leet deep. The benefits of steamboat travel were great, but risks were high. The average life of a river steamboat was three to six years — not surprising considering the dangers presented by snags, ice, bursting boilers, collisions, fires, and sand bars. About one-third ol the steamboats built before 1850 were lost in accidents. In 1839 Michael Chevalier, a French traveler in America, noted that his Mississippi steamboat trip posed more dangers than his Atlantic crossing: There have been many accidents by fire in the steamers, and many persons have perished in this way. . . . The Brandywine was burnt near Memphis, in 1832, and every soul on board, to the number of 1 10, was lost. The Americans show a singular iiidijference in regard to fire, not only in the steamboats, but also in their houses; they smoke without the least concern ifi the midst of half open cotton-bales, with which a boat is loaded; they ship gunpowder with no more precaution than if it were so much maize or salt pork it matters little, if they move at a rapid rate, and are navigated at little expense. The thousands of miles of canals built during the first part of the nineteenth cen- tury were as important to transportation as the river systems. For moving heavy goods, canals were far more efficient than even the best roads.

Before 1815a number of short canals had been built, most ol them around rapids and tails in rivers. A lew canals connected nearby natural water- ways. The canal-building craze did not really begin, however, until completion of the Erie Canal in 1825. Begun by New York state in 1817, the Erie Canal was 40 feet wide, 4 feet deep and 363 miles long — running from Albany on the Hudson River to Buffalo on Lake Erie. The canal lowered the cost of moving a ton of goods from almost 20 cents per mile to less than 2 cents and reduced travel time from 20 days to 6. It quickly made New York City the greatest port in America and brought instant pros- perity to rural areas upstate. The success of the Erie Canal encour- aged other states to invest in canals. Penn- sylvania built a canal system across the Appalachian mountains, linking Pittsburgh with the east and allowing Philadelphia to challenge New York as the nation's major port. Ohio went deeply into debt to build 500 miles of canals connecting the Ohio River and Lake Erie. Indiana's canal-build- ing program nearly bankrupted the state. In an era before dynamite, concrete, and steel, building canals took astonishing physical eftort by countless workers. By 1840 more than 3,000 miles of canals were dug by workers using shovels and scoops pulled by horses and oxen. Locks — enclosures with gates at each end to raise or lower the water level — were constructed as canals crossed hills and val- leys. The stone for these locks had to be cut and set completely by hand. Construction workers labored on the canals from dawn to dusk for wages that averaged less than $1 a day. Many farmers earned extra income by working on nearby canal projects. But farmers were not avail- able during the growing season, and in areas other than cities, the population was too small to supply enough workers. So con- struction depended on thousands of Irish immigrants who moved from project to project as canal-building spread. Canals also created opportunities for new businesses to supply food, shelter, and other necessities to workers — and later to travelers on the canals. In rural areas, towns sprang up along canals, especially at locks, which were typical stopping points for boats. Soon, however, an even quicker means ol trans- portation was developing. Examining Illustrations Canals speeded the movement of goods and people, but their use- fulness was limited. They froze in winter dried up in summer, and flooded with spring rains — collapsing their banks and requiring expensive repairs. Why did New York City benefit from the Erie Canal?

Locks are Lockport, Erie Canal AND Technology chambers, with gates. at each end, that raise and lower ships to compensate for elevation changes along a waterway. A ship traveling downstream enters a lock and remains there while a gate is closed behind it, creating a watertight chamber. Water is slowly released through the downstream gate to lower the water level in the lock. The downstream gate is then opened, and the ship continues on its way at a lower elevation.

They were faster than roads and were passable in almost all weather. They did not freeze in winter or dry up in summer like canals and rivers; nor were they limited by topography. Early trains were nearly as unsafe as steamboats. Engineers operated locomo- tives at top speed down hills and around curves, giving passengers the nineteenth- century equivalent of a roller-coaster ride. Sparks from belching smokestacks ignited wooden railroad cars, haystacks, and buildings along the track.

Experienced travelers rode in the middle cars. Despite their dangers, railroads excited Americans. In his book Walden, Henry David Thoreau captured this spirit: When I hear the iron horse make the hills echo with his snort like thunder, shaking the earth with his feet and breathing fire and smoke fivrn his nostiils. . . it seems as if the earth had got a race now worthy to inhabit it. Yet despite such enthusiasm, railroads were slow to take hold, mainly because of opposition from state governments, which had heavy investments in roads and canals. New York, lor example, attempted to protect the Erie Canal by prohibiting trains Irom carrying freight. By 1840 the number of miles of track laid equaled the number of miles of canals that had been dug. But not until the second half ol the century would railroads dominate the nations trans- portation system.

Citizens of Illinois could enjoy the same foods, fashions, and household furnishings as residents of Ver- mont. Food prices fell in the Northeast, while farm production more than dou- bled. By 1840 more western farm prod- ucts were being shipped on the Erie Canal than down the Mississippi River to New Orleans. Transportation changed America in other ways as well. Information joined the flow of products as mail became deliverable throughout the nation. In 1825 Congress established home deliv- ery of letters, and in 1847 created the first national postage stamps. With the mail came newspapers, which brought national issues to the attention of the most remote rural communities and helped integrate them into national lile and politics. Improved transportation also brought circuit-riding preachers more frequently. No longer did Americans in isolated areas wait months for formal religious services, marriage ceremonies, or baptism of their chil- dren. For women, the effects of the trans- portation revolution were mixed. The constant need to make such household necessities as candles, soap, and cloth once required the help of the whole family. But the availability of manufactured goods nation-wide changed the division of labor and status of women. Household work required less time and became the sole responsibility of women. It also became less valued than labor that produced income for the family, and many women moved into paid employment outside the home. Another important result ol the trans- portation system was that it connected the Northeast with the old Northwest Territory. The natural geographic connection ol the West was with the South, by way of the Mississippi River. But the best market tor western htrm products was the populous industrial Northeast. Opening up that market cre- ated a strong economic tie between the West and the Northeast — a tie that later would have important political conse- quences for the nation. Ui Section Two Review 39QB1S •BE Summary In the early 1 800s roads and canals were built to unite the different sections of the country. When Madison's veto of the Bonus Bill reduced federal financing for internal improvements, private companies and state governments stepped in to fill the gap. Steamboats, roads, and canals improved transportation, joined the West with the South and East, carried raw materials and manufactured goods, and hastened migration of settlers into western territories. They also encouraged an infor- mation revolution by making postal ser- vice and newspapers available to citizens along the frontier. Checking for Understanding 1.

Americans approved from afar as Spain's colonies in Latin America gained independence. At the same time, the United States worked to establish peace along its borders and to expand them where possible. Out of these events came a policy that for the next 1 50 years guided America's attitude toward European involvement in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe America's problems with Britain and Spain and how they were settled. • Explain the foreign policy principles established by the Monroe Doctrine. United States foreign afhiirs after the War of 1812 were dominat- ed by John Quincy Adams, Monroe's secretary of state until becoming President himscll in 1825. Pew Americans could match his qualifications. I Ic had spent 18 years abroad in diplomat- ic service, as the United States minister to the Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, and Great Britain. Furthermore, as the son of a former Federalist President and a native New Englander, his appointment to the cabinet was in the spirit of national unity sought by President Monroe. Disputes and Diplomacy Although peace with Great Britain had been achieved in 1815, bitter feelings remained. The Treaty of Ghent was wide- ly regarded as a mere truce because it had not resolved the differences between the two nations. \"That man must be blind to the indications of the future,\" declared Fienry Clay in 1816, \"who cannot see that we are destined to have war after war with Great Britain.\" Disputes over fishing rights at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River led to violence between Canadians and New Englanders. Britain and the United States competed tor naval supremacy on the Great Lakes. From Maine to Oregon the boundary between the United States and Canada was unset- tled, and in several places it was disputed. There were strong reasons for improving relations with Great Britain. Chief among these was trade. Britain remained a buyer of American raw materials and America a market for British manufactured goods. Realizing that neither countr\\' had any- thing to gain by continued hostilities, Britain made attempts to smooth out rela- tions. For example, it ended assistance to native Americans in United States territory south of the Great Lakes. Between 1815 and 1817, Great Britain and the United States were able to work out several ot their disputes peaceRilly. As minister to England, John Quincy Adams used Great Britain's desire for better relations with the United States to negotiate the famous Rush-Bagot Agreement ol 1817, the first mutuiil naval disarmament in histo- rv. The United States and Britain agreed to remove all warships Irom the Great Lakes, except tor a tew small vessels to control smuggling. 1 his precedent later encouraged the United States and Canada to demilita- rize their entire .^, 000-mile border, creating what continues to be the longest untortilicil international boundaiy in the wt)rld.

Beyond the Rockies, the treaty provided \"joint occupation\" ol the disputed Oregon territory for ten years. Each cotm- try would be free to carry on fur trade and settle the region without interference from the other. The dispute over ownership of Oregon was thereby suspended. Spanish Florida remained a source of friction, however, as it had been since the Louisiana Purchase. Spain insisted that Florida's western boundary was the Missis- Life of the Times Seminole Survival In order to avoid defeat by Andretv Jackson in 1818 to 1819, many Seminole Indians of the Southeast fled deep into the swamps of the Florida Evergla^les. Isolated from the world, the Seminole had to adapt to a new envi- ronment. This involved learning new skills and crafts suited to life in a warm, wet, and hostile climate. Seminole houses called chickees were made from the palmetto trees that flourished in the swamp. The floor of the house was raised off the ground on poles to keep it dry. Open walls and thatched roofs kept the dwelling cool. Birchbark canoes were replaced by sleek dugouts. These were made by throwing embers from a fire along the center of pre- pared logs, then scraping out the charred wood. The walls of the dugouts were thin, sometimes no more than one inch thick. Using streams as trails, the pilots stood on platforms at the tear of the dugouts. From this vantage point, they used long poles to push the vessels through the swamps. The huntets who rode in the dugout could spear fish, which provided the Seminole with a rich supply of food. Seminoles continue to live in the Everglades today. sippi River, while the United States claimed that it was the Perdido River, 200 miles farther east. During the War of 1812 the United States resolved the controversy by simply seizing the disputed territory. Because Spain was an ally of Great Britain in the War of 1812, Florida became a base of British and Indian operations against the United States. After the war, it remained a reflige for Seminole and Creek Indians, who continued to battle the Geor- gia settlers who had taken their land. In 1818 Andrew Jackson, commanding the Tennessee militia, ignored the international boundary and pursued a Seminole force into Florida, where he seized Spanish set- tlements at Pensacola and St. Marks. The Spanish government demanded that the United States pay for the \"outrage\" and punish Jackson. But Adams defended Jack- son and argued that true blame lay in Spain's failure to keep order in Florida. He convinced Monroe to issue Spain an ulti- matum^either govern Florida effectively or surrender it to the United States. Occupied with problems throughout its Latin American empire, Spain gave in and ceded Florida to the United States in the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819. In return the United States agreed to pay $5 million to Ametican citizens who had claims against Spain. The treaty also set the western boundary of the Louisiana Purchase from the Gulf of Mexico northwest to the Oregon Territory and west to the Pacific. In addition, the United States gave up a weak claim to Texas as part of the Louisiana Territory, while Spain gave up a much stronger claim to Oregon. Secretary of State Adams had used Spain's world problems to negotiate a treaty extremely favorable to his own nation. The Monroe Doctrine The most significant accomplishment of Sectetary of State Adams was the Mon- roe Doctfine of 1823. This famous state- ment of foreign policy had a complex background that involved events in Latin America, in Europe, and on the Pacific coast of North America. Between 1814 and 1824, Spain's Latin American colonies declared independence. 298 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1789-1824"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Examining Illustrations President Monroe consulted his cabinet before Issuing the Monroe Doctrine. What warning did the Monroe Doctrine contain? Armies led by Simon Bolivar (See MOHN Buh LEE vahr) and Jose San Martin (Hoh SAY SAHN MAHR TEEN) exceeded even the Patriots' heroics in the American Revolution. Bolivar's advance to Peru through more than 2,000 miles ot mountains and San Martin's expedition from Argentina, as he led 5,000 troops through mountain passes over 12,000 feet high, captured the attention of the Ameri- can people. Sympathy for the Latin Americans was increased by events in Europe. After defeat- ing Napoleon in 1815, the victorious European monarchies formed the Quadru- ple Alliance to suppress the democratic ideas of the French Revolution. Klemens von Metternich (MEHT uhr NIHK), prime minister of Austria, branded democracy \"the disease which must be cured, the vol- cano which must be extinguished, the gan- grene which must be burned out with the hot iron.\" The Quadruple Alliance helped defeat revolutions in Italy and Spain. The success of the Quadruple Alliance caused some European leaders to talk of taking similar action in the Americas. Although there was little chance that they could carry out such action, rumors of it caused concern in the United States and Great Britain. Both the British and the Americans were enjoying a profitable trade with Latin American nations. 11 the Quad- ruple Alliance returned the region to Spain, restrictions would reappear and this trade would be lost. Ihc British government looked for a way to discourage moves to restore Sjianish rule in Latin America. In August 1823, the British foreign min- ister suggested to the U.S. minister in Lon- don that the two nations issue a joint statement about the independence of Latin America. The statement would say that the United States and Britain opposed interven- tion in Latin America by any power, and that neither nation would acquire any part of Latin America for itself — a surprising proposal from an old enemy.

The Monroe administration was wrestling with a number of foreign policy concerns. Russia already claimed Alaska and was making aggressive moves on the Pacific coast. For years Russian settlers had been operating an iron foundry north of San Francisco. In 1821 the Russian tsar announced that his empire extended south into Oregon, which conflicted with Ameri- can and British claims there. Should the United States allow Russia to expand its holdings in the Western Hemi- sphere? How should the United States meet the threat of intervention in Latin America — accept the British offer of coop- eration or act alone? President Monroe discussed these questions with his cabinet and consulted his fellow Virginians, Jeffer- son and Madison. The two former Presi- dents favored a joint statement with Great Britain. But Secretary of State Adams argued that it would look as though the United States was following \"in the wake of the British man-of-war.\" He urged that the United States act alone. The national- ism of John Quincy Adams prevailed. For what would become a landmark of American foreign policy, the Monroe Doc- trine was presented in an undramatic way. It appeared in two widely separated pas- sages in President Monroe's annual message to Congress on December 2, 1823. It pro- vided both a warning and a reassurance to Europe (see AppendLx). Despite its lasting importance, the Mon- roe Doctrine had no great significance at the time it was issued. If the nations of the Quadruple Alliance ever seriously contem- plated intervention in the Americas, it was the British navy, not Monroe's warning, that made them back down. In 1824 the Russians, already in possession of more land than they could effectively govern, agreed to withdraw from Oregon. The significance of the Monroe Doctrine is in later events. Its bold warnings gained meaning only when the United States was able to back them up without relying on British sea power — a development that took nearly a century. Nor did the Monroe Doc- trine protect Latin America from the nation- alism, expansion, and intervention of the United States itself over the next 150 years. \"HR Section Three Review Summary After the War of 1812, bitter relations between the United States and Britain improved, beginning with the Rush-Bagot Agreement, which removed each other's warships from the Great Lakes.

State and federal legislation promoted internal improvements to join the sections of the nation, while Supreme Court decisions strengthened the authority of the national government. As the sections were physically joined by a network of roads and canals, settlers streamed westward and cities sprang up in the wilderness. Raw materials and manufactured goods went back and forth, and trading between the sections expanded. An information net- work eliminated the local character of communica- tions and brought news of national and international affairs over new American highways and byways. American pride was evidenced in the conduct of for- eign affairs. While the United States acquired territory from Spain, Americans voiced their support for Spain's Latin American colonies struggling for the indepen- dence the United States had so recently won. The Monroe Doctrine closed the Western Hemisphere to further foreign colonization and announced the Unit- ed States' intention to stay out of Europe's affairs. * Using Vocabulary Write a paragraph describing the awakening of American nationalism from 1812 to 1823 using the following terms: internal improvements Era of Good Feelings protective tariffs American System turnpikes Monroe Doctrine * Reviewing Facts 1.

Find out what viewpoints others hold on the same topic. • Decide what your position is and list as many state- ments to support it as you cam. Study the list to make certain that all supporting statements relate directly to the topic, to one another, and to the point of view you have chosen. Check to make sure they are in a logical, easy-to-h)llow order and that they support your point ot view in a clear enough manner lor others to imdcrstand.

Leave for last the supporting statement that is most impressive and will li.ur ilie most impact. Your concluding statement should also restate your viewpoint, but in different words than your opening statement. Example The statement below expresses a viewpoint about Americans after the War of 1812. Read the viewpoint, its supporting statements, and the restate- ment ot the viewpoint. Note how they all follow the guidelines for expressing a viewpoint. Opening statement of viewpoint: l.The American people felt like one nation. Supporting statements: 2. Tirifts on international goods protected internal trade. 3. A national banking system was created. 4. The dominance of the nation over the states was established, as the power of the federal government increased while states' rights decreased. 5. Improved transportation made trade between the states easier. 6. Improved communication such as a federal postal system and newspapers carrying national news made easier the exchange of information from state to state. Concluding restatement of viewpoint: 7. The War of 1812 renewed the national feelings that the Revolution had given, and subsequent internal improvements lead the people now to feel more American, more like a nation.

It was also thrust into foreign affairs. Many wondered whether the nation would sur- vive these pressures. In the end not only did it survive but it emerged as a world leader. Chapter 7 The Federahst Era To lead the new nation, the people elected the hero of the Revolution, George Washington, who inspired confi- dence and loyalty to the nation. As the first President, Washington set several precedents, such as creating a cabinet, directing foreign affairs, and serving as \"chief legislator.\" Washington also tackled the nation's war debts. He delegated much of the nations financial policy to Alexander Hamilton, his secretary of the treasury. Hamilton rec- ommended an excise tax on whiskey to provide revenue for the government, pay- ment of foreign and domestic debts, assis- tance with state debts, the establishment of a central bank, and the development of home industries. On the whole, Hamil- ton's program restored the credit of the United States, although it met with bitter opposition, particularly from Thomas Jef- ferson, who believed the federal govern- ment should not wield such power. To deal with the Indians who were resisting settlers entering the western terri- tories, Washington called on General Anthony Wayne to drive the native Amer- icans out of Ohio. The defeat of the Miami Confederation and the Treaty of Greenville opened the way for settle- ment in the Northwest. Washington also snuffed out the \"Whiskey Rebellion staged by western farmers to protest the excise tax on whiskey. Another of Washington's tasks was to establish a foreign policy. At the outbreak of the Anglo-French War, he issued the Proclamation of Neutrality, which stated that the nation would be \"friendly and impartial\" toward both warring parties. This proclamation withstood the efforts of French minister Edmund Genet to gain American support for his nation's cause. Washington faced difficulties with Eng- land, which interfered with American trade. In an effort to stave ofT war, Wash- ington's chief justice John Jay negotiated what became known as the Jay Treaty. Following this treaty, the United States signed the Pinckney Treaty with Spain, giving the United States the right to deposit goods at the mouth of the Missis- sippi River and established a southern boundary for the United States. John Adams succeeded Washington as the nation's leader. Resistant to the skill of compromise, he faced a difficult term in office. Adams's tenure was marked by the XYZ affair, in which the French attempt- ed to bribe American envoys; an unde- clared war with France; anti-Republican legislation that ultimately hurt Adams's Federalist party; and the first appearance of the theory of nullification in the Vir- ginia and Kentucky Resolutions. Chapter 8 Jefferson and the RepubHcans Adams sought reelection in 1800 but was defeated by Republican Thomas Jef- ferson in a close contest. Jefferson brought a political and philosophical change to the presidency. The thrust of his beliefs were the people were the source of a govern- ment's power. He also believed that peo- ple who thought that the Union should be dissolved should not be punished; that the United States government was the strongest in the world; and that people were able to govern themselves. Once in office, however, Jefferson found that he had to provide strong leadership to prevent his party from dividing into factions. 304 Unit 3 Launching the Republic: 1789-1824"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"During Jefferson's first term, for the most part, foreign and domestic affairs remained tranquil, with much of\" the earU- er Federahst legislation remaining in effect. An exception was the power of the federal judiciary, which the Republicans cut back. In addition, foreign trade was increased; taxes and the national debt were reduced; and the principle of judicial review, in which the Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of laws, was established. Jefferson's accomplishments led to an easy victory for a second term. A major event during Jefferson's presi- dency was the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States. Despite doubts over whether the federal government had the legal power to acquire foreign territory, Jefferson agreed to the purchase because it extended the boundaries of the United States west of the Mississippi. Not all people supported the purchase, however. In particular, die- hard Federalists in the Northeast feared that it would ultimately weaken New England's power in national affairs. During Jefferson's presidency, he tried to remain neutral in foreign affairs despite such threats as attacks on ships by the Barbary pirates, the French Napoleonic decrees, the British Orders in Council, and the British policy of searching Ameri- can ships for former British subjects. In response to the latter. Congress passed the Embargo Act, which sanctioned an eco- nomic boycott. Because American trade suffered severely as a consequence, the act was repealed. Under James Madison, Jefferson's suc- cessor, the United States became em- broiled in an unpopular war with Britain. The war of 1812 dragged on three years, with fighting taking place in Canada, in the United States, and at sea. The war finally ended in 1814 with the Treaty of Ghent. Chapter 9 Nationalism and Change The (xriod following the W;ir of 1812 was markcii by the spirit of nationalism, in which Americans cooperated to develop a stronger, more unified nation. Internal improvements were encouraged, and a new national bank stimulated the econo- my and encouraged economic growth. In addition, protective tariffs were instituted to protect American manufacturers from goods manufactured abroad. Nationalism was also demonstrated in a series of Supreme Court decisions by Chief Justice John Marshall, which strengthened the power of the federal gov- ernment at the expense of the states. These included McCiilloch v. Maryland, Dartmouth College v. Woodward, and Gib- bons V. Ogden. The early 1800s were also marked by a transportation revolution, taking place on America's inland waterways at a time when highway and turnpike development in its infancy. Railroads were also slow to take hold. One development was Fulton's steamboat, which turned rivers into two- way navigation paths. Another was the building of thousands of miles of canals during this period. Both developments dramatically lowered the time and cost of shipping goods from place to place. Transportation improvements helped unite Americans, who could now buy goods produced in distant places and improve their lifestyles. Other important consequences of transportation improve- ments were the increase in the spread of information and the changes to the geo- graphic landscape of the country. While the United States was making internal improvements, it was also looking after its foreign affairs. Relations between the United States and Britain improved with the Rush-Bagot Agreement, which was the first example of mutual naval dis- armament in history. Differences between Spain and the United States were settled by the Adams-Oni's Treat}', which gave Florida to the United States. One of the greatest foreign policy accomplishments, however, was the Monroe Doctrine, which proclaimed that the western hemi- sphere was closed to further European col- onization. Although insignificant when it was issued, ii has had lasting import- ance in American foreign policy and has helped keep the n.iiion out ol European al fairs.

During this time, political life in the United States changed as well. With the election of Andrew Jackson as President in 1828, more people began to take part in political affairs. Many of Jackson's sup- porters believed strongly in democracy and such social reforms as women's rights and improvements in education. The most controversial issue, however, was the abolition of slavery. Great Britain out- lawed slavery in 1833, but in the United States slavery became entrenched in the southern economy.

Many Transcendental works of poetry and prose were penned during the period, but none more fully embodies Transcendental ideals than Henry David Thoreau's^-AditVi. Part journal, part social commentary, and part sermon, the work summarizes and enlarges upon Thoreaus experiences at Walden Pond, near Concord, Massachusetts, where he built a cabin and lived in solitude for two years. As you read this passage, look for Thoreaus criticisms of American society, his call for personal feedom, and what he says we must do to live in society. Henry David Thoreau hen first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defense against the rain, without plaster- ing or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night. The upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave it a clean and airy look, especially in the morning, when its timbers were saturat- ed with dew, so that I fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude from them. To my imagination it retained throughout the day more or less of this auroral character, reminding me of a cer- tain house on a mountain which I had visited a year before. This was an airy and unplastered cabin, fit to entertain a travelling god, and where a goddess might trail her garments. The winds which passed over my dwelling were such as sweep over the ridges of mountains, bearing the broken strains, or celestial parts only, of terrestrial music. The morning wind forever blows, the poem of creation is uninterrupted; but few are the ears that hear it I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when 1 came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and ^iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiMnMiiiiiiiMiiiiiiiniiiiMiniiiiiiiiiniMiiiiiiiniiniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiniiniiiiiJMiniiHiiuiniiiiiiiniiiiniiiiiinMniiiiiiiMnMiiriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiniiiiiiiiiiiiMiiiiiMii(iiniiiniiniiiiiiiiiiiniiMMiiiiiMM 312 Unit 4 Toward a Democracy: 1820-1848"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"iniiiniiiiiinii[iiiniiiiiiiiiiininiiniininiiniiMiiMiiiiiiniiJMiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiijiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii[iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii; publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion. For most men, it appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to \"glorify God and enjoy him forever.\" Still we live meanly, like ants.... Our lite is frittered away by detail. An honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes, and lump the rest. Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a mil- lion count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb-nail. In the midst of this chop ping sea of civilized life such are the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousand-and-one items to be allowed lor, that a man has to live, if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his port at all, by dead reckoning, and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds. Simplify, simplify. Instead of three meals a day, if it be necessary eat but one; instead of a hun- dred dishes, five; and reduce other things in proportion. Our life is like a German Confederacy, made up of petty states, with its boundary forever fluctuating, so that even a German cannot tell you how it is bounded at any moment. The nation itself, with all its so-called internal improvements, which, by the way, are all grown establishment, cluttered with furni- ture and tripped up by its own traps, ruined by luxury and heedless expense, by want of calculation and a worthy aim, as the million house-holds in the land; and the only cure for it, as tor them, is in a rigid economy, a stern and more than Spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose. It lives too fast. Men think that it is essential that the Nation have com- merce, and export ice, and talk through a telegraph, and ride thirty miles an hour, without a doubt, whether they do or not; but whether we should live like baboons or like men, is a little uncertain. ... Let us spend one day as deliberately as Nature, and not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquito's wing that falls on the rails. Let us rise early and fast, or break fast, gently and without perturba- tion; let company come and let company go, let the bells ring and the children cry, — deter- mined to make a day of it. Why should we knock under and go with the stream?... Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in. I drink at it; but while I drink I see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is. Its thin current slides away, but eternity remains. I would drink deeper; fish in the sky, whose bot- tom is pebbly with stars. I cannot count one. I know not the first letter of the alphabet. I have always been regretting that I was not as wise as the day I was born. The intellect is a cleaver; it discerns and rifts its way into the secret of things. I do not wish to be any more busy with my hands than is necessary. My head is hands and feet. I feel all my best fliculties con- centrated in it. My instinct tells me that my head is an organ for burrowing, as some creatures use their snoiu and fore paws, and with it I would mine and bur- row my way through these hills. I think that the richest vein is somewhere here- abouts; so by the divining-rod and thin rising vapors I judge; and here I will begin to mine. Interpreting Literature 1.

Then came the Industrial Revolution — a revolution that would change ways of life more in the next 200 years than they had changed in r the previous 4,500. The Industrial Revolution The Industrial Revolution consisted of several basic developments: in industry there were shifts from simple tools to com- plex machines; from natural sources of power, such as draft animals and falling water, to artificial sources, such as the steam engine and the electric motor; from regional to nationwide distribution of products. Jobs became more specialized, so that many workers concentrated on par- ticular, narrow tasks rather than on creat- ing an entire product. In addition, new inventions made transportation and com- munication faster and more efficient. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain. Between 1730 and 1800, new mechanical methods of spinning and weaving cotton cloth transformed Britain's clothing industry. These machines operat- ed so efficiently that cotton cloth, former- ly a luxury, became the cheapest textile, or woven fabric, in the world. Initially, manufacturing was a British monopoly; many of the machines that characterized the Industrial Revolution were developed by British inventors. Fur- thermore, British laws forbade the export of this machinery, as well as the emigra- tion — the leaving of one's country perma- nently for another country — of skilled workers. Many Americans believed it was time to start producing their own goods. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1816: In the thousands of years between the building of the first pyramids in 2650 B.C. and the construction of log cabins in the eighteenth century, there was not much change with regard to building tools or sources of power. Hand implements and beasts of burden ...to be independent for the comforts of life we must fabricate them ourselves [Sjhall we make our own comforts or go without them at the will of a foreign nation? 316 Unit 4 Toward a Democracy: 1 820- 1 848"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"The new technology finally reached America in 1789 with the arrival of Samuel Slater. While a young man in Britain, Slater apprenticed in a textile factor)', where he memorized every detail of the finest textile machinery. Soon after arriving on American soil, he formed a partnership with two other men in Providence, Rhode Island, and began to duplicate British tex- tile machinery from memory. In 1790 America's first textile mill, built on the banks of the Seekonk River, opened its doors for business under the name of Almy, Brown, and Slater. The Industrial Revolution had come to America. The embargo against England in 1812 had given the cotton-textile industry a chance to develop in the United States. This industry, which soon became more prosperous than the North's lucrative trade, was centered in New England for a number of reasons. The region boasted many swift-flowing streams, an abundant source of water power. New England's shippers were seeking additional enterpris- es in which to invest their profits. And, after the 1820s, European immigration to the region provided a large labor force. By 1840, 800 cotton mills and 500 woolen mills in New England employed nearly 50,000 workers. In addition, shipping continued to thrive in the region, and there also were many small factories turn- ing out such products as shoes, clocks, carriages, and paper. Manufacturing also took hold in the Middle Atlantic states — Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. Although there were textile mills in this region, too, the area was better known lor its coal and iron ore resources. Improved roads and expansion of the nation's rail- way systems opened western markets, and increased the demand for machinery. It was discovered that coal could be used in the manufacture of iron, which was used to make machines. The coal fields of Pennsylvania quickly turned the area into a great center for the iron industry and for the manufacture of machinery. Pittsburgh, located near plentiful deposits of coal and iron ore, became a great center of these industries. Early Effects The Industrial Revolution transformed the Northeast from a region where fami- lies lived and worked together at farming, crafts, and home-based businesses to one in which people lived mostly in cities and earned their livings by working for others in industry. Factories that required a large AlJ'f :j- Linking Across Time The Textile Industry As was the case in the 1810s and 1820s, the United States continues to import more tex- tiles than it manu- factures. Great Britain, however, has been replaced as the major sup- plier. Imported textiles today come primarily from the Pacific Rim coun- tries, which include Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, and South Korea. This region, like New England in the early decades of the nineteenth century, has an abundance of cheap labor.

What types of products did these factories pro- duce? Examining Fine Art The serenity of rural farming life made a striking contrast with the hustle of the expanding factory sys- tem in New England and the Northeast. Why did young people leave the farm? labor force and nearby sources oi power sprang up in existing cities, such as New York and Philadelphia. Such new cities as Lowell and Lawrence in Massachusetts were built along the falls and rapids of New England's rivers. As the cities grew, so did the demand for better transporta- tion to carry raw materials to the factories and finished products to markets. Improved transportation brought food into the cities to feed the thousands of factory workers. Industrialization created two new classes ol people — the industrial capitalists who built and owned the factories, and the industrial laborers who worked in them. These new owners and workers performed S^*''%f/t.. distinctly different functions. The differ- ences even extended to their dress, and these differences became symbols that are still understood today: in political car- toons, a top hat and frock coat designate a capitalist; a cap and overalls, a factory worker. Much of the profit from the Northeast's manufacturing and shipping went back into business, but a great deal of money was also invested all over the country. Banks loaned money to speculators in the West, to companies building Mississippi River steamboats, and to Alabama cotton producers. Thus, even though the regions of the nation developed in different ways, the whole country began to be tied to- gether by a web of credit. The Labor Movement Although industrialization eventually raised the standard of living of many peo- ple by creating cheaper and more abun- dant goods, its immediate result was to create several new difficulties for workers. As machines replaced hand tools, jobs for skilled craftsworkers became scarcer, and manv such workers were reduced to performing unskilled labor. Before indus- trialization, there had been enjoyment in skilled work and pride in good handicraft. But tending machines proved monot- onous, and workers could take little pride in the completed product. Moreover, though craftspeople worked long hours, they could begin and end the day at the times they themselves chose. If they want- ed to take a day off to go fishing or to 318 Unit 4 Toward a Democr^acy: 1820-1 848"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"sleep, the decision was theirs. Factory workers, by contrast, kept hours that were fixed by the employer. Dramatic social changes occurred as a result of such industrialization. In the small-community society before the In- dustrial Revolution, laborers often owned their own cottages, with gardens to help supplement their earnings and help feed their families during periods of unemploy- ment. Now big-city workers were crowded into dingy rented apartments and could not produce any of their own food. In addition, before the age of industry, owner and employee knew each other and might even have married into each other's families. After industrialization, however, owners and workers lived in different sections of town and moved in different social circles. In an effort to improve working condi- tions, workers organized into labor unions. In the United States, the first labor unions were formed by skilled craftspeople, such as carpenters, shoemak- ers, and printers. By 1830 most of the major crafts had \"trade societies\" in all the major northeastern cities. The trade soci- eties worked to improve the lives of their members by demanding higher wages, shorter hours, and the closed shop, a place of employment open only to union members. In some cities, different crafts joined together to form citywide federations. In 1835 the Philadelphia trade societies called a citywide strike to force the employers to grant members a 10-hour day. In addition, city trade societies from several cities formed a National Trades Union, which claimed 300,000 members. Unskilled factory workers were less suc- cessful in forming unions. Strikes could be easily broken by employers who simply hired recent immigrants to fill vacant fac- tory positions. Incentive to organize was low, too, among textile workers, many of whom were young women from poor farms. To these hardworking young women, $3 a week was good pay and a 12- or 13-hour workday not unusual. Some factory owners even provided these women with educational opportunities, comfortable quarters, and chaperones. As competition for jobs in the textile mills increased, however, conditions wors- ened, and some of the female workers decided to organize. This led to the first women's strike, which occurred in 1824 among the weavers of Pawtucket, Rhode Island. In 1833 a union for women facto- ry workers appeared in Lynn, Mas- sachusetts, followed shortly by a \"Factory Girls' Association,\" designed to include all female workers.

As Harriet Hanson Robinson wrote of an 1836 textile strike in Lowell, where she had worked as a child: It is hardly necessary to say that so far as results were concerned this strike did no good. . ..[T] hough the authorities did not accede to their demands, the majority returned to their work, and the corporation went on cutting down the wages. I Elizabeth Ann Seton 1774-1821 Elizabeth Ann Seton was 31 years old when she converted from the Epis- copal Church to Roman Catholicism. Newly widowed with five young chil- dren, she drew strength from her new faith and determined that her children would receive a Catholic education. Elizabeth Ann opened a free Catho- lic elementary school — the first in the nation — in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1809. Not only did she provide the children of newly arrived immigrants with schooling but she also led them lunch! She later founded the American Sisters of Charity, guided the Sisters into aiding the sick, founding orphan- ages, and bringing new converts to the Roman Catholic faith. In 1973, \"Mother Seton\" became the first native-born American to be declared a Roman Catholic saint. Nonetheless, such unions represented the first attempts at large-scale organizations of women workers in the United States. Demands of Labor The unions stood behind many of the demands for reform that characterized this period. No groups were more interested in the founding of public schools than the trade societies, whose members wanted to eliminate competi- tion from children in the labor market. Unions also led the movement to abolish imprisonment for being unable to pay one's debts. In the 1830s, this was a criti- cal issue. An estimated 75,000 people were thrown into jail for unpaid debts each year, often for trifling amounts. Another labor demand was for mechanics' lien (leen) laws, which would require that the wages owed to workers be the first payments a bankrupt employer would have to make. In order to obtain their goals, laborers began to enter politics. In 1829 the Workingmen's party put up candidates for local offices in New York City and won a surprising 6,000 out of 20,000 votes. This party and others like it did not last long, for they were torn apart by infighting between radicals and moder- ates and between representatives of dif- ferent unions. Professional politicians lured many workers into the major par- ties by including some of labor's demands in their platforms. The Demo- crats were especially successful in encour- aging workers to support Andrew Jackson. In 1840 Martin van Buren revealed his debt to the labor vote by establishing a 10-hour day for federal government workers. The early trade societies faced severe legal difficulties. In 1806 a Pennsylvania court ruled against a strike by Philadel- phia's shoemakers' union — the Federal Society of Journeymen Cordwainers — stating that workers organizing to force employers to raise wages constituted crim- inal conspiracy and was punishable by fines or imprisonment. This ruling became a precedent followed in other states. In 1835 employers successfully 320 Unit 4 Toward a Democracy: 1820-1 848"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"prosecuted another group of shoemakers, this time in Geneva, New York. In finding the workers guilty ot conspiracy because their trade society demanded that they be paid at least $1 to make a pair of shoes, the court said: Competition is the life of trade. If the defendants cannot make coarse boots for less than one dollar per pair, let them refuse to do so: but let them not directly or indirectly undertake to say that others shall not do the same work for less price. The legal right of trade societies to carry on collective action against employers was finally recognized in 1842 in the case of Commonwealth v. Hunt. The Mas- sachusetts Supreme Court held that an attempt by a trade society to improve the lot of its members through organized pressure, such as a strike or a boycott, might be legal it the methods employed were peaceful. This rather cautious toler- ance of trade societies had force only in Massachusetts, however, and employers were still able to use the courts to break many strikes. In any event, the decision came too late to help most of the early unions. The Panic of 1837 had already caused their collapse. Unemployment was so wide- spread that in order to avoid starvation, workers accepted whatever wages were offered. It would be nearly a generation before labor again tried to organize on a large scale. The labor movement of the Jacksonian period did secure some permanent gains, however.

Fordham British traveler in his journal, 1818 Section Focus During this time of industry, ingenuity, and migration, the people of the nation quickly adapted to the changing times. They altered production methods to take advantage of new technology. They also redefined the westward-moving frontier. In doing so these people influenced the shape of American life and society for years to come. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain how industrialization con- tributed to wider acceptance of slavery in southern states. • Describe the importance of cotton to the South. • Identify reasons for the rapid growth experienced by the Northwest. The effects of the Industrial Rev- olution were lelt in the South even earlier than they were felt in the Northeast. As British cot- ton mills produced cheaper goods for a worldwide market, they demanded more and more raw cotton. Much of this cotton came from the southern states. To pro- duce more cotton, southern planters needed a technological advancement. Plantation Slavery Before the Industrial Revolution, some southern planters profited greatly from their use of enslaved people — especially owners of large rice fields and tobacco plantations. Most other planters, however, made little profit from slave labor. Keep- ing slaves fed and clothed was costly. To prevent slaves from attempting to run away from the cruel and harsh working conditions, slaveowners had to supervise their work force continually. With Eli Whitney's cotton gin in 1793, however, slave labor was made profitable throughout the South. Because of the cot- ton gin, it was now possible to process cotton quickly, cheaply, and efficiently, thus significantly increasing production. Cotton fibers, which had to be painstak- ingly removed by hand from the seeds after it was picked, could be cleaned by Whitney's machine instead. Now, rather than cleaning 1 pound of cotton per day, a slave could clean 50. If the cotton gin was operated with water power, this total was increased to 1,000 pounds a day. British demand for cotton, as well as the increased production made possible by the cotton gin, changed southern atti- tudes toward slavery Cotton production proved to be ideally suited to the use of slave labor. The planting, hoeing, picking, and ginning all required manual labor, and slaves provided a fairly cheap source. Furthermore, most of the field work was done in groups and could thus be easily supervised. Because the growing and har- vesting of cotton continued throughout much of the year in the deep South, 322 Unit 4 Toward a Democracy: 1 820- 1 848"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Examining Illustrations The invention of the cotton gin made cotton the most important southern agricultural product. Bountiful cotton harvests, particularly in the newer growing regions of Alabama and /[/lississippi, were the basis of the South's increasing prosperity. The cultivation of cotton, however required intensive hand labor What tasks in cotton production did slaves perform? enslaved people did not have to be sup- ported through long periods of idleness. Thus, slave labor suddenly became prof- itable for cotton growers. More and more southerners began to think of slavery as a \"positive good.\" Bib- lical arguments were used to suggest that slavery was a natural institution, ordained by God. Criticism of this \"peculiar insti- tution\" virtually died out in slave states. Between the invention of the cotton gin and the beginning of the Civil War, the number of enslaved persons in the United States more than quintupled, even though slaves could not be legally imported after 1808, when the slave trade was ended. Cotton Is King Cotton fust became a major crop in South C'arolina and Georgia, but its pro- duction quickly spread throughout the South. CxJtton, however, was not the only important southern crop. The climate of the upper South was imsuited to cotton- growing. In Virginia, Kentucky, and North Carolina, tobacco was a more successful crop, and Louisiana produced sugar. And throughout the South, farmers raised corn, wheat, hogs, and cattle. Still \"Cotton is king\" was a common southern phrase that accurately reflected the importance of cotton to the South's economy. Because the South had few factories, cotton continued to be sent out of the region for manufacture. Cotton was the greatest export, not only of the South but of the nation.

Although masters forbade slaves to play horns or drums, for fear that they could be used to send messages about planned rebellions, they were permitted to sing. The repertoire of slave songs was much more extensive than the slaveowners knew. It was not uncommon for slaves to sneak out of their quarters at night for secret meetings. In these secret gatherings, slaves poked fun at their masters by telling folk tales and with songs such as \"...

How might workers today protest unfair treatment? g^gyiiTiiTi The profound influence of cotton on the South was reflected in the class struc- ture of southern society. The institution of slavery, which had been abolished in the North, led to the formation of a rigid system of social classes in the South. At the top were a tew wealthy planters, who enslaved 50 to 200 or more people and cultivated the best land. Below these rich owners was a larger class of less wealthy planters who owned medium-sized farms and usually had fewer than 20 slaves. Then there were the owners of small farms, who made up a large majority of southern farmers and owned either a few slaves or none at all. They raised crops and meat for their own needs and some cash crops, such as cotton or sugar. Near the bottom of the social scale was a class of impoverished white people, about 1 percent of the white population. They were usually illiterate and did not have regular employment, obtaining food by hunting, raising a few hogs or cows, and farming the exhausted soils for which cot- ton growers had no use. Seen as lowest on this cotton-created scale were the blacks. Ail but a few were enslaved, and nearly all performed heavy labor or menial tasks. To keep up with the demand for raw cotton, cotton plantations sprang up to the west, in the fertile \"black belt\" (so- called for its rich, black soil) of Mississip- pi and Alabama, and in the rich bottom lands along the Mississippi River and its tributaries. This westward movement of the cotton crop contributed to the popu- lation growth that led to statehood for Mississippi in 1817, for Alabama in 1819, and for Arkansas in 1836. The rapid movement of cotton produc- tion was not merely the result of the increased demands of British mills, how- ever. It also came from the movement of plantation owners, who depleted the soil by planting one cotton crop after another 324 Unit 4 Toward a Democracy: 1820-1 848"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"in the same location. When the fertility of the soil was exhausted, they had to move on. It was cheaper to migrate than to restore fertility to the earth. Many southerners, including Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and Patrick Henry, publicly condemned slavery. In 1787 many southerners even supported passage ol the Northwest Ordinance, which prohibited slavery north of the Ohio River. This same group advocated the abolition of the slave trade at the earli- est date allowed by the Constitution. Few southern planters were as enthusi- astic about treeing their slaves. Many southerners feared that if too many blacks were freed in the South, it would create new social and cultural problems for southern society. And the majoritv, as well, did not believe that freed blacks should have equality with whites. In response to these concerns, in 1817 slave- owners in Virginia, Maryland, and Ken- tucky formed the American Colonization Society, whose purpose was to plant colonies of freed slaves back in Africa, the home of the slaves' ancestors. Members of the society encouraged blacks already living as free men and women to emigrate. In 1819 Congress appropriated $100,000 to support the project, and in 1 822 the society founded the republic of Liberia — \"land of free- dom\" — on the west coast of Africa as a haven for American ex-slaves. But the society lacked funds to relocate more than a few thousand people. More important, most blacks felt that America, not Africa, was their home. One group wrote: Settlement of the Northwest Like the expanding South, the North- west Territory also experienced tremen- dous growth as pioneers poured over the Appalachian Mountains into the region, clearing and settling the land, readying it for a future as part of the United States. \"All America is moving westward,\" wrote a British traveler who passed through Pittsburgh in 1816. The census of 1820 revealed that one-fourth of the population of the United States lived west of the Appalachians.

Between 1800 and 1840, thousands upon thousands of settlers poured into the region. They came fom all sec- tions of the United States — cotton planters from the upland South, cattle and sheep farm- ers from New England, grain farmers from Vir- ginia. All were looking for new economic opportunities. 101- ^m^ Conestoga wagons, devel- oped by Penn- sylvania's German Amer- icans during the colonial era, typically carried all the family's posses- sions on their journey west. These sturdy wagons, pulled by yoked oxen, had canvas - -* '• tops. Once the pioneers had arrived at their des- tinations, their survival depended upon becoming proficient with the long-handled axe and rifle. With the axe the farmer not only cleared trees from the land, but fash- ioned the wood from those trees into cabins and crude furniture. A good rifle was essential equipment for people moving West. It was used for defense from enemies — human and otherwise — and for providing game for food. Until the 1 840s, the weapon most settlers chose was the \"Kentucky Rifle.\" With its long barrel, small bore, and accurate sights, a skilled pio- neer could split a sapling at over 200 yards. Because of the hostilities between set- tlers and Indians, settlement of the Northwest had been tentative until the end of the War of 1812. But that war resulted in the breakup of Tecumseh's Indian league and put an end to British support of the northern nations. After the defeat of the Sauk (sawk) chief Black Hawk in 1832, the Indians were driven west of the Mississippi. Perhaps the greatest lure of the North- west was vast, rich, unsettled land. According to the English economist and novelist Harriet Martineau, who made an extended tour of the United States from 1834 to 1836: The possession of land is the aim of all actions, generally speaking, and a cure for all social evils, among men in the United States. If a man is disappointed in politics or love, he goes and buys land. . ..If a citizen's neighbours rise above him in the towns, he betakes himself where he can be a monarch of all he stirveys.

From the South came independent farm- ers and impoverished whites anxious to get away from slavery and the plantation system. From the Northeast came farmers lured by tales of the almost unbelievable fertility of western lands. Eventually, Europe supplied a third stream of immi- grants, often arriving in New York or Philadelphia and traveling west by the Erie Canal or the Ohio River to the nation's frontier. Growth of Towns Farmers alone did not develop the West. They needed sawmills for lumber and flour mills for grain; barges and wag- ons to carry produce to market; mer- chants to buy it; and storekeepers to provide the goods they could not make themselves. These suppliers gathered in towns where cargo was transferred, such as Cincinnati {where three tributaries flow into the Ohio River), Louisville (at the falls of the Ohio River), and Nashville (at the head of steamship navigation on the Cumberland River). Thus, manufacturing began to develop in these cities. The largest manufacturing center in the West, however, was Pitts- burgh. Located at the site where the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers flow into the Ohio River, Pittsburgh had access to the area's mineral resources. Here were glass factories, which in 1815 produced glassware worth $235,000. The whole region benefited from Pittsburgh's iron works. In western towns, people could often make more money in manufacturing than they could on the farms. Such skilled workers as masons and wheel- wrights were so scarce that they de- manded and received high wages. Manufacturers could charge high prices because of the increasing demand for their articles and because of the cost of transporting products across or around the Appalachians. Western towns offered such prospects of wealth that selling lots in fiuure cities of the West became a standard way for speculators to take money from investors. mi » Section Two Review uuss sssvsscae EB 1 Summary Slavery became profitable after the Industrial Revolution increased demand for cotton and the cotton gin made large-scale production of cotton possible. As cotton became the South's greatest export, it led to a class system of large, slaveholding planters, small farmers, poor whites, and African Americans. Meanwhile, settlers were attracted to the Northwest: farmers by abundant fertile land, businesses and workers by demand for goods and services, and manufactur- ers by high prices. Midwest cities and towns became centers where cargo was transferred before moving to the North- west. Checking For Understanding 1.

Only in the last two hundred years has humanit) shown a fundamental revulsion toward the practice. Systems ol forced labor may be practiced secretly in a few areas. Historically, slaver\\ has taken two principal forms. Ownership of one person by another as personal property is known as chattel slav- ery. In another form, serfdom, people are tied to the land. Although not owned by others, serfs have no legal right to change occupations, their places of residence, or employers. Slaves or serfs could be of the same race as their masters or of a different race. Greeks, Romans, and medieval lords principally practiced the enslavement of peo- ple of their own race. Later, the ownership of people of another race — mainly blacks — became the rule in the Americas, where slaver)^ was practiced to an extent un- dreamed of in the ancient world. Many slave practices in the ancient world resulted from con- stant warfare. Captives taken in battle were put to work building cities, tilling fields, and erecting monuments to conquerors. Baby- lonians and Hittites had well- established laws dealing with slav- ery as early as 1750 B.C. One of the best-known stories of slavery and eventual freedom in the Mid- dle East concerns the ancient Israelites, who were held as cap- tives in Egypt. Iro7i casting from Benin showing slaves in western clothes Greece's golden age was under- pinned by slave labor. Captives were plentiful due to constant wars; Athens at its height was said to have more than 55,000 slaves and 155,000 citizens. Philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristo- tle could devote themselves to the pursuit of knowledge because the work of ordinary living was done by slaves. Roman civilization was also built on slavery. About one- third the population of the early Roman Empire consisted of slaves, but in Rome the practice took on a cruel twist. Gladiators were enslaved warriors who were forced to butcher one another for the amusement of the public. The modern English word slave comes from medieval European slave practices. So many Slavic peoples were forced into servitude by Germans that the word \"slav\" came to stand for a person in bondage. Serfdom developed in western and eastern Europe in order to allow free men to fight in bat- tle. Small landowners who could not afford the cquiprhent required for war sought the protec- tion of stronger neigh- bors and eventually became their servants. Following the voyages of Columbus to the Americas, Spanish adve- turers enslaved native Americans. By the 1 520s European traders had lirought thousands of slaves from western Africa to the Caribbean. Soon black slaves were supplying the labor force needed to develop lands in all the Americas. Not until the United States Civil War was the evil practice outlawed in this country. Making Connections 1. How is serfdom different from chattel slavery? 2.

I consider it at once as the knell of the Union. — Thomas Jefferson Letter to John Holmes, April 27, 1820 Section Focus The issue of the expansion of slavery, which caused Thomas Jefferson such grave concern, was only one issue that threatened the nations unity. Despite these issues, leaders of the United States struggled to cooperate, and the term \"compromise\" became part of the national vocabulary. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify four areas of sectional conflict. • Explain how the Missouri Compro- mise temporarily maintained a balance between slave states and free states. • Explain how John Quincy Adams won the 1824 presidential election. Given the physical differences between the regions of the United States — the harsh and unforgiving land of the Northeast, the warm, fertile soiuhern region, and the forests and mountains of the West — it is not surprising that Amer- icans in these regions had different concerns and reacted differently to important issues. How to apportion pub- lic lands, how to protect American prod- ucts, how to improve life in the United States, and what to do about slavery were questions whose resolutions would affect each region differently. Solutions to these problems would have to be reached by compromise. Points of Conflict Politicians were those who assumed the task of fmding compromises to smooth over the sectional differences that threat- ened the Union. One of the issues they tackled was public land policy. Should land be offered to settlers at a low price or a high one? Should land be opened for settlement rapidly or slowly? Should squatters, who occupied lands before they were opened for sale, have any rights to the lands they farmed? Each region of the nation had differ- ent answers to these questions. Western frontier farmers naturally favored cheap land, rapid settlement, and \"squatters' rights.\" Eastern manufacturers were opposed to such policies for fear the West would draw off their labor supply. Eastern farmers were convinced that cheap western lands would result in imfair competition. Southerners were clivided on this issue. Plantation owners wanted lands opened for sale but were opposed to \"squatters' rights,\" because the squatters might claim the best lands first. Another caustic issue was a protective tariff Should there be high tariffs to pro- tect United States industries? Or should tariffs be kept low, to allow foreign goods to come into the country cheaply? Northeastern manufacturers and laborers naturally favored protective tariffs to (^HAPri;R 10 Sl-.CIIONAI ISM AND (iKOW'l 11 329"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"ensure that American factories could com- pete successfully with foreign manufactur- ers. As southerners came to realize that their region would not become a manu- facturing center, they became more and more opposed to the system of protection. High tariffs caused them to pay more for manufactured goods. Surprisingly, the Northwest, a farming region, was the section most completely in favor of protection. This was because they thought that the growth ot industrial cities would increase the market for farm products. In addition, westerners believed that protection might encourage manu- facturing west ot the Appalachians; rev- enue from the tariffs could then be used for building much-needed roads and canals. Money was at the core of arguments over internal improvements. Should the federal government spend money to build roads and canals, or at least help states and private companies to build them? The West was overwhelmingly in favor of using federal money for such purposes because it needed roads and canals to get its goods to market. The South, with a fine river system for transportation, was opposed. The Northeast generally favored internal improvements at federal expense, partly because tariffs would be required to pay for them. Among all the issues, the extension of slavery into territories seemed to raise the most feverish emotion. Should the territo- ries be closed to slavery, following the precedent set in the Northwest Ordi- nance? Because cotton production de- manded the movement of plantations onto new lands and the plantation system depended on slave labor, southerners insisted that they be allowed to take their slaves with them anywhere but into the free states. In the northern and western states, which were not economically dependent on the slave system, there was an increasing conviction that slavery was a moral wrong. While conceding that southern states had a right to maintain slavery where it already existed, northern- ers protested it should not be allowed to be extended to the territories. To south- erners, this meant that no new slave states could be formed, and the political power of the South would decrease. These conflicting sectional interests loomed as major problems the national government had yet to address. The Missouri Compromise The question of the expansion of slav- ery became politically controversial in 1819 when Missouri applied for admis- sion to the Union as a slave state. As soon as the bill reached the floor of Congress, Representative James Tall- madge of New York proposed an amend- ment that would gradually abolish slavery in Missouri and forbid future importation of slaves into the state. His amendment stated, in part: . . . That the further introduction of slavery or involuntary servitude be prohibited. . . and that all children of slaves, born within the said state... shall be free The impact of the Tallmadge Amend- ment, if passed, was immediately appar- ent. Slavery would gradually be ended in an area where it already existed. The amendment, which passed the House on a strictly sectional vote, caused a violent outcry from southerners. The amend- ment, and with it the question of Mis- souri's admission to the Union, was held up for more than a year, while debates in Congress grew increasingly bitter. A new twist to the debate was intro- duced when Maine petitioned to be sepa- rated from Massachusetts and admitted to the Union as a free state. At this time there were 1 1 free and 1 1 slave states. Thus, slave and nonslave states were even- ly represented in the Senate, although the North's population gave it a majority in the House of Representatives. If Missouri alone were admitted, the slave states would enjoy an important advantage in 330 Unit 4 Toward a Democracy: 1820-1848"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"the Senate. However, if Maine were admitted as a free state at the same time, the bahince in the Senate would continue unchanged. Finally a compromise was reached. Mis- souri and Maine were admitted to the Union together. In the still unsettled por- tions of the Louisiana Purchase, slavery would be forbidden north of the parallel 36° 30', a line running west from the southern boundary of Missouri. This solution gave southerners their immediate goal — the admission of Mis- souri as a slave state. But the area closed to the future expansion of slavery was far greater than the area potentially open to slaveowners. The South allowed the North this advantage partly because ot a widely held belief that the prairie region west of the Mississippi River was unfit tor human settlement.

Why was his presidency not suc- cessful? Linking Across Time The Smithsonian Institution John Quincy Adams was a lite- long supporter of the arts and educa- tion. Largely through his efforts after his presiden- cy, Congress was persuaded to accept the bequest of James Smithson, an English scien- tist. Smithson left £100,000 to establish in Wash- ington, D.C., an institution \"for the increase and diffu- sion of knowl- edge.\" Today the Smithsonian Insti- tution serves the public through a zoological park, a performing arts center, several renowned muse- ums, art galleries, and research insti- tutes. . . . scarcely a year passes over our heads without bringing some new astronomical discovery to light, which we fain receive at second hand from Europe. . . . But Adams's eloquence was to no avail. His opponents ridiculed his proposals. How extravagant, they said, to spend the taxpay- ers' money on such frills. And later, when Adams and Clay proposed to send dele- gates to a Pan-American Congress called by Latin American liberator Simon Bolivar, Congress delayed action until it was too late for the United States to be represented. Adams's problems did not end when Jackson left the Senate in 1825. Although he could have strengthened his following by discharging Jackson supporters from federal jobs and filling those vacancies with people faithful to him, he refused to play politics on his own behalf Adams's strict code of propriety also prevented him from answering opponents publicly. Thus his ambitious federal programs received little support, and his power as President was neutralized by opponents in the House. The stage was set for Adams's defeat in the presidential election of 1828. fiiiifiiiimmjLiJ Section Three Review TITTIIIIIIIIfllllll Summary Differing economic interests created sectional conflicts over tour issues: public land policy, a protective tariff, internal improvements, and the spread of slavery. When Missouri petitioned to be admitted to the Union as a slave state, a major political crisis developed. In a compro- mise, Missouri was admitted as a slave state and Maine as a free state. Sectional interests also dominated the presidential election of 1824. Four Republican candi- dates, Jackson, Adams, Crawford, and Clay, split the vote along sectional lines. Because no candidate received a majority in the electoral college, the contest was thrown into the House of Representatives where Adams, with Clay's backing, was declared the winner.

The first step is to go to the hbrary to use reference works. Explanation Standard reference works are general encyclopedias, biographical dictionaries, peri- odical guides, books of quotations, atlases, and almanacs. These are found in the Reference section of the library. Each type of reference work provides specific kinds of information. General encyclope- dias are sets of books that contain relatively short articles on many subjects. Because encyclopedia reading levels and the amount of detail in content coverage vary, check several to see which appropriate for you. Biographical dictionaries offer condensed biographies of famous individuals. They are useful when you need more information than an encyclopedia provides, but less than a full biography or auto- biography. Periodical guides help you find articles in magazines and news- papers. Articles are indexed by subject or by the author's last name. Under a subject heading the entry will contain the title of the article; th e most author name(s); and the title of the publication, date, and page number(s). Periodicals that you should become familiar with as a history student are American History Illustrated, American Heritage, and Smithsonian. Period- ical guides are especially helpful when you need to have current information. Example Books of quotations contain statements by individuals. Quota- tions may be arranged by the author's last name or by subject. Make it a habit to use quotations to support your main ideas and \"add color \" to your writing. Atlases contain maps and charts, and almanacs contain statistics. Each also includes additional data that may give supporting evidence for your report. If the report is to contain illustrations, atlases and almanacs may provide ideas or suggestions. For your report on Adams, follow these steps: • Check several encyclopedias to see which one has the appro- priate reading level and best coverage of Adams. • kocatc and read about Adams in a biographical dictio- nary. Does the mate- rial add to what was in the encyclopedia? • Look up \"Adams, John Q. \" in a peri- odical guide under \"Subjects.\" With the assistance of a librar- ian, obtain the peri- odicals listed. • Locate books of quotations, and scan the index for quotes by Adams. Read them and decide if any could be used in your report. • Check atlases and almanacs on United States history or United States Presidents for illustrations or maps pertaining to Adams's administration. Practice For further practice make a list of the titles of all the reference works in your school library that you could use to complete a report on Samuel Slater and the early American textile industry.

The spirit of democracy soon would pro- vide a standard to assess candidates, affect the rules for elections, and significantly influence government decisions. The presidency of Andrew Jackson would give this spirit momentum and would itself be carried along by democracy's swelling tide. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe campaign methods used by both political parties in the election of 1828. • Summarize the life and political career of Andrew Jackson. Well before the presidential election of 1828, it was clear that President John Quincy Adams and chal- lenger Andrew Jackson would be the only candidates. Without much help from the President, Adams's supporters had built a loosely organized following, primarily in the Northeast. They tended to represent established property interests and favored nationalist legislation. Jackson's support- ers, on the other hand, included farmers of the South and West, skilled workers, and owners of small businesses. Like the Republican part)' ol Jefferson's time, Jack- sonians favored limiting federal power. The Adams supporters called themselves National Republicans, and the Jackson followers took the name Democratic Republicans, or simply Democrats. The Election of 1828 The United States in the 1820s was undergoing rapid change. Conflicting sec- tional interests and a shifting population made political forecasts difficult. In this en- vironment both political parties decided not to risk the presidential election of 1828 by taking a strong position on any issue. Instead, they focused on comparisons of the candidates' personal traits. The elec- tioneering soon turned to mudslinging. The National Republicans portrayed Jackson as a barbarian who \"misspelled every fourth word,\" a Julius Caesar who would destroy American liberties, and a \"butcher\" who had murdered a score of men. The Democrats revived the \"bargain and corruption\" smear from the 1824 election. They went on to charge that Adams had allowed the federal civil ser- vice to become scandalously dishonest and had wasted the people's money on \"gaming tables\" — actually a billiard table and a chess set bought with Adams's own money for the White House. Adams's backers went so far as to accuse Jackson of adultery based on a technicality concern- ing his wife's divorce from a former hus- band years earlier. Rachel Jackson suffered terribly from this attack and died shortly after the election — a tragedy for which Andrew never forgave the slanderers. While both parties were equally adept at misrepresentation, the Democrats found an advantage in their candidate's humble beginnings.

Andrew Jackson was such a controver- sial figure that it is difficult to find the truth between the slander of his enemies and the praise of his admirers.

In his time Jackson became almost a mythical figure. George Ban- croft, a New Englander and an ardent Democrat, wrote: Behold, then, the unlettered man of the West, the nursling of the wilds, the fanner of the Hermitage, little versed in books, unconnected by science with the tradition of the past, raised by the will of the people to the highest pinnacle of honor, to the central post of republican freedom, to the station where all the nations of the earth would watch his actions — where his words would vibrate through the civilized world, and his spirit be the moving-star to guide the nations. Jackson was elected Tennessee's first rep- resentative to Congress before the age of 30. In the War of 1812, he had been one of the few generals who could get ill- trained militia to stand up to the British redcoats. His most obvious trait was his force of will, a characteristic that became evident when someone tried to defy him. Jackson's early life was notable for vio- lent personal quarrels. He took part in five duels, once killing a man. From that encounter, a bullet lodged next to his heart remained with him tor the rest of his life, surgeons believing it too dangerous to operate. As Jackson grew older, his temper and actions became milder; by the time he reached the White House, he had become a person of dignity and courtesy. A visiting English woman at his inauguration said he looked like \"a gentleman and a soldier.\" Entering office at age 62, Jackson was tortured by several physical agonies: headaches, digestive disorders, coughing spells, and old wounds. His wife Rachel's death before the inauguration in 1829 added bereavement and loneliness. Still, his inner toughness enabled him to per- form the duties of the office with a firm and steady haiul. Section One Review tfUHUlKH P MBMi! Summary The supporters of President John Quin- cy Adams and challenger Andrew Jackson conducted a mudslinging campaign in 1828. Jackson's victory reflected signifi- cant changes in the political landscape of America. The fact that the new President was from the West, and of frontier ori- gins, indicated the growing political power of that section and the emerging influence of the \"common man\" in national politics. A newly enfranchised group of landless voters, including labor- ers and small business owners, contribut- ed to Jackson's victory. Jackson's rise from humble beginnings gave hope to many Americans in similar circumstances. For the first time able to vote, they supported \"the candidate of the people\" on election day. The President they helped elect was decisive and combative. His strong will was his great asset and also a source of great controversy. Checking For Understanding 1.

Catlin moved westward from Pennsyl- vania in 1830 and became the first painter to shape the national image ol the proud Plains Indians. During the mid 1830s, Catlin spent several sum- mers among various nati\\ c American peoples. He sa\\\\ and recorded with his brush the earthlodge villages of the Pawnees, the scalp dance of the Sioux, and the practices of Blackfoot medicine men. He was so accurate and detailed in his paintings that descendants of those he immortalized easily recognized their ancestors. By 1840 Catlin had made almost 500 portraits and sketches. He established Catlin's Indian Gallery, a traveling exhibition ol painting, costumes, and artifacts that toured major cities in Great Britain and France as well as the United States. During the 1850s Catlin traveled to South America and to the Pacific coast of North America and recorded the appear- ances, surroundings, and ways of life of the native Americans of these regions. Many of the thou- sands ol paintings Catlin produced can be viewed in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and in the American Museum ol I'hi Ligl't Natural History in New York. Through his work, Catlin came to realize that traditional tribal life was doomed to destruction from whiskey, disease, and forcible re- moval from ancestral lands. His paintings record a way of lite oblit- erated by the constant march of white expansion during the nine- teenth century. They are a highly valuable primary source of in- formation for more than 40 Indian nations. The two-pose painting shown here is of Wi-jun-jon, or Pigeon's Egg Head — also known as The Light — the son of an Assiniboin chief that Catlin painted in 1832. The Assiniboin lived on the northern Plains and were distant relatives of the Dakota Sioux.

Jacksonian democracy is also defined by the political optimism of his time. It was a period of celebration for the rights of the \"common man. \" Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • List three important democratic changes that developed during this period. • Describe attitudes toward native Amer- icans and African Americans during this period. As the time for Jackson's inaugu- ration approached, thousands of his admirers poured into Washington. They slept five or six to a bed; when no more beds were to be had, they spent the night on sofas, billiard tables, and floors. Seized with lear, dignified Washingtonians thought of Rome, overrun by hordes of barbarians. Outgoing President John Quincy Adams left the capital rather than attend the cere- mony that, in his opinion, might mean the end ol the republic. The People's Government Some Americans thought Jackson would turn the inauguration into a grand military pageant. Instead he followed Jefferson's precedent and walked to the inaugural cer- emony. His hands shook as he quietly read a cautious and colorless address. What hap- pened later, however, seemed to justify those who had gloomily predicted that Jackson's election meant the reign of \"King Mob.\" Following the address at the Capi- tol, Jackson rode on horseback to the White House, surrounded by a cheering crowd. There a reception had been pre- pared for invited guests and important offi- cials only. The crowd, however, began to push inward. Chairs and china were bro- ken. Admirers pressed around Jackson so heavily that he had to be helped to escape through a back window. Some of the crowd was influenced to leave the presiden- tial mansion when buckets of punch were placed on the White House lawn. During the Jackson era the American def- inition of democracy and popular expecta- tions of the political system changed greatly. Americans had always believed it possible tor common people to climb up the social ranks through hard work and thrift:. One of their rewards might be a voice in political affairs. Now, however, politicians sought the support of ordinary voters. Before Jackson's time, voters expected public officials to use their own best judg- ment. Now they came to believe that offi- cials should act according to the demands of the people. To make government respond more directly to popular will, state and local governments began to fill some positions such as judges, constables, and public surveyors by election rather than appointment. The terms of office were also shortened so that popular opin- ion had a more direct effect on the actions of elected officials. Ci lAi' lER 1 1 Act.

As national parties built stronger state and local ties, they began to rely upon a growing number of profession- al or career politicians. These changes helped to initiate the spoils system, the practice of appointing people to govern- ment positions on the basis of party loyal- ty and party service. This was not an entirely new development; George Wash- ington had often used the support of Fed- eralist principles as a test for appointment. But Jackson was the first to oust large numbers of government employees in order to appoint his followers to office. He based his action on the principle that there should be rotation in office — a point he emphasized in his first state of the union message: The duties of all public officers are. ..so plain and simple that men of intelligence may readily qualify themselves for their performance; and I cannot but believe that more is lost by the long continuance of men in office than is generally to be gained by their experience.

A contemporary observer not unfriendly to Jackson noted that \"office-seeking and office-getting was becoming a regular business, where impu- dence [boldness] triumphed over worth.\" Jackson amplified presidential power by using the veto more than all previous Presidents. He was also one ot the first Presidents to use the pocket veto, killing a bill by taking no action on it and wait- ing for Congress to adjourn. Jacksonian democracy did not offer women suffrage, but women did make some gains in rights and liberties. Emma Willard, Catharine Beecher, and Mary Lyon established female academies, pro- moting education among women. By 1850 most white women were literate, a major change from the eighteenth centu- ry. And in the 1830s some states passed the first women's property acts, guarantee- ing women the right to control property. Native Americans and African Americans Jacksonian democracy had nothing to otter two oppressed minorities — native Americans and Atrican Americans. The administrations under Jackson and his successor, Martin Van Buren, pursued an Indian policy begun by Jetferson — remov- ing these peoples to territory west ot the Mississippi River. In an annual message to Congress in 1835, Jackson explained: t* PO, All preceding experiments for the improvement of the Indians have failed. It seems now to be an established fact that they cannot live in co)itact with a civilized community and prosper. ...A country West of Missouri and Arkansas has been assigned to them, into which the white settlements are not to be pushed.

He never learned English, but he was fascinated by the \"talking leaves\" ot books. He was convinced that reading and writ- ing gave whites power. After being disabled by an accident, he dedicated himselt to creating written symbols for the Cherokee language. At first, Sequoya tried to create sim- ple pictures to represent Cherokee words, but later he developed 86 sym- bols to represent all syllables in Cherokee speech. He then had his six- year-old daughter demonstrate his sys- tem of reading and writing to Cherokee leaders.

Jackson, and later President Van Buren, spoke ot protecting the Indians trom traud and ot how humane and just the government's removal policy was, but the policy as carried out was cruel. In Georgia the Cherokee had developed a comfortable lifestyle that included schools, mills, and turnpikes. In the 1820s, under pressure trom the state ot Cieorgia to give up their lands, they wrote a constitution, hired lawyers, and sued in the Supreme Court. C'hiet Justice John Marsh.ill upheld the rights ot the Cherokee against the state ot Ceorgia.

Forced to move from their homes to what is now Arkansas and Oklahoma, an estimated 4,000 died of starvation, disease, or expo- sure on the march that the Cherokee called the \"Trail of Tears.\" Another tragedy took place in Illinois. The Sac and Fox people were forced to move to Iowa where the Sioux and the settlers both harassed them. In 1832 Black Hawk, the Sac and Fox leader, moved them back into Illinois to recover their old lands. When farmers in Illinois panicked, the state militia trapped and massacred Black Hawk's entire group. By 1 840 the government had moved the few native Americans still living east of the Mississippi to reservations, except for the Seminole of Florida. After years of fighting, Osceola, their chief was captured and later died in prison. Some Seminole settled deep in the Everglades, where they remain today. Although most citizens supported Jack- son's Indian removals, a few National Republicans, like Henry Clay, said that Jackson's attitude stained the nation's honor. Missionary-minded religious de- nominations, especially Methodists and Quakers, denounced the harsh treatment of native Americans, but these voices were a small minority. In the South, the cotton culture had firmly established the institution of slavery in the 1830s, and criticism of the system became increasingly unwise. Those who spoke out against slavery were highly un- popular and risked physical harm. In the North, blacks were free, but were generally second-class citizens. The debates of the 1 820s leading to the Missouri Compromise had shown the slav- ery issue to be so explosive that a policy called \"the great silence\" began, and discus- sion of slavery as a national issue faded. Anti-slavery literature was often barred from the mails. From 1836 to 1844 anti- slavery petitions to Congress were automat- ically \"laid on the table\" — that is, ignored. Jackson did not oppose these policies, even though he himself was a slaveowner. ****** Section Two Review »»»» Summary In several ways, Jackson's election repre- sented a kind of revolution in American politics. Jackson did not create Jacksonian democracy, but in his time the voting rights were extended to ordinary people, and he drew his political strength from this trend. In addition, Jackson extended the power of the presidency with his \"spoils system\" and his use of the veto. As common people exercised increasing political power, they came to expect their ofTicials to implement the voters' wishes, and more offices became elective. Despite the growth of democracy, women, African Americans, and native Americans did not benefit from it. The fortunes of these three groups in society remained for the most part largely in the hands of the white male majority. Checking For Understanding 1. Identify John Marshall, Black Hawk, Osceola 2.

Westerners believed that Jackson would favor internal improve- ments and curb the power of the Bank of the United States while inflating the cur- rency. Southern Democrats began to oppose high tariffs and national spending on internal improvements. The northeast- ern wing of the party was split on the tar- iff issue, but strongly opposed inflationary money policies. It was a setting ripe lor conflict. Debates on these issues would test Jackson's leadership even as they strained the federal system of government. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify the various sectional interests of the nation in this period. • Explain how the tariff and nullification issue developed into a crisis. Botii supporters and opponents were interested in President jatk- soii's position on such matters as intern, il itnprovements, tariffs, and banking, in his first term of offlce, Jackson made bokl decisions on these issues — sometimes delighting, sometimes dismaying, fellow Democrats. Jackson surprised the West with his answer to the issue of federally financed roads. Congress had passed a bill promis- ing to pay for half the cost of extending the Cumberland Road inside the state of Kentucky. This legislation, known as the Maysville Road bill, was vetoed by Jack- son. He said that the Constitution did not grant the federal government power to spend money on local transportation — the road was to be entirely inside one state. In his veto message he explained that grants of federal money: [HJave always been professedly under the control of the general principle that the works which might be thus aided should be \"of a general not local national not state, \" character A disregard of that distinction would of necessity lead to the subversio>i of the federal system. The fact that the proposed extension was to be inside the home state of Henry Clay, Jackson's chief political adversary, proba- bly influenced his strict interpretation of the Constitution. Sectional Issues The Northeast and the West were divid- ed over federal land policy. Senator Samuel A. Foot of Connecticut represent- ed eastern manufacturers who were wor- ried about losing their labor supply. In 1830 he proposed a limit on western land sales, to discourage people from tnoving west. Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri angrily attacked Foot for pro- moting the interests of the Northeast at the expense of the West. Senator Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina supported Benton. In several days of debate, senators from both the South and the Northeast attempted to win the support of western politicians. With Vice President C Calhoun of South (Carolina presiding, 1 layne and Daniel Webster of Massachusetts eventu- ally engaged in a full-scale discussion of Chai'ii-.r 11 Agi. e)i Jac;k,son 349"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"Examining Illustra- tions During the Web- ster-Hayne debate in the Senate, Daniel Webster argued that the Union was a national government of all peo- ple in all states, and if it passed laws that infringed on the rights of the states, the Supreme Court would declare the laws uncon- stitutional. What was Robert Hayne's major argument? Linking Across Time Tariffs Today Like manufac- turers in the early 1800s, American business firms con- tinue to demand protective tariffs on cheaper foreign imports that hurt profits. In 1987, however, Harley- Davidson, the only motorcycle maker in the United States, requested that a 1983 tariff' against Japanese motorcycles be lift- ed early. The tariff, which they origi- nally requested, had so improved business, that pro- tection was no longer needed. Frequently, howev- er, Congress extends such tariffs for several years beyond the initial time limit. many of the issues. When the debate turned to the question of the tariff, the resulting crisis threatened the federal Union. It also affected Calhoun's political career because many of the ideas expressed by Hayne were originally written in an essay published anonymously by the Vice President. Webster's political career followed a course exactly opposite Calhoun's. Calhoun had been a War Hawk during the War ot 1812. Webster opposed the war, even to the extent ot considering nullification, or mak- ing null and void lederal laws calling lor raising troops. When Calhoun supported nationalist legislation after the war, Webster supported the Northeast. By 1830, howev- er, the two reversed positions. To preserve his political future in South Carolina, Cal- houn changed his views. South Carolina was suffering Irom low cotton prices and a depressed economy. Calhoun cotild no longer support high tariffs because the peo- ple of his home state believed that high tar- iffs were a cause of their local economic problems. Opposing the tarifl, Calhoun became a states' rights advocate, while Web- ster's support for a protective tariff made him lavor a strong federal government. A man of imposing appearance — it was said no man cotild be as great as Webster looked — the senator from Massachusetts was also the greatest orator of his day. In a \"Sec- ond Reply to Hayne,\" he pointed out that nullification could only mean the end of the Union. Webster said the Union was not a creature of the states: it was the people's gov- ernment, forged for their own welfare and meant to endure. Thousands of copies of the speech were published. School children memorized the closing paragraph with the famous final words: \"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!\" The antitariff forces rallied around Cal- houn's ideas published anonymously in a work called The South Carolina Exposi- tion. Calhoun denounced the tariff of 1828, claiming that it made the South a servant of northern industrialists. In brief, Calhoun's argument was that the federal government was created by a compact, or contract among the states. Each state gave up only such powers as were expressly granted in the Constitution. If the federal government passed laws that infringed on the remaining state powers, each individu- al state, not the Supreme Court, had the right to decide whether or not that federal law was constitutional. A state could declare the law null and void within its own borders. Behind this doctrine of nul- lification lurked the threat to secede from the Union. The nullification issue moved the debate to the broad and potentially dan- gerous issue of the nature of the federal Union. The Tariff of 1832 would threaten the Union by pushing South Carolina to the brink of secession. The protective tariff of 1816 was not cost- ly enough to satisfy American manufactur- ers. In response to their demands, duties on imported manufactures and on some raw materials were raised twice more — in 1824 and 1828. These laws aroused increasing resentment in the South, especially in South Carolina where the cotton economy was depressed. Increased cotton production on rich lands farther west had reduced cotton prices.

When the news of the Tariff of 1828, called by its enemies the \"Tariff of Abomi- nations,\" reached Charleston, people were indignant. Flags were hung at half-mast; col- lege students threatened to buy no northern goods; and there was talk of leaving the Union. But South Carolina held back from formal action against the Tariff of 1828 because John C. Calhoun, the states leading politician, was Andrew Jackson's running mate for Vice President. Calhoun's influence in a new administration might bring about tariff reduction. The Nullification Crisis Which side would Jackson take in the argument over nullification? Southerners hoped that the President, a slaveholder and planter himself, would support their interests. Jackson's first annual message to Congress in December 1829 had raised the hopes of the states' rights defenders. The President warned Congress against \"all encroachments upon the legitimate sphere of state sovereignty, \" a position that also signaled his veto of the Maysville Road bill in 1830. The nullifiers tried to get Jackson to show his hand at a dinner celebrating lef- ferson's birthday on April 13, 1830. Con- trolling the committee in charge of the banquet, they had antitariff and nullifica- tion toasts printed on the menu. It was hoped that the President would fall into the mood of the occasion. But Jackson chose the national interest over the states. When his turn came, the old warrior asked everyone to rise, looked straight at Calhoun, and proposed a toast that echoed Webster: \"Our Federal Union: it must be preserved. \" Calhoun, pale and trembling, responded, \"Our Union, next to our liberty, the most dear. \" The break between Jackson and Calhoun over nullification was personal as well as political.

Of the cabinet members, only Martin Van Buren, a widower, could afford to be pleasant to Peggy Eaton. Jackson, remembering his own wife's suffering from social slander, stopped meeting with most of his cabinet advisers. Jackson's final break with Calhoun came when he discovered that, years earlier, Calhoun had wanted to have \"Old Hickory\" censured for mistreat- ment of the Indians in Florida. From this point on. Van Buren became Jackson's choice to succeed him in office. In 1 832 Congress passed a new tariff law. The rates, while lower than those of 1828, were still high. South Carolina immediately called a special convention that passed an Ordinance of Nullification declaring that the tariff was \"null, void, and no law, nor binding upon this state, its officers, or its citizens.\" The ordinance threatened seces- sion, and the state began to arm and drill a volunteer military force. In response, Jackson issued a \"Procla- mation to the People of South Carolina,\" pointing out that nullification meant dis- union and disunion meant treason. Pri- vately, he warned Senator Hayne that if there was bloodshed he would hang the first nullificationist he could get his hands on from the first tree he could find. Hayne resigned from the Senate to become governor ol South Carolina and Calhoun resigned the vice-presidency to lead the fight in the Senate. Compromise settled the nullification crisis. Jackson asked Congress to pass a Force Bill to give him the powers necessary to suppress disunion in South Carolina. While Congress debated the measure, Henry Clay introduced a compromise tar- iff bill. It provided for gradual scaling down ol duties to the 1816 level. The Tar- iff of 1833, supported by both Webster and Calhoun, and the Force Bill were passed the same day. Thus Congress removed South Carolina's grievance about the tariff and at the same time denied its right to nullity a law. South Carolina with- drew its Ordinance of Nullification, claim- ing it had won its major purpose — lowering the tariff. ax Section Three Review Summary Opposing sectional interests continued to divide the countrv over tariffs, internal improvements and money policies. States' rights versus national power became a major controversy, especially after a series of tariffs led to the Ordinance of Nullifica- tion in South Carolina. John C. Calhoun, a South Carolina states' rights advocate who opposed Jackson's nationalist policies, resigned as Vice President after Jackson threatened to respond to nullification with force.

Working)nen thrown out of employ by the hundreds daily. — George Templeton Strong Student at Columbia University, from his diary, 1837 Section Focus The national debates over internal improvements and tariffs divided the country along sectional and economic lines. Although the threats of nullification and secession were real, leaders in Congress managed to compromise on these issues. The fight over the Second Bank of the United States, however, divid- ed business interests from labor, creditors from debtors, and commercial interests from agriculture. Instead of compromise, this issue caused panic and depression. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • List the main arguments regarding the Second Bank of the United States. • Explain the role ot the Bank in the elec- tion of 1832. At the time the (lueslion of nulli- fication was dividing the nation, Jackson was also engaged in a dramatic struggle with the Bank ol the United States. C^hariered in 1816, the \"B.U.S.,\" as it was nicknamed, was a useful institution. Like the original Bank of the United States, it performed much ol the financial business of the country and controlled the supply of currency. Popular Distrust of Banks Despite its importance, the Bank had many enemies who called it such names as \"Monster,\" \"Octopus,\" and \"Mammoth of the East.\" Opposition came from smaller banks chartered by state legislatures, because the B.U.S. was a powerful com- petitor, and because it prevented state banks from lending too freely. Another group, mostly farmers, were against all banks. They believed the only honest cur- rency was \"hard money\" — silver and gold. Farmers respected real wealth — corn, hogs, grain, cotton, tobacco — and resented pay- ing tribute to those who controlled paper wealth, such as mortgages and bank notes. The Bank also suffered because of a rising feeling against monopolies. Although 80 percent of the Bank of the United States was owned by private individuals, it enjoyed a monopoly of all government business. State legislatures granted somewhat similar privi- leges to state banks and also made mon- opoly grants to companies running toll bridges, steamship lines, and turnpikes. Feeling against this sort of privilege was strong in the Northeast among small busi- nesses and workers who believed that monopolistic charters created an unfair ad- vantage. They made certain people wealthy and kept others from acquiring property. Thomas Sedgwick, a writer and typical Jack- sonian, argued that the right to incorporate and to issue paper money should belong to everyone, not just banking monopolies: Will it be said that money would not have been loaned if the legislature had not granted any exclusive privilege of doing it to a certain number of individuals^ No!

A new president, Nicholas Biddle of Philadelphia, beginning in 1819 made improvements that helped to enhance the Bank's reputation. Sound investments, high dividend rates for its stockholders, and a sense of responsibility to serve the government had made the Bank a respect- ed institution among business and com- mercial interests. Poorer people, especially in the South and West did not share this opinion, how- ever. Farmers, wishing easy credit, were unhappy with the Bank's strict lending policies. Laborers in the East disliked the paper currency issued by the Bank because it caused higher prices. Jackson, like most westerners, was a hard-money man who distrusted all banks and all paper money. While the President believed that high finance was dangerous, he also remembered that the Bank had opposed his candidacy in 1828 and had refused jobs and loans to his supporters. For the first three years of his presiden- cy, however, Jackson took no action against the Bank except to express the opinion that it had too much power. The President's inaction may have encouraged Nicholas Biddies supporters to use the difference of opinion on the Bank issue to challenge Jackson in the election of 1832. The National Republicans fired the first shots in the bank war when they decided to make the Bank the main issue of the 1832 election. In the summer of 1832, Henry Clay, the hkely presidential chal- lenger, introduced a bill to give the Bank a new charter, even though the old one did not run out imtil 1836. Clay hoped to embarrass Jackson by forcing him either to sign a bill he disliked or to veto it. He did not believe Jackson could defend a veto in the presidential campaign. When Congress passed the Recharter Bill, Jack- son remarked, \"The Bank, Mr. Van Buren, is trying to kill me; but I will kill it.\" His veto message to Congress showed little knowledge ot banking but great understanding of why many people dis- liked the B.U.S. Jackson wrote that the Bank favored the few against the many; it made \"the rich richer and the potent more powerful.\" He called it un-American because more than a quarter of its valuable stock had been purchased by foreigners. Finally, he said it was an overextension of federal power because the Constitution nowhere explicitly granted the federal government the right to establish a central bank. Jackson's veto was so sharp that Nicholas Biddle described it as having \"all the fury of a chained panther biting the bars of his cage. \" Bank forces cam- paigned hard for Henry Clay, hiring speakers, subsidizing newspapers, printing handbills that included Jackson's veto, and spending a lot ol money. Clay and Daniel Webster campaigned hard across the country countering the speeches of Jack- son supporters. Election of 1832 The Bank issue did determine the pres- idential election, but not in the way Henry Clay anticipated. The National Republicans accused Jackson of \"ap- pealing to the worst passions of the uninformed part of the people and en- deavoring to stir up the poor against the rich.\" They produced arguments to show the value of the Bank to the nations finances. But the bank issue backfired. Jackson's veto message appealed to a majority of the people. When the returns were counted, they showed that Jackson had won an overwhelming victory. He received 687,000 popular votes to Clay's 530,000 and carried the electoral college by 219 to 49. The election of 1832 introduced a new method of nominating candidates. A new minor parry called the Anti-Masons ran a slate of candidates that it had selected at a national nominating convention. Previ- ously, nominations had been made either by state legislatures or by a caucus of party members in Congress. The Anti-Masons' procedure, giving more people a role in presidential nominations, was soon adopt- ed by the major parties and has been fol- lowed ever since. 354 Unit 4 Toward a Democracy: 1820-1848"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"Connections H STORY Banks and the Money Supply In the 1800s a bank served three func- tions in the community: it provided a secure place to deposit gold and silver coins; it loaned its deposits to individuals and local businesses; and it issued paper notes to borrowers — the value on each bank note representing a like amount of m ^ jsamatm />:' -hrii) V,- // / An early hank note issued by the Bank of the United States.

But the interest on loans was profit, and by issuing more notes, banks could loan many times the specie in their vaults. If enough people who held a bank's notes wanted hard cash, however, all its assets would be paid out and its depositors' funds would be lost. The Second Bank of the United States sought to regulate the nation's economy by controlling bank notes. By purchasing huge amounts of notes and redeeming them at the issuing banks, the B.U.S. could exhaust the assets of unsound banks and force them to close. But even this crude centr;il banking system ended when the B.U.S. lost its charter. Not until the Feder- al Reserve System was created in 1913 was banking brought under effective control.

Although the law required funds of the federal govern- ment to be deposited in the Bank, Jackson resolved to remove them. This required an order from the secretary of the treasury. Two secretaries resigned rather than sign the order. Finally a third secretary agreed, and the government began to gradually withdraw deposits from the vaults of the B.U.S. New funds from taxation and land sales were placed in strong state banks thai National Republicans scornfully called \"pet banks. \" I he removal ot the deposits caused a great outcry among Jackson's opponents, who branded the action imconstitutional. Nicholas Biddle, president of the Bank, claimed that removal of the deposits forced him to call in its loans and stop lending. Biddies policy created such a scarcity ot credit that hundreds of busi- ness people were driven into bankruptcy and scores of banks failed. Factories closed down and workers were laid off Since Jackson had vetoed the Bank bill, business people sent petitions urging him to save the country from depression. Fhe President replied, \"Go to Nicholas Bid- die!\" Eventually, Democrats shifted the blame to Biddle, arguing that if one man at the head of a private institution could drive the country into depression, then lackson was right in saying the Bank had too much power.

Congress stimulated the boom by issuing $30 million in sur- plus funds to the states, triggering a host of internal improvement schemes in turnpikes, canals, and railroads. The Panic of 1837 The free spending, speculation, and resulting inflation worried Jackson's hard- money supporters. Jackson decided to halt the trend by issuing the Specie Circular, ordering that all payments for public lands be in silver or gold. This drastic reversal of policy virtually stopped land sales, eliminated easy credit, and helped bring on a severe panic and depression in 1837. Jackson's victory over the Bank had appeared to be a victory for free enter- prise. It encouraged a movement toward \"free banking\" laws that permitted any individual or group to establish a state- chartered bank as long as certain regula- tions designed to protect the depositors and the public were observed. Compa- rable to free bank legislation were the general incorporation laws, which were designed to allow all businesspeople to form corporations on the same terms. Jacksonians wanted to free business from government controls and to allow business concerns to succeed on the basis of efficiency rather than on special favors. While Jackson increased the power of the presidency, he believed his mission was to reduce the sphere of the central government, reflecting the laissez-faire philosophy that the Jacksonians inherit- ed from Thomas Jefferson. But the war against the Bank of the United States reduced confidence in the banking sys- tem and removed government controls over speculation, inflation, and rapid expansion. The administration's erratic policies proved that leaders had much to learn about government's role in a free economy. Soon Democrats would learn that in times of depression, the party in power loses the presidential election. *****••*•** Section Four Review • *<k**************** Summary The Bank of the United States stabilized the nation's economy by controlling the supply of currency and by preventing smaller banks from lending too freely. It drew opposition from other banks, bor- rowers, and even hard-money advocates. Having vetoed a bill to extend the Bank's charter, Jackson won re-election in 1832. He then withdrew government funds from the Bank, which tightened credit, causing widespread business failures and unemployment. The return to easy credit made possible by Jackson's final destruc- tion of the Bank led to overspeculation and inflation. Jackson responded by issu- ing the Specie Circular, ordering that pay- ment for public land be in gold or silver. This policy reversal dried up credit again and set the stage for the Panic of 1837.

Taking their name from the British party that in the eighteenth centu- ry had resisted the power ot the Crown, they fought the growth of presidential power under \"King Andrew I.\" Their principal leaders were Clay and Webster. The Whig party succeeded in electing two presidents, but both died in office and the party itself split over slavery in the 1850s. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • List three causes of the panic and depression of 1 837. • Explain why the government became ineffective under President Tyler. As the election ol 1836 ap- proached, Jackson used his control of the Democratic party to pick his successor. His choice was Martin Van Buren, the Vice President, a New York politician whose reputation for craftiness earned him the nickname \"the Fox of Kinderhook.\" The Whigs were so divided they could not agree on one candidate. Instead, they nominated three favorite sons, or leading politicians from different states, hoping to divide the electoral college vote. If they could prevent Van Buren from getting a majority, the election would be thrown into the House of Representatives, con- trolled by the Whigs. Jackson's continuing popularity and the nation's perceived pros- perity were enough to give the Democrats the election. Van Buren won 170 electoral votes against a combined total ot 124 votes for all his opponents, although his edge in the popular vote was small. Panic and Depression Van Buren had hardly taken office when the country was hit by the panic ot 1837 and one of the most severe depres- sions in American history. Jackson's Specie Circular had sent the economy into a tail- spin, but like most depressions, that of 1837 had several causes. One factor was a withdrawal of British investments. British gold and silver deposits in American banks had supported American economic growth in the 1830s. In 1837 Great Britain suffered from hard times, and British investors became more cautious. As British and American investors in state banks withdrew deposits, banks failed. There was no Bank of the United States to restore confidence in the bank- ing system. People hoarded their gold and silver, merchandise went unsold, crops found no markets, and businesses closed. Thousands of farmers lost their farms through mortgage foreclosures. Unem- ployment soared among eastern factory workers, and work on canals and railroads nearly ceased. As the depression deepened, workers fought (wer the meager relief that ciry governments provided. Today, faced with such a crisis, the people would demand action by the federal govern- ment, and the feileral government would respond with legislation.

Why did the Whigs choose Harrison as their presidential candidate? governments had helped to cause the depression, Ltissez-faire philosophers said it was not the function of the government to do much about the problem. Van Buren emphasized this in his inaugural address when he said that \"all communities are apt to look to government for too much.\" His one great legislative effort was to try to get the federal government entirely out of bank- ing. He shared Jackson's disapproval of a great central bank like the B.U.S., but rec- ognized that depositing federal funds in pet banks had also failed. Van Buren proposed an Independent Treasury System, under which the federal government would collect its taxes in specie to be stored in vaults throughout the country. Federal expenditures would be paid in specie, making federal credit literally as good as gold. This would dis- courage inflated bank notes because state banks would have to keep a sufficient reserve to allow their depositors and those holding their notes to do business with the government. The Independent Trea- sury Act successfully passed in 1840. \"Log Cabin\" Campaign of 1840 The Whigs eagerly looked forward to the election of 1 840, even though they were so divided on major issues that they did not even try to write a platform, or statement of beliefs. Their campaign plan was simple: nominate a military hero and attack Van Buren. For their presidential candidate they passed over known leaders of the party and chose General William Henry Harrison, whose principal attraction was that he had fought Indians at the batde of Tippecanoe in 1811. Nicholas Biddle warned that Har- rison should not make speeches: Let him say not one single word about his principles, or his creed — let him say nothing — promise nothing. Let no committee, no convention, no town meeting ever extract from him a single word about ivhat he thinks nor what he will do hereafter. Let the use of pen and ink be u 'holly forbidden. 358 Democrats jeered that all Harrison was fit for was to sit in front of a log cabin, drink hard cider, and draw a pension. The Whigs adopted the very methods the Jacksonians had used against Adams in 1828. Harrison — born to wealth and social position — was pictured as a simple frontiersman, while Van Buren — born in humble circumstances — was portrayed as a champagne-drinking aristocrat with cologne-scented whiskers. John Tyler, a former Democrat who had left the party in protest over Jackson's nullification poli- cy, was selected as Harrison's running mate. The 'Whigs' campaign slogan became \"Tippecanoe and Tyler too.\" Blaming the Democrats for the depres- sion, the Whigs boasted that Van Buren's policy was \"fifty cents a day and French soup; our policy — two dollars a day and roast beef.\" The result of this rollicking campaign was a decisive victory for Harri- son — 234 electoral votes to 60 — although the popular vote was quite close. The election of 1840 was the first to illustrate a recurring principle of Ameri- can politics: during a depression, the party in power is likely to be punished at the polls. Twelve years before, when Jackson defeated Adams, a little more than 50 per- cent of the eligible voters went to the polls. In 1840 nearly 80 percent of those Unit 4 Toward a Democracy: 1 820- 1 848"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"eligible voted — in some states almost 90 percent.

Tyler and the Whigs SpHt While the Whigs gained office by ignor- ing differences and discrediting Van Buren, once in power they had to address the diverse needs of the nation. Henry Clay, now in the Senate, had worked out a legislative program designed to appeal to as many different interests as possible. The elderly Harrison was expected to be a figurehead, while Clay and Webster ran the parry. But just a month after his inauguration. President Harrison died of pneumonia. John Tyler of Virginia became the first Vice President to become President by the death of the incumbent. Placed on the Whig ticket simply to attract southern support, Tyler was opposed to most of the Clay and Webster programs. They were nationalists; the new President was a believer in states' rights. Nevertheless, he did sign the first of several bills in Clay's program. The Tariff of 1 842 pleased east- ern manufacturers by raising the rates to about what they had been ten years earli- er. The Pre-emption Act of 1841 satisfied the western demand that \"squatters\" on public lands have first right to buy the lands they had settled. Tyler, however, vetoed a bill establishing another national bank and vetoed a second bill that was drawn up to meet his objections. In dis- gust at the President's actions, all the Whigs except Daniel Webster resigned from the cabinet, and Clay resigned from the Senate. Divided, without a program or leadership, the Whigs lost heavily in the congressional elections of 1842, and John lyler became a President without a party. Yet, while Jacksonian democracy finally had proven powerless to solve the nation's growing sectional stalemate, the democratic spirit comiiuKd to show great promise in addressing the nation's social IKCtls.

More offices became elective. Jacksonian democracy, however, did not extend to native Americans, African Americans, or women. Despite his belief in limited federal powers, Jackson extended presidential power through the spoils system and frequent use of the veto. When states rights versus national power became an issue, Jackson supported the national government and responded forcefully when South Carolina tried to nullify the federal tariff law. Jackson also asserted presidential authority in his struggle with the Second Bank of the United States. His destruction of the Bank's power eventually led to panic and depression in 1837, causing widespread business failure and unemployment. But these were the problems of the new President, Martin Van Buren, who attempted to restore economic stability. The Whig party was organized in these troubled times and elected William Henry Harrison President in 1840. After Harrison's death on April 4, 1841, John Tyler, his successor, clashed with the Whigs\" nationalist pro- gram. * Using Vocabulary Use the following terms in writing a short essay about presidential leadership style. platform pocket veto spoils system * Reviewing Facts 1.

When he isn't there by 8, you begin to won- der why: Is he lost? Was he in an accident? When your triend finally arrives, you express your concern about his lateness. But instead of offering an explanation he responds, \"How do you like my car? We're going to make a really great impression tonight.\" You reply, \"That's irrelevant. \" An important part of critical thinking is being able to distinguish relevant from irrelevant information. Relevant information is information that deals with the main topic or idea. Irrelevant information is informa- tion that does not deal with the main idea. In the above case, the car's appearance is irrelevant because the topic of discussion was that your friend was late and not the car. The impression that the car will make has nothing to do with your friend's lateness. Ihc following guitlclitus will help \\c>u to disiin- guish between relevant and irrelevant information in written material: • Read the material, and determine the main idea, or topic of discussion. • For each statement, determine if it relates directly to the topic by asking yourself if the statement defines, explains, illustrates, serves as an example, or describes a cause or consequence of the topic. • Any statement that does not do one of the things named in the second guideline is information that is irrelevant. Example These guidelines are used to tell the differ- ence between relevant and irrelevant information in the following paragraph.

With this din of opinion and debate there was a keener scrutiny of institutions and of domes- tic life than any we have known — — Ralph Waldo Emerson American poet and essayist, 1803-1882 Section Focus The \"keener scrutiny of institutions\" to which Emerson referred meant that Americans were examining their society on the basis of ideas in the Declaration ol Independence. During the early 1800s, many Americans in search of a better, more democratic world formed organiza- tions to persuade others to their way of thinking. Perhaps never before or since the Jacksonian period have Americans shown such optimistic faith in improving the quality of life. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify improvements in education made in the 1800s. • Discuss the obstacles to establishing public schools. A hhough the idea of universal education had a long history, dating back as tar as the Mas- sachusetts General School Act of 1647, public school systems had not developed adequately. As late as 1834, 250,000 of the 400,000 children in Penn- sylvania did not attend school. In the 1830s and 1840s, however, there was a tremendous increase in the number of tax-supported schools. Public Education The drive for public education was root- ed in the vision of the United States as a land of equal opportunity. To deny a child education was to close the door to it. As more people gained the right to vote, the need for education grew. Nonwhites, women, and white men without property had all been denied the vote in the early days of the Republic. In the 1820s and 1830s, however, most states amended their laws, extending the vote to white men who did not own land. In addition, it became necessary to educate the increasing number of immigrants who came to the United States in the mid- 1800s. Thus, the increase in the number of eligible voters became a compelling rea- son for free public education. Democracy demanded an informed, educated elec- torate, a goal not easy to achieve. One legislator who tackled this goal was Horace Mann. As president of the Mas- sachusetts Senate, he pressed for public education and signed a bill in 1837 creat- ing a state board of education in Mas- sachusetts. He then stepped down from his post to serve as secretary of the state board of education. During his 12 years in that position, he doubled teachers' salaries, opened 50 new high schools, grouped students by grades, and estab- lished schools for teacher training called \"normal schools.\" Massachusetts quickly became the model for all other northern states. The establishment of public schools was not achieved without a fight. Communi- ties that declared themselves in favor of public schools were often unwilling to tax their citizens to raise the necessary money. Lutherans, Roman Catholics, and other religious groups ran private schools of their own. Many of these people won- dered why they should pay taxes to sup- port public schools. Many people without children were also opposed. \"Why should 364 Unit 4 Toward a Democracy: 1820-1848"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"I be taxed,\" they protested, \"to educate other peoples children?\" In answer, Thaddeus Stevens, a rising young politician from Pennsylvania, said: The industrious, thrifty, rich farmer pays ti heavy county tax. . . which is necessary to support and punish convicts, but loudly complains of that which goes to prevent his fellow being from becoming a criminal. . . . Educating blacks presented even more difficult problems. It was flatly illegal in the South, and in the northern states people wavered on the need to provide education for blacks — ^whether with whites, separate- ly, or at all. Although there were 15,000 blacks in New York City in 1828, there were only 2 schools for them; in Philadel- phia, only 3 schools for 20,000 blacks. Efforts to educate blacks were sometimes met with violence even in the more liberal North. Prudence CrandalFs white students withdrew when she admitted one black girl to her Connecticut school in 1831. When her school filled with black girls horn all over the Northeast, the school was vandal- ized. Food had to be secretly brought in to the students. Connecticut then made it illegal to educate \"a person of color\" Irom out of state, which led to Crandall's arrest and conviction. The verdict, however, was reversed. When Crandall reopened the school, it was again attacked, and she was forced to give up her efforts there. Others, especially in the West, saw no reason why children should learn more than the \"three Rs.\" As an Indiana news- paper put it: . . . Give them a little spelling, a little ciphering, iind a little handivriting, with a liberal sprinkling of the rod, and they'll have more than their fathers had before them. Did Tippecanoe Harrison graduate from a seminary^ Did Old Hickory Jackson knoiv any Latin or Cireeki'. . . Even less public support could be mus- tered for education lor children with spe- cial needs. Reformers who worked for this cause went to great lengths to give these children an equal opportunity lor a better life. Reverend Thomas Gallaudet traveled to Europe to learn how to help people with impaired hearing. He became adept at hand signals, or signs, for communicat- ing with hearing-impaired persons that he learned about in France. When he returned in 1817, he opened a school in Hartford, Connecticut, that became a model in education for the hearing impaired. Samuel Gridley Howe, head ot the New England Asylum for the Blind, taught the imsighted to read by pasting string on cards to make raised letters. His prize stu- dent was Laura Bridgman, a girl who entered the school at age eight and learned to read, write, and sew. She became the first sight- and hearing-impaired person to be successfully educated. Often teachers were untrained and undedicated young men or women. As Examining Illustrations Horace Mann said \"Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity \" Why did some groups resist Mann's ideas about public education?

As recently as 1987, of those who began high school, 73. 1 percent gradu- ated, while the other 26.9 percent dropped out along the way. Louisiana and the District of Columbia had the highest dropout rates (40.5 percent and 38.4 percent respectively). Some states, however, have a very high attendance rate. Minnesota and North Dakota can boast that almost 90 percent of their high school stu- dents graduate. teachers were paid salaries of only $155 a year for men and as little as one-third of that for women, schools could not attract skilled professionals to teach. Because teacher training was not yet widely avail- able, classroom instruction was character- ized by memorization and harsh discipline. Fortunately, the spirit of reform was strong enough to influence lawmakers. By 1850 most ot the free states provided tuition-free elementary education. In the South, which was dominated by planta- tion owners, public schools were tar less common. But in the North, free high schools had replaced many private academies. Most boys and girls, however, did not take advantage of the high schools. Many lacked interest in \"book learning,\" or believed that the quality of education was poor, or that free schools were charity. The new laws supporting free public education were, however, an important step in the development of the United States educational system. An American Language Despite a popular mistrust of \"book learning,\" Noah Webster's American Spelling Book became a bestseller after it was first published in 1783. By 1837 sales had reached 15 million copies. In 1880 it was still going strong. The publishers reported: It has the largest sale of any book in the world except the Bible. We sell a million copies a year, and we have been selling it at that rate for forty years. . . . They are bought by all the large dry goods and supply houses, and furnished by them to every crossroads store. A young schoolteacher when he wrote the speller, Webster was dedicated to \"a uniformity and purity of language.\" He was eager not simply to preserve the lan- guage for its own sake; but he saw it as a way to promote national spirit. \"A nation- al language,\" he wrote, \"is a band of national union.\" His spelling book con- tained a preface encouraging Americans to respect their own literature. Webster also wrote the famous dictionaries that bore his name. William McGuffey, a cleric and college president, had similar ideas. In 1836 he introduced the first of six McGuffey's Readers. Filled with moral instructions and patriotic sayings, these literature anthologies influenced schoolchildren for generations. Between 1836 and 1920, 122 million McGuffey's Readers were pub- lished. They were eventually adopted as textbooks in 37 states. The influence of McGuffey's reader and Webster's spelling book and dictionary was great indeed. These texts helped pro- mote uniformitv' of language and provid- ed children with a shared cultural background. Higher Education New approaches to education were adopted at the college and university lev- els as well. North Carolina opened a state university' in 1795. Jefferson helped to establish the University ol Virginia, which opened its doors in 1825. The university was an exception in that its students were offered a broad spectrum ot subjects and were free to take any course. Although many state universities were established after 1820, most colleges and universities were private, church-related schools that offered professional training to aspiring ministers. As the practice of apprenticeship was still common in many professions, formal education for those students seeking careers in law, medicine, or engineering was slow to develop. In the face ol limited offerings and inadequate facilities in United States uni- versities, many students sought higher education in the more progressive schools of Europe, especially in Germany. Ameri- can students returned to the United States enthusiastic and full of new ideas for changing higher education. 366 Unit 4 Toward a Democracy: 1820-1848"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"Interest in training teachers helped the cause ot higher edtication for women. One argument for training women as teachers was that it was more economical because women teachers could be paid less than men. Although many men feared that higher education tor women would disrupt home life, feminist leaders such as Emma Willard, Catharine Beecher, and Mary Lyon argued that chemistry could be used in cooking and math in house- hold finance. Their schools, founded in the 1820s and 1830s, were tront-runners in higher education for women. Mount Holyoke College, founded in Mas- sachusetts by Lyon in 1836, is still a women's college. Oberlin College in Ohio, the first coeducational school, saw its first female student graduate in 1841. Oberlin — and Bowdoin College in Maine — were the first institutions to admit black students. These achievements were rarities, how- ever. Because black men ancf women were generally barred fiom educational opportunities, there were fewer than 1 5 black college students in the United States before 1840. Aside from one black college, Lincoln University, which opened in Pennsylvania in 1854, there was little progress in education for blacks until after the Civil War. While opportunities for formal higher education were limited for most people, there was a move toward adult education for the common person. Libraries, once accessible only by subscription, began to take hold as free public institutions. The first was established in Peterboro, New Hampshire, in 1833. Even more popular was the lyceum (ly SEE uhm) movement, begun in 1826 in Millbury, Massachusetts, by Josiah Holbrook. A lyceum was a voluntary organization designed to promote \"the improvement of its members in useful knowledge.\" Supporting their organiza- tion with small membership fees, the group might purchase books, scientific equipment, and specimens for study.

Section One Review fiiiimiiig Summary In the early 1800s, few public schools existed. As more people gained the right to vote, the number of tax-supported schools increased substantially. Many cit- izens and groups opposed taxes for pub- lic schools. Public schools operated with meager facilities and young, poorly- trained, ancH underpaid teachers. Edticat- ing blacks and children with special needs brought less public support. The spirit of reform led to the establishment of free high schools, colleges, and univer- sities.

What do they have in common that I can compare? 3. On which common area do I want to concentrate? Explanation To compare means to examine in order to identify similarities and differences. You can compare any two things. To be an accu- rate comparison, how- ever, you must note at least one similarity and one difference. Making comparisons does not involve analysis or evaluation. There are no judgments being made, and no conclusions being drawn. In the above example, there are obvious differences between debat- ing and baseball, yet there are at least two similarities. Both are group activities, and both are com- petitive in the nature in which points are scored. This means that a comparison is possible. No matter what you are com- paring, there are questions that can be asked that help in making effec- tive comparisons. They are: Daguerreotype of the Emerson School 4. What similarities are there in this common area? What differences are there in this common area? Example Note how the above questions are applied in making a comparison between public and private schools in the 1800s: l.What is being compared? (Public and private schools in the 1800s.) 2.What did they have in common? (A belief in education for the young; a concern for values; the need for acquiring money with ivhich to operate their schools.) 3. On which common area should there be concentration? (The need for acquiring money can be chosen, although you could have chosen any area.) 4. What similarities are there in this com- mon area? {Both had to pay teachers; pay for books; pay for heating fuel and building expenses.) What differences are there in this common area? (Public schools acquired money through community taxation. Private schools generally acquired money through churches or other sponsoring groups and through fees or donations only from those parents whose children actually went to those schools.) This completes a comparison between public and private schools in the 1800s. This method can be applied to other movements or institutions in your study of history.

There were organizations to do away with flogging in the navy, drinking alcohol, and eating meat. There was even a society that encouraged reformers called The Friends ol Universal Reform. The great reform movements of the 1830s and 1840s could boast of solid achievement, especially in state legislation dealing with such problems as prisons, the mentally ill, child labor, liquor, and public schools. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • List reform movements of the 1800s and discuss their achievements. • Explain the ways in which women were treated as second-class citizens. • Discuss the efforts made to end slavery. Calling lor action on such issues as care lor the mem, illy ill, women's rights, and abolition of slavery, reformers appealed to their state legislaiures and the federal government with little success. The persis- tent message of the reformers eventually awakened the United States to many of the needs of more than one-half of the population. Prison Reform As Emerson had suggested, there was a wealth of opportunity for reform; one had only to turn a critical eye to the world and make a choice. Prisons, too, began to experiment with ways to reform criminals. Unfortunately, the results were more severe punishments. For example, in Pennsylvania criminals were put in solitary confinement day and night to allow convicts to meditate on their crimes and, thus, reform. At Auburn, New York, treatment was less severe. There group labor in absolute silence was allowed. Instead of public hangings — commonplace before the 1830s — reformers sought the more humane change to private executions. Obviously, much reform remained to be done. When Dorothea Dix began visiting prisons in 1841, she found that mentally ill persons were still treated as criminals. In her report to the Massachusetts legisla- ture, she wrote: I proceed, gentlemen, briefly to call your attention to the present state of insane persons confined within this commonwealth, in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience Miss Dix's findings were so shocking and so accurate that Massachusetts passed a law establishing asylums where mental illness could be treated as a disease rather than as a crime. Miss Dix traveled ihroughout the United States visiting more than 800 jails and .ilmshoiises, or homes lor the poor. Largely as a result of her influence, 20 more states hnmded insane .isylunis.

Despite the fact that by 1850 near- ly all white males could vote, women were still denied an active part in politics. Life of the Times Language of Etiquette In the early 1800s a strict code of behavior governed relationships betiveen unmarried men and women. Pub- lic displays of affection of any sort were prohib- ited. Modesty required that words referring to body parts were never spoken in mixed com- pany. The chest, for example, was referred to as the \"neck\" and the stomach, the \"chest. \" Thus, a stomachache was a \"pain in the chest. \" In 1839 the English novel- ist Frederick Marryat toured the United States. His journals pro- vide a glimpse ol the passion tor modesty that pervaded American social etiquette. ^Tiile visiting Niagara Falls, a female com- panion of Mr. Marryat's fell and grazed her leg. The novelist asked if she had \"hurt her leg.\" Much to his astonishment, she was deeply offended by his question. She later explained that the word \"leg\" was not used in mixed companv. Rather, the novelist should have asked il she had \"hurt her limb.\" If Mr. Marryat was not fully convinced of the lengths to which Americans would take this social modesty, a ttip to a girl's school a few months later probably persuaded him. In the parlor of the school stood a grand piano with four \"limbs.\" Much to his cha- grin, each piano leg had been covered with a frillv trouser! Examining Illustrations Dorothea Dix's careful documentation of the treatment of mental illness led to state-operated asylums. Why was this a remarkable achievement for a woman in the 1840s? Women were perceived as \"second-class citizens'\" in other ways, too. According to English common law that formed the basis of American law, \"husband and wife are one and that one is the husband.\" Even before a woman married, however, she lost the right to manage her own per- sonal matters. According to one law book, it was unfair to her betrothed to allow a woman to control her own finances because he might be disappointed if she did not bring all of her anticipated wealth into the marriage. Similarly, a woman had no legal right to manage the affairs of her own children, and only in the state of Ohio could a woman make a will. As factories opened in the Northeast, many new jobs tor women were created. As in teaching, women received consider- ably less pay than men did, and when they took it home, the money became their husbands'. Women also felt social pressures directed against those who took these jobs. In spite of little totmal education, women learned by reading. One impor- tant influence was the women's magazine Godey's Ladys Book, which published such important authors as Emerson, Longfel- low, Poe, and Hawthorne and had a circu- lation of 150.000. 370 Unit 4 Toward \\ Democracy: 1 820- 1 848"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"Still, almost all institutions of higher education and most professional careers were closed to women. It took Elizabeth Blackwell years to be allowed to take med- ical courses. When she finally completed her training to become the country's first woman physician, sexist prejudice nearly kept her from practicing. Even in the reform movements them- selves, women were often forced to deter to men. It was considered improper, tor example, for a woman to address a mixed audience. When nine women went as United States delegates to the World Anti- slavery Convention, they were greeted with cries of \"Turn out the women!\" from American clerics. The women, Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton among them, refused to leave and, as a compro- mise, were seated behind a curtain and allowed only to listen. Frustrated by the limits on their actions, women reformers began a campaign lor their own rights. In 1848 Mott and Stan- ton organized the Seneca Falls Conven- tion. This gathering of women reformers drew up a \"Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions\" that echoed the words of the Declaration of Independence: We hold these truths to he self-evident: that all men and women are created equal: that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights: that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. . . . Stanton shocked many of the women present when she proposed a resolution that they devote themselves to gaining the right to vote. Frederick Douglass, a black antislavery reformer, stepped into the shocked silence to second the resolution, giving a speech in support. The resolution passed, but narrowly. Most politicians were eiilici inditleixni or hostile to the issue ot women's rights. During this time women gained neither the right to vote nor admission to professions; most colleges continued to exclude them. They did, however, gain relief from some of their worst legal hand- icaps. For example, many states passed laws permitting women to retain and manage their own property. Above all, women drew attention to their cause and to the seriousness of their purpose.

It was, however, the clothing she first wore in 1851 that made Amelia Bloomer a household name. Seeking a more practical style than the hoopskirt, she donned a short skirt over loose pants gathered at the ankles. She did not invent the fashion, but her insis- tence on wearing it — despite ridicule — led to calling the outfit \"bloomers.\" Large crowds came to hear her lecture. The novelry of seeing a woman wear- ing pants accounted tor much ot her popularity.

The question became increasingly acute by 1840. By that time most Latin American countries had aboUshed slavery, and Great Britain had banned the practice. It is not surpris- ing then that the upsurge of democratic feehng in the Jacksonian period made antislavery the dominant reform effort. The organized movement to abolish slavery began among religious groups. As early as 1776, the Quakers — in the South as well as in the North — had agreed not to hold slaves. In Virginia in 1789 the Baptists recommended \"every legal mea- sure to extirpate this horrid evil from the land.\" The abolition movement at first made many converts in the South. Ben- jamin Lundy, a native of New Jersey, spent most of his active career organizing antislavery societies in southern commu- nities. James G. Birney, an Alabama lawyer and cotton planter, freed his own slaves and attempted to get other owners to do the same. The voices of abolitionists, or those persons in favor ot doing away with slav- ery, grew stronger. On January 1, 1831, the first edition of The Liberator, a Boston antislavery newspaper, was published. Editor William Lloyd Garrison wrote in a strong, unrelenting tone: / will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation / am in earnest. I will not equivocate. I will not excuse. I will not retreat a single inch. AND I WILL BE HEARD.

He demand- ed immediate freedom tor enslaved blacks without compensation for the owners, whom he regarded as \"not... within the pale of Christianity, of Republicanism, of humanity.\" He denounced the Constitu- tion as being in \"a league with death and a covenant with Hell\" because it protected slavery.

A group who proposed to abolish slavery by the use oi the ballot box founded the Liberty party. It nominated James G. Birney for the presidency in 1840 and 1844, but Birney received only a few thousand votes. Another leader who favored political action was Frederick Douglass, a sell-edu- cated former slave, who edited an aboli- tionist newspaper. The North Star. The title was meant to remind people ol the Underground Railroad. This secret aboli- tionist organization, which had hiding places, or stations, throughout the north- ern states and even into Canada, brought slaves out of the South and set them Iree. Moving at night, the agents ol the Under- ground Railroad had only Polaris, the fixed star in the northern skies, to guide them. They not only took care of slaves after they had come North, but they risked their lives to go into the slave states and lead blacks to freedom. One of the most successful ol these agents was Harri- et Tubman, the \"Black Moses,\" who had herself been born into slavery. After mak- ing her own escape, she returned to the South again and again, liberating more than 300 slaves. Tubman always avoided arrest, even though a reward ol $40,000 was promised for her capture. It had been no mere coincidence that the first publication of The Liberator coincided with a slave insurrection in Virginia in 1831. That revolt was led by Nat Ttirner, a black preacher and slave who believed him- self divinely inspired to lead his people Irom bondage. Turner's rebellion was quelled, but only after about 60 whites had been killed. The revolt spread panic throughout the South. The beliel that Turner had been inspired by abolitionist propaganda effec- tively ended the antislavery movement in the South. From that time on, Southerners who favored abolition ol slavery usually remained silent or moved north.

When he was absent one day, however, a mob seized his presses and sent them across the Ohio River to Cincinnati. Southern hostility to abolition grew stronger. The South demanded the sup- pression of abolitionist material as a condi- tion for remaining in the Union. Southern postal workers refused to deliver abolition- ist newspapers. In 1835 a bill to bar aboli- tionist literature from the mails passed the Senate, although it eventually was aban- doned. In 1836, under Southern pressure, the House of Representatives passed a \"gag rule\" providing that all abolitionist peti- tions should be shelved without debate. Despite the excitement it aroused, the antislavery movement affected politics very little at first. The Missouri Compro- mise had supposedly averted civil war by fixing the boundary between slave and free territory. No prominent politician, however, proposed endangering the Union by attacking slavery where it was already protected by law. W Summary The reform movements of the 1830s and 1840s led to improved conditions for prisoners and the mentally ill. Women were not allowed to vote nor be admitted to professions. They could, in some states, retain and manage their own property. Slavery, in spite of democratic changes, persisted. The abolitionist movement began among religious groups. It established newspapers and the Underground Railroad. Despite its grow- ing hostility to slavery, the antislavery movement had little effect on politics. Checking for Understanding 1.

They wanted to create a dis- tinct civilization, rivaling that of the Old World. They were concerned not only with rights but with the quality and fla- vor of life in the United States. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify the prominent artists, writers, and scientists of the 1800s. • Explain the goals of nineteenth-century religious movements. • Discuss the temperance movement. Americans themselves had a sense of inferiority. People could not write poetry without \"a legendary past nor a poetic present,\" remarked one young scholar. \"Large mountains, extensive prairies, tall cataracts, long rivers [and] millions of dirty acres\" did not seem suitable subjects for literature. James Fenimore Cooper set the scene of his first novel, Precaution (1820), in England and tried to attract readers by promoting the rumor that he was \"a prominent Englishman.\" In 1820 the Reverend Sydney Smith, writing in a British magazine, sneered at the low cul- tural level of Americans and the lack of artistic and scientific achievement in the United States: The Americans are a brave, industrious, and acute people; but they have hitherto given no indication of genius In the four quarters of the globe, who reads an American book^ Or goes to an American play? Or looks at an American picture or statue? What does the world yet owe to American physicians and surgeons? What new substances have their chemists yet discovered? What old ones have they analyzed? Almost as if in answer to Sydney Smith's taunt, the second quarter of the nine- teenth century saw many advances by American scientists and an outpouring of books by American writers that are still read on both sides of the Atlantic.

As a result of reading James Fenimore Cooper's novels, generations of children — not only here but in France and Great Britain — gloried in the drama of native Americans and pioneers on the New York frontier. In his novels and short stories, Nathaniel Hawthorne mined the Puritan history of his native New England. In Moby Dick, Herman Melville used his experience as a sailor to write a fascinating account of wh;iling that was also an allegorical drama of the human struggle itself American poets, too, began to use American subjects. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow immortalized the native American hero Hiawatha. John Greenleaf Whittier in \"Snow-Bound' described winter on a New England farm. William CuUen Bryant in \"To a Waterfowl, \" drew a haunting picture of sunset over a lonely marsh. Edgar Allan Poe wrote of the ter- rors that lurk in the world of imagination and dream. Many American writers took an active part in reform movements. Whittier and Longfellow joined the crusade against slavery, as did poet James Russell Lowell and poet and novelist Lydia Maria Child. Henry David Thoreau himself spent a night in jail rather than pay taxes to sup- port the Mexican War. Scientific Advances Men and women in the United States also won fame in the field of science. As a child in Nantucket, Massachusetts, Maria Mitchell taught herself astronomy while checking navigational instruments for whaling captains. She discovered a new comet, several groups of distant stars, and wrote important studies of Jupiter and Sat- urn. Mitchell was the first woman elected to several learned societies.

One of the most important advances in the history of medicine is credited to two physicians from the United States. Work- ing independently, Dr. Crawford W. Long of Georgia in 1842 and Dr. W. T. G. Morton of Boston in 1846 were the first physicians to use ether as an anesthetic during surgery. The Arts Painters and sculptors were eager to produce works as great as those of Europe. Samuel F. B.

American artists did best, when, like the writers, they turned their attention to the American scene. Such an artist was George Caleb Bingham, who painted the life he had seen on the Missouri frontier as a boy. Of importance also was a group of landscape painters in the East known as the Hudson River School. Their romantic paintings of the Catskill Mountains and Hudson River are highly prized. Early nineteenth-century American architects continued to use classical mod- els developed in the Renaissance. In New England, Charles Bulfinch, influenced by English models, developed a distinctive \"Federal\" style of architecture that can be seen in the Massachusetts State House, the largest building in America at the time it was designed. Bulfinch later worked for 14 years in Washington D.C., and helped to complete the design of the Capitol. His influence can be seen especially in architecture in the North- east. The type of architecture that most appealed to the American taste, however, was the style known as \"Greek Revival.\" Based on classical Greek and Roman forms, it was used both in domestic architecture and in public and private buildings, the most famous of which is Virginia's State Capitol. \"A Greek Revival town,\" remarked a historian of American architecture, \"is a fine and handsome assembly of stately colonnades and well- turned building masses.\" By the middle of the nineteenth centu- ry, American architects had abandoned the simplicity and clean lines of the Feder- al and Greek Revival styles and begun to imitate the Gothic style of the Middle Ages. Characterized by elaborate detail, pointed windows, and colored glass, this style was originally developed for churches and stone construction. When adapted to other purposes and to wooden buildings, however, it often seemed inappropriate. Among the few signs of real originality in American architecture were the \"octagon houses,\" designed to give maximum light and space with a minimum of wall space and supporting rafters. International Peace While American artists were creating an American culture, a small group of social reformers turned their attention to a prob- lem affecting all human-kind — abolition of war. Since the formation of this nation had apparently solved the problem of bringing together independent states and because the United States seemed in no danger from its neighbors, it was natural for Americans to think that universal peace was attainable. In 1828 the American Peace Society was formed to promote interna- tional understanding. Its principal founder was William Ladd, who abandoned suc- cessful careers, first as ship captain and then as farmer, to devote his entire energy to the cause of peace. Ladd agitated for a Congress of Nations with courts of inter- national justice to settle all disputes. Social Experiments From Europe at this period came a new idea — socialism. Socialists believed that the means of production should be owned by society, not by private individuals. They believed that business competition and individual ownership of property caused poverty and inequality. Socialists proposed to substitute cooperation for competition and common ownership for individual ownership. The early followers of the idea proposed to start small, volun- tary communities where their ideas could be put into practice. Most of these experi- ments took place in the United States because land was so easy to acquire. A famous English socialist, Robert Owen, started a cooperative venture at New Har- mony, Indiana. Even more influential than he were the disciples of the French- man, Charles Fourier, who proposed to organize society into \"phalanxes\" of just 1,620 people, living in villages called \"phalansteries.\" His converts included Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, the most widely read newspaper in the United States.

He wrote to his fiancee: It is my opinion. . . that a matis soul may be buried under a dungheap, or in a fitrroiv of the field, just as well as under a pile of money The community ultimately collapsed after a large fire left the group greatly in debt. Religious Movements Religious groups, having an additional basis for unity, were more successful in community living. One rapidly growing religious body was The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, more com- monly known as the Mormon Church. This church was founded in 1830 by a New Englander, Joseph Smith, who claimed to have been called to restore the Christian church to its original form. Smith wrote the Book of Mortnon from golden plates that he said an angel had led him to discover. Mormonism enjoyed a rapid growth and established a distinctive pattern of communal living at Kirtland, Ohio. Persecution finally drove the Mor- mons west to Utah. Another religious group, the Shakers, was founded by Mother Ann Lee in 1772, as an offshoot of the Quakers. Supporting themselves by small industry in orderly communities that were isolated from the rest of the world, the Shakers reached their peak in the mid- 1800s with some 6,000 members. They did not marry or have children; the society survived by making converts. Few Shakers are left, but their handiwork — especially Shaker furni- ture, with its clean lines — is highly valued by collectors today.

The revivalist spirit of the temperance movement is revealed by a stanza from one of its songs, entitled \"One More Drink\": Stt7y, mortal stay! nor heedless thus Thy sure destruction seal; Within that cup there lurks a curse Which all who drink shall feel.

They were able to convince many politicians of the justice of their cause. Abraham Lincoln, for example, favored prohibition by state action, argu- ing that just as the American Revolution freed people from the tyranny of Britain, so would prohibition free people from the tyranny of alcohol. In 1851 Maine passed the first state prohibition law, an example followed by about a dozen states. Other states passed \"local option\" laws, which allowed towns and villages to pro- hibit the sale of liqtior within their boundaries. Many aspects ol the reform movenieiu may seem odd today.

Section Three Review fllTIIIIIIII Summary American artists and writers came into their own in the 1800s as they began to feature American subject matter and evolve American styles. American scien- tists made outstanding contributions in astronomy, meteorology, oceanography, and medicine. Social and religious groups began experiments in communal living. Protestants split into diverse sects, and new religious philosophies devel- oped. Owing partly to increasing reli- gious attention to life on earth, religious groups became leaders in reform move- ments such as abolition and the emerging temperance movement.

Women gained the right to own and manage prop- erty, but not the right to vote nor enter most profes- sions. Other reform movements included education for the deat and blind and improved conditions tor prisoners and the mentally ill. New religious sects emerged, and an increasing focus on the need to improve life on earth led many groups to embrace the spirit of reform.

There are two kinds of evidence — that which is admissible (allowable or acceptable) in court and that which is not. For example, a statement made about an event by someone who was not present at that event is not admissible evidence. Only four kinds of evidence are admissible: • eyewitness accounts — statements by people who saw an event take place • written docinnents — diaries, letters, memos • visual evidence, such as photographs • physical objects, such as weapons or clothing These definitions of evidence can help \\(iu idem if \\' evidence to support your studies. You can imagine that when Dorothea Dix spoke out against the treat- ment of the mentally ill, she had to gather evidence to support her claims. Example Consider this claim: Insane people are treated like criminals and are forced to live like animals in cages. Read the information about Dorothea Dix in the chapter on pages 369-370. Then read the answers to the following questions. They will help you to understand how to identify evidence to support claims. l.Are there statements by eyewitnesses? (Yes. Dix her- self visited the prisons; some prison or court officials might report what they had observed.) 2. Are there written documents? (Yes, the court and prison records of the treatment of insane people.) 3. Is there visual evidence? (Some photographs might have existed or sketches might be drawn by an eyewit- ness.) 4. Are there physical objects? (Yes, the chains, rods, stalls, etc.) Practice Suppose that you read a claim that African Americans actually lost some of their earlier rights in northern states beginning in the 1820s. Researching this claim you find a document entitled Appeal of Forty Thousand Citizens, Threatened with Disfinnchise- ment to the People of Pennsylvania, 1838. Read the fol- lowing excerpt from the document and identify evidence that supports the claim. We appeal to you from the decision of the \"Reform Convention, \" which has stripped us of a right peaceably enjoyed during forty-seven years under the constitution of this commonwealth It may be objected to us, that in point of fact we have lost by the recent decision of the fPennsylvania] Supreme Court, in the case of Fogg v. Hobbs, whatever claim to the right of suffi-age we may have had under the constitution of 1790 Not so. We hold our rights under the present constitution none the cheaper for that decision The blessings of the broad and impartial charter of Pennsylvania rights can no more he wrested from us by legal subtlety than the beams of our common sun or the breathi>ig of our common air Our fathers fought by the side of yours in the struggle which made us an independent republic All we ask is, that no ma?i shall be excluded on account of his color; that the same rule be applied to all. Chapter 12 The Spirii' of RilI-orm 383"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"* * * Unit 4 Digest * * * With the 1820s came the Industrial Revolution, which brought industrializa- tion, growth, conflict, migration, and com- promise — social, economic, and politi- cal — to the United States. At the same time, the decade began an age of demo- cracy and social reform. Americans improved their lives and learned the advantages and disadvantages of freedom and unity. Chapter 10 Sectionalism and Growth The Industrial Revolution brought changes to all sections of the United States. In the Northeast, New England's textile industry expanded rapidly due to the abundance of water power and work- ers. Other manufacturing and shipping industries also grew in importance. As a result, goods became cheaper and more widely available. Meanwhile, craft workers who once worked in shops and owned their own tools found their lives more dif- ficult and restricted in factories — their sense of security was gone. The plight of unskilled factory workers was even worse. To improve their lives, craft workers orga- nized trade societies, and unskilled work- ers formed labor unions. When strikes failed to achieve the workers' goals, their organizations formed political parties. Even though political action brought about some reforms, the workers' parties were short lived, and the societies and unions soon collapsed. In the South the cotton gin and Britain's increased demand for cotton boosted the economy beyond southerners' wildest dreams. Cotton became the major export not only of the South but of the nation. Plantations grew in size and num- ber. As a result, many southerners' disap- proval of slavery faded away because owning slaves was now profitable and more popular than ever. In the Northwest, food, land, and other resources abounded. Pioneers streamed over the Appalachian Mountains to settle the region. Storekeepers and millers fol- lowed to supply the pioneers' needs. Soon towns became cities like Cincinnati, Louisville, and Chicago, and in these cities, manufacturing sprang up. By 1820 more than one-fourth of the people in the United States lived west of the Appalachi- an Plateau. Each section of the country had its own wants and needs. The Northeast favored a protective tariff to stimulate the sale of its manufactured goods. The South insisted on the expansion of slavery to maintain its cotton economy. The Northwest demand- ed internal improvements like roads to get its goods to markets. Often people in dif- ferent sections quarreled over whether the national government should support a particular issue. These quarrels threatened American unity. To save the Union, politicians sought compromises like Henry Clay's \"American System,\" designed to benefit the eco- nomies of all sections. But the compro- mises brought unity for only a while. In the presidential election of 1824, section- alism resurfaced. Four National Republi- cans, representing different sections, sought the office. Since no candidate won a majority in the electoral college, the election was thrown into the House of Representatives. With Clay's help, John Quincy Adams emerged victorious, much to the disgust of Andrew Jackson, who had received the most popular votes. Jack- son then resigned his seat in the Senate to begin campaigning for the 1828 election. Chapter 1 1 The Age of Jackson By the election of 1828, sectional inter- ests had strengthened, and the population was shifting from the Northeast to the South and the Northwest. As a result, the political parties avoided discussing the issues and indulged in mudslinging. Andrew Jackson became the new 384 Unit 4 Toward a Democracy: 1 820- 1 848"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"President. Jackson was a man of the peo- ple and his supporters became known as Democrats. During Jackson's administra- tion, the power of the presidency increased, the American definition oi democracy broadened, and the people began to expect more from their political system. Politicians now recognized the importance of the individual voter, and the American government became more of a government by the people. However, the new democracy did not extend to native Americans and African Americans. The government forced Amer- ican Indians to move from their lands. Thousands of Indians died during the removal process, African Americans did not fare much better. In the South most remained slaves. In the North free blacks were second-class citizens. Meanwhile, tariffs, banking, and inter- nal improvements were still controversial and triggered sectional disputes. When Senator Hayne from the South and Sena- tor Webster from the Northeast debated the issues of nullification and high tariffs, many feared that the southern states might secede. The banking issue divided the nation still further. Andrew Jackson's stand against the Second Bank of the United States helped him win the 1832 election but, in the end, led to the panic and depression of 1837. In the election of 1840, the Whig party captured the presidency for its candidate, William Henry Harrison, by avoiding dangerous issues and trying to overcome sectionalism. Once in power, the Whigs realized that they had to meet the diverse needs of the nation. However, Harrison died after only a month in office, and Vice President John Tyler became Presi- dent. Unfortunately for the Whigs, Tyler, a southerner, disagreed with them on many issues, especially states' rights. Chapter 12 The Spirit of Reform Between 1820 and IXSO, many Ameri- cans focused on social needs rather th.iii political issues. Reformers wanted to better their world, and through organiza- tions and reform movements, they accom- plished enduring changes. Thanks in part to Horace Mann and his example as public school board secretary for Massachusetts, many states provided free elementary education by 1850. In addition, Noah Webster's American Spelling Book and William McGuffey's McGuffey's Reader were helping establish a uniform language throughout the United States. State universities began to spring up, and Emma Willard and Catharine Beecher founded some of the first schools for the academic education of women. Programs for adult education and free public libraries became widespread. Other reformers championed the causes of prisoners and the disabled. Blind chil- dren were taught to read with their fin- gers, and the deaf were taught to speak with signs. Due to the persistence of Dorothea Dix, many states opened insane asylums to care for the mentally ill who formerly lived in jails. Also in the 1840s, women began to organize for their rights. They failed to gain universal suffrage or general accep- tance into professions, but for the first time in many states women were allowed to retain and to manage their property. The first womens' rights convention was held in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848. The dominant reform effort of the time was the abolitionist movement. Some abolitionist leaders, such as Frederick Douglass, worked to abolish slavery through political means. Meanwhile, the Underground Railroad quietly smuggled slaves out of the South, and the black preacher Nat Turner led an unsuccessful slave rebellion that panicked southerners into restricting black privileges more than ever. American culture reflected the social changes going on. Poets, artists, and novel- ists described the American scene. Part of the scene was a religious renewal, a \"Sec- ond Great Awakening,\" during which existing religions were strengthened and new religious groups formed. Among the new religious organizations were several Utopian ct)mnuiniiies, such as the Shakers. Synthesizing Unit Themes Relating Ideas 1. How did economic growth deepen sec- tional conflicts.''

The capitalist system, he charged, concentrated wealth in the hands of a few capitalists, widened the gult between the rich and the poor, denied workers a lair share of their labor, and led to abominable working conditions and other abuse of the worker.

The swelling tide of our population must and will roll on until that mighty ocean interposes its waters, and limits our territorial empire. — Francis Baylies Congressman trom Massachusetts, 1821 Section Focus The idea that the United States was bound to extend its borders from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans became known as \"manifest destiny.\" It found its greatest expression in the decade of the 1840s, when the United States acquired territories even more vast than the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Oh] ectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Give reasons Americans wanted to ex- pand their territory to the Pacific. • Describe negotiations with Britain over disputed lands. Several factors combined to produce the expansionist movement known as manifest destiny. Chief among these was the seemingly habitual ambition, nurtured by the restlessness of the American pioneer spirit, to move on to new land. Fulfilling the nation's mani- fest destiny, settlers pushed westward all the way to the Pacific coast — one of the great migrations of history. Yet, why would Americans move beyond the exist- ing boundaries of the United States when most ot the land within those boundaries was still sparsely settled, and most of the area between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains was still not tilled? Westward to the Pacific The push to the Pacific Ocean resulted in part fiom the assumption that the tree- less plains between the 98th meridian and the Rockies were unsuited to farming and should therefore be left to the Indians and the buffalo. The federal government set apart portions of this \"Great American Desert\" for Indian nations expelled from their homes in the East. In 1825 the gov- ernment declared that there was to be no further white settlement beyond a line drawn along the western boundaries of existing states and territories. Reinforcing this policy, Congress in 1834 not only forbade settlement in Indian territories but required a special license to trade with Indians. Thus, if newcomers wanted avail- able land, especially the forested and well- watered land they were used to, they had to cross the Rockies. Land-himgry settlers proved willing to risk their lives in crossing the wide grass- lands and steep mountains to reach the Pacific Coast. The spirit of manifest des- tiny was flavored with the boastfulness of the frontiersman who said that he could: . . . wade the brown Mississippi, jump the Ohio, step across the Nolachucky, ride a streak of lightning, slip without a scratch down a honey locust tree, whip my weight in wildcats, and strike a blow like a falling tree. Commercial interests as well as the desire lor land promoted manifest destiny. Excited by the recent opening of China, eastern traders and shipowners saw the harbors of San Diego and San Francisco as necessary way-stations on the route to Asia. Fearing that the British were also interested in acquiring good harbors and would seize California before the United States, eastern mercantile interests pushed hard for expansion. They also wanted the question of who controlled the Oregon territory to be settled in such a way that 398 Unit 5 Division and Reunion: 1825-1877"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"the United States would acquire the excel- lent harbor at Paget Sound. Perhaps the strongest aspect of the patri- otic impulse toward expansion was pride in American institutions and a desire to spread them. Andrew Jackson expressed this idea clearly when he argued that the United States had a mission to \"extend the area of freedom.\" It was political idealism that motivated a New York editor, John L. O'SuUivan, who gave a name to the expan- sionist movement when he wrote: Aw^y, away with all those cobweb issues of rights of discovery, exploration, settlement, continuity, etc. Our claims are based on the right of our manifst destiny to overspread and to possess the whole continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment in liberty and federative self-government entrusted to us. Rivals for the Land Expanding the United States to the Pacific involved risks, tor it meant taking land claimed or settled by other peoples. The United States, with limited military power, had to carefully weigh the possibili- ty of hostilities with Indians on the Plains, with Mexico in Texas, and with Britain on the Pacific Coast. Fortunately for the United States, the vast region of southwestern plains and plateaus was a \"power vacuum.\" Mexico claimed the land bui had almost no pres- ence there. The Indians who lived there were at a technological disadvantage in defending themselves against whites. The Arapaho and Comanche Indians ol the Plains and the Apaches of the Southwest were divided into sm.ill bands and fought each other as readily as ihey did whites. In the 1840s, they did not rcali/.e that their entire way ol lile was in ilanger. Mexico lacked not only settlements in I he region but political stability at the center ot its governnuiii. With a revolu- tion occurring about once every three years, Mexico was unable to carry on a war with another nation effectively. It could not prevent the advance of the United States to the Rio Grande or to California. Manifest destiny also propelled the Unit- ed States toward confrontation with the British on the Pacific Coast. Although Great Britain's superior naval power would probably have been able to keep Oregon and take California, British political leaders had little desire to add to an empire that they thought to be already overextended. Great Britain, however, was quite capa- ble of defending land that served its vital interests. For this reason the first area where the advance of American settlement caused serious friction with Britain was not in the West, but in the extreme Northeast. Because of confusing language in the Treaty of Paris after the Revolution, the northern and eastern boundaries of Maine had been uncertain. As long as the region was unoccupied, this was not a serious matter. In 1838, however, the British decided to construct an overland road to connect St. John on the Bay of Fundy with Montreal and Quebec. The road was just one part of an overall plan to suppress a Canadian independence movement by giving British troops ease of travel. In February 1839, settlers from Maine, pushing into the fertile Aroostook (uh ROOS tuhk) Valley, met and clashed with British workers who were felling trees for the road project. The struggle, fought mostly with fists, is known as the Aroostook War. It nearly led to something more serious when Maine and New Brunswick called out their militias, and Congress authorized President Van Buren to call for SO, 000 soldiers in case a war with Great Britain should develop. A general atmosphere ot ill will made it seem likely that sooner or later some petty dispute would plunge the United States and Great Britain into war. American ora- tors and school textbooks kept alive bitter memories ot the Revolution ami the War ot 1(S12. Beginning in 1838 along the border between the United States and Canada, Americans formed secret \"Huniers' Lodges' whose avoweil purpose was to help the ( .in.uli.ins throw oft British rule.

British authors wrote books that jeered at every unpleasant feature of American life from tobacco-chewing to slavery. Many British investors were angry over losses from land swindles or debts that some states had refused to honor after the Panic of 1837. The Webster- Ashburton Treaty In spite ot friction and ill feeling, there were practical reasons for pursuing peace. The most important reason was that the United States and Great Britain each prof- ited from the other's trade. Great Britain was the largest foreign buyer oi American wheat, tobacco, and cotton, and the Unit- ed States was Britain's biggest market lor manufactured goods. Fortunately, both the British and American governments were aware of the advantages of peace. In 1842 Lord Aberdeen, the British for- eign secretary, and Daniel Webster, the American secretary of state, arranged a meeting to attempt to settle outstanding disputes. Showing his goodwill, Aberdeen sent Lord Ashburton, the husband of an American heiress, to Washington, D.C. Eager to reach an agreement, the men decided that it was impossible to fix the correct boundary ot Maine. Instead, they divided the disputed territory as fairly as they could. Great Britain got what it wanted most — enough of the northern section to make possible a direct land route from the St. Lawrence River to New Brunswick. The United States received what it wanted — the Aroostook Valley — along with other concessions on the northern boundaries of New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. Webster and Ashburton tailed to reach agreement on several other disputes involv- ing such matters as American ships illegally carrying slaves from Africa, the debts owed British investors, and the ownership of the Oregon territory.

Section One Revie-w *************** Summary In the 1 840s the quest for land and commercial interests pushed American pioneers westward to the Pacific Ocean. Americans considered the Great Plains unproductive, but California and Oregon were attractive to settlers and to eastern merchants, eager to claim coastal harbors lor their trade with China. Patriotism fueled Americans' wish to spread their democratic beliels across the continent and nearly brought war with Great Britain over territorial disputes in Maine.

By the 1830s and 1840s, they were making their way to Oregon, California, and Utah. What began as a trickle of immigrants swelled to a flood; these American settlements, in turn, gave weight to arguments in favor ol expan- sion and annexation. Obj ectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe the overland migrations to Oregon and Utah. • Explain why Texas wanted indepen- dence from Mexico and how it became part of the United States. The Oregon Territory extended from the Pacific Ocean to the Rocky Mountains, bordering Russian Alaska to the north and California to the south. Until the early 1800s, Spain, France, Russia, Creat Britain, and the United States held claims to Oregon. The United States acquired the French claim by the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the Spanish claim by the Flori- da-purchase treaty of 1819. Russia fixed the southern boundary of Alaska in 1824, giving up its claims to the area. In 1818 Great Britain and the United States agreed to a curious arrangement known as \"joint occupation\" of the Oregon Territory, leav- ing the question of ownership unsettled. While Webster and Ashburton were deter- mining the Maine boundary, the rivalry between Great Britain and the United States in the Oregon territory intensified. The Opening of Oregon The interest ot the United States in Oregon began in 1787 when a Boston ship, the Columbia, made a very profitable pioneer trading voyage. The ship left port with a supply of ginseng, the root ot a common New England weed highly prized by the Chinese as a medicine. Rounding Cape Horn, South America, the Columbia sailed to the coast of Ore- gon to take on other cargo in demand in China — sea-otter furs. After a voyage across the Pacific, the ginseng and furs were exchanged for Chinese tea and silk. These in turn were sold to Americans at high prices when the vessel returned to the United States after a trip around the woddin 1790. The Columbia inaugurated a regular trade route, with profits that were some- times enormous. In exchange for trinkets valued at less than $2, one trader got from the Indians sea-otter pelts that brought $22,000 in China. Small wonder that in 1800, 5 years before the arrival ot Lewis and Clark, no tewer than 15 New En- gland ships cruised the coast of Oregon to gather furs for the China trade. The beavers found in inland waterways drew even more people to Oregon than the sea otters of the coast. Beaver pelts had been the chief export of French C^ana- da before 1763 and of the British tur traders alter that. By 1800, the eastern supply had been reduced so ntuch that the discovery ot beavers in the streams drain- ing from the Rockies was like a gold strike.

Who sent back the first reports of rich Oregon soil? American Fur Company headed by John Jacob Astor of New York, and the Mis- souri Company of St. Louis. The bitter struggle among the fur companies verged on actual warfare. The three companies played politics in rivalries among the Indi- an nations, bribed away each other's agents, and sometimes stole each other's fiirs. As accessible regions were trapped out, the rugged individuals who carried on the dangerous business of trapping and trading in Indian country penetrated far- ther and farther into the Rocky Mountain wilderness searching for new sources of\" furs. In The Year of Decision, 1846, Bernard DeVoto wrote ot the bravery, skill, and self-reliance of these trappers, who became known as \"mountain men\": Woodcraft, forest craft, and river craft were his skill. To read the weather, the streams, the woods; to know the ways of animals and birds; to find food and shelter; to find the Indians when they were his customers or to battle them from stump to stump when they were on the warpath and to know which caprice was on them; to take comfort in flood or blizzard; to move safely through the wilderness, to make the wilderness his bed, his table and his tool — this was his vocation. While their heyday lasted only about 10 years and the\\' never numbered more than a few hundred at any one time, the mountain men played an important part in opening overland routes to Oregon and California. They discovered the best pass- es through the mountains and places where rivers could be crossed. They also served as guides to parties of settlers cross- ing the mountains by wagon train. The pursuits of the mountain men, however, were devastating to the native Americans. They introduced whiskey and new dis- eases, which corrupted and weakened these Americans. Settlers Move West Until shortly before 1840 the joint occupation of Oregon was almost entirely a British affair, with the Hudson's Bay Company acting as the government ol the region. In the mid- 1830s, however, American churches sent missionaries to Christianize the Indians. When the mis- sionaries began to farm, they sent back glowing reports ot the fertility of the soil. Missionaries Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, together with Eliza and Henrj' Spalding, joined a band ol mountain men on their journey to Oregon in 1836. Nar- cissa Whitman and Eliza Spalding were the first white women known to cross the continent. Reading the Whitmans' letters, people in the East were convinced that the Oregon country could be settled.

By 1842 there were perhaps 500 Americans in Oregon, and in the next year a single parry of immigrants numbered 900. The long, slow journey from Missouri to Oregon demanded courage and endurance. Heavy Conestoga wagons car- ried a family's belongings in a space only about 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. Teams of 6 or 8 oxen pulled the wagons; when the going was good, they covered about 2 miles in an hour. The trip usually took from May to November, when there was grass along the trail for the cattle to graze. Crossing rivers in- volved the risk of tipping the wagons or drowning the oxen. Through much of the journey there was an ever-present danger from Indians. To meet such difficulties, parties of immigrants had to be thorough- ly organized. The members of a wagon train often chose officers by election. One person would have responsibility for the cattle, another for posting sentries, and another for leading the advance party, which chose the route. The group as a whole voted on major decisions. By 1843 so many Americans had arrived in Oregon that they set up a government of their own. Like the Pilgrims and the Mayflower Compact, they drew up their own constitution. Its preamble, similar to the U.S. Constitution Preamble, read: We the people of Oregon territory, for the purpose of mutual protection and to secure peace and prosperity among ourselves, agree to adopt the following laws and regulations until such time as the United States of America extend their Jurisdiction over us. of the Columbia River and demanding that their government take possession of the Oregon Territory. Another group of settlers moved west, not to expand United States territory but to escape from it. The Mormon Church and its founder Joseph Smith were forced to move several times to escape persecu- tion. Many people resented the new reli- gion because of its communal organization and Smith's teachings that a man could have more than one wife. The Mormons moved first to Ohio, then to Missouri, and then to Illinois. At Nauvoo, Illinois, they built a thriving communit}' of 20,000 people. But in 1844 Joseph Smith was jailed for ordering the destruction of a printing press that belonged to people who The last phrase shows dial the settlers were determined that the United States and not Britain should rule Oregon. By 1845, 5,000 Americans were living south Life of the Times Mountain Men In the early nineteenth century, fashionable Europeans ivore felt hats made of beaver fur. Milliners used the short-haired fir from a beaver's belly to produce the sofr nap needed for felt. These hats came in all shapes — top hats, felt bonnets, and tri- corns — the three-cor- nered hats associated with the American Revolution. At one time miUiners obtained their fins from Russia, but hunters exhausted the supply of heaver there. The next source was the woodlands of eastern North America until the beaver was hunted out there too.

Few rules, except the law of sur- vival, governed their behavior. J While only some moun- tain men could read, almost all were good horsemen and marksmen. As year-round wilderness residents, they learned to live independently. They also knew everything about capturing beavers. A mountain inan called the bait he used to lure the beaver \"medicine. \" Actually it was a musk\\- liquid that came from the glands of other heavers. The mountain man spread the liquid on a branch suspended above the trap. Since beavers are water animals, a moun- tain man set his trap under water to mask his smell. An animal caught in the underwater trap drowned quickly, and so the trapper did not have to worry about struggling with his catch and possibly getting hurt or damaging the pell of the animal.

They developed an advanced system for controlling the water supply in the semiarid regions of the Far West. Around Salt Lake City, irrigation transformed the desert into a garden spot.

A pioneer Methodist mis- sionary effort began in the Oregon Terri- tory when Marcus and Narcissa Whitman helped establish a string of mission stations along the Columbia River in the 1830s.

Mexican officials agreed that Austin could bring American settlers into Texas, provided that they became Roman Catholics and obeyed Mexican law. Austins settlement proved so success- ful that by 1830 Texas had attracted almost 30,000 Americans. In that year Mexico passed a law restricting further immigration because it was concerned about developments in Texas. Americans, knowing that Mexico's law against slavery was not strictly enforced in Icxas, had hroughi ihousands of enslaved people. In addition, ihey had failed to become Catholics, and the flood of settlers now iiuinumbcred local Mexicans 10 to 1. In 1833 Mexico elected General Anto- nio Santa Anna as president. When the new president assumed tlictatoriai powers and abolished local rights, rebellion broke out in Texas. Late in 1835 Santa Anna marched his army north to subdue the rebels. In February 1836, with more than 2,000 troops, Santa Anna besieged 188 Texans in the Alamo, a mission station in San Antonio.

Division of Oregon, 1846 The risk of war with Mexico put pres- sure on the United States to settle the Oregon question. It was one thing to shout, \"Fifty-four forty or fight!\" in an election campaign, and another to take on Great Britain, the greatest sea power in the world, and prepare to fight Mexico. Great Britain also had reasons to settle the Oregon question peacefully. By 1846 the number of American settlers in Ore- gon had risen to 10,000 and United States expansionists were calling lor \"thirty thou- sand rifles\" in Oregon to protect Ameri- can interests. Rather than losing all ot the territory, the British government was will- ing to relinquish the southern half The Hudson's Bay Company had trapped out the beavers from the region there and had moved its principal base troni the Columbia River to Vancouver Island.

When Texans revolted against the Mexi- can government, Santa Anna led an army into Texas. Led by Sam Houston, the Tex- ans eventually won a shaky independence.

She has proclaimed that hostilities have commenced, and that the two nations are now at war. — James K. Polk Message to Congress, May 11,1 846 Section Focus James K. Polk had been chosen as a presidential candidate because of his clear commitment to territorial expansion. He was determined to fulfill the pledges he made to his party during the campaign. In undertaking a war with Mexico, how- ever, he would face stiff resistance from northerners and Whigs in Congress. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Contrast the United States' short-term and long-range goals in the war with Mexico. • List the terms of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. James K. Polk was a man who knew what he wanted. On his first day in office, he told a member of his cabi- net that he had four great purposes: to settle the Oregon question, to lower the tariff to reestablish the inde- pendent treasury system abolished by the Whigs in 1842, and to annex California. By his third year in office, Polk's strong will and hard work had accomplished his first three goals. Annexing California would prove much more difficult. New Englanders had traded with Cali- fornia for cattle hides and tallow for 50 years and had described the region as \"the richest, most beautifiil, the healthiest country in the world.\" In the 1840s, it seemed that control of the region might soon change hands. The native popula- tion had staged 4 rebellions against the Mexican government, which was too dis- tant and too disorganized to govern the region effectively. American officials feared that Great Britain, or even France, might annex California to acquire the great harbor of San Francisco, large enough to accommodate all the navies of the world. In his annual message to Congress in December 1845, Polk cautioned Great Britain and France by repeating the \"no colonization\" principle of the Monroe Doctrine. He also urged the United States consul, or official representative, in Mon- terey, California, to \"arouse in the bosoms of the Californians that love of liberty so natural to the American continent\" — in other words, to stir up a revolution. Late in 1845 he sent John Slidell as envoy to Mexico to discuss the Texas question and to offer up to $25 million for California. Slidell's mission was completely fruitless. So great was Mexican anger at the loss of Texas that any Mexican official who dared to talk with the American diplomat could have lost his position and possibly his life. Slidell's visit, however, inspired a success- ful revolt against the Mexican government by those who opposed any negotiations with the United States. The new leaders were determined to go to war to win back Texas, and President Mariano Paredes refused to see Slidell. Because he could not present his case, Slidell returned to Washington, D.C. The Mexican govern- ment broke off diplomatic relations when the United States annexed Texas, making further negotiations impossible.

Which terri- tory did he want to annex? Outbreak of War The spark that ignited the war between Mexico and the United States resuhed from a dispute over the southern bound- ary of Texas. Mexico claimed it was the Nueces (noo AY suhs) River, while the United States said it was the Rio Grande 130 miles to the south. Both sides pre- pared troops, but for a time they did not clash. On hearing of the failure of Slidells mission to Mexico City, Polk immediately ordered General Zachary Taylor to move his troops south to the Rio Grande. Tay- lor's troops were, in effect, sent looking tor trouble, waiting for an incident justi- fying retaliation. Late in April 1846, Mexican soldiers crossed the Rio Grande and attacked a small detachment of United States cavalry, which were in Mexican territory accord- ing to the Mexican point ot view. When news of this attack on Taylors force reached Washington, D.C., the President hastily revised a war message that he had been preparing in response to Slidells rejection in Mexico City. Pointing out that his effort to negotiate peaceably with Mexico had failed, Polk argued that war had been begun \"by the act of Mexico herself\" On May 13, 1846, Congress declared war by overwhelming majorities in both houses. In spite of the vote in Congress, many Americans refused to support a war of aggression against a weaker neighbor.

Linking Across Time Declaring War It is doubtful that an American President today would declare war as preemptively as Polk did in 1846. In 1990, although Americans deplored Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and praised Presi- dent Bush's deployment of United States' troops to the Mid- dle East to protect Saudi Arabia from invasion, many Americans sup- ported force only after the nation joined with the world communit}' in exhausting all other peaceftil options.

Lincoln invited Polk to point out the spot where American blood had been spilled on American soil. Even American soldiers had their doubts about the legitimacy of the war. In 1846 Colonel Ethan Allen Hitchcock wrote: / have said from the first that the United States are the aggressors We have not one particle of right to be here It looks as if the government sent a small force on purpose to bring on a war, so as to have a pretext for taking California and as much of this country as it chooses, for, whatever becomes of this army, there is no doubt of a war between the United States and Mexico. . . . My heart is not in this business. . . but, as a military man, I am bound to execute orders. Although attacking Polk for starting the war, the Whigs in Congress supported it by voting for supplies and troops. This action was not as illogical as it may seem, because it is not certain that war could have been prevented. Several months before Polk's message to Congress, the Mexican government had declared itself in lavor of \"a necessary and glorious war.\" Aware of the dismal failure of American efforts to invade Canada in the War of 1812, the Mexicans expected victory. The President himself planned the mili- tary campaigns of the Mexican War as a three-part strategy. First, General Taylor and his troops invaded northern Mexico. In May they pushed the Mexican army back across the Rio Grande and by September had taken the city of Monter- rey. Taylor and his men then penetrated nearly 300 miles into Mexico and against strong resistance, won the battle of Buena Vista in February 1847. As the second part of the war strategy.

Thus California came under United States control, and fighting in the west ended. When Mexico still refused to make peace, Polk launched the third part of his war strategy, sending General Winfield Scott to conquer Mexico City. With a force of 10,000, Scott sailed south and landed at Veracruz. In September 1847, after six months of difficult fighting, he occupied the capital. Working to the Americans' advantage was the disorganization of the Mexican government. One group after another seized power in Mexico, so that some- times it was difficult to know who headed the government; once three different men claimed to be president. Alfonso Toro, a Mexican historian, wrote of his country's hapless condition: Although Mexico had an enormous war budget, she really lacked an army; for hardly worthy of the name was the assemblage of drafted men, badly armed, and . . . without confidence in their leaders.

Meanwhile, ardent advocates of manifest destiny, including two members of Polk's Cabinet, urged that the United States annex all of Mexico. President Polk, anticipating Scott's vic- tory in Mexico City, had sent Nicholas P. Trist, a clerk in the state department, to Mexico with instructions to offer the same terms that Slidell had offered earlier. After a long delay, Polk's patience with Trist gave out, and the President ordered him back to Washington. Trist, knowing that he was on the verge of a successful treaty, ignored the orders and stayed on to complete the negotiations. In February 1848, before the total- annexation movement had proceeded very far, a peace treaty was signed at Guad- alupe Hidalgo, outside Mexico City. While President Polk denounced the \"exceptional conduct\" of Nicholas Trist, he saw no alternative to submitting this treaty to the Senate. After a round of expansionist oratory by those who favored annexing all of Mexico, the Sen- ate finally voted 38 to 14 in favor of the treaty. In the treaty the United States gained full title to Texas (with the Rio Grande as a boundary), California, and all of what was then called New Mexico except the so-called Gadsden Purchase, which was acquired in 1853. The United States paid $15 million outright for New Mexico and California and agreed to pay debts of the Mexican government amounting to $3,250,000. Mexico lost only 1 percent of its population but half ot its national ter- ritory. In 1853 the United States completed expansion across the continent by pur- chasing from Mexico a strip of land in Arizona and New Mexico.

How would the United States connect its Pacific settlements with the East? Would expansion continue south- ward? Would manifest destiny continue to move American interests beyond North America to other parts of the globe? Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the events that brought about the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. • Compare the motivations for American interest in Cuba, Central America, China, and Japan in the mid- 1800s. The acquisition of territory from Mexico and the division of Ore- gon completed United States expansion across the continent. The spirit ol manifest destiny subsided in the North but not in the South. Wliether dictated by law or by geography, the por- tion of the United States open to slavery was far smaller than the area closed to slavery. Many southerners thought the only way to maintain the sectional bal- ance was to expand southward. In 1848 De Bow's Review, a New Orleans financial journal, declared, \"We have New Mexico and California. We will have old Mexico and Cuba!\" The Caribbean and Central America Lying so close to Florida, Cuba offered tempting benefits — rich sugar plantations worked by thousands of enslaved people and a strategic location at the mouth of the Caribbean. So strong was the desire lor Cuba among southerners and some northern investors that in 1848 the Unit- ed States offered to buy Cuba from Spain for $100 million. The Spanish foreign minister turned down the bid, saying that he would rather see the island sink into the sea than sell it. When negotiations failed, determined expansionists lent their support to armed adventurers called \"filibusterers,\" who set off to gain territory that might later be annexed to the United States. One of the best known filibusterers was Narcisco Lopez. With the aid of prominent South- erners, Lopez attempted three armed landings in Cuba with small bands of Americans. His goal was to foment a revolt against Spanish rule, but on his third try he was captured and swiftly exe- cuted in 1851. Interest in expansion to the south did not die with Lopez, however. Prominent northern Democrats who sought southern expansion were called \"dough faces.\" Among these was President Franklin Pierce from New Hampshire. He raised America's offering price for Cuba to $130 million. When Spain still refused, secretary of state William Marcy instructed United States ministers to Spain, Britain, and France to meet and decide how to obtain Cuba. The 3 United States diplomats drew up a state- ment known as the Ostend Manifesto, 414 Unit 5 Division and Reunion: 1825-1877"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"which declared that if Spain would not sell the island, the United States should take it by force. In part it said: After we shall have offered Spain a price ftjr Cuba far beyond its present value, and this shall have been refiised, it will then be time to consider the question, does Cuba, in the possession of Spain, seriously endanger our internal peace and existence of our cherished Unions' Should this question be answered in the affirmative, then, by every law, human and divine, we shall be justified in wresting it from Spain Published in 1854, this infamous docu- ment caused such protest that the secre- tary of state repudiated it, and the effort to buy Cuba was abandoned. Future attempts to expand slave territory were doomed because of northern opposition. American ambitions turned from ex- pansion to development of the newly acquired territories. Hundreds made the long journey overland across the plains and the Rocky Mountains, but the longest route around Cape Horn, South America, was the safest. In January 1848, gold was discovered in California at Sutter's mill near Sacramento. Stories of instant riches led to a gold rush from the eastern United States and Europe. Many fortune seekers who took the ocean route saved time by crossing the narrow isthmus at Panama to board one of the few ships that would carry them to California. The gold rush aroused new interest in a project that had been discussed since the establishment of the Spanish colonies in the sixteenth cen- tury: the construction of a canal across Central America to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. In 1846 the United States signed a treaty with New Cranada (later Colombia) by which it gained the right to preserve \"free tr.insit\" across the Isthmus ol Panama. The British were also interested in con- trolling canal routes and in extending I heir influence along the entire Atlantic coast of Central America. Rival ambitions caused such tension that in 1850 Great Britain sent a special agent. Sir Henry Bulwer, to Washington, D.C., to confer with Secretary of State John M. Clayton. In the resulting Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, the United States and Britain agreed to jointly support the building of a canal either through Nicaragua or Panama. The cost and risks of such a venture delayed action by either country until after 1900. Then American interest was reawakened by the commercial and military advan- tages of a canal to support United States expansion in the Pacific. >^°^. Narcisco Lopez 1798M851 Narcisco Lopez, a Venezuelan, fought for Spain against Simon Bolivar's South American independence forces, rising to the rank of general in the Spanish Army. Later he took up residence in Cuba, married, and became devoted to the interests of the Cuban people. In 1848 he planned a revolt against Span- ish rule, hoping for help from Ameri- c.in supporters and for annexation of the island to the LJnited States. When the revolt failed, he fled to America.

For centuries the prospect of trade with China had stirred people's imaginations because China produced valuable commodities and its potential 300 million customers were the largest untapped market in the world. United States trade with China had grown since the late eighteenth centu- ry, but until the 1 840s, this trade was lim- ited to the port of Canton. As the oldest civilization in the world, the Chinese did not think they had much to gain from the outside world. But a weakened Chinese government could not long resist foreign trade. From 1839 to 1842, the British fought the First Opium War with China. When Great Britain won, it acquired the port of Hong Kong and various privileges for its mer- chants and missionaries. Among these was the right of extraterritoriality, or the right of a foreigner accused of a crime to be tried under his or her own law rather than under Chinese law by Chinese courts.

Underlying the push to the Pacific was the desire to secure West Coast harbors and the rich resources ot Oregon. Expansion had its price, however. Mexicans, native Americans, and the British were also rivals for this land. Ironically, tensions between the United States and Britain erupted over a territorial dispute in the Northeast. Conflict was avoided by the Webster- Ashburton Treaty. Meanwhile, Oregon attracted increasing numbers of American settlers, and others staked claims in Texas. When Mexico tried to cut oft immigration, Texans already had independence on their minds. Texans won their independence and soon asked to be admitted to the United States. President Polk, unable to purchase California from Mexico, sent troops to southern Texas, provoking war. After Mexico's defeat, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo extended the United States to the Pacific Ocean and set the Texas border at the Rio Grande. Americans soon turned their sights toward other global interests. Only public outrage prevented the United States from seizing Cuba from Spain. To expand global trade, the United States negotiated with Britain a peaceful solution to controlling canal routes in Central America, took advantage of trading privi- leges won by European nations in China, and used warships to back up its request that Japan open its ports to American merchants. * Using Vocabulary Imagine yourself an American diplomat in the 1840s assigned to negotiate trade agreements in China and Japan.

Later, you will use this same card when preparing your final bibliography. Weaver, Robert B. \"Pioneer Life.\" World Book Encyclopedia. Vol. 14. Chicago: Field Enterprises, 1991, pages 428-442. Start the next card with the author's last name and first name, if more than one author has the same last name. Include the tide, too, if you are using more than one resource from this author. Also include the page number. Underneath the author's name and page number, take notes on one main idea only. Start by writing a sentence that summarizes the main idea — a general- ization. Then list supporting statements. Weaver, page 439 Main Idea: The pioneers could not buy soap, so they had to make their own. Supporting Statements: 1 . The pioneers saved wood ashes in a barrel and fats and grease from cooking and butchering. 2. In the spnng the pioneers poured water over the ashes in the barrel and allowed it to trickle out through a hole near the bottom. 3. This brown liquid called lye was collected and boiled in a kettle with fats and grease until it thick- ened to form a soft, jellylike, yellow soap. • After you have taken notes from all your resources using a separate card for each main idea, sort through your cards, placing them in the order you will address the main ideas as \\'ou write.

With the acquisition of New Mexico and California, it became clear that some decision had to be made regarding the legality of slavery in these new areas. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Evaluate the impact of the issue of slav- ery on the 1848 presidential election. • Explain why Calilornia's application tor admission to the Union incited heated debates on the question of slavery. • Describe how the Compromise of 1850 temporarily reunited the nation. Even before the war with Mexico had ended, growing antislavery sentiment in the North led the House of Representatives, with its northern majority, to pass the Wilmot Proviso. This bill provided that all territory acquired from Mexico should be closed to slavery. Although the Wilmot Proviso was defeated in the Senate, where North and South were equally represent- ed, many southern senators argued that •Congress had no constitutional power to forbid slavery in the territories; to do so would be to deny slaveowners their rights as citizens. There seemed to be no way of reconciling these opposing views on the issue of slavery in the new territories. When the Polk administration ended in 1849, no steps had been taken to provide for civil government in New Mexico and California. The Election of 1848 In the presidential election of 1848, both northerners and southerners took elaborate precautions to play down discus- sion of slavery. The Democrats, although controlled by their southern wing, nomi- nated a northern senator, Lewis Cass of Michigan. Cass supported a compromise solution known as popular sovereignty, whereby voters within the territories would decide whether slavery would be permitted inside their borders. The state- ment of policies, or platform, of the Democrats reinforced this idea by stating that Congress had no authority over the question of slavery. The Whigs, whose principal stronghold was in the North, nominated Zachary Taylor from Louisiana, a slaveowner him- self The Whig platform avoided the issue of slavery altogether by focusing on Tay- lors military accomplishments in the Mexican War. Efforts to keep slavery out of the cam- paign failed, however. A third party emerged when a group of antislavery northern Democrats and \"conscience Whigs\" united with the former Liberty parry to form the Free Soil party. This party, whose motto was \"Free soil, free speech, free labor, and free men,\" nomi- nated former President Martin Van Buren. Although the Free Soilers gained no elec- toral votes, they received more popular votes than the Democrats had in New York, Vermont, and Massachusetts.

The California Question The issue of slavery in the new territo- ries intensified after .gold was discovered in California in 1848. By the end of 1849, an estimated 95,000 \"Forty-niners\" from all over the world had settled in northern California. Ray Allen Billington, a historian, described the gold-seekers: In those ramshackle in/iiiug camps. . . where rooms rented for $1,000 a month and eggs cost $10 a dozen, were assembled the most colorfid desperadoes ever gathered in one spot. Mingling together were Missouri farmers, Yankee sailors, Georgia crackers. English shopkeepers, French peasants, Australian sheepherders, Mexican peons, . . . and a liberal sprinkling of \"assassins manufactured in Hell. \" With this tremendous growlli in [lopu- lation came an urgent need tor govern- ment. CJime and violence had become common in mining camps and towns, and military authorities could not conuol ii. At the siiggcsiion ol President laylor, a convention met in Monterey, C'alilornia, in the fdl of 1849, and adopted a consti- tution that, in part, provided a structure for the new government and outlined state boundaries. It also prohibited slavery. The Life of the Times FORTY-NlNERS President Polk referred to the rich gold discov- ery in California in his annual message to Congress in December 1848. The secret was out. Within a year the gold fever attracted some 95,000 people to California. The three principal routes were across the Isthmus of Panama, around Cape Horn, or overland. Half of the 49ers crossed the plains and mountains. Along the California Trail inex- perienced travelers died by the luoulrcds. Skeletons ot horses and oxen marked the toll of death trorn exhaustion or starva- tion. The hardships, according to John Lloyd Stephens who described his own ... are beyond conception.

As an agricultural state, California produces 90% of the nation's wine and 54% of its fresh vegetables. newly created government immediately applied for admission to the Union as a free state in which slavery was forbidden. California's application lor statehood touched off one of the longest, most bitter debates in the history of Congress. Violent threats aimed at senators were common. Admission of California would tip the bal- ance of power in the Senate in hwor of the free states, already in the majority in the House. If California were admitted as a tree state, southern leaders warned, their states would leave the Union. To deal with this alarming situation, Henry Clay, who had been in retirement since his defeat in the presidential election of 1844, successfully ran for reelection as senator. The Whig senator from Ken- tucky, a master of negotiation, proceeded to arrange his last great intersectional compromise. Clay's compromise was a series of measures intended to satisfy northern and southern demands. The principal provisions favoring the North were that California be admitted as a tree state and that the slave trade — but not slavery — be forbidden in the District ot Columbia. The South, in turn, would gain a stronger Fugitive Slave Law, de- signed to suppress the Underground Rail- road. In addition, the Mexico Cession, gained at the end of the Mexican War, would be divided into two territories, Utah and New Mexico, with the question of slavery to be decided by popular sovereignty when the territories were orga- nized with territorial legislatures. This was, interestingly enough, the same for- mula as had been proposed by Cass in the 1848 campaign. At first. Clay's proposals failed to receive sufficient support to pass. Presi- dent Taylor opposed Clay and offered proposals of his own. However, Taylor died suddenly in the summer ot 1850. His successor. Vice President Millard Fill- more, favored the compromise. The young Illinois senator Stephen A. Doug- las skillfully put through the compromise as five separate bills, which Fillmore duly signed. The Compromise ot 1850 averted immediate disaster, but, unhappily, turned out to be a temporary truce rather than a permanent peace. m VSHB smj Section One Review Illllllllllllllllf •Summary By 1848 the nation had become divided over the issue of slavery. Etforts to down- play the controversy during the presiden- tial election were dashed when a group of northern Democrats, who advocated free- dom for the slaves, formed the Free Soil parry. The conflict over slavery became centered on the admission of new states, especially California. The Compromise of 1850 temporarily calmed tempers on both sides.

The stamp collector tells you that before the stamps can be appraised, you will first have to classify them. Expl anation Classifying is a process oi sepa- rating and arranging information into related groups. The stamp collector wants you to separate the stamps into categories such as United States stamps and stamps of foreign nations or regular- issue stamps and commem- orative stamps. This kind of classification will make it easier for you and the collec- tor to see what stamps you have and to evaluate them. In order to group the stamps into these various categories, you must exam- ine each stamp and compare it to the others. Based on your understanding of the criteria — tor example, the differences between a regular-issue stamp and a com- memorative stamp — you can then classify each stamp accordingly. The same process can be done with historical information. Instead of trying to understand all the information about a broad subject, you can break it down into parts and organize it. Taking notes on the subject is one way of organizing the information. Another would be making a chart, which is a graphic view of the information set up in columns and rows. Organizing the information makes it easier to evaluate, and from studying the information, one can draw con- clusions or make generalizations. Example One of the many sources of information about history is illustrations. This map of the Compromise of 1850, for example, will be helpful in understanding COMPROMISE OF 1850 Free states Slave states Territory closed to slavery Territory open to slavery Indian territory what were the results of the compromise. After examining the data on the map, follow the guidelines below to help classify its information. • Determine what iitformation you need to classify. (results of the Compromise of 18'>0) • Decide on the major categories by looking closely at how the information can be broken down into parts. (The legend of this map shows categories: free states, free territories, slave states, territories open to slavery) Write down the data that fits in each category or, if you are making a chart, place the appropriate information in columns under each category. {free states: Calif., Conn., Del., 111., Ind., Iowa, Maine, Mass., Mich., N.H., N.J., N.Y., Ohio, Pa., R.I., Vt., Wise; fire territories: Minn., Oreg., Unorganized Territory; slave states: Ala., Ark., Fla., Ga., Ky., La., Md., Miss., Mo., N.C., S.C., Tenn., Tex., Va.; territories open to slavery: N.M., Utah) • After studying the in- formation in each category and combining it with your prior knowledge of the subject you are studying, what conclusions can you make? (Possible answers might be: Free states and territories were in the northern half of the country; In 1850 there ivas not much territory left that would be open to slavery; More of the nation was free in 1850 than was slave.) Practice For further practice in classify- ing information, follow these guidelines in taking notes or creating a chart on the Kansas- Nebraska Act map on page 434.

Every major economic inter- est — cotton planting, wheat farming, manufacturing, and transportation — was booming. The huge gold strike in Cali- fornia paid for imports; the flood of gold expanded United States currency Also, during these years, increasing numbers of immigrants began arriving in the country Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe the inventions that changed both the northern and southern economies. • Explain the great impact of increased immigration on the economic growth of the United States. During the 20 years from 1840 to 1860, rapid and apparently self-sustaining growth became the dominant characteristic of the nation's economy. Among the reasons for this growth were new inventions, 426 sufficient capital with which to build new factories, a class of businesspeople willing to start new enterprises, an increase in agricultural productivity, a growing labor supply and a transportation system that connected farms to factories. Inventions and Industry In 1850 two-thirds of the nation's peo- ple were engaged in agriculture. But indus- try was growing, partly because of a flood of new inventions. By 1861 the telegraph had made possible rapid communication throughout the continent and across the Atlantic. The rotary press allowed newspa- pers to publish far larger editions than ever before. Some inventions, however, had their greatest impact on Northern indus- tries. For example, the sewing machine, invented by Elias Howe in 1846, revolu- tionized shirt-making by reducing the time it took to make one shirt from more than 14 hours to little more than an hour; when the technique was adapted for shoemaking, it made possible the mass production of shoes. Charles Goodyear's invention of vulcanized rubber in 1839 was widely used in industry and in the manufacture of waterproof garments. Textile factories, powered by more effi- cient steam engines, increased in size as several operations were combined under a single roof The techniques invented by Eli Whitney and Simeon North for mak- ing interchangeable parts and breaking down manufacturing into simple opera- tions now found applications in the mass production of clocks, watches, larm ma- chinery, and sewing machines. For the first time, goods manufactured in the United States were featured in world markets.

These products were the resuh of Yankee ingenuiry and the machine-tool industry, which mass-pro- duced interchangeable parts. The British called this industry \"the American system of manufacturing,\" but \"the Northeastern American system\" would have been more accurate. More than half of America's 140,000 factories were concentrated between New York and Massachusetts, and they were the coun- try's largest and most productive. The South had 20,000 factories, but they were small and concentrated on processing local products like cotton or tobacco rather than manufacturing. ffiniitnii Making The technology Connection 1. How might the level of industrial- ization affect the ability of the North and the South to wage war? Linking Past And Present 2. Hypothesize why the South in the 1990s is not among the top few manufacturing centers. innovations such as mechanical churns, revolvers, and alarm clocks fascinated the crowds. All this activity served to benefit the industrialized North far more than it did the South, whose economy was largely based on agriculture. Developments in Agriculture Inventions and innovations allowed agricultural productivity to keep pace with the nation's htst-growing industries, riie Middle West, with its fertile plains, attracted farmers from the rockv .ind hilly lands of the Northeast as well as immi- grants from I'.mope. Public lands could be piuxhased lor as little as 25 cents an acre, and the Pre-emption Act of 1841 allowed squatters the o|ip()niinity to buy their land before someone else did. The first great need was for plows that could cut through tree roots in recently cleared forest land and turn the tough sod of the ptairies. In 1825 Jethro Wood began the manufacture of an iron plow with replaceable parts. John Deere of Moline, Illinois, soon developed a much- improved version made of steel instead of iron; by 1850 the Deere factories were turning out as many as 10,000 plows per year. The new plows enabled farmers to plant tnore land than they could harvest. To solve this problem, Cyrus McCormick, a Virginia blacksmith, took out a patent in 1834 on a mechanical \"reaper,\" or grain harvester. Bv 1860 more than 1 ()(),()()() of McC.ormick's reapers were in use.

By the turn of the century, however, most of the millions of \"new\" immigrants were from eastern and southern Europe, notably Russia and Italy. But regardless of the country of ori- gin, reasons for coming to America remained much the same, freedom from political unrest and eco- nomic opportunity. British textile industry brought prosperity to the deep South. In the 1850s, cotton production broke all previous records. By 1860 seven-eighths of the world's supply ot cotton came from the United States, and raw cotton comprised three-fifths ot the nations exports. The 1850s also witnessed a revival of tobacco farming. A discovery by Stephen, a black overseer in North Carolina, led to a new method of \"curing,\" or preparing, tobacco, which greatly increased the yield and quality of tobacco crops. Yet despite these advances, the South did not experi- ence the industrial expansion enjoyed by the North. Eventually the West would fol- low the North and surpass the South in its move toward greater industrialization. Increased Immigration Fuels Factories One of the necessities for sustained industrial growth is a sizable labor supply. Until about 1800, immigrants came to the United States at a rate of about 8,000 per year. During the second quarter of the nine- teenth centur)', however, a great migration Irom Europe to America began. Between 1840 and 1860, an average of more than 200,000 immigrants reached American shores every year. The reasons lor this were both political and economic. Thousands of immigrants made the perilous voyage to escape poverty. Many English crafts work- ers, made jobless by the Industrial Revolu- tion, sailed to America. The Scandinavians and the Dutch, whose native soil could not support rapidly growing populations, also came. So did the Irish, after a failure of their potato crop resulted in economic hardship and the starvation of thousands. Others, like the Germans, came to avoid political persecution. By 1860 one out of every eight Americans was foreign-born. European agents of railroad companies and steamship lines described America as a land where riches could be had almost tor the asking. Several states established immi- gration agencies to attract northern Euro- peans; inducements were otTered, such as giving the right to vote to newcomers even before they became naturalized citizens. Perhaps the most persuasive inducements were the \"America letters\" written by recent immigrants to their families and friends in Europe. One person wrote: The poorest families adorn the tables three times a day like a wedding dinner — tea, coffee, beef, fowls, pies, eggs, pickles, good bread. . . . Say, is it so in England? The move to America was difficult and dangerous. Immigrants were packed into overcrowded ships where terrible condi- tions resulted in death from malnutrition and disease in an estimated 10 percent of the passengers. Unfortunately, the prob- lems of the immigrants continued even after they had found jobs and places to live — immigrants were forced to confront the bigotry of some established Americans who resented their different languages, religions, and customs. Such resentment, along with the fear that immigrants would bring new and possibly radical political ideas into the United States, led to the formation of secret societies. One of these was a nation- wide secret political society called The Order of the Star-Spangled Banner, founded in 1849. Nicknamed \"Know Nothings\" because members replied \"I know nothing\" when asked about their organization, they tried to keep recent immigrants from political office. They also demanded that immigration be restricted and that the naturalization peri- od be extended to 21 years. In spite of such hardships and preju- dice, immigrants continued to flock to the United States. Although some went West to its rich farmlands, many remained in the North, often in such port cities as New York and Boston, where their ships had docked. One reason for this was that they had little money to continue their journeys. Also the South already had a source of cheap labor — the black slave. The result was that immigrants supplied the North's growing industries with a steady stream of low-paid workers. 428 Unit 5 Division and Reunion: 1825-1877"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"Transportation Ties North and West With rapidly expanding domestic and foreign markets came great advances in transportation. In the 1850s the United States btiilt the largest merchant marine fleet in the world, inland navigation reached its peak, and on the railroads — the newest form of transportation — track mileage was increased threefold. In 1849 Great Britain repealed the Nav- igation Laws that had given special pro- tection to British ships trading within its empire. The United States, however, con- tinued to allow only its own ships to carry cargo between American ports. Compet- ing on even terms with British ships in British ports while enjoying an advantage in their own, United States ships increased in total tonnage from 943,000 tons in 1846 to 2,226,000 tons in 1857. The greatest triumph at sea for the United States was the clipper ship, which enjoyed its brief heyday between 1845 and 1860. Characterized by very sharp bows, an immense spread of sail, and masts 200 feet high, clippers soon became the fastest ocean-going sailing vessels ever built. The clipper Lightning once logged over 500 miles in a 24-hour period. Alarmed by the superiority ol United States sailing ships, the British concentrat- ed on the development of steamships. Between 1850 and 1860, the amount of ocean freight carried in steam vessels rose from 14 to 28 percent, and most of this increase could be attributed to British ship- ping. By 1860 United States shipyards, which could produce only sailing ships, were closing down.

The Erie Canal car- ried so much traffic that it had to be widened and deepened. The Great Lakes gained such importance as a water route that 6,000 ships sailed from Chicago in a single year. This was also the great period of steamboats on the Mississippi River. Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi and Huckleberry Finn bear witness to the importance of the great river as a trade route. But the days of great river traffic were numbered. As inventor Oliver Evans pre- dicted in 1813: The time will come when people will travel in stages moved by steam engines, from one city to another, almost as fast as birds fly, fifteen or twenty miles an hour. Railroads were able to reach places that riverboats could not. By 1860 railroads tied the agricultural areas ol the Northwest to the cities and ports of the Northeast. The first successful use of the steam loco- motive in the United States occurred on the Charleston and Hamburg railroad line in South Carolina in 1831. Other lines began operation almost simultaneously. Early railroads, however, were handi- capped by numerous practical problems. Furthermore, railroads were extremely expensive to build and maintain. Whereas state governments had funded the building ol canals, private enterprise provicied the money for the railroads. The new railroads cost what were then colossal sums. The Erie Railroad cost about $23 million to build, half as much as the United States paid for New Mexico and Calilornia. By 1850 many of the technical problems of railroading had been solved, and an era of great expansion began. By this time 9,000 miles of track had been laid; 10 years later the number of miles had increased to over 30,000, and railroads connecting the Adantic seaboard to the Mississippi River crisscrossed the East.

Was the Union doomed to be torn apart by the vast political and economic differences that separated North and South? Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss how the majority of southern- ers viewed and defended the institution of slavery. • Explain the significance ot the Kansas- Nebraska Act. • Examine the reactions of both the North and the South to the Supreme C^ourts Dred .SVorr decision. Southern legislatures made it in- creasingly difficult for owners to emancipate their slaves. Some states decreed that free blacks must either go somewhere else or be sold back into slavery. All blacks, slave or Iree, had to carry identification passes when away from their homes. At night, patrols equipped with dogs and guns watched for runaways. The \"Peculiar Institution\" The bondage of blacks assumed many forms. Between house servants and their masters and mistresses, there was often a sense of trust and affection. Some enslaved people, especially in the cities, were hired out to other employees and thus were afforded some freedom of movement. The entire working force of the highly successful Tredegar Iron Works in Rich- mond, Virginia, was black. Most blacks, however, worked on plantations and lived lives marked by hard labor, cruel disci- pline, and isolation. Slave marriages were not legally recognized. Families could be broken up by sale. And it was against the law to teach slaves to read, although some white Southerners broke that law. The few people who enslaved many peo- ple made some money out of the slave sys- tem. The rise in the price of \"prime field hands,\" from $300 in 1790 to $1,800 in 1860, proved that slaves were a valuable commodity. In general, however, the sys- tem proved costly for the South as well as inefficient, mainly because it kept the South from mechanizing its industry. In ad- dition, slavery as an institution lowered the dignity of both the workers and the work. To support the system, many southerners developed an elaborate defense of slavery. Southerners argued that slavery was neces- sary to provide an adequate labor supply. Moreover, they said, slavery was \"a positive good\" because all the enslaved person's material needs were provided.

Opposition to Slavery For a few years it looked as though the Compromise of 1850 might provide a permanent solution to the slavery contro- versy. In the presidential election of 1852, both major parties stood by its provisions. Leading business people, plantation own- ers, and members of Congress joined in condemning any attempt at serious dis- cussion ol the issue of slavery. In the North, however, opposition to the stringent Fugitive Slave Law included in the Compromise of 1850 increased. Abolitionist mobs freed runaway slaves trom jail. Under this law, the word of an owner of a runaway slave or even one who claimed to be the owner, was taken as conclusive proof of identity. A suspected runaway (who might in fact be a free per- son) had no right to testify on his or her own behalf Any citizen might be required to join in pursuit of a runaway slave. To counter this injustice, most free state legislatures passed personal liberty laws that nullified the Fugitive Slave Law by forbidding state officials to assist in the capture of runaways. Antislavery feeling in the North was also stimulated by the pub- lication in 1852 of Harriet Beecher ^t* Po^ Harriet Tubman 1820-1913 Born to enslaved parents in Mary- land, Harriet Tubman worked as a plantation field hand until she was nearly 30 years old. Then she made her break for freedom, escaping to the North with the help of the Under- ground Railroad. Knowing full well the risks of being captured. Tubman nonetheless made 19 trips back into the South during the 1850s to help other slaves escape. Altogether she assisted more than 300 blacks — including her aged parents — to escape bondage. While not the founder of the Underground Railroad, she certainly became its most famous and successful conductor. Known as the \"Moses\" of her people. Tubman maintained iron discipline among the escapees, and — despite huge rewards offered in the South lor her capture and arrest — she always managed to elude her enemies.

Bloodshed on Free Soil In 1854 the political truce over slavery ended with the passage of the Kansas- Nebraska Act. This legislation originated with Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illi- nois, the skilled legislator of Compromise of 1850 fame. Douglas did not intend to reopen intersectional controversy. Rather, he hoped to encourage the rapid settle- ment of the trans-Missouri region and build a transcontinental railroad with ter- minals at St. Louis and Chicago. The act provided that the region be divided into two new territories, Nebraska and Kansas.

In order to overcome this problem, a clause specifically repeal- ing the Missouri ban on slavery north of that line was added. The results of the Kansas-Nebraska Act were disastrous. The repeal of the Mis- souri Compromise was denounced in the North as a violation of a solemn compact. The South continued to demand that the North recognize the rights of slaveholders in the territories of the United States. Settlers started at once to move into the Kansas Territory. Because the slavery issue was to be decided by popular vote, a race developed to see whether the majority of settlers would come from slave or free states. Northern settlers received assistance from an abolitionist organization, the Emigrant Aid Society, which supplied wagons, tools, livestock, farm machinery, and rifles. Meanwhile, a proslavery secret society, the Blue Lodge, sent armed settlers from Missouri into Kansas. The bloody struggle between the proslavery and antislavery factions began to assume the proportions of a civil war. The violence in \"bleeding Kansas\" reached its peak on the eve of the presi- dential election of 1856. In the two years 'since the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the Whig parry had broken up because of friction between the proslavery \"Cotton\" Whigs of the South and the antislavery \"Conscience\" Whigs of the North. To fill the void, two new parties — the Americans and the Republicans — appeared. The American party, composed of Know Nothings and some ex- Whigs, tried to divert people's minds from the slavery issue by whipping up feeling against immigrants. Its candidate in 1856 was former President Fillmore. The basic principle ot the Republicans (who took their name Irom the party of Thomas Jef- ferson) based its plattorm on \"free soil,\" or keeping slavery out of the territories. Free soil appealed to abolitionists, who con- demned slavery, and to many white farm- ers and laborers who feared that slavery would lower their standard of living by lowering wages. Strongly organized in every free state, the Republican party nominated General John C. Fremont as its candidate. Meanwhile, the Democrats dodged the slavery issue. To balance Southerners' dominance of the party, they nominated a Northerner, James Buchanan of Pennsyl- vania. With only a minority of the popu- lar vote, the Democrats won the election with 174 electoral votes for Buchanan against 114 for Fremont and 8 for Fill- more. The result of the election of 1856 was ominous because of the clearly sec- tional voting — the Democrats swept the South and gained enough votes to win, while the Republican Fremont won two- thirds of the electoral votes of the free states. The D red Scott Decision In his inaugural address in March 1857, President Buchanan suggested that the controversy over slavery in the territories be left to the Supreme Court, which had recently heard a case on this question and was soon expected to render a decision. 434 Units Division and Reunion: 1825-1877"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"Dred Scott was a slave taken by a former master from the state of Missouri into ter- ritory closed to slavery by the Missouri Compromise and then brought back to Missouri again. For more than 10 years, Scott, with the financial support of aboli- tionists, had sued for freedom on the grounds that residence in a free territory released him from slavery. On March 6, 1857, Chief Justice Roger Taney (TAW nee) delivered the majority opinion in Scott v. Sanford. Nine separate opinions were written. The seven majority views were Irom Democrats who upheld completely the southern point of view that Scott had no right to sue in a federal court. Taney ruled against Scott because, he claimed, the founders of the United States did not intend for blacks to be citizens. In addition, when ruling on the constitutionality of the Missouri Com- promise ban on slavery north of the 36° 30' line, the Court said: ...it is the opinion of the court that the Act of Congress which prohibited a citizen from holding and owning property of this kind [slaves] in the territory of the United States north of the line therein mentioned, is not warranted by the Constitution and is therefore void ******* Instead of settling the slavery dispute, the Dred Scott decision made it more bit- ter.

I Section Three Review flllTIIIIIIIIIIIIII^ Summary By the 1850s, slavery was firmly entrenched in the South. To defend the slave system, southerners fostered the belief that slavery was a positive good and that blacks were racially inferior. Antislavery feelings in the North were fueled by hatred of the Fugitive Slave Law and the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. Many northerners were upset by the Kansas-Nebraska Act with its provision for popular sovereignty. The Dred Scott decision, which stated that slaves were property and could be taken into the territories, intensified the conflict between proslavery and antislavery factions.

Both the North and the South watched with dread as events sur- rounding the election of 1860 led toward the dissolution of the Union. For south- erners, Lincoln's election signaled that slavery could not be extended. Obj ectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Evaluate the importance of the Lin- coln-Douglas debates. • Identify the purpose of John Brown's raid at Harper's Ferry and reactions to it. • List the political events that led to the secession of seven Southern states. The question of slavery in the ter- ritories left the nation in a state of almost hopeless confusion. The Dred Scott decision, sup- ported in the South, was flatly opposed by the Republicans, dominant in the North. But what about the principle of popular sovereignty? Did the Dred Scott decision forbid the people of a territory to decide whether or not they wanted slavery? This became the most important question in the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858. Lincoln-Douglas Debates Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lin- coln were rival candidates in the election for senator from Illinois. Douglas — a short, thickset man nicknamed \"Little Giant,\" both for his size and his political influence — had served in the Senate for 12 years and had gained a national reputa- tion for his commitment to the principle of popular sovereignry. The most promi- nent Democrat in Congress, he hoped to be elected President in 1860. His challenger was Abraham Lincoln — a man whose tall, angular frame inspired ridicule and who often hid valuable papers in his stovepipe hat. Lincoln had served only a single undistinguished term in the House of Representatives. He defended the Compromise of 1850 — even to the point of enforcing the Fugitive Slave Law. But although Lincoln was not an abolitionist, he did believe that if slav- ery were confined to its existing area, Southerners themselves might eventually abolish it. As a former Whig who had only recently joined the Republican party, Lincoln enjoyed a local reputation as a clever lawyer and keen debater. During the campaign Lincoln and Dou- glas traveled to seven Illinois towns to debate the critical issues of the day. Dou- glas attempted to show that Republicans in general — and Lincoln in particular — were abolitionists in disguise, bent on destroying the Union. During their debate at Freeport, Illinois, Lincoln put Douglas in a difircult position by asking the question, \"Can the people of a territory in any lawful way... exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a State Constitu- tion?\" Douglas was trapped. If he answered \"Yes,\" he would appear to support popular sovereignty, thereby opposing the Dred Scott decision. A \"yes\" answer would improve his chances for reelection as sena- tor, but at the expense of Southern support 436 Unit 5 Division and Reunion: 1825-1877"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"Examining Photographs John Brown failed in liis attempt to start a stave uprising in Virginia.

A \"no\" answer, on the other hand, would make it seem as if he had abandoned the notion of popular sovereignty — the principle on which he had based his pohtical career. This answer would be welcomed by the South but could cost him the senatorial election. To solve this dilemma, Douglas formulat- ed the so-called Freeport Doctrine. Accord- ing to this formula, Douglas said he accepted the Dred Scott decision that for- bade Congress to bar slavery from the terri- tories. However, he pointed out, a territorial legislature might effectively discourage slav- ery if it failed to pass laws to keep slaves under control. Said Douglas, \"Slavery can- not exist a day, or an hour, anywhere, unless it is supported by local police regulations.\" By admitting that a territorial legislature could practically nullify the Dred Scott deci- sion, Douglas won a narrow victory in Illi- nois' senatorial election — at the price ot losing Southern support lor the presidency in 1860. Lincoln lost the election but gained a national reputation. John Brown's Raid John Brown, a fiery abolitionist, regard- ed himself as a heaven-sent agent whose mission was lo liberate slaves and punish slaveholders. Brown Ii.kI previously pan it i pated in the armed struggle against prosl.u - ery forces in Kansas, later traveling basi lo continue his work.

Which slave states remained In the Union? The New England poet Ralph Wiildo Emerson said that Brown had \"made the gallows glorious like the cross.\" Southerners regarded Brown's punishment as just. 1 hey feared nothing so much as a slave revolt. Even before Browns raid at Harpers Ferry, Southern fears had already reached crisis proportions with the 1857 publica- tion ot The Impending Crisis of the South, by Hinton R. Helper, himself a Southerner. Helper attacked slavery because it enriched a few \"slaveocrats\" at the price ot dooming non-slaveholding whites to \"galling poverty and ignorance.\" Many Southern states banned the book from the mails. The Republican parry was stirred to distribute 100,000 copies as a campaign document. The Election of 1 860 As the election of 1860 approached, Democrats split over the issue of slavery in the territories.

Meanwhile, government leaders made last-minute attempts at compromise. The most promising was a proposal by Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky. The key- stone of the Crittenden Compromise was the reestablishment of the 36° 30' line, dividing the territories into slave and non- slave regions. Lincoln, however, refused to agree to this proposal. When Lincoln reached Washington, D.C., in late February 1861, only eight slave states still remained in the Union. Many supporters feared for his life. Although the North generally agreed with Buchanan's view that states did not have the right to leave the Union, no one wished to fight to force them back in. General Winfield Scott expressed wide- spread public sentiment when he said, \"Wayward sisters, depart in peace.\" Lincoln disagreed. In his first inaugural address, he said that \"no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out ol the Union.\" He argued that secession was a blow to the basic democratic principle that the will of the majority should prevail. Yet, like Buchanan before him, Lincoln suggested no active measures to force the Confederate states back into the Union. He proposed only to hold military posts not yet taken by the Confederates, to enforce federal laws where federal agents were not \"obnoxious\" to the local popula- tion, and to deliver the mail \"unless repelled.\" Although Lincoln still refused to make any concession regarding slavery in the territories, his address did not explicit- ly object to a constitutional amendment forbidding federal iiuertercnce with slavery in the Soiuhern states.

The Compromise of 1850 created a temporary lull in the conflict between proslavery and antislavery forces. California entered the union as a free state, and southerners got a tough, new fugitive slave law. Meanwhile, new territories were organized with no restriction on slavery. A remarkable period of economic growth fueled by new inventions and technological innovations spurred on both the industrial North and the agricultural South. Large numbers of immigrants flooded into the United States to meet the labor needs of the booming industrial economy. The slavery issue, however, would not go away. The Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott decision, ruled that slaves could be taken into the territories and that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional. When the Kansas-Nebraska Act was passed, opening this area to slavery, near civil war ensued as slavery and antislav- ery groups fought tor control of the Kansas territorial government. When abolitionist John Brown attacked the arsenal at Harpers Ferry as the first step in a slave revolt, southerners were convinced that compromise with abolitionists was not possible. Increasingly, the South found itself isolated politi- cally from the rest ot the nation. The election of Abra- ham Lincoln in 1860, perceived as an abolitionist victory by southerners, triggered the secession of seven southern states. * Using Vocabulary Each of the following terms can be considered a \"cause\" and an \"effect.\" Define the terms below by writing two sentences for each.

Next, create a subcategory that enumerates all the items that created conllict and tension between the North and South.

Pre- sent your trial to the class and poll them to determine John Brown's innocence or guilt. * Mastering Skills Making Inferences Each day you give anci receive information both ver- bally and in writing. Sometimes this information is stated directly, but at other times it is hinted at, or implied. When this happens, a person has to make an inference, or a deduction based on lacts or circum- stances. Inferences are made by \"reading between the lines. \" You make an inlereiue when vou use facts to draw a conclusion that is not stated directly. Good inferences are based on sound reasoning and careful analysis of information. Making inferences helps you understand something more completely. Example The following steps will help you make inferences on information presented below on south- ern slaveholders. • Read or listen carefully. Be sure you understand all the facts presented: Slaveholders, called planters, were actually a very small percentage of the southern population. To be con- sidered a planter, a person had to hold at least 20 slaves. Only about 4 percent of slaveholders had this many slaves. An extremely small percentage of slave- holders had more than 100 slaves. Jefferson Davis, who became the fiiture president of the Confederacy, held as many as 3,000 slaves. The majority of slaveholders, however, were farmers who kept about 5 slaves. About three-fourths of the southerners had no slaves at all. These southerners oivned small farms on which they grew their own food and perhaps a cash crop such as tobacco or cotton. About 10 percent of this non- slaveholding southern population were poor whites. They supported themselves by hunting and fishing. • Summarize the information: The majority of the people in the South did not own slaves. Those wlw did had very few. Only a few planters had large numbers oj slaves. • Decide what inferences or conclusions can be made based on what was read or heard but was not stated directly. Read the following inference based on the above summary. The economic benefits of slavery directly affected only a few southerners. Practice Use the three steps outlined above and what you have learned in this chapter to determine which of the following three inferences seems reasonable. 1. Before the (jvil War, the prosperity of the South depended on slave labor. 2. The absence of slavery in the North meant that northerners were not prejudiced .rgainst African Americans. 3. The southern economy grew because of advances in farming equipment such as Deeres steel plow and McC'ormick's grain har\\'ester.

With the attack on Fort Sumter, war became the solution to the long-standing differences between North and South. Each leader was determined to do what was necessary to win a quick victory. Neither could pre- dict the terrible cost of the long war that was to come. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Compare the strengths and weaknesses of the North and South. • Explain the strategies of the North and South. • Discuss the role of wartime diplomacy. As the Southern states seceded, they seized United States arse- nals, mints, fortresses, and other public property within their borders. Fort Sumter, on a rocky island in the harbor ot Charleston, South Carolina, was one of only two Southern forts still under federal control. By April 1861, the fort was running short ol provisions because a supply ship sent by President Buchanan in January had been turned back by artillery fire from shore. Lincoln decided to resupply Fort Sumter, and he told South Carolina authorities of his decision. Lincoln's decision placed Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, in a difficult position. How long could the Confederates tolerate the fort of a \"for- eign\" nation in the harbor of their major Atlantic port? If Davis allowed the fort to be resupplied, he would appear to be giv- ing in to Lincoln. If he ordered that Fort Sumter or the relief ships be fired on, he risked war. Davis chose to take the fort before the ships arrived. On April 12, 1861, shore batteries of the South Caroli- na militia opened fire on Fort Sumter. From inside the fort, Captain Abner Dou- bleday described the attack: Showers of balls. . . and shells. . .poured into the fort in one incessant stream, causing great flakes of masonry to fall in all directions. When the immense mortar shells, after sailing high in the air, came down in a vertical direction, and buried themselves in the parade ground, their explosion shook the fort like an earthquake. After 34 hours of bombardment, but no loss of life. Fort Sumter surrendered. Preparing to Fight News of the attack on Fort Sumter stirred nationalism in the North. When Lincoln requested 75,000 volunteers for 90 days to suppress the rebellion, more responded than could be equipped or trained. \"I never knew what popular excitement could be,\" wrote a Bostonian to a friend in England. \"The whole popu- lation, men, women, and children, seem to be in the streets with Union flags Nobody holds back.\" A similar wave of nationalism swept the South, as Jefferson Davis called for 100,000 volunteers.

Nationalism worked for the Union, while the strongest argument for secession was slavery. He considered Delaware to be safe for the Union. But to remind the others that the war was to preserve the nation, and not to end slavery, the President declared: The central Idea pervading this struggle is the necessity of proving that popular government is not an absurdity. We must settle this question now, whether, in a free government, the minority have the right to break up the government whenever they choose. Faced with the prospect of fighting their neighbors, however, (\"our more states — Vir- ginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, Ten- nessee — abandoned the Union. Virginia's secession put Washington, D.C., in danger. To its west was Virginia. To the east was Maryland, where many people owned slaves and supported the Confederacy. If Maryland seceded, the Union capital would be in enemy territory. Lincoln deter- mined to hold Maryland at all costs. Only a week after Fort Sumter, as Union troops passed through Baltimore on their way to Washington, D.C., they were attacked by a mob aroused by pro-Confed- erate newspapers. The President responded by placing Baltimore under martial law, a form of military rule that includes suspend- ing Bill of Rights guarantees. Persons who advocated secession or otherwise openly supported the Confederacy were arrested and held without trials. Although tensions in Maryland remained high throughout the war, Lincoln's action kept this strategically important state in the Union. \"I hope to have God on my side, \" Lin- coln said, \"but I must have Kentucky.\" The President's native state and Missouri were important because they controlled the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. Although Kentucky had a pro-Union government, Lincoln eventually put the state under martial law to stabilize it. In Missouri, where slaveholders controlled the state, he supported rebellion against the pro-Con- federate elected state government.

Nearly three million soldiers wore the uniforms of the Union or the Confederacy. Countless other men and women supported these troops — on the farm, in the factory, on the battlefield, and behind the lines. The South had the better army, especial- ly during the early years of the war. Because of a strong military tradition in the South, many Confederate officers had attended the United States Military Acade- my at West Point in New York. Most of the top officers in the United States Army resigned their commissions to fight for the Confederacy, among them Robert E. Lee. After his native Virginia seceded, Lee decided that he could not \"raise my hand against my relatives, my children, my home.\" He rejected Lincoln's offer to lead the Union armies and took command of Confederate forces in Virginia. The Union's military strategy was sim- ple: blockade Confederate ports and ruin the Souths economy; invade the South and split it into thirds at the Mississippi River and through Tennessee and Geor- gia; and capture the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. Southern strategy was even simpler. Southerners would be fighting for their independence on famil- iar terrain. To win, the South did not have to do anything except hold out against enemy attacks. The South, formerly a region within a nation, was now itself a nation to fight and die for. Southerners felt they were fighting to preserve the cotton economy and the plantation culture. Because Europe was the major market for their cotton, they counted on European nations to provide war materials and other supplies. The South would need Europe's help because the North was superior in nearly every type of resource.

The Confederacy had less than one-half as many people as the North and more than one-third of these were slaves. The Confederacy was open to attack all along its border with the Union and along its extensive coastline. In short, the South was ill-equipped to wage war, even in its own defense. The Confederacy also suffered from the very political theories that had created it. The Confederate constitution limited the authority of the central government and emphasized states' rights, a framework ol goveiument that was contrary to what was needed in wartime. As the war progressed, some state governments resisted the Con- federacy's efforts to raise troops. Not until 1863 was the central government able to levy taxes to finance the war. It was forced to borrow and to issue worthless paper money to pay its bills. State governments also printed paper money and added to the economic chaos, which encouraged hoarding and damaged morale. Wartime Diplomacy The principal task of Union diplomacy daring the Civil War was to prevent European iiaiions (loni supporting the Confederacy. Europe's ruling classes con- tinued to be concerned about maintain- ing their power and status at home, and they were not upset by the disintegration of the world's largest democracy. The British and French governments, in par- ticular, were openly sympathetic to the Confederacy. The South expected Britain's aid because British textile mills used Southern cotton. In Britain, manufacturers believed that an independent South would be a better market for their products. Lacking industry, the Confederacy would be unlikely to impose protective tariffs. Lin- coln reminded the British that they need- ed Union wheat as much as Confederate cotton. But to prevent Great Britain and the South from developing closer com- mercial ties, the President also struck his first blow against the South. Six days after Fort Sumter fell, Lincoln announced a blockade of Southern ports. At the time the action seemed foolish and impossible to enforce. To patrol a Confede- rate coastline 3,500 miles long, the United States Navy had just 42 wooden ships and fewer than 9,000 sailors, so at first the blockade was selective. But as the Union navy grew to 626 ships and about S9, ()()() Linking Across Time Southern Cotton Cotton remains a vital part of the Southern econo- my.

In May 1861, Britain declared that a state of war existed between the North and South and announced its neutrality in that war. Because the British stopped short ol rec- ognizing Southern independence. Con- federate leaders continued to pursue that goal. In November 1861, Confederate diplomacy brought the North to the brink of war with Great Britain. A Unit- ed States warship stopped the British steamer Trent in the Caribbean and removed two Confederates bound for negotiations in Britain and France. When Britain angrily demanded the release of the two diplomats and an apol- ogy for violating its neutrality, some Americans called for war. The British responded by sending 8,000 troops to Canada. Forced to choose between inter- national humiliation if he gave in, or war with England if he refused, Lincoln released the diplomats. \"One war at a time,\" he told his critics. British relations with the Confederacy remained close after the Trent affair, and tensions with the Union high. Southern diplomats arranged for British shipyards to build and outfit Confederate warships to prey on Northern shipping. But these vessels could not break the Union block- ade, nor could Britain's need for cotton. Increased cotton production by Britain's colonies in Egypt and India replaced the loss of Southern cotton and eliminated the Confederacy's best hope for European intervention in the Civil War.

Lee Battle of Fredericksburg, 1862 Section Focus The fighting began with two armies of immigrants, farm boys, schoolteachers, and store clerks. At first there was a curi- ous, almost eager anticipation of battle. But as blood began to spill and young men on both sides fell wounded and dying, both North and South began to confront the grim reality of a long and bitter war. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify the major battles of the war. • Explain the significance of the battles of Antietam, Gettysburg, and Vicks- burg. There were two major areas of land warfare. The eastern the- ater, east ot the Appalachians, centered on the region sur- rounding the two capitals, Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia. Because the two cities were less than 100 miles apart, many battles occurred in this area. The western theater centered around the Mississippi River and its tributaries. In many ways, the West was critical to victo- ry. If Union armies gained control of the Mississippi River, tiie Confederacy woukl lose its western food supplies. The War in Virginia On July 21, 1861, with Lincoln's 90- day volunteers nearing the end of their enlistments, the Union army invaded Vir- ginia to capture Richmond. About 30 miles from Washington, D.C., 30,000 Northern troops met a smaller Confeder- ate force near a stream called Bull Run. Expecting victory and a quick end to the war, members of Congress and Washing- ton civilians came along to picnic and watch the battle. What they saw was a confusing clash of two untrained armies. Union troops fought well at first, but the Confederates proved better organized. Using the railroad and telegraph. Confed- erate officers were able to quickly supply reinforcements. The Union army's retreat was reported for the London Times by a correspondent on the scene: 1 perceived several wagons coming from the direction of the battlefield;. ..a thick cloud of dust rose behind them, and running by the side of the wagons were a number of men in uniform every moment the crowd increased, drivers and men cried out with the most vehement gestures, \"Turn back!

Indeed, Yankee predictions of a quick war could have come true. \"Give me 10,000 fresh troops, and I will be in Wishington tomorrow,\" Confederate gen- eral Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson said after Bull Run. But Jefferson Davis insist- ed on a defensive war, and the Union was saved. After the disaster at Bull Run, Lincoln replaced General Irvin McDowell with General George McClellan who trained and reorganized the Union army.

Lee's victory over bungling Union generals at the Second Battle of Bull Run in August 1862, encouraged him to invade the Union. His plan was to surprise Washington, D.C., hom the north and destroy North- ern morale. In September 1862, his 45,000 troops slipped into Maryland and disappeared into the mountains, where he split his army and sent \"Stonewall\" Jackson to seize the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry. McClellan, who was to protect Washington by keeping between Lee and the capital, frantically chased after his enemy. At this point, incredible good luck befell McClellan. On a Maryland road a Union patrol found three cigars wrapped in a copy of Lee's plans. McClellan realized that the Confederate forces were divided and that he could destroy Lee's army. On September 17, 1862, McClellan attacked Lee at An- tietam (An TEE tuhm) Creek near Sharpsburg, Maryland. In the bloodiest single day of the war, McClellan forced Lee to retreat back into Virginia. The Confederates suffered more than 11,000 casualties. But McClellan lost even more, and his army was too damaged to pursue Lee and finish him.

The order was an Emancipation Proclama- tion, which he issued on September 22, 1862, to free the slaves of the Confederacy (see Appendix). Lincoln's order, which made this conflict a war against slavery, had its greatest impact, however, in the North and in Europe. It had little effect in the South, which first had to be defeated. Encouraged by nearly destroying Hookers army of 130,000 at Chancellorsville, Lee crossed the Potomac again in June 1863, and moved into southern Pennsylvania. He was shadowed, however, by a Union army under General George G. Meade. An acci- dental clash between small units at Gettys- burg developed into a bloody battle that marked the turning point of the war. As both armies gathered to do battle. Union troops took up positions on the crest of a low ridge. It became the Conled- erates' task to dislodge them from this high ground.

In this Gettysburg address, the Pres- ident promised that \"these dead shall not have died in vain\" (see Appendix). War in the West In 1 861 the war in the west was a strug- gle for control of the border states. In Missouri the pro-Union state government that Lincoln supported waged its own civil war against Confederate sympathiz- ers. Thousands were killed in fighting in Missouri before the first shots were fired at Bull Run in the east. The western counties of Virginia, where pro-Union sentiment ran strong, were detached from the state after it seceded, and in 1863 they were admitted to the Union as the new state of West Virginia. Despite Kentucky's strong pro-(-onfederatc lean- ings, the LJnioii army held the state throughout the war.

The LJnion advance began when General Ulysses S. Grant attacked two Confederate forts on the Kentucky-Tennessee border. First taking Fort Henry, on the Tennessee River, Grant surrounded Fort Donelson, on the Cumberland River, in February 1862. When the Confederate commander at Fort Donelson tried to negotiate, Grant's reply created his reputation as a tough, no-nonsense soldier: \"No terms except unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted.\" The fall of Fort Donelson, with about 13,000 Confederate prisoners, opened the way for a Union advance south toward a railroad center at Corinth, Mississippi. From there Grant planned to move west along the railroad to capture Memphis, Tennessee, on the Mississippi River. The Union advance was slowed in April 1862 by the bloody, two-day battle of Shiloh on the Tennessee-Mississippi bor- der.

As the maneuver began, the moon rose and the forts opened fire, hitting the first ship 42 times. After a 90- minute battle, 20 of 24 ships made it past, and New Orleans surrendered without fir- ing a shot. By the end of 1862, Union armies occupied all of western Tennessee and were probing south into Mississippi. Other armies were advancing north from New Orleans.

Heavily fortified, Vicksburg was perched on a high bluff on the east side of a sharp bend in the Mississippi. North of Vicksburg lay the Yazoo Delta, a vast area of flat, swampy land half under water. Grant descended the river from Memphis where he vainly sought to approach the city through the delta. Grant then boldly crossed the Mississippi to the west bank, slipped south, and recrossed below Vicks- burg. Contrary to established military strateg)', and against the unanimous advice of his staff, he cut his supply lines, allowing his troops only what lood they could carry or get along the way.

Rosecrans retreated to Chattanooga, where the Confederates laid siege to his army and cut off its supplies. He was saved when Grant arrived in October and drove Confederate forces from the heights around the city, opening the way for a Union advance into Georgia. By the end of 1863, only four states — Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia — remained to be subdued. In early 1864, Lincoln gave General William T. Sherman command in the west and summoned Grant to accomplish what none of his other generals could do — to crush Robert E. Lee. ; Section Two Review »« Summary The first major battle of the war at Bull Run — a Union disaster — sent a message that this would not be a short or bloodless conflict. In the east, early Confederate victories gave way to Union victories at Antietam and Gettysburg. In the west, the Union's strategy was to gain control of the Mississippi River. Grant's capture of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson began the Union advance, which concluded with Grant's daring victory at Vicksburg.

This was due to the invention of a device about the size of the tip of an index finger: the conoidal, or cone-like, bullet for rifled muskets, h is likely that no other technological advance in weaponry has had such an impor- tant, or immediate, effect on the batdefield. The flintlock muskets common- ly used by armies before the lS50s were notoriously inaccurate. Smoothbored muzzleloaders, they allowed part of the force of the blast to escape around the round bullet, and it waffled through the air like a knuckleball. Attackers were relatively safe from enemy fire until within about 100 yards. Defenders would hold their fire until they could \"see the whites of their eyes,\" that is, about 50 yards distance. Since it took 12 motions and at least 15 seconds to reload, the soldier often relied on the bay- onet once the initial volley was fired. The conoidal bullet tremendous- ly increased the accuracy and range of rifles, becoming deadly at up to 300 yards. In the Civil War, the common soldier's rifled musket in- flicted 85 to 90 percent of casualties. Battle became increasingly impersonal as men killed and were killed by unseen opponents. The power, accuracy, and rate of rifle fire increased by the time of World War I, but a new invention of the 1880s — the field telephone — brought artillery back to the fore of battle.

But people were the most important resource. The war provided opportunities for blacks and women to make additional contribu- tions to their nations vital interests. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss behind-the-lines activity in the North and South. • Explain the wartime roles played by women, blacks, and native Americans. The Civil War was the largest war ever fought on the North Amer- ican continent. Of the 1.5 mil- lion Southern white males of fighting age, about 900,000 served in the Confederate armies. Of 4 million such males in the North, about half fought in the war. In addition, more than 200,000 blacks fought and served in the Union mil- itary, and thousands of slaves performed manual labor tor Contederate armies. More Americans were killed in this war than in any other conflict in the history of the United States. Even in the early battles the losses were shockingly high. As the war dragged on, the Union suffered terri- ble casualties but grew stronger. Confed- erate losses, however, gradually weakened the South's will to fight. Wartime Government Power Opposition to the war existed from the very beginning in both North and South. To carry on the war. President Lincoln and President Davis each exerted so much power that both were accused of acting like dictators. The Confederate govern- ment seized mules, wagons, food, and slaves for its armies. The Union govern- ment took over and operated private tele- graph lines and railroads near war zones. Both Presidents suppressed opposition to the war by abusing the civil rights of citi- zens. Davis declared martial law in parts of the Confederacy, and he suspended the right of habeas corpus, which requires that persons who are arrested be brought to court to show why they should be held. The North was a hotbed of discontent about the war. Abolitionists were irate over Lincoln's accommodating attitude toward slavery and about his reRisal to make the end of slavery a goal of the war. They were joined by members ol Lincoln's own party in Congress, a faction called the Radical Republicans, who opposed Lincoln's view that the war was only to preserve the Union. At the other extreme were the \"Copper- heads, \" mainly Democrats, who called for ending the war at any price, even if that meant welcoming the South and slavery back into the Union, or letting the slave states leave in peace. Some Copperheads encouraged Northerners to resist the war and others openly supported the South. Many ol the measures Lincoln used to quiet opposition to the war violated con- stitutional guarantees of free speech, press, and assembly. He prevented a state legislature from meeting. He denied some opposition newspapers tise of the mails and used the army to shut others down. 460 Unit 5 Division and Reunion: 1825-1877"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"And he ordered hundreds of suspected Confederate sympathizers jailed without the right of habeas corpus. President Lincoln agonized over his decisions to deny American citizens their civil rights. But he also believed that the survival ol the nation during an emergen- cy overrode the Constitution. Near the end of the war, he wrote to a friend that: I felt that measures, otherwise unconstitutional, might become lawful by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the Constitution through the preservation of the nation. In May 1863, Clement Vallandigham, a former Ohio congressman, made a speech in which he blamed the President tor pro- longing the war. He was arrested and sen- tenced to prison for the remainder of the war by a military court in Cincinnati. Val- landigham appealed to the Supreme Court for his release. But in 1864, in Ex parte Val- landigham, the Court refused to challenge the President and ruled that its authority did not extend to military courts. Not until the war was over and Lincoln dead, did the Supreme Court confront the civil rights violations that had occurred. In 1866, in Ex parte Milligan, the Court over- turned the conviction of a Copperhead tried for treason by a military court in Indiana. The Court noted that Milligan had been living in a peaceful area where the civil courts were operating, and it rejected the argument that war justified the denial of rights guaranteed by the C^onstitution: ...it is the birthright of every American citizen when charged with crime to be tried and punished according to law By the protection of law human rights are secured; withdraw that protection, and they are at the mercy of wicked rulers, or the clamor of an excited people. Although Milligans alleged crime had been much more serious than Val- landigham's, the Court ordered Milligan released. The Emancipation Proclamation When the Civil War began there was not universal support in the North for a war to free the slaves. In many areas of the North there was open hostility to black Americans, and laws that limited their rights. Slavery still existed in Washington, D.C., and in five states that remained in the Union. Lincoln, himself was not an abolition- ist. He regarded slavery as a moral wrong and a disaster for both blacks and whites, but he recognized the constitutional guar- antees for slavery. He assured the South that he had \"no purpose, directly or indi- rectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery where it now exists\" but that he only opposed its extension into the terri- tories. Again and again Lincoln declared that his goal was \"to save the Union... not either to save or destroy slavery.\" If he acted any other way, he feared that the border states might join the Confederacy. As time passed, however, Lincoln came under increasing pressure to turn the war into a crusade against slavery. The aboli- tionists and the Radical Republicans demanded that Southern slaveholders be punished for the war by loss of their prop- erty. As the number of battlefield casual- ties grew. Northerners increasingly began to feel that such bloodshed was justified only il it destroyed an institution that vio- lated human principles of freedom and dignity. In addition. Great Britain talked ol mediating a settlement of the war on behalf of the South. Lincoln realized that public opinion in Europe — and in Britain especially — was strongly opposed to slav- ery, and that no Huropean government would defend the South in a war to abol- ish slavery. After Lee's defeat at Antietam in 1862, Lincoln .mnounced that he would tree the slaves in the Confederate states on Jan- uary 1 , 1 863.

Neither the Confederacy nor the Union enlisted men as cooks, and no training was available to those who received this assignment. In the Union army recruits could supplement their rations with supplies from a merchant who was licensed to accom- pany the army — if they had money. Prices, however, were generally high and the quality of items such as pies and canned meat was ques- tionable. Proclamation did not immediately free any slaves, because it applied only to the ateas held by the enemy. The Proclama- tion, however, turned the war into a moral crusade and aroused a renewed spirit in the North. The number of black volunteers for the army increased dramati- cally. As news of the Proclamation spread through the Confederacy, whenever Northern armies occupied Southern terri- tory, thousands of runaway slaves poured into Union lines. The Emancipation Proclamation is \"the greatest event of our nation's history, if not the greatest event of the century,\" said black abolitionist editor Frederick Douglass. Slavery in areas where the Emancipa- tion Proclamation did not apply remained When in quar- ters, a compa- ny would receive a gov- ernment issue of flour, pork, beans, pota- toes, coffee and the like. Initial- ly, six or eight recruits would form a mess team and take turns cooking. If any of them actually knew something about preparing meals, the group was fortunate. Later, the commanding offi- cer assigned men to the cook tent, as often as not to get them out of the ranks. On the march, rations typically consisted of dried salt pork, hardtack (a saltless hard biscuit made from flour), and coffee. South- ern soldiers usually went without coffee, and cornmeal was substituted for hardtack. Vet- eran soldiers found fresh hardtack palatable enough. With age, however, it might become infested with weevils. Some thought it better to eat it in the dark. Soldiers of both armies frequently supplemented meager rations by stealing crops and livestock from nearby farms. a problem, however. There were 800,000 slaves in the border states and many more in areas of the South that the Union armies already had conquered. For these areas Lincoln recommended a policy of compensated emancipation — setting the slaves free, but paying their owners for them. Congress, however, adopted this idea only for the District of Columbia, whete there were just 3,000 slaves. Else- where, slavery was abolished by the Thir- teenth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1865. Raising the Armies At first, both North and South relied on volunteers to fill the tanks ot their armies, and Lincoln's original 90-day volunteers were replaced by 3-year enlistments. But lengthening lists of casualties, published in newspapers, reduced enthusiasm for the war in both North and South, and enlistments decreased. As the South's economy collapsed, and the scatcity of clothing and medicine was matched by shortages of food and shelter. Confederate desertions increased. \"I am so tited for I never get any rest night or day, and I don't think I will last much longer,\" wrote a Georgia woman in despair. When Confederate soldiers received such letters, many saw no dis- grace in going home to aid their suffering families. In all, 100,000 Confederate sol- diets deserted, while Union desertions wete 3 times that number Both North and South were forced to resort to conscription, or the drafting of men for military service. The South, with less than one-half the population of the Notch, began dtafting men aged 18 to 35 in Aptil 1862. Later, as the need to main- tain its armies increased, the Confederate congress raised the upper age limit to 50. In March 1863, the United States Congtess created a militarv' draft in the North. The draft laws were incomplete and dis- criminatory. In both Notth and South a draftee could avoid military service by hir- ing a substitute, and a Union draftee could buy his way out by paying the gov- etnment $300.

Why did the South not enlist blacks in the Confederate army? public criticism ever)'where that it was \"a rich man's war and a poor man's fight. \" In the South, some state governors helped their citizens evade the draft. In the North, opposition to conscription caused terrible draft riots in New York City in July 1863.

This led to the practice of \"bounty jumping,\" whereby a man would enlist, collect his bounty and then desert, only to reenlist somewhere else. President Lincoln at first resisted appeals to enlist blacks in the Union armies because he feared that such a poli- cy would be resented in the border states. But after the Emancipation Proclamation the policy was changed. Nearly 200,000 free blacks and fugitive slaves enlisted for military service and an additional 1 50,000 served in the quartermaster and engineering corps. Black soldiers were commanded by white officers, were paid less, and were segregated from white troops, who ohen resented them.

In what other ways did women aid the war effort? service, despite its desperate need for sol- diers. Confederate armies often used slaves to dig fortifications, cook, drive wagons, and perform other labor, but there was widespread opposition to arm- ing slaves for combat. Not until March 1865, on the advice of General Lee, did the Confederate congress agree to black soldiers. But by then the war was in its final days, and the new troops could not affect its outcome. The Civil War also dramatically affected the lives of native Americans. The South acted quickly to win the Indians to their side, sending commissioners to the Indian Territory to sign peace treaties with the Indian nations. The Cherokees even fought on the Confederate side. In 1864 the Union sent troops to restore its authorit)' over the Indians. Federal vic- tories over Confederate and Indian forces in Arkansas and in the Indian Territory showed the Indians the weakness of their Confederate allies. The North then rene- gotiated treaties with the Indian nations and took land away from those who had fought for the Confederacy. Women Behind the Lines The demands the war placed on civilian populations created new roles for women in both the North and South.- Southern women were required to run plantations after planters and overseers were called for military service.

Southern households became miniature factories, with spinning wheels and looms turning out clothing for the Confederacy. The war forced many Southerners to abandon their romantic view of women as \"belles\" to be protected from rough work. Many women were needed to replace men as government clerks and factory workers — including dangerous work in munitions factories, making weapons and ammunition for the troops. Some women accompanied the armies in the field, cooking, sewing, and washing. A few went into combat dis- guised as men, and some acted as spies behind Union lines. Although shortages of food and other necessities made life very difficult in the Confederacy, South- ern women managed to keep the home front going under the most desperate con- ditions during the war. Although most Northern women, did not suffer from invading armies and destruction of their homes and property, they also were deeply affected by the war. In the North, the mechanical reaper and the sulky plow — where the operator rode on top of the plow itself rather than pushed it from behind — allowed women to take the place ot husbands and sons who were in the army. Industry's need tor labor opened other opportunities lor women in Northern factories. Many women whose fathers and husbands had been drafted needed such work to support their families. On both sides, women took over much of the nursing, a task formerly reserved for men. As nurses, women were exposed to the worst horrors of the war. Dorothea Dix became superintendent ot female nurses in the Union army and in this position fought corruption and prejudice against her sex. Even more effective in widening the role of women in hospitals was Clara Barton, who later became the first president of the American Red Cross. Women aLso played a large part in America's first great private relief organiza- tion — the United States Sanitary Com- mission. This organization collected millions ol dollars lor projects to improve ihe living conditions of Union soldiers. It is little wonder that after the Civil War there was a renewed demand that women receive the right to vote. Supplying the Armies In a long war fought on a vast scale, vic- tors are decided as much behind the lines as on the battlefield. The Confederacy was defeated largely because of its inabili- ty to produce industrial goods. Through war contracts, the Confederate govern- ment helped to stimulate industry in the South.

The efforts of the Union government to supply its armies were hindered by over- charging and corruption. Army contrac- tors sometimes supplied shoddy clothing, rotten meat, and defective shoes. But the productivity of Northern factories was so great that, in spite of the grah. Union armies were generally much better equipped than their enemy. The Confederacy also was less able to finance the war than was the North. The South had intended to obtain money by selling cotton in Europe, but the Union blockade prevented this. To raise money, the Confederacy enacted a graduated income tax and demanded 10 percent of all crops produced. But the most impor- tant way that the Confederacy, and its state governments, raised money was sim- ply by printing more of it. The Confeder- ate government was able to operate only by forcing its citizens to accept its worth- less currency in exchange for supplies. The North was far more successful in financing the war. About one-fourth of the $4 billion needed came from taxation, and the rest from borrowing and issuing paper money. For the first time, Congress levied an income tax of 5 percent on incomes from $600 to $5,000, and 10 percent on incomes above that. Excise taxes were placed on food, tobacco, cloth- ing, alcoholic beverages, railroad tickets, and many other items. High wartime tar- iffs, passed with little opposition because no Southerners remained in Congress, also brought in revenue. Their purpose, however, also was to encourage American manufacturers to increase production, so that the army would not be dependent on imported goods. During the war the federal government issued more than $2.5 billion worth of bonds. Like the Confederacy, the Union government also inflated its currency, but not to the point where it became worth- less. The federal government issued $400 million worth of greenbacks, paper money that was not backed by gold or sil- ver, but whose value rose and fell with the success of Union armies in the field. iiiiiiniiiiiiima Section Three Review » Summary During the war both Union and Con- federate governments extended their pow- ers.

War is Hell. — William Tecumseh Sherman Commencement address at Michigan Military Academy, 1879 Section Focus In March 1864, it became Ulysses S. Grant's turn to face the brilliant Confed- erate general, Robert E. Lee. Lincoln brought Grant east and gave him com- mand of all Union forces. At last the Pres- ident found a commander who could win the war. The President, however, would not live to see the war's end. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the changes in Union military strategy after Grant took command. • Discuss the issues in the election of 1864. G eneral Grant determined that to win the war he would utilize the Union's biggest advantages over the South — its overwhelming superiority in population and in production capacity. To end the Souths ability to fight, he would not only defeat Confederate armies, but would destroy them. To end the Souths ;/'/// to fight, he would engage in \"total war\" — war against civilians and resources as well as against armies. Grant in the East Moving south into Virginia, in May and June 1864, Grant's force of 120,000 engaged the Confederate army of 60,000 almost continuously. At the Battle of the Wilderness, Lee stopped Grant in a forest where the fighting was so heavy that the woods caught fire, trapping the wounded in the flames and burning them to death. But instead of retreating after a defeat, like previous Union commanders had done. Grant kept advancing. He attacked Lee at Spotsylvania in a bloody battle that one soldier called \"the most terrible twen- ty-four hours of our service in the war.\" In early June, Grant attacked Lee again, at Cold Harbor, where he ordered suicidal charges against fortified Confederate posi- tions. In less than a month. Union forces had suffered casualties greater in number than Lee's entire army. A Union officer protest- ed that \"our men have, in many instances, been foolishly and wantonly sacrificed.\" But Grant knew that he could replace his losses while his enemy could not, and he promised \"to fight it out along this line if it takes all summer.\" In mid-June Lee retreated to Petersburg, south of Richmond, where Grant sur- rounded the Confederates and their capi- tal and laid siege to the city. In July, Lee attempted to break the siege by instruct- ing General Jubal Early to move through Virginia's Shenandoah River valley to threaten Washington, D.C. Grant dis- patched the Union cavalry under General Philip Sheridan to drive the Confederates from the area and told him \"nothing should be left to invite the enemy to return.\" He ordered Sheridan to make the valley \"a barren waste.\" By March 1865, Sheridan had carried out his orders so well, he reported to Grant, that a crow flying across the valley would have to carry its food. Meanwhile, Grant contin- ued his siege of Richmond.

Lincoln's chances for victory largely depended on the fortunes of the Union armies in the field. In mid- 1864 the war was going badly, and Lincoln was certain that he would be defeated. But Sherman's capture ot Atlanta in September, coupled with McClellans retusal to support his parry's platform, gave Lincoln the victory.

The fall of the Confederacy toppled the planter aris- tocracy that had ruled the South since before the American Revolution. Also gone was slavery, the labor system that was the basis of Southern society. But the end of slavery did not solve the problems that the 3.5 million newly freed blacks were to face. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the changes in Southern society that occurred after the Civil War. • Discuss the changes that freedom brought to black families. When Confederate veter- ans — tired, ragged, and hungry — went home at the end of the Civil War, they returned to a ravaged land. Large areas of land had been systematically laid waste by the armies of Sherman and Sheridan. The wreckage stretched from South Carolina's Atlantic coast in the east to Tennessee in the west and trom Vir- ginia's Shenandoah Valley in the north through Georgia in the south. One Mis- sissippi woman remembered her father's homecoming after the war: He had come home to a house stripped of every article of furniture. The plantation was stripped of the means of cultivating any but a small portion of it. A few mules and one cow made up the stock He owned nothing that could be turned into money without great sacrifice but five bales of cotton. But it was not only the land that was in ruin. Economically, politically, and social- ly, the South was in total disarray. Confed- erate money was worthless, and Southern banks were ruined. Government at every level had all but disappeared. There were no courts, no judges, no sheriffs, and no police — no law or authority except when groups of people took matters into their own hands. The war left the South's trans- portation systems in complete disorder. Roads were impassable, bridges had been destroyed or washed away, and railroad track rendered unusable. For planters, the greatest economic blow was the loss of their slaves, an investment worth more than $2 billion. When the slaves were freed, the plantation system collapsed. New Ways of Life The devastation of war affected all levels of Southern society'. After his regiment surrendered at Appomattox, the planter Harry Hammond said he had \"a pipe, some tobacco, and literally nothing else.\" Although Hammond owned a large plan- tation, he could fmd no one who could afford to buy his land when he put it up for sale. Hammond was saved from total ruin when most of the 300 blacks on the plantation agreed to stav and work the land. In return for their labor, Hammond provided his former slaves with housing, firewood, weekly food allotments, every other Saturday off and $ 1 5 a year in cash after the crops were harvested. Hammond also agreed to provide the loan of a mule 476 Unit 5 Division and Reunion: 1825-1877"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"Examining Photographs Devastation In the South was widespread after the Civil War.

In what ways were the communications systems of the South in disarray? and a plow so that the workers could grow their own crops. Not every planter was so fortunate. Southerners who had invested heavily in Confederate currency and bonds were wiped out financially when they became worthless after the war. Many lost their land because of taxes or other debts they could not pay. Some sold their acres to anyone who could pay the outrageously low prices for which Southern farms and plantations were advertised in Northern newspapers. On other plantations and on small farms throughout the South, war widows struggled to hold onto their prop- erty and keep it producing. Poor blacks and whites realized that social and economic status in the South was tied to the land, but few had money to buy land, even at such low prices. So some became tenant farmers, that is, they larmed land that they rented. But even this was beyond the means of many poor Southerners and, more often, they became sharecroppers, persons who worked the owner's land — sometimes using the owner's tools, animals, and seed — and received a share ol the crops in return. Although these arrangements seemed a solution that would provide a living tor both workers and landowners, the system contained serious defects. For example, debt-ridden landowners wanted to get the highest possible return, so they pressured tenants to grow only cotton or tobacco, cash crops that paid the best. To prevent depletion of the soil, however, tenants could have planted a variety of crops, including food crops. lenants, black and white alike, usually had to buy seed, fertilizer, work animals, and food on credit, at interest rates as high as 40 percent. So, no matter how hard they worked, many tenants tell deeply into debt and remained trapped on the land until they paid those debts — no freer to leave than the slaves had been. As late as 1907, a federal investigator estimated that one-third of the farms in the Cotton Belt depended on the labor of tenants tied to the land by their debts.

He gave us freedom without giving us any chance to live to ourselves and we still had to depend on the southern white man for work, food, clothing, and he held us through our necessity and want in a state of servitude but little better than slavery. ^^ ^o^, Frederick Douglass 1817-1895 Born into slavery, Frederick Doug- lass escaped (after one failed attempt) in 1 838 and quickly emerged as a leading abolitionist. During the Civil War, he prodded President Lincoln to tree the slaves, and he helped organize black troops to fight for freedom. After Lincoln was assassinated, Douglass opposed the Reconstruction program of President Johnson, histead he backed the Radical Republican plan. He used his oratorical ability to insist on full equality for blacks in all parts of the nation, and he was a vigorous backer of the Fourteenth Amendment. But he was particularly outspoken in support of the Fifteenth Amendment, guaranteeing black men the right to vote. To Douglass, being able to vote meant that blacks would not only be hill citizens but would also have a weapon to protect their rights. Even before the end of the war, some slaveholders noticed a change in the atti- tude of their slaves as they sensed freedom close at hand. Other planters were stunned, however, when slaves they thought happy and content left without a word to try to reach the Union lines. Freedom strengthened black family ties. Families that had been separated during slavery were now reunited. Newspapers carried advertisements from blacks seek- ing information about missing relatives: $200 reward. During the year 1849, Thomas Sample carried aiuay from this city, as his slaves, our daughter Polly, and son, Geo. Washington, to the State of Mississippi, and subsequently to Texas We will give $100 each for them, to any person who assist them, or either of them, to get to Nashville, or get word to us of their whereabouts, if they are alive. Freed slaves, many of whom had only first names, now went about choosing family names. Some chose the name of an ancestor or the name of a hero, like Lin- coln. Some adopted their former slave- holder's family name, but many blacks rejected such an idea. \"That's my old rebel master's title, \" said one young man, \"and I don't see any use in being called for him.\" Former slaves who remained on the plantations as paid laborers usually refiised to live in the old slave quarters. They objected to the common areas for cooking and washing and sought the privacy of separate cabins. For others, freedom meant leaving the plantation and their former owners and starting a new life. Some set- tled on the Great Plains and farmed land of their own. Others headed for large cities and jobs they hoped to find there. The Freedmen's Bureau At the close of the war.

What options remained for families that did not want to be tied to the sharecropping system? Abandoned Lands, which became popu- larly known as the Freedmen's Bureau. Led by General O.O. Howard, the Bureau at first gave food and clothing to both black and white families in the war- ravaged South. Its primary mission, how- ever, was to help blacks adjust to their new freedom. In adtiition, the Bureau provided medical help and founded 45 hospitals in 14 states.

Many were young women who had been active in the antislavcry and women's rights move- ments, who now dedicated themselves to educating the freed slaves. The teachers frequently found their students just as dedicated to getting an education. One black teacher from Philadelphia who taught school in Georgia, noted that many of her students worked in the fields in the morning and came to class \"alter their hard toil in the hot sun, as bright and as anxious to learn as ever.\" At the end of the day, these same class- rooms were filled with adults, equally hungry lor the education deprived to them while they were slaves.

In addition, the Freedmen's Bureau tried to find jobs for former slaves. It encouraged them to sign labor contracts with planters to provide work in return for wages or a share of the crops. Because most former slaves could neither read nor write, Bureau agents tried to prevent them from being cheated in these contracts, but the Bureau never had enough agents to do this job fully. The dream of most freed slaves was to own their land. During the war Union troops had seized large amounts of land from Southern planters, and Congress decided to distribute some ot this land to former slaves. On the Sea Islands of South Carolina, the Freedmen's Bureau was per- mitted to sell or lease confiscated land in parcels of up to 40 acres. Many newly freed black families hoped that 40 acres and a mule would help them start their lives anew. However, when President Andrew Johnson decided to pardon Con- federates, he restored their property rights. If their land had been distributed to blacks, it was returned to its former owners. General Howard went to the Sea Islands to tell black farmers that their land was being returned to pardoned Confed- erates. He urged them to sign labor con- tracts to work on the land they briefly had owned. Most of the farmers refused to sign contracts, and a large number refused to give up their land. They were evicted against their will — some at bayonet point — by Union troops. Summary After the Civil War, the South had to rebuild not only its farms and roads, but its social and political structures as well. A new system of farming soon developed to accommodate the lack of money. Tenant farmers and sharecroppers worked the owners' land in exchange for rent or a share of the crops. Freedom for African Americans meant renewed family ties and a new sense of identity. The Freedmen's Bureau provided services in education and employment for newly freed slaves. In addition, many blacks moved to other regions of the country to find work and start a new life. Yet equality for blacks was still elusive and few were able to realize the dream of owning their own land. Although they were no longer slaves, many African Americans found few opportunities open to them. Checking for Understanding 1. Identify Freedmen's Bureau 2. Define tenant farming, sharecroppers 3.

President Lincoln contended that the task was to restore the nation quickly and without bitterness. Others, however, felt that the South should be punished, and they sought to shape Reconstruction accordingly. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Compare the Lincoln-Johnson plans for Reconstruction with the plans of the Radical Republicans. • Explain how the black codes and the return of former Confederates to power affected Reconstruction. R CC 1 ^ cconstruction\" involved much more than merely rebuilding md repairing the war damage inflicted on the South. It also meant restructuring Southern society by granting rights to former slaves, and restor- ing the nation by readmitting Southern states to the Union. Between 1865 and 1877, Congress and the President struggled with, and frequently clashed over, Recon- strtiction policies and programs. Presidential Reconstruction Before the war ended Lincoln began to plan for the peace that would follow the war. Because his primary goal was to restore the Union as quickly as possible, the President favored a generous policy. He offered amnesty, or pardon, to all Southerners, except for a few high-rank- ing Confederate officials, who pledged an oath of loyalty to the United States. Lin- coln proposed that when 10 percent of a state's voters in the 1 860 presidential elec- tion had taken this oath, Congress would readmit the state to the Union. Lincoln's plan did not address the plight of freed slaves. Although Lincoln strongly supported the Thirteenth Amendment to free the slaves, for a long time he person- ally had favored colonization of free blacks in Africa and the Caribbean. But he was willing to let the South handle the matter. The President urged, however, that blacks who could read and write, and those who had served in the Union army, be allowed to vote. Resistance to Lincoln's plan surfaced at once from his Radical Republican oppo- nents in Congress. The Radicals did not share the President's belief that the South- ern states could immediately be trusted with determining the status of free blacks, or that loyal state governments could result from his readmission plan. In addi- tion, they maintained that Congress, rather than the President, should deter- mine Reconstruction policies. The Radicals' alternative to Lincoln's plan came in the Wade-Davis Bill of 1864. This legislation proposed putting the South under military rule and required a majority of a state's electorate to take the loyalty oath as a condition for the state's readmission.

The amendment also prohibited the states from deny- ing any rights to their new citizens. However, in 1896, the Supreme Court ruled that states could pro- vide \"separate but equal\" services and facilities to black citizens, thus legal- izing segregation. Segregation remained legal until 1954, when the Supreme Court declared \"separate but equal\" to be unconstitutional. Representative Henry Davis of Maryland challenged him in a widely published attack that warned: The President must understand that the authority of Congress. . . must be respected. . . and if he wishes our support he must confine himself to his executive duties — to obey and execute, not make the laws — and leave political reorganization to Congress. When Arkansas, Tennessee, and Louisiana met the conditions of Lincolns plan. Congress refused to readmit them to the Union. The President then realized that he would not have a peace based on \"mal- ice toward none\" and \"charit}' for all,\" and he began to negotiate with Radical con- gressional leaders. At this critical point, Lincoln was assassinated. Andrew Johnson, who succeeded to the presidency, attempted to carry out Lin- coln's Reconstruction policies. But he was hampered in this effort because, as an unelected President, he had little popular following. In addition, as a former Demo- crat, he could not command the support of the Republican majority in Congress and as a Tennessean and former slavehold- er, he offended the Radicals. If these handicaps were not enough, he was self- righteous, hot-tempered, stubborn, and crude. In the summer of 1865, with Congress in recess, Johnson began to implement his Reconstruction program. His conditions for readmission were that each Southern state abolish slavery, repeal its ordinance of secession, and repudiate its war debts. When Congress returned in December, every state except Texas had followed Johnson's formula and asked to return to the Union. The Radicals, however, were alarmed because the leniency of Johnson's plan allowed the return of traditional leadership in each of these states, and Southern voters elected former Confeder- ate officials to power. The new governor Examining Photographs President Andrew Johnson soon found himself at odds with the Radical Republicans who wanted a stricter Reconstruction policy. Why did John- son take no action regarding the status of blacks? of South Carolina was a former Confeder- ate senator, for example, and Alexander Stephens, former Vice President of the Confederacy, was elected to the United States Senate. When Congress recon- vened, it refused to seat members from the Southern states. The Radicals were also concerned about the status of blacks in the South. Like Lincoln, President Johnson believed that this was a state matter and that federal jurisdiction stopped with the abolition of slavery. Consequently, the new Southern state governments endorsed the principle stated by the governor of Mississippi, \"Ours is and ever shall be a government of white men. \" The new Southern state legislatures passed a series of laws known as \"black codes\" that severely limited the rights of blacks and made it plain that blacks were still to have a subordinate status in the South. State governments made few pro- visions for black schools. In no Southern 482 Unit 5 Division and Reunion: 1825-1877"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"state were blacks permitted to vote, testify against whites, handle weapons, or serve on juries. In some states, all blacks were required by law to have steady work. Those who did not were arrested as vagrants, and their labor sold to the high- est bidder. Some states permitted blacks to work only as farmers and servants and denied them many of the rights enjoyed by whites. Northerners were outraged by the black codes, and even Johnson's supporters were alarmed by the actions of the Southern states. Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles warned that: The entire South seem to be stupid and vindictive, know not their friends, and are pursuing just the course which their opponents, the Radicals, desire. I fear a terrible ordeal awaits them in the fiture. These fears proved well-founded. Events in the South increasingly led moderate Northerners to support the Radicals in Congress against the President. In 1865, House and Senate leaders cre- ated a Joint Committee on Reconstruc- tion to set congressional policy for restoring the Union. Over the next lew months, the Joint Committee proposed bills providing economic aid for blacks and protection ol their civil rights. Congress passed these bills, but President Johnson vetoed each one. Finally in April 1866, Congress passed the Civil Rights Bill, which granted citizenship to blacks and gave federal government the power to intervene to protect the rights ol heed slaves. When Johnson also vetoed this bill, Congress overrode his veto. Fearing that the C^ivil Rights Act might be overturned in court, however. Congress passed the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution in June 1866. The amend- ment defined citizenship to include blacks and required that no state deny any per- son \"the equal protection of the laws. In addition, the amendment barred many Confederate political leaders from holding public office and prohibited any state from paying Confederate war debts. President Johnson attacked the Four- teenth Amendment and campaigned against its ratification. As the 1866 con- gressional elections neared, it was clear that they would reveal whether the Presi- dent or Congress would control the direc- tion of Reconstruction. In a speaking tour to muster support, Johnson made so many bitter and intem- perate remarks that he alienated more vot- ers than he gained. He called powerful Radical Republican leaders traitors who were \"opposed to the restoration of the Union of these States.\" His opponents Life Of The Times Rebel Pride Soon after General Lee's surrender, the occupy- ing Union anny issued certain ordinances that were aimed at erasing all loyalty to the Con- federacy. Many of these laws added insult to the injury of the defeated South. Ingenious Southerners, however, often found ways to cir- cumvent these rules and keep their Rebel pride intact. A \"Button Order,\" for example, prohibited the wearing of Confed- erate mili- tary buttons. Since but- tons of any type were scarce. Southerners resorted to using thorns from thornbushes as fastenings. Realizing that replacement buttons would be difficult to find, a clause permitted the \"cov- ering of formerly used buttons with cloth.\" Ingenious women draped Confederate but- tons with black cloth. Thus, in obeying the Button Order, Southerners tound a way that they could publicly display mourning for the Confederacy. Another ordinance stated that the courts of Virginia could not issue any marriage license unless both parties took the oath of allegiance to the United States.

Radical Reconstruction Republican leader Thaddeus Stevens summarized the Radicals' approach to Reconstruction in an 1866 speech in the House of Representatives: Strip a proud nobility of their bloated estates, reduce them to a level with plain republicans; send them forth to labor, and teach their children to enter the workshops or handle the ploiv, and you will thus humble proud traitors. The November election provided an overwhelming victory for the Radicals, who gained control of both House and Senate. They now had the strength to override any presidential veto and could claim that they had a mandate, or com- mand, from the public to enact their own Reconstruction program. 484 Now firmly in control, the Radical Republicans began implementing their policies for Reconstruction. One goal was to sweep away the new state governments in the South and to replace them with military rule. Other goals were to ensure that former Confederate leaders would have no role in governing the South, and that the freed slaves' right to vote was pro- tected. Radical plans were inspired by self- interest as well as by concern for the freed slave and a desire to punish the South. The Radicals expected that blacks would express their gratitude for freedom by vot- ing Republican. If the Southern states were readmitted to the Union without providing the franchise to blacks, the Democrats might regain power. Radical plans also were supported by Northern business leaders, who feared that a Congress controlled by Democrats might lower the tariff or destroy the national banking system established during the Civil War. Manv Radicals genuinely cared about the plight of the freed slaves, of course. They had been abolitionists before the Civil War and had pushed Lincoln into making emancipation a goal of the war. Thev believed in a right to equality and that government must rest on the consent of the governed. Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts summarized their position by saying: Unit 5 Division and Reunion: 1825-1877"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"[Co)igress] must see to it that the man made free by the Constitution is a freeman indeed; that he can go ivhere he pleases, work when and for whom he pleases. . .go into the schools and educate himself and his children: that the rights and guarantees of the commo7i law are his, and that he walks the earth proud and erect in the conscious dignity of a free man. In March 1867, Congress passed a Reconstruction Act that abolished the Souths new state governments and put them under military rule. Except for Ten- nessee, the former Conf-ederacy was divided into five military districts, each under com- mand of a Union general. To be restored to the Union, each of the states was required to hold a constitutional convention, with delegates elected by all adiJt males, and to frame a state constitution that gave blacks the right to vote. If the voters ratified the constitution, a state government could be elected. Finally, if Congress approved the constitution, if the state legislature ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, and it the amendment became a part of the Constitu- tion, then the state would be readmitted to the Union. By 1868, six states — Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, North Caroli- na, and South Carolina — had satisfied these requirements and were restored to the United States. In 1869 Congress further protected black suffrage by passing the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution, provid- ing that the right to vote \"shall not be denied... on account of race, color, or pre- vious condition ot servitude.\" Congress required that states not yet complying with the Reconstruction Act — Virginia, Geor- gia, Mississippi, and Texas — had to ratify the Fifteenth Amendment as a fiirther con- dition for readmission to the Union.

Carpetbag Government By 1870, each of the 10 states under mihtary rule had been readmitted to the Union. But Radical Reconstruction had disenfranchised — or took the right to vote from — many former Confederates, and many other Southern whites boy- cotted elections. As a result, government in the South was left to a small group oi white Southern Union sympathizers called \"scalawags\" and Northerners who came South — called \"carpetbaggers\" because they arrived with all their belongings in cheap suitcases made of carpet fabric. Some carpetbaggers were respectable, honest, and sincerely devoted to the pub- lic interest, but enough were selt-seeking to give the \"carpetbag governments\" a rep- utation for graft, fraud, and waste. Votes in Southern state legislatures were openly bought and sold. One carpetbag governor admitted accepting more than $40,000 in bribes. Raihoad franchises, public lands, and government contracts went to white Northerners and Northern businesses. As a result. Southern state debts rose sharply. Carpetbag rule was not without achievement, however. Most public funds were spent honestly to encourage rebuild- ing and industrial development in the war-torn states. Carpetbag governments also established public schools, including schools for black children, that had not existed in the South before the Civil War. Many Southern whites despised carpet- bag governments that increased debt and taxes and that educated, protected, and shared power with blacks. A Charleston, South Carolina, newspaper reflected such feelings when it commented on a recently adjourned session ot the state legislature: In life it has been unlovely, and in death it has not belied its record. As it lived, it has died — an uncouth, malformed and abortive monstrosity, its birth a blunder, its life a crime, and its death a blessing. Black voters, however, saw the carpetbag governments as their best hope and they overwhelmingly voted for Republican candidates. At the height of Radical Reconstruction, 700,000 blacks could vote in the South, compared to 625,000 whites. Although black voters held the majorit)' at the polls in several states, the carpetbag governments were not run by or for black people. No blacks were elected governors. Only in South Carolina did a state legisla- ture have a majority of black members. Fifteen black members were elected to the House of Representatives during Recon- struction, and two black men served as United States senators. The Radicals in Power To ensure their control over the Recon- struction program, the Radicals in Congress attempted to reduce the power of both the judicial and executive branch- es. Fearing that the Supreme Court could apply its decision in ex parte Milligan to the militarv districts of the South, Congress forbade appeals to the Supreme Court arising under the Reconstruction Act. To prevent President Johnson from appointing justices to vacancies on the Supreme Court, Congress provided that when justices died or resigned, they were not to be replaced. 486 Unit 5 Division and Reunion: 1825-1877"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"The Radicals also were determined to reduce the presidential power that Lincoln had assumed during the Civil War and to remove Johnson as an obstacle to their plans. Here, too, the conflict focused on the military districts of the South. In March 1867, Congress passed the Army Appropriation Act, which severely limited the President's power as commander-in- chief Accompanying this legislation was the Tenure of Office Act, which required Senate approval for the President to remove any government official whose appointment had required its consent. The Radicals knew that President John- son wanted to remove Edwin Stanton, Lincoln's secretary of war, who remained in Johnson's cabinet but who openly sided with the Radicals. Characteristically, Johnson ignored these warnings and con- tinued trying to block Radical Recon- struction. He removed commanders in the Southern military districts who sup- ported the Radicals and, while Congress was in recess, he fired Stanton. To replace Stanton, Johnson appointed General Grant, but when the Senate recon- vened, it rejected Grant's nomination, and Grant resigned in favor of Stanton. Out- raged, Johnson fired Stanton again — on February 21, 1868 — this time replacing him with General Lorenzo Thomas, but Stanton barricaded himself inside his office and refiised to leave. The Radicals then came to Stanton's support. Three days later, the House of Representatives voted to impeach, or charge, Johnson with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" in office. As provided in the Constitution, the President was tried by the Senate, a two-thirds majority being needed for a conviction. For more than two months, amid intense public excitement, the Senate debated the President's fate. Radical mem- bers of the House, led by Ihaddcus Stevens, presented the case against John- son, denouncing him for blocking Recon- struction and even suggesting that Johnson might have been involved in the plot to assassinate Lincoln. Johnsons lawyers argued that Lincoln, noi Johnson, had appointed Stanton to the Cabinet and, thereiore, ihai the lenure of Office Act did Tioi apply. Although Johnson ^ \"^^w-vgco.-,: n^ mijiy} — c ^f 2 It 9 iMJT 7a never attended the trial, his lawyers were successful in arguing his case and winning public sympathy for his position. On May 16, 1868, the Senate voted 35 to 19 that Johnson was guilty of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" — just one vote short of what was needed for conviction. Seven Republican senators were not able to fmd honest evidence that Johnson was guilty. Under tremendous political pressure, they refused to put partisan politics above the independence of the executive branch. One of them, Senator Lyman Trumbull, explained the reason for his vote: It is i/ot a party question I am to decide. I must he governed by what my reason and judgment tell me is the truth and the justice and the law of this case Once set, the example of impeaching a President for what, when the excitement of the hour shall have subsided, will be regarded as insufficient causes, and no future President will be safe who happens to differ with a majorit)' of the House find two thirds of the Senate. . . what then becomes of the checks and balances of the Constitution so carefdly devised and so vital to its perpetuity?

The Radicals, however, were publicly humiliated by their defeat, lost the support of Republican moderates in Congress, and turned many people in the North against Radical Reconstruction. With Johnson no longer an obstacle, the Radical Republicans sought a candi- date in the 1868 presidential election who could sweep the country and keep them in power. They found such a person in General Grant. Grant had been a Demo- crat before the war and shared Lincoln's and Johnsons lenient attitude toward the South. But he allied with the Radicals after his failed appointment as Johnsons secretary of war. The Democrats chose Horatio Seymour, former governor of New York, and their platform condemned Radical Republican actions. Although Grant won handily, 214 to 80, in the electoral college, a small shift in the popular vote in key states would have given Seymour the election. Grant won only because he was supported by the car- petbag governments of the South and because three Southern states had not yet been readmitted to the Union. Through- out Grant's two administrations, troops remained in the South. By keeping the South under military rule, the Republi- cans hoped to keep control ol Congress and the presidency. Section Two Review Summary Differences over how Reconstruction should be carried out soon divided the government. Radical Republicans tried to consolidate their power by limiting the power of the President, culminating in charges of impeachment against President Johnson. With the President no longer an obstacle, the Radicals were able to imple- ment their version of Reconstruction. Then by selecting Civil War hero Ulysses S.

Tillman South Carolina, speech in the United States Senate, 1906 Section Focus Reconstruction left a mixed legacy. It allowed the South to begin rebuilding its economy, but proved to be ot only tem- porary help to black Southerners. As political and civil rights were restored to former Confederates, they were increas- ingly denied to blacks. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe Southern resistance to Recon- struction. • Discuss political and economic change in the South after Reconstruction. w hite Southerners at first put up little resistance to Radi- cal Reconstruction. Weary from the war, they were busy with the business of keeping alive amid general poverty. But there were many \"unre- constructed rebels\" who were not inclined to follow General Lee's advice to \"unite in the restoration of the country and the re-estab- lishment of peace and harmony.\" Unable to strike openlv at the federal government, opponents ot Reconstruction organized secret resistance societies. The largest of these groups was the Ku Klux Klan. Started in Tennessee in 1866, the Klan spread throughout the former Con- federacy. Hooded, white-robed Klan mem- bers rode in bands at night and threatened carpetbaggers, teachers in black schools, and black people themselves. Using beat- ings, murder, and other violence to back up their threats, Klansmen broke up Republi- can meetings, tried to drive Freedmen's Bureau officials out of their communities, and tried to keep freed slaves from voting. Although by 1872 it had been gready suppressed by federal troops, the Klan and similar organizations contributed to the establishment of Southern governments op- posed to the Radicals. Democrats, often called \"Redeemers\" or \"Conservatives,\" gained control of one Southern state after another, until by 1 876 only South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana did not have govern- ments controUed by white Democrats, many of whom were former Confederates. One reason for these Democratic suc- cesses in the South was that Northerners were becoming weary of Radical Recon- struction. In 1872 a group called the Lib- eral Republicans, including some of the most prominent people in the Republican Party, opposed the Radicals and refused to support Grant for re-election because they considered him unfit for the presidency. The Liberal Republicans joined with the Democrats to nominate newspaper pub- lisher Horace Greeley for President. Although Grant won re-election, the Rad- ical's power was weakened, and Grant's administration loosened its controls over the South. As fewer troops were sent to protect black voters during Southern elec- tions, white political power was restored. The Compromise of 1877 The presidential election of 1876 brought the end of Radical Reconstruc- tion. In the campaign the Republicans \"waved the bloody shirt,\" the label applied to stirring up bitter memories of the war. 490 Unit 5 Division and Reunion: 1825-1877"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"Connections HISTORY Growth of Southern Manufacturing Many factors pushed the postwar South toward industrialization. Most important, however, was the surplus labor supply. Widows, orphans, and displaced former slaves needed work, and agriculture could not employ them all. This meant there AND ECONOMICS Pig iron jnctory in Alabama was a large pool of cheap labor. In acidi- tion, Northerners and Europeans invested capital in fledgling Southern industry, as did a number of Southerners themselves. Two industries that made spectacular advances in the postwar South were textile and tobacco processing. Cotton mills sprang up in the major cotton-growing areas of the South. By 1900 there were 400 mills in operation. The postwar demand For a new product — cigarettes — and the invention of the cigarette-rolling machine in 1880 were the catalysts that fueled the development of the tobacco- processing industry. Other industries based on agriculture or minerals also developed such as steel man- ufacturing and making cottonseed oil. Despite gains in industrialization, the South remained primarily rural and agri- cultural until industrial advances devel- oped in the middle of the twentieth century.

Tilden, governor of New York, polled 250,000 more popular votes than the Republican, Ohio's governor Ruther- ford B. Hayes. Tilden was a vote short of a majority in the electoral college, but 20 electoral votes were disputed. One of these electoral votes was from Oregon, and was challenged on a technicality. The other 19 involved disputed results from ihe three Southern states still under car- petbag rule — Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana — where charges of massive voting fraud flew. Republicans com- plained that l^cmocrats prevented blacks irom voting, and Democrats accused Republicans of using federal troops to raise its vote totals. Ihese three states each likd two sets of election returns, one lor lildcii and another for Hayes. Because the Constitution did not pro- vide for settling such a dispute. Congress appointed a commission of five members each from the House, the Senate, and the Supreme Court to settle the matter. Tilden needed only one of the disputed electoral votes to become President, but Hayes, needed all of them. Voting strictly along party lines, the commission awarded all 20 disputed electoral votes to Hayes. Congress accepted the verdict on March 2, 1 877, two days before the inauguration. The Democrats were outraged at the commission's decisions, and they were determined not to be defrauded. There were threats of civil war and talk of block- ing Hayes's inauguration. But the Repub- licans were just as determined to keep control of the presidency, and they began to talk about a compromise.

To compete and make a profit, Southern fac- tory owners generally paid lower wages than in the North. With these developments in transporta- tion and industry, and with the spread oi sharecropping in agriculture, the Souths economy gradually revived. By 1870, the South was producing as much cotton as it had in 1860, and by 1890 its cotton yield had doubled. By 1900 Southern industrial production was four times what it had been in 1860. In many ways, Reconstruction aided the South. But it also caused much bitterness in that section, helping to create the \"Solid South\" — a voting bloc, dominated by the Democrats, that did not break up for a century. Reconstruction also provid- ed only limited and temporary help to Southern blacks, whose rights it professed to defend. As time passed, abolitionist idealism declined, and many Radicals proved more interested in black votes than in the welfare of black Americans. Congress closed the Freedmen's Bureau after only five years, and it made no long- range plans to provide what the treed slaves needed most — land and education.

For this rea- son, written material is not always objective, free from the influence of a writer's or speaker's personal views or emotions. Sometimes, even if a writer or speaker does not intend it to happen, what he or she writes or says shows bias, a set idea or opinion about something or someone. Bias may be in favor of or against an idea or person. As you read in this chapter, Lincoln had one view about how the South should be treated after the war, while the Radical Republicans had a different view. Northern and southern leaders often expressed oppo- site points of views in their speeches and writings. Example As a student of history, you need to devel- op a method to critically examine historical sources and detect bias in materials from the past. Asking the questions that follow will help you learn how to detect bias. • When and why was the document written? Before reading a document determine, if possible, its date, its authorship, and the historical circumstances sur- roLuulint; it. • Are certain phrases used in order to have emotional impact? Speakers sometimes persuade their audi- ences by presenting statements of fact. Other times they stir their listeners' emotions by using emotion- packed phrases. • Does the writer or speaker tend to show one group as good and the other group as evil? A person's bias is often evident if he or she tries to show that a group is either completely wrong or completely right. Practice The following excerpt is from President Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address (1865). Compare it to what one of the Radical Republicans, Colonel Robert Ingersoll, had to say about Democrats (see page 484). Then answer the questions. With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives its to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are i>i. to bind up the nations wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his ividoio and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations. l.How can knowing about Lincoln's Reconstruction plans help you understand his message in his inau- gural address? 2. What effect did Lincoln want to create in the minds of his listeners? 3. What is the difference in bias between Ingersoll's remarks and Lincoln's address? What words and phrases did Ingersoll use to create an emotional impact? Look, for example, at these two statements: By the end of Reconstruction, the South was once more a part of the Union. The once-proud and unwilling states of the South had, by the end oj Reconstruction, been forced back into the Union. Each of the statements seems to be saying roughly the same thing. But if you keep in mind the definition of bias, the difference between ihe two statements becomes clear.

Driven by a desire to expand United States bor- ders, Americans were pushing westward. Americans were also moving apart ideo- logically with the slavery issue the main source of dissension. This powerful issue led to a conflict that would ultimately divide the nation in war. Chapter 13 Manifest Destiny The American drive to the Pacific was caused by several factors, including the habitual desire of Americans to move onto new land, the mistaken belief that the plains were unsuitable for farming, com- mercial interests concerning East Asian trade, and patriotism. Initially, the push westward met with little resistance from the Indians, Mexico, and Britain, but ulti- mately conflict did arise. In Texas, disputes between American settlers and the Mexican government led to several conflicts. In 1836 Texas became independent and the Rio Grande was accepted as the boundary line separating Texas and Mexico. In 1846 the United States and Mexico clashed over the south- ern boundary of Texas and war broke out. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican War, granted the United States full title to Texas with the Rio Grande as a boundary, California, and what was then New Mexico territory. The war with Mexico preempted a war with Britain over the Oregon boundary. Although Americans shouted \"Fifty-four forty or fight!\", this dispute was settled peacefully by compromise between the United States and British government, with both agreeing to the 49th parallel. Manifest destiny also moved American interests to other parts of the globe. Americans sought to acquire Cuba, but after several unsuccessful attempts aban- doned their efforts. Americans did. however, succeed in laying the ground- work for a canal across the Isthmus of Panama. In East Asia, Americans opened up China and Japan for trade. Chapter 14 Compromise and Conflict The Mexican War and the Treaty of Guadelupe Hidalgo brought into the open the slavery issue. Once the United States acquired New Mexico and Califor- nia, the nations leaders realized that a decision had to be made concerning slav- ery in the territories. This issue became acute after the discovery of gold in Cali- fornia led to California's application for statehood as a free state. This touched off a bitter debate, which was settled by the Compromise of 1850. Unfortunately, this turned out to be only a truce. By 1850 the United States was booming economically — new inventions; further development of established industries; increased agricultural productivity; in- creased labor force from immigration; and great advances in transportation, which tied together the North and the Midwest. Many of these developments, however, benefited only the North. The Souths feel- ings of isolation were intensified by its reliance on slavery, which was also causing tensions throughout the nation. Tensions increased after the passage of the Kansas- Nebraska Act. The rush among settlers from both slave and free states to populate the Kansas Territory culminated in blood- shed known as \"bleeding Kansas.\" The nation was further torn apart by the Dred Scott decision. The slavery issue was kept alive with the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858 in which Douglas admitted that territorial legislatures could practically nullify the Dred Scott decision, and John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry.

In response to Lincoln s victory, most of the southern states seced- ed from the Union. Chapter 15 The Civil War War broke out in 1861 with the Souths attack on Fort Sumter. The attack sparked patriotism on both sides, and thousands joined the ranks of their respective armies. The North and the South each had advantages. The North had superior resources and an established federal gov- ernment, whereas the South had intense nationalism and better generals. Part of the northern strategy was to blockade southern ports. This tactic was successful and reduced southern trade dra- matically. The South, though, gained momentum, crushing Union troops at both the first and second battles of Bull Run. In the West, they were less success- ful, losing several key battles to General Grant and later to General Sherman. Behind the scenes, both sides laced dif- ficulties recruiting volunteers and resorted to conscription. The South also faced pro- duction and supply difficulties. In addi- tion, the South had trouble financing the war, and Confederate money eventually became worthless. As the war progressed, Lincoln turned the war into an abolitionist crusade. Thus, the Union was now fighting to end human bondage. The progression ol the war also saw Grant finally face the bril- liant Confederate general, Robert E. Lee. Grant emerged victorious, and Lee and his army agreed to lay down their arms at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. The war had finally ended. Chapter 16 Reconstruction The Civil War had left the South in dis- array, with the land, government, and transportation system in ruin. Both the rich and the poor were allected, with many poor blacks and whites resorting to tenant firming and sharecropping. Free- dom, however, strengthened black family ties. For many, it also meant leaving the plantation and heading for the larger cities where they sought the protection and aid of the Freedmens Bureau. The freed blacks, though, were soon subjected to restrictive black codes. Two questions remaining after the war were how to deal with the defeated South and what rights should the newly fieed blacks have. Lincoln had favored a gen- erous policy for readmitting the defeated states, but many Radicals strongly op- posed this plan. Lincoln dicf not address the freed slave issue. Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's successor, tried to implement his predecessor's plan but tailure to try to overturn the black codes and conflicts with Congress ultimately gave the Radical Republicans the chance to enact their own version of Reconstruction. The Radicals were motivated primarily by a desire to punish the South and keep the Republican party in power, although many cared about the plight of the treed- men. One of their first acts was to pass Reconstruction laws that put the South under military rule and established strin- gent requirements tor readmission to the Union. Once in power, some of the lead- ers of the new state governments were accused of graft and corruption. Although this was to an extent true, these \"carpet- bag\" governments encouraged industrial development and social improvements. Radical Reconstruction met with several opponents. Andrew Johnson, still in con- flict with the Radicals, was impeached under the Radical Republicans, turning many people against Radical Reconstruc- tion. The Ku Klux Klan, also against Reconstruction, openly used violence against fieed slaves. Reconstruction ended after the disputed Tilden-Haycs election of 1876. Following this election, there was a new alliance between wealthy southerners and north- ern financiers intent on building a \"New South.\" Although the Souths economy gradually revived, the region lagged behind other areas ol the country tor decades.

They had little use for the idealism of antebellum books. This postwar generation of writers depicted events and characters in the hard, cold light of reality. Two masters of the new realism were Mark Twain and Hamlin Garland. In the first of the following selections, Twain applies a light touch to his account of a journey to Carson City with two miners. In the second selection. Garland paints a stark picture of farming in the late 1800s. As you read, determine what each author is implying about human nature. Mark Twain Hamlin Garland from Roughing It he snow lay so deep on the ground that there was no sign ok a road perceptible, and the snowfall was so thick that we could not see more than a hundred yards ahead, else we could have guided our course by the mountain ranges. The case looked dubious, but Ollendorff said his instinct was as sensitive as any compass, and that he could \"strike a bee- line\" for Carson City and never diverge from it. He said that if he were to straggle a single point out of the true line his instinct would assail him like an outraged con- science. Consequently we dropped into his wake happy and content. For half an hour we poked along warily enough, but at the end of that time we came upon a tresh trail, and Ollendorff shouted proudly: \"I knew I was as dead certain as a com- pass, boys! Here we are, right in some- body's tracks that will hunt the way for us without any trouble. Let's hurry up and join company with the parry.\" So we put the horses into as much of a trot as the deep snow would allow, and before long it was evident that we were gaining on our predecessors, for the tracks grew more distinct. We hurried along and at the end of an hour the tracks looked still newer and fresher — but what sur- prised us was, that the number of travelers in advance of us seemed to steadily increase. We wondered how so large a party came to be traveling at such a time and in such a solitude. Somebody suggest- ed that it must be a company of soldiers from the fort, and so we accepted that solution and jogged along a little faster still, for they could not be far off now. But the tracks still multiplied, and we began to think the platoon of soldiers was mirac- ulously expanding into a regiment — Ballou said they had already increased to five hundred! Presently he stopped his horse and said: \"Boys, these are our own tracks, and we've actually been circussing round and ;iiiiniijiiiniiniiiiiiiiiii(iiiiiiiininii(ni(iiiiiiiiniiiiiiniiiniiiiiiiiiiiiiiriiiiiiiiiiiiii(iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii 504 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"nMniiMniiiininiiiiiiiiiiiininiiiiiiniininiiiiniiiiiiiiiiiiMiiiiiiiMiiniiiiMiMiiiiiiiiniiiiiiiiiniiniiniininiiiMiininiiiniiiiiiiiiiniiiiiiiiMiiiiiniiiiiiiiiiMiiiiMiiiiiiiiniiniiiiiiiiiiniiMiiiiiniiiiiiiMiMin»inii^ round in a circle for more than two hours, out here in the blind desert! By George this is perfectly hydraulic!\"... All agreed that a campfire was what would come nearest to saving us, now, and so we set about building it. We could find no matches... .This was distressing, but it paled before a greater horror — the horses were gone! I had been appointed to hold the bridles, but in my absorbing anxiety...! had unconsciously dropped them and the released animals had walked oft in the storm.... We were miserable enough, before; we felt still more for- lorn, now.... At this critical moment Mr. Ballou fished four matches from the rubbish ot an overlooked pock- et. To have found four gold bars would have seemed poor and cheap good luck compared to this. One cannot think how good a match looks under such circumstances — or how lovable and precious, and sacredly beautiful to the eye. This time we gathered sticks with high hopes; and when Mr. Ballou prepared to light the first match, there was an amount of inter- est centered upon him that pages of writ- ing could not describe. The match burned hopefully a moment, and then went out. It could not have carried more regret with it if it had been a human life. The next match simply Hashed and died. The wind pulfed the third one out just as it was on the imminent verge of success. We gath- ered together closer than ever, and devel- oped a solicitude that was rapt and painful, as Mr. Ballou scratched our last liope on his leg. It lit, burned blue and sickly, and then budded into a robust flame. Shading it with his hands, the old gentleman bent gradually down and every heart went with him The flame touched the sticks at last, took gradual hold upon them — hesitated — took a stronger hold — hesitated again — held its breath five heartbreaking seconds, then gave a sort of human gasp and went out. Nobody said a word for several minutes. It was a solemn sort of silence; even the wind put on a stealthy, sinister quiet, and made no more noise than the falling flakes of snow. Finally a sad-voiced conversa- tion began, and it was soon apparent that in each of our hearts lay the convic- tion that this was our ast night with the living. I had so hoped that I was the only one who felt so We put our arms about each other's necks and awaited the warning drowsi- ness that precedes death by freez- ing.... Then came a white upheaval at my side, and a voice said, with bit- terness: \"Will some gentleman be so good as to kick me behind?\" It was Ballou — at least it was a tousled snow image in a sitting posture, with Ballou's voice. I rose up, and there in the gray dawn, not fifteen steps from us, were the frame buildings of a stage station and under a shed stood our still saddled and bridled horses! An arched snowdrift broke up, now, and Ollendorff emerged from it, and the three of us sat and stared at the houses without speaking a word. We really had nothing to say. We were like the profane man who could not \"do the subject jus- tice,\" the whole situation was so painfully ridiculous and humiliating that words were tame and we did not know where to commence anyhow.

They rose early and toiled without intermission till the dark- ness fell on the plain, then tumbled into bed, every bone and muscle aching with fatigue, to rise with the sun next morning to the same round of the same ferocity of labor. The eldest boy drove a team all through the spring, ploughing and seed- ing, milked the cows, and did chores innumerable, in most ways taking the place of a man. An infinitely pathetic but common fig- ure — this boy on the American farm, where there is no law against child labor. To see him in his coarse clothing, his huge boots, and his ragged cap, as he staggered with a pail of water from the well, or trudged in the cold and cheerless dawn out into the frosty field behind his team, gave the city-bred visitor a sharp pang of sympathetic pain. Yet Haskins loved his boy, and would have saved him from this if he could, but he could not. By June the first year the result of such Herculean' toil began to show on the farm. The yard was cleaned up and sown to grass, the garden ploughed and plant- ed, and the house mended. Council had given them tour of his cows. \"Take em an' run 'em on shares. I don't want 'o milk s'many. Ike's away s'much now. Sat'dys an' Sund'ys, I cant stand the bother anyhow.\" Other men, seeing the confidence of Council in the newcomer, had sold him tools on time, and as he was really an able farmer, he soon had round him many evidences of his care and thrift. At the advice of Council he had taken the farm for three years, with the privilege of re-renting or buying at the end of the term. ;iMiiiiniiiiiiHiiiiiiniiiMiMiiniiniiniiiMiiniiniiiiiiniiiiiiMiiiMiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiniiiiiiniiiiiiiiiniiniiiMiiiiiniiiMiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii(iiiiiiiitiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiijiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii(iiiiii 506 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"iiiniiiiiiiiiininiiiniiniiijniMiiniiniiiiiiiiiiMiiiiii[iiiMiiniiiiiiiiiiiiniiMiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiniiniiniiniiinniiiiiiiiiinii[niniiiiiiniiiiiiiiiiiiiniiniiini[iiiniiniinMiiiiniiiiiiniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii' \"It's a good bargain, an y want \"o nail it,\" said Council. \"If you have any kind of a crop, you c'n pay y\"r debts, an keep seed an bread.\" The new hope which now sprang up in the heart of Haskins and his wife grew great ahnost as a pain by the time the wide field of wheat began to wave and rustle and swirl in the winds of July.... \"'M, yes; 'm, yes; first-rate,\" said Butler, as his eye took in the neat garden, the pig- pen, and the well-filled barnyard. \"You're gitt'n quite a stock arotind yeh. Done well eh?\" Haskins was showing Butler around the place. He had not seen it for a year, having spent the year in Washington and Boston with Ashley, his brother-in-law, who had been elected to Congress. \"Yes, I've laid out a good deal ol money durin' the last three years. I've paid out three hundred dollars f'r fencin'.\" \"Um — h'm! I see, I see, \" said Butler, while Haskins went on: \"The kitchen there cost two hundred; the barn ain't cost much in money, but I've put a lot otime on it.

Fact is, I think I c'n buy the farm this fall, if you'll give me a reason- able show.\" \"Um — m! What do you call a reason- able show?\" \"Well, say a quarter down and three years' time. \" Butler looked at the huge stacks of wheat, which filled the yard, over which the chickens were fluttering and crawling, catching grasshoppers, and out of which the crickets were singing innumerably. He smiled in a peculiar way as he said, \"Oh, I won't be hard on yeh. But what did you expect to pay f'r the place?\" \"Why, about what you offered it for before, two thousand five hundred, or pos- sibly three thousand dollars,\" he added quickly as he saw the owner shake his head. \"This farm is worth five thousand and five hundred dollars,\" said Butler, in a careless and decided voice. \"What!\" almost shrieked the astounded Haskins. \"What's that? Five thousand? Why, that's double what you offered it for three years ago.\" \"Of course, and it's worth it. It was all run down then; now it's in good shape. You've laid out fifteen hundred dollars in improvements, according to your own story.\" \"But you had nothin' t' do about that. It's my work an' my money.\" \"You bet it was; but it's my land.\" \"But what's to pay me for all my — \" \"Ain't you had the use of 'em?\" replied Butler, smiling calmly into his face. Haskins was like a man struck on the head with a sandbag; he couldn't think; he stammered as he tried to say; \"But — I never'd git the use — You'd rob me! More'n that you agreed — you promised that 1 could buy or rent at the end of three years at — \" \"That's all right.

He was under the lion's paw. He felt a horrible numbness in his heart .iiul limbs. He was hid in a mist, and there was no path out. Interpreting Literature 1.

For a few years the United States government reserved most of the vast interior of the country to the native Americans because it believed these \"Great Plains\" to be too dry for farming. When whites began to infringe on these territories, they met determined resis- tance from the Plains Indians. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe the Plains Indians\" way of life. • Give three reasons the Plains Indians' way of life came to an end. T he United States government assigned Major Stephen H. Long the exploration of the region beyond the Mississippi River in 1820. In his report. Long used the term \"Great American Desert\" to describe the territory — a term that soon appeared on all the maps of the West. Believing the land to be completely deso- late, many who ventured to California and Oregon completely avoided it, choosing to travel by clipper ship around Cape Horn ' at the tip of South America. Some who attempted to cross the \"desert\" by wagon train lost hope and life in what Mark Twain called \"one prodigious graveyard.\" Nomadic Life Ends The territory that early European ex- plorers believed to be a desert was home to countless species of wildlife. Hundreds of millions of jack rabbits and \"prairie dogs,\" millions of wolves and coyotes, and an estimated 12 to 15 million American bison, usually called buffalo, roamed the Great Plains. The region was also home to many dif- ferent native American nations. Some, like the Omaha and the Osage nations, lived in communities as farmers and hunters. Most of the Indians, however, including the Sioux [SOO], the Comanches [kuh MAN cheez], and the Blackfeet, were nomadic peoples, roaming vast distances, following their main source of food: the great herds of buffalo that lived on the plains. For generations the nomadic people of the plains had only dogs to haul their possessions as they traveled from one hunting area to another. In the 1600s, horses, either traded or stolen from Spanish settlers in the Southwest, changed the Plains Indians' way of life. By the mid- 1750s, almost every Plains Indian rode on horseback. Horses became a vital part of their social, economic, and politi- cal life. Comanches were perhaps the best riders, but the Sioux, Cheyenne [shy AN], Pawnee, Blackfoot, and Crow nations were nearly as skilled. In the deserts of the region that would become the states of Arizona and New Mexico, Apaches [uh PACH ees] and Navajos [NA viih HOHS] captured horses to sell to northern Indians. The horse made the Plains Indians much more effective hunters than they had been on foot. It became easier to 510 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1 860- 1 900"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"^\"Jj^'SJijIitif^SSg^^f^^^^ .-.;. i-. u '4ll^ ^\\M ^ Examining Fine Art Covered with wolfskins, George Catlin. the artist, and an Indian hunter get a close look at the buffalo, whose poor eyesight made it an easy prey Why did the elimination of the buffalo destroy the Plains Indians' way of life? follow the buffalo, the Indians' source of food, skins fot clothing and shelter, and bones for tools. The bufhilo hunt not only yielded life's necessities, it provided sport, ritual, worship, and training for war. Fighting from horseback, the Indian war- riors were better able to resist the encroachments of settlers and railroads. Captain Randolph B. Marcy's admiration for the Indians' skill is apparent in the fol- lowing description: It is when mounted that the prairie warrior exhibits himself to the best advantage. . . . his skill in various manoeuvers which he makes available in battle — such as throwing himself entirely upon one side of his horse and discharging his arrows with great rapidity toward the opposite side from beneath the ani}rud's neck while he is at full speed — is truly astonishing. Plains Indian nations often limited their alliances with other groups. Some, such as the (\"heycnne and Arapaho [iih RAP uh HOI 1 1 established close friendships. But others, such as the Lipan [LIMP ahn] Apaches and the Utes lYOOI'S], compet- ed with one another lor the same hunting lands or control of the same horse herds and sometimes became lasting enemies. Railroads Open the West A Dakota newspaper editor wrote, \"Without the railroad it would have required a century to accomplish what has been done in five years.\" What was \"accomplished\" was the killing of nearly all the bufftio and other prairie life, the destruction of the Plains Indians' way of life, and the removal of anv surviving Indians to reservations. Railroad-building in the West began at a furious pace during the Civil War. The most dramatic achievement was the com- pletion of the first transcontinental line in 1869. Discussion of this project started when gold was discovered in California in 1848. During the 1850s at least 10 routes were surveyed, and the Gadsden Purchase was acquired from Mexico principally because the Gila River valley provided the easiest route across the western plateau. Congress wanted to finance this huge pro- ject, but sectional rivalry caused delays. The South preferred that the eastern ter- minal be located at New Orleans; the North argued for St. Louis or Chicago. In 1862, with Southern representation tem- porarily withdrawn from Congress, the government passed an act to encourage the building of a Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific Company was to build west Irom Omaha, while the Central Pacific Company was to rim lines east from Sacramento. The federal government loaned money to both companies at the Linking Across Time Indian Treaties In the nine- teenth century, the United States negotiated hun- dreds of treaties with various Indi- an nations across the continent. These were usually enforced very selectively, if at all. Provisions that benefitted the tribes were neglect- ed or ignored. Those that benefit- ted miners, ranch- ers, or settlers were enforced. In the last half of the twentieth century, many Indian groups have gone to court seek- ing to redress grievances caused by uneven enforce- ment of treaties. The courts have given several favor- able settlements to native Americans.

Each com- pany also received land grants along the right-of-way averaging 640 acres per mile. Construction proceeded rapidly as the two lines raced to get more government money and land. At the height of the competition, the Union Pacific builders employed 10,000 workers. Irish immi- grant crews working for the Union Pacific and Chinese immigrants working for the Central Pacific sometimes laid as much as 1 miles of track a day — a remarkable feat because the digging and grading were done by hand. The Central Pacific had a difficult time in the Sierra Nevada ranges with snow that sometimes collected in drifts 60 feet deep. Its heavy equipment was carried from the East 19,000 miles around Cape Horn to California by a fleet of 30 ships. On May 10, 1869, the \"wedding of the rails\" took place at Promontory Point, Utah. The whole country celebrated as a transcontinental telegraph reported the blow of a silver sledge hammer driving a golden spike to complete the railroad. A magnetic ball dropped from a pole on the top ot the Capitol in Washington, D.C.; in Chicago a seven-mile procession parad- ,^^4<'\".^'' ed through the streets; in small towns citi- zens rang church bells. The first transcontinental line was soon followed by others — the Northern Pacific; the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe; the Southern Pacific; and the Great Northern. Beginning in 1879, James J. Hill built the Great Northern, connecting the state of Minnesota and the Washington Territory, without government help. By encouraging settlement as soon as the rails were laid. Hill assured that his line would have cus- tomers. He offered free transportation from eastern ports, credit, farm machin- ery, and even gave farmers free advice on how to improve crops. Hill's careful con- struction of the Great Northern kept maintenance costs down and enabled him to charge lower rates. As a result, his rail- road became the leading carrier in the Northwest. The railroads played a major role in the extermination of the buffalo. Formerly ranging eastward as far as Pennsylvania and the Carolinas, the buffalo's natural habitat was the Great Plains where they migrated north and south with the sea- sons. The Union Pacific Railroad effec- tively cut the huge herds in half At first buffalo hunting supplied meat for railroad workers, but later it became \"sport\" for city vacationers to shoot the animals from train windows. In 1871 it was discovered that buffalo leather could be sold at a profit. Professional hunters killed millions for their hides. Train loads of bones were shipped east to make fertilizer or charcoal. By 1886 only a few hundred buffalo were left, deep in the Canadian woods. Plains Wars To protect their lands and to stop the waste of the buffalo. Plains Indians had to fight. For two and one-half centuries they had maintained their way of life against Spanish, English, French, and American invaders. The last battles against over- whelming forces proved futile. The mili- tary effort to remove the Indians from the plains was relentless with the United States spending an estimated million dol- lars for each adult male Indian killed. 512 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"NATIVE AMERICAN"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"Examining Fine Art Kicking Bear painted this description of tlie Battle of the Little Big Horn.

Not all nations were involved, however, so conflicts between the Indians and the army continued. With the discovery of gold in the Dako- ta Territory in 1874, miners flooded into Sioux and Cheyenne lands. Two years later the Sioux, led by chiefs Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, attacked the miners and settlers. The conflict came to a climax in June 1876 at the Little Bighorn River, where a large group of Cheyenne and Sioux were camped. General George Custer attacked, but the Indians killed Custer and all of his troops at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. The Sioux victory meant only a brief reprieve. In 1881 they surrendered tor a final time to the United States Army. The final clash between the army and the Indians occurred at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in December ot 1890, where more than 190 unarmed Indians were killed. With this tragic encounter, the wars came to an end. Although Plains Indian nations fought hundreds of battles from 1860 to 1890, their cause was doomed because they were dependent on the buffalo tor food, cloth- ing, fuel, and shelter. When the herds were wiped out, resistance became impos- sible. In spite of some victories and heroic deeds, such as the 1,500-mile march of the Nez Perces (NEHZ PUHRS) under Chief Joseph in 1877 to avoid capture, the result was inevitable. Chief Joseph's speech at his surrender summarized the hopelessness of the Indian cause: Our chiefs are killed. . . . The little children are freezing to death. My people. . . have no blankets, no food. ... Hear me, my chiefs; I am tired; my heart is sick and sad.

The telegraph eliminated the Indians' advantage of surprise attacks. What eventually destroyed all Indian resistance? In 1887, three years before Wounded Knee, Congress passed the Dawes Act, which broke up Indian nations, even on the reservations. The Dawes Act gave each family 160 acres to cultivate. After a pro- bation period of 25 years, an Indian was granted ownership of the land and United States citizenship. The Dawes Act was the result of humanitarian opposition to the U. S. Army's extermination policy. In 1881 Helen Hunt Jackson had written A Centu- ry of Dishonor, a book that criticized the government policy toward native Ameri- cans. Unfortimately, the new legislation did more harm than good. Plains Indians were nomadic peoples whose way ol lite was based on the buthilo hunt. They did not understand the fine points of land ownership, knew little about hirming, and were demoralized by reservation lile.

The removal of the buffalo and the Indians from the plains, as well as the opening of eastern markets bv the railroad, introduced the great days of the cattle ranchers. Discov- eries of more gold and silver in the west- ern mountains lured thousands of fortune-seekers to the mining towns. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the role of the environment in the rise and fall of the long drive. • Identify the realities behind the mjths ofthe \"Old West.\" The open-range cattle industry' started in Spanish Texas. The Spanish brought the techniques of herding on horseback, rop- ing, and the roundup to the Americas. From the Spanish, too, came the distinc- tive dress and equipment ol the cowhand. The cattle in Texas were mainly Spanish in origin, although some were brought by American and French settlers to Texas when it was part of Mexico. The Cattle Kingdom After the Texas revolution in 1836, mavericks, or unbranded cattle, multi- plied on the open range. An estimated 330,000 head of cattle in 1850 grew to between 3 and 4 million head by 1860. There were so many that they could be bought for as little as S3 or $4 a head in Texas. After the Civil War, opportunity developed for great profit in the cattle industry as growing cities of the North provided huge markets for meat. There were, however, no direct railroad lines from Texas to the North. The result was the long drive. As the spring of 1866 turned the grasslands green, cowhands drove herds of steers to railroad shipping centers in Missouri and Kansas. The routes of the long drives became known as trails — such as the Chisholm Trail from near San Antonio to Abilene, a station on the Kansas Pacific Railroad. Examining Illustrations After the Civil War many blacks took demanding jobs as cowhands driving cattle north.

A single herd mioht number 2,300 and be attended by 8 to 10 cowhands, a trail boss, and wranglers to care for the horses. The lite of a cowhand on the trail demanded discipline, endurance, and courage, but it paid well to those who sur- vived. More than 30,000 cowhands may have ridden the trails to deliver cattle from Texas to the North. Several thou- sand ot these were African Americans, free to earn their first wages after the Civil VCar. IJte in the cattle towns was exciting, but many cowhands told exaggerated tales ot daring that multiplied as dime nov- els — books of stories that sold for a dime — spread the myths of the \"Wild West\" in eastern towns and cities. A typi- cal tale was The Lije and Adi'e)itures of Nat Love: Better Known in the Cattle Country as \"DeadwooA Dick\" — By Himself. Love was an authentic black cowboy whose story became part of the romance of the West. I'or the investor, the profits obtained from a successful cattle drive were enor- mous. As the buffalo were cleared from the plains, the Cattle Kingdom expanded northward until, by 1883, it covered an area half as large as Europe, extending from Texas to Montana. From the East, even from Great Britain and France, peo- ple with cash to in\\'est and a taste tor adventure put their money in cattle. Although offering vast profits, the industry was beset by difficulties. Steers could go blind from drought, drown in flash floods, die in stampedes, or get infected by the dreaded Texas fever. They might be stolen by rustlers or shot by angry homesteaders trying to protect their crops. The open-range cattle industry col- lapsed even more rapidly than it had risen. Too many animals were put on the ranges, and overgrazing resulted. Over- production drove prices down. Sheep- herders and homesteaders competed with the cattle ranchers for land. Nature helped to end the long drives. The cold winter of 1883 and 1886 was followed by a summer so dr\\- that the grass withered and streams disappeared. In the following winter, 1886 and 1887, terrible blizzards covered the ground with snow so deep that the cattle could not paw down to grass.

The Mining Frontier The discovery of gold in California was just the beginning of prospecting in the West. Inspired fortune seekers moved to California, then spread east into the Great Basin and Rocky Mountain regions. A gold strike in Colorado in 1858 set off a stampede to the region the next year: The first breath of spring started the hordes westward. Steamboats crowded to the rails poured throngs of immigrants ashore at every Missouri River town All through April, May, and June they left the jumping-off places in a regular parade of Conestoga wagons, hand carts, men on horseback, men on foot — each with \"Pike's Peak or Bust\" crudely printed on their packs and wagon canvas By the end of June more than 100,000 fifiy- niners\" were in the Pike's Peak country. The Colorado strike was followed by many other finds; gold in the Black Hills of Dakota, copper in Montana, and silver in many places. The Comstock Lode at Virginia City, Nevada, yielded about $300 million worth of silver ore between 1859 and 1877. These discoveries attracted swarms of fortune seekers, and new min- ing towns appeared overnight. Human life was cheap in these commu- nities of tents and crude dwellings, with their rows of saloons and gambling houses.

Section Two Review O^l^^K I Charles M.

In 1880, at the age of 16, Russell set out for Montana to work as a cow- hand and to observe native American life. He began to paint life as he saw it, creating realistic scenes of the untamed West: cowhands riding bucking broncos, Indians hunting buffalo, and outlaws holding up stage- coaches. Little realizing the value of his paintings, he often gave them away. By the early 1890s, however, Russell was able to stop cowpunching and devote himself solely to art. By 1920 Russell's portrayals of cowboys and Indians commanded high prices, and he was recognized as one of the finest artists of the American West. 9B Summary Due to demand for beef in the growing cities and the abundance of inexpensive longhorns, a huge and profitable Cattle Kingdom developed rapidly as an open range industry. It collapsed even more rapidly as a result of overgrazing, falling prices due to overproduction, and several seasons of unfavorable weather.

The most fundamental reason for farmers' unwillingness to venture into the great ocean of grass was not the Plains Indians; it was the totally new environ- ment. Three forces worked to overcome the farmers' hesitation: new agricultural technology, the western expansion of the railroads, and European immigration. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • List three factors that made farming the Plains possible. • Summarize the problems faced by Plains farmers. In 1862 Congress passed the Home- stead Act, enabling a head of a family to acquire a 160-acre farm for $10. To ensure that the land went to actu- al settlers, the act required that the owner must reside on or cultivate tiie land tor five years. The act was pa.ssed as a result of nearly half a century of agitation by west- ern farmers and eastern laborers. But the 1 lomestead Act did not work out as planned. Through fraud, speculators rather than actual settlers gained posses- sion of much land. The law required that a would-be homesteader put up a home and cultivate the land. Speculators paid relatives or employees to lay down a few logs as a \"foundation\" and scatter a few grains ol corn. After five years they col- lected title to a large tract. A more impor- tant reason lor the inellectiveness ol the Homestead Act was that much ol the most desirable land near the railroad lines was usually controlled by the railroad companies themselves. Farming the Great Plains Before the plains could be settled, farm- ers had to be convinced that they could overcome the disadvantages of the dry environment. In the East a larmer could get water from a stream or by digging a well 10 to 20 feet deep. In the plains lew streams ran all year-round, and under- ground water was 30 to 300 teet down. The American farmer had always depend- ed on trees for fuel, buildings, and fences. On the plains, trees were lound only in the bottomlands near rivers. Some of the difficulties of farming the plains were overcome by technology from the Industrial Revolution. Cheap iron and steel made possible the iron-encased drilled well and the cast-iron windmill, [oseph Glidden sold his first barbed-wire in 1874, making up for the lack of wood- en fence rails. Improved agricultural machinery cut the cost of raising crops. The reaper, in general use by 1865, was followed by the mechanical binder, which tied the grain into sheaves as fast as it was cut. By the 1880s two people and a team of horses could harvest and bind 20 acres of wheat a day. The steam-driven threshing ma- chine also came into general use. In addi- tion to solving technical problems, the Industrial Revolution created a vast new urban population and expanded the mar- ket for food, both in America and Europe. The inellectiveness of the Homestead Act provided Westerners with a grievance but did not interfere with settlement.

What were environmental realities that farmers on the Plains faced? the sale ot their own. They did not charge high prices because they wanted settlers to get the land into production. In fact the most important factor in promoting settle- ment was the railroad. A spectator of the Dakota boom of the early 1 880s wrote: Yon may stand ankle deep hi the short grass of uninhabited wilderness; next month a mixed train will glide over the waste and stop at some point where the railroad has decided to locate a town. Men, women, and children will jump out of the cars, and their chattels [personal property] will tumble out after them. From that moment the building begins. Land-grant railroads had \"Bureaus of Immigration\" to persuade farmers to settle along their lines. They maintained offices in the principal European cities and agents in eastern seaports to meet immigrants as they left the boat. Steamship companies and western states advertised the region as so healthy that it cured all known diseases. The industrious person could expect to become wealthy; an $8,000 investment, it was claimed, might soon result in a steady income of $ 11 ,000 per year — an enormous sum considering that a 160-acre farm was homesteaded for $10. The West was pic- tured as a place where unmarried women would easily find husbands. \"When a daughter of the East is once beyond the Missouri,\" said one railroad advertisement, \"she rarely recrosses it except on a bridal tour.\" To offset the myth of the \"Great Ameri- can Desert,\" a new myth was created. Some \"experts\" said that rainfall on the Great Plains would increase with the plant- ing of trees or with simple cultivation; a Nebraska promoter summed it up in the catchy epigram, \"Rain follows the plow.\" As the plains were opened, the produc- tion of wheat, centering in Minnesota, the Dakotas, Kansas, and Nebraska, quadru- pled. Wisconsin, too far from the market to send fresh dairy products, used its sur- plus milk for cheese production. Near every great city, truck gardens provided Iresh vegetables. Sod House Reality The life of a Great Plains farmer seldom approached the railroad agents' glowing prophecies. The climate that was sup- posed to cure all known diseases turned out to be severe. In the summer the tem- perature might go over 1 00°F for days at a time. In winter there were periods of extreme cold, and terrible blizzards drove the snow through every chink in doors and windows. Families could be stranded in sod houses for many days. Prairie fires were a constant danger in the spring and fall. Sometimes huge swarms of grasshop- pers appeared, as if from nowhere, to eat everything green, choke wells to the brim, break the branches off fruit trees by their weight, and even devour tool handles. Worst of all disasters was drought. The normal rainfall of the plains region was markedly less than that of the wooded East, dropping from about 30 to 40 inch- es along the 98th meridian, or line of lon- gitude, to as little as 10 inches just east of the Rockies. The greatest push westward into the Great Plains took place in the early 1 880s, during a cycle of wet years that offered false promises of abundant crops. In the late 1880s, drought returned to drive thousands back east in despair.

The scarcity ot wood and water, almost uniformly prevalent, will prove an insu- perable obstacle in the way of settling the country.

A farmer's prosperity, perhaps even the ownership of the tarm, might depend on the unpredictable price of grain in an international market. Farmers also became dependent on the railroad, which carried their crops to market, on the commission merchant who marketed it, and on the owners ot grain elevators who stored it. Farmers who raised hogs or beef cattle were in a similar situation; they had little bargaining power and were forced to take whatever the meat packers paid. Farming on the plains demanded large investments of money to drill wells, put up windmills, enclose fields in barbed wire, and buy machinerj^. Because few farmers could pay with cash, they had to borrow by mortgaging their land. Then, to pay interest on the mortgages, they were forced to concentrate more than ever on raising cash crops. If prices dropped or a lean year came, they could not meet their payments and lost their land. By 1900 about one-third of the farms in the corn and wheat areas were cultivated by tenants. Not surprisingly, farmers protested. Even though they fed the cities, and sup- plied the commodities, or economic goods that paid for European investments, the wealth they created seemed to be siphoned off to others. Their attitude was expressed by a Nebraska newspaper: There are three great crops raised in Nebraska. One is a crop of corn, one a crop of freight rates, and one a crop of interest. One is produced by farmers, who sweat and toil, from the land. The other two are produced by men who sit in their offices and behind their bank counters and farm the farmers. For women, life on the plains often meant solitude and drudgery. \"Born and scrubbed, suffered and died,\" is the epitaph given a woman in one of Hamlin THE DISAPPEARING FRONTIER 524 Unit 6 The Emergence oe Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"Garland's poems. Yet the settlement of the West owed much to the endless toil of frontier women.

Women have written some of the best accounts of plains life, such as Ferber's Cimarron and h4y Antonia by Willa Gather. While not minimizing the suffer- ings of pioneering, these novels reveal how much easier life became after the sod house days were past. Willa Gather described Black Hawk, Nebraska, the locale of My Antonia: . . .

For years they had been held up as the most admirable and the happiest of peo- ple. A member of Gongress supporting free homesteads in 1851 had said: The life of a farmer is peculiarly favorable to virtue; and both individuals and communities are generally happy in proportion as they are virtuous His life does not impose excessive toil, and yet it discourages idleness. The farmer lives in rustic plenty, remote from the contagion of popular vices, and enjoys, in their greatest fruition, the blessings of health and contentnwnt. By the 1880s power and prestige had shifted from the rural areas to the cities. \"Gaptains of industry\" won the admira- tion of the public and urban America regarded country people not as the back- bone of the nation, but as unsophisticated and backward. In 1890 the Census Bineau reported that settlement had been so rapid \"that there can hardly be said to be a frontier line.\" In reality, much land was still unoc- cupied, and new settlement continued at a brisk pace into the twentieth century, but the news that the frontier was closing encouraged prophets of doom, who saw the end of an era. They believed that the existence of unoccupied land at the fron- tier had provided a \"safety-valve of social discontent,\" the idea th.it Americans could always make a fresh start.

Cowhands and miners were usually young and their lives were adventurous. Homesteaders, on the other hand, took on long-term responsibilities; they invest- ed in tools and land, and started to raise a family. When misfortune struck, patience was their virtue. Because of these differ- ences, literature about farming the plains was realistic, sometimes bitter. This can be seen in the stories of Hamlin Garland, who was born on a Wisconsin farm in 1860. Garland's family moved west three times during his boyhood. In books such as Main-Travelled Roads and A Son of the Middle Border, he told \"a tale of toil that's never done.\" Although describing moments of joy such as harvest time, or ot beauty as when the spring touched the plains. Garland refused to say that \"butter was always golden and biscuits invariably light and flaky.\" \"I will not lie,\" he wrote, \"even to be a patriot. A proper proportion of the sweat, flies, heat, dirt, and drudgery shall go in.\" The railroads enticed so many immi- grants from Scandinavia to the wheat country that by 1890, 400 Minnesota towns bore Scandinavian names. Letters written to relatives back home described the wonders of the new land. \"Here it is not asked,\" wrote one, \"what or who was your father, but the question is, what are you?\" Another wrote of the pleasure of eating white bread every day and pork three times a week. But they told of troti- bles too: Indian raids, prairie fires, locusts, and loneliness. Such struggles provide the subject of one of the greatest novels of the Great Plains, O.E. Rolvaag's Giants in the Earth, written in Norwegian. It describes the heroic efforts of Per and Beret Hansa to establish a farm in South Dakota. The farm is built, but the human cost is terri- ble: Beret goes slowly mad, and Per dies in a blizzard.

Railroads later encouraged the settlement of the plains, not only by making settlement practical, but by actively promoting it to ensure customers on their lines. Settlers began to farm once profitable farming of the Great Plains was made possible by new technology. Unfor- tunately the technology was expensive, forcing farmers to mortgage their farms and to specialize in single cash crops. This left them vulnerable to price fluctuations as well as to the harsh environment. Many farmers still failed financially, though, in spite of backbreaking toil by both men and women.

For years the federal government had debated the need for a transcontinental railroad. Americans cele- brated the completion of this line in 1869. When other railroads crossed the Plains in the decades fol- lowing the Civil War, the myth of a \"Great American Desert\" began to disappear. The government deter- mined to open the Plains to settlers and encouraged families to \"homestead\" large acreages. The intrusion of railroads and settlement of the plains brought wars with native Americans. The unrestrained slaugh- ter of the buffalo — on which nomadic Plains Indians depended for food and supplies — helped to destroy an entire way of life. The United States military, after years of bloodshed, forced survivors onto reserva- tions. Settlement accelerated following the completion of the first transcontinental railroad. Railroads not only made settlement practical, but they promoted it to ensure customers. Precious metal discoveries drew settlers to the West. A Cattle Kingdom developed rapidly on the open range, then collapsed due to falling prices and unfa- vorable weather. Technology made profitable farming of the Great Plains possible.

In Jon Hassler's novel. North of Hope, a value of shar- ing is demonstrated when Chippewa Indians in north- ern Minnesota pass a ladder from one family to another, regardless of ownership. This example shows that the Chippewa do not place the same value on material possessions as do most white Americans. Each culture has its own set of values, or customs and beliefs. The values of any culture are expressed in its art, religion, and politics and are reflected in its everyday life. Each individual living in a culture learns its values as a normal part of life. It may be difficult lor a person to identity many of his or her own cultur- al values unless they are contrasted with those of another culture. For this and other reasons, it is helpful to learn the values of differing cultures through study. Example Two methods can be used to identity the values of a culture. One is to examine sources such as a textbook. Note the practices ot the people of the cul- ture. From these, you can determine important values. For example, you read in your textbook about Per and Beret Hansa, characters trom a Norwegian novel who attempted to establish a tarm in South Dakota in the late 1800s. From this account, vou can determine that Norwegian settlers valued land ownership, tanning, and hard work. The other method ot identit)'ing cultural values is to examine the source tor the expression ot a belief or idea and then check tor evidence that supports it. For example, your textbook states that \"human lite was cheap\" among fortune seekers in the mining towns of the West. To check this, you could read to find out whether the miners' actions demonstrated a disregard for life. Since your textbook states that there was a \"vital need for law enforcement, \" you may conclude that the belief is correct. Practice For further practice in this skill, reread ( hapter 17 and find librarv resources on the nomadic Plains Indians. While these groups did not see them- selves as one entit\\', their cultures and \\alues were actuallv very similar. Using the two methods described, determine and list the major values of the Plains Indians.

Sherman, 1865 Section Focus The tremendous industrial growth that occurred in the United States after the Civil War resulted from foundations that had been laid over the previous half-cen- tury. As settlement reached beyond the Mississippi River, agriculture flourished in the South and Midwest, and manufac- turing increased in the Northeast. A transportation network spread people, products, and information across the nation. Yet greater growth was ahead. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify and explain the factors that encouraged industrial growth. • Discuss the railroads role in the growth of industry. Unlike the South, the North emerged virtually undamaged by the Civil War, its railroads and factories intact. Further- more, the war and Reconstruction elimi- nated Southern planters as rivals to Northern industrialists for political power, allowing industrial growth to proceed at an even greater pace. Although interrupted by depressions in 1873 to 1878, 1882 to 1884, and 1893 to 1896, America's indus- trial production doubled every 12 to 14 years. By the 1880s the United States had overtaken Great Britain as the world's in- dustrial leader. Although historians differ over the rela- tive importance of the reasons for industrial growth after the Civil War, they generally agree that several factors combined to support its rapid development. Natural and Human Resources The United States contained tremen- dous deposits of the natural resources upon which industry depended — coal, iron ore, and petroleum. Before the war, these deposits had scarcely been touched. By the 1860s, however, methods for ex- tracting and utilizing these resources were well developed. Mineral resources were abundant in sev- eral regions of the country. The amount of coal mined in the United States more than doubled in every decade between 1840 and 1890. By the 1870s, vast de- posits throughout the Appalachians from Pennsylvania to Alabama were being mined. Completion of the Soo Canal between Lake Superior and Lake Huron in 1855 allowed ships to move iron ore mined from large deposits in Michigan and Wisconsin to iron and steel mills on the lower Great Lakes. The American oil industry got its start in 1859 in western Pennsylvania when the first successful well was drilled. By 1900 oil fields extended as far west as Texas. Production had risen from 2,000 barrels per year in 1859 to 64 million barrels per year in 1 900. The human resources available to American industry were as important as the mineral resources. European capitalists 532 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"sometimes had difficulty recruiting labor for new industries. Ciiildren of working class families often were raised to follow traditional occupations, and in the Euro- pean countryside peasants frequently were reluctant to leave their home villages. In the United States, however, labor was more mobile. Workers came to new jobs in cities the way pioneers moved to new lands. Between 1860 and 1890, America's population more than doubled, rising from 31 million to nearly 75 million. The flood of immigration that had begun in the 1840s continued, contributing to this growth. Pulled by opportunities in America — and pushed out by the lack of them at home — 14 million immigrants arrived between I860 and 1900, more than twice the number ol the previous 40 years. Many of these immigrants were adult males, eager to find employment. These newcomers enlarged the labor pools that gathered wherever jobs were available, which helped keep industrial wages low. Public Policies and Private Investment American industry developed within a free enterprise system. NXTiereas European governments exerted controls over manu- facturing and trade, Americans embraced a philosophy of laissez-faire, which comes from the French phrase meaning \"let alone.\" As a result, American industries developed with few government restraints. Some government policies actually encouraged industrialization. American entrepreneurs, or business organizers, sought and received special lavors from Congress. Liberal immigration laws in- sured a steady supply of cheap labor. High protective tariffs encouraged American industries and raised manufacturers' prof- its by keeping out foreign goods. I'he fed- eral government sold public lands containing vast mineral resources for a small proportion ol their true values and assumed about one-third ol the cost of building western railroads. It gave rail- roads grants of monev totaling more than $700 million and gave them public lands throughout the West equaling the size of Texas. In the United States, business attracted and held people of high ability and ambi- tion. While European entrepreneurs often retired when they acquired enough money to buy their way into the upper class, Americans regarded money-making itself as a worthwhile goal. \"Such opportunities for making money, \" wrote Thomas Mel- lon, a Pittsburgh judge who became a banker, \"never existed before in all my for- mer experience. \" The money to be made in American manufacturing and transportation attract- ed private investors. The savings ol New Englanders — accumulated from the West Life of the Times Working-class Tenements Working-class incomes varied greatly during the late nineteenth cen- tury. For example, in 1889 a carpenter earned $686 annually; a laborer, $384; and a young girl in a silk mill only $130. The carpenter ate meat or eggs, hotcakes, butter, and cake for breakfast. The laborer and silk worker had only bread and butter for two meals out of three. The carpenter lived in a comfortable, spacious house. Most working- class people like the laborer and the silk worker crowded togeth- er in tenements designed to house as many families as possible. Living con- ditions in tenements were primi- tive. Beds often con- sisted of boxes filled with straw. Few build- ings had indoor plumbing, and in those that did, several fam- ilies shared a bathroom. Living areas were cramped. Rags, bones, and other garbage piled up outside, freezing in winter and reeking in summer. Disease festered in the pervasive dirt and vermin. Working-class men and women developed a community lile as vibrant as their physical surroundings were bleak. Frequently this life was based on ethnic ties. Irish Americans gathered in taverns and parish churches. Jew- ish Americans organized Flebrew schools and Yiddish-speaking literarv groups. Most immigraiu groups and Alrican Americans developed social clubs, storefront churches, .iiul mutual-aid societies.

Science and Technology A flood of important inventions helped increase America's productive capacity and improved the network of transportation and communications that was vital to the nation's industrial growth. As American universities, influenced by German educa- tion, extended their activities beyond teaching, they became important centers of scientific research. The American public knew little of the university professors who extended the boundaries of science. But it was greatly impressed with inventors like C. Latham Sholes, a Wisconsin printer whose idea for a typewriter in 1868 revolutionized busi- ness communications. Equally inventive was Alexander Graham Bell, an immigrant from Scotland. Bell's profession was teaching children to speak. He applied his speech training to develop- ing the principles upon which the tele- phone is based before he knew enough about electricity to build one. In 1876 he sent the first telephone communication to his laboratory assistant in the next room, \"Mr. Watson, come here; I want you.\" A year later he demonstrated the commercial value of his invention by sitting in Boston and talking with Watson in New York — and the Bell Telephone Company was founded. By 1886 more than 250,000 phones were in use, mostly in businesses — creating jobs for thousands of women as switchboard operators in offices through- out the United States. By 1900 rates had been lowered, and telephones began to appear in American homes. Examining Pliotographs The telephone made business communications quicl< and person- al.

Perhaps even more famous than Bell was Thomas AJva Edison, who has been erroneously given credit for inventing the electric light, the phonograph, and mov- ing pictures. Edison actually made tew original discoveries. Instead, he was a great innovator who put the inventions of others to practical use. For example, Edi- son's redesign oi Sholes's typewriter per- mitted people to type faster than they could write. His improvement of Bell's telephone allowed voices to be transmit- ted longer distances. His work on improv- ing the telegraph led to one of his few actual inventions, the phonograph. The laboratory he founded in 1876 at Menio Park, New jersey, and staffed with highly skilled technicians, was the forerunner of today's industrial research laboratories. The incandescent electric light had been demonstrated in Britain in 1840. But it was Edison who, in 1879, developed cheap methods oi supplying power and wire, as well as filaments that lasted more than just a few minutes. The incandescent bulb lighted America's cities and made industrial production possible 24 hours a day. As technology exploded, its effect was felt almost everywhere in the United States. During the Civil War, soldiers in the Union army had received some rations in cans, an innovation that demonstrated the value of canned food. After the war the canning industry improved its methods, and by 1900 machines had been designed to make, fill, and seal cans. A large variety of canned foods, not always available as fresh produce, began to appear on the shelves of the nation's stores. America's textile industry had long de- pended on machines to turn fibers into cloth. In 1893 the invention of the Northrup automatic loom led to the man- ufacture of cloth at an even faster rate. Bobbins, which had previously been changed by hand while the loom was stopped, were now changed automatically without stopping the loom. Great changes also occurred in the clothing industry. Standard sizes, devel- oped from measurements taken of Union soldiers during the Civil War, were used Examining Illustrations In thie 1850s a Yale University professor developed a process to convert oil into kerosene to light lamps.

Power-driven sewing machines and cloth cutters rapidly moved the clothing business from small tailor shops to large factories. Similar changes took place in shoe-mak- ing. New processes and inventions made economies of scale possible in the shoe industry. In other words, large factories could mass produce shoes more cheaply and efficiently than smaller companies and could pass these savings on to their cus- tomers in the form of lower prices. By the turn of the century, local cobblers had nearly disappeared. Prices of many other products also dropped as the United States became an industrial nation. Much oi the nation's phenomenal indus- trial growth was made possible by earlier advances in specific industries. For exam- ple, the Bessemer process revolutionized American steelmaking in the 1870s. As steel was increasingly used for products such as machines, rails, and building beams, industry in general began to ex- pand. The boom in the oil industry, along with the development ot oil-lubricated machine tools — metal lathes, punches, and drill presses used to make other machines — brought tremendous growth in the country's industrial capability. New technology also stimulated the growth ot the railroad industry. Steel pro- duced by the Bessemer process enabled the railroad companies to replace iron rails and expand their operations because steel held up better and carried heavier loads. The Westinghouse air brake allowed the cars and locomotives to stop simultaneous- ly — another factor making longer trains and heavier loads possible. Kerosene lamps, and later electric lights, provided better headlights for nighttime travel. Examining Maps After the first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, travel time from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean was reduced from a month to a week. More track was laid in the 1880s than in all the years between 1828 and 1870. Why did transportation improvements encourage Industrial growth?

In 1884 delegates from 27 nations met in Washington, D.C, and divided the earth into 24 time zones. The base time zone was established with the prime meridian (0° longitude) as its midpoint. This zone extended about 7-t degrees on either side of the prime meridian. Since the prime meridian ran through Green- wich in Britain, the time in the base zone became known as Greenwich time. The time zones are not equally divided in 15-degree intervals. The zones deviate considerably to suit the needs of the peo- ple living within them.

At the end of the Civil War, there were 35,000 miles of railroad track in the United States, of various gauges, or widths between the two rails. By the mid- 1870s the amount of track had doubled and by 1 890 more than dou- bled again. In 1900 passenger and Ircight trains steamed along almost 200,000 miles of rails in the United States. This was more than 40 percent ot the world's track and more than all the track in F.uropc and Russia combined. By then track also was laid according to a standard gauge — 4 feet, 8\\ inches- wide — so that freight could move from line to line with- out having to unload it Irom one car and reload it onto .mothei. This standardized railroad network bound all sections o( the country into one market and one nation. Trains could carry bulky products long distances quickly and cheaply, making it possible lor businesses to sell their goods across the continent. In 1860 railroads carried less than hall as much Ireight as inland waterways. By 1890 railroads car- ried five times as much. Railroads were not only the biggest shippers ol industrial products; they were also American industry's best customers. In the mid-188()s, lor example, rails were the single most important product ol American steel companies. In addition, construction and operation ol railroads required huge amounts ol coal to power locomotives, lumber for ties and cars, iron for bridges, and petroleum products to lubricate moving parts.

As a result, hundreds of unconnect- ed small lines existed after the Civil War, with tracks of varying gauges. The South, for example, had more than 400 railroads averaging less than 40 miles each. The challenge facing eastern capitalists was to create a single rail transportation system from this maze of small companies. Railroad consolidation proceeded rapid- ly from the end of the Civil War to the turn of the century. More than two-thirds of the nations railroads were absorbed by the other one-third. In the 1880s about 400 railroads became controlled by other lines. By 1890 the Pennsylvania Railroad was a consolidation of 73 smaller compa- nies with more than 5,000 miles of track. The Southern Railway had pieced togeth- er companies with 8,500 miles of lines. Eventually most rail traffic was controlled by 7 giant systems with terminals in major cities and scores of branches reach- ing into the countryside. In gaining and using such power, many railroad builders and consolidators became tough, ruthless, and unethical competitors who amassed huge fortunes in the course of their activities. Railroad consolidator Jay Gould sold small lines that he owned to large railroads that he controlled at prices far above the small railroads' actual worth. When railroad builder Collis Huntington remarked \"It takes money to fix things,\" he meant bribing government officials, not repairing equipment! In de- scribing his industry, railroad executive Charles Francis Adams, Jr., observed: Honesty and good faith are scarcely regarded. Certairdy they are not tolerated at all if they interfere with a man's getting his \"share of the business. \" Gradually this demoralizing spirit of low cunning has pervaded the entire system.

Vanderbilt liked to be called \"the Commodore\" because he got his start as owner of a Staten Island ferry. By the mid- 1850s, he had built the largest steamboat fleet in America. Yet the Com- modore saw that the Riture of trans- portation was in railroads. So at age 73 he merged 3 short New York railroads he had purchased to form the New York Central, running from New York City to Buffalo. Within 4 years Vanderbilt extended his control over lines all the way to Chicago. In addition to bringing many lines under one management, Vanderbilt made great improvements in service. He was one ot the first to use the Westinghouse air brake and the very first to lay a tour-track main line — two tracks for freight and two for passenger traffic. In accomplishing his goals, Vanderbilt, like most other railroad tycoons, was a combination of shrewd speculator, ruth- less competitor, and visionary. In business deals the Commodore often showed little respect for either law or the public inter- est. He was one of the first to practice \"insider trading,\" rigging the stock market to force prices up or down as he pleased and driving other companies into bank- ruptcy in the process. Yet Vanderbilt, and other entre- preneurs who made the railroad Ameri- ca's first national business, provided great benefits, too. Standard-gauge track was universally accepted and standard time zones were established to simplify scheduling. The big systems were able to improve equipment, to shift cars from one section of the country to another according to seasonal needs, and to speed long-distance transportation. They made railroad operation so much more effi- cient that the average rate per mile for a ton of freight dropped from 2 cents in 1860 to threc-foiuths of a cent in !')()().

Rockefeller American industrialist, 1839-1937 Section Focus As railroads gave industrialists access to raw materials and markets, great opportu- nities developed for business expansion. The result was \"Big Business.\" By 1900 several major industries were dominated by gigantic companies that owned scores ol plants, sold products nationwide, and had hundreds of millions of dollars in capital and credit behind them. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss the methods big business used to become successful. • Explain why incorporation encouraged business growth. The railroads were America's first \"Big Business.\" Foimding a major railroad consumed larger sums of money than any previ- ous American enterprise. The investment required was so great that no one individ- ual could make it. Instead, a large railroad line was organized as a corporation — a company formed by a group of investors who each receive a share of ownership in proportion to the amount they invested. Investors also enjoyed the protection of limited liability; that is, they risked only the amount of their investment, even if the corporation went bankrupt and could not pay its bills. This business structure allowed entrepreneurs in many industries to raise the money they needed to launch or expand companies as opportunities arose. Benefits of Big Business Big business enjoyed many advantages. Large companies could manufacture enough products to meet the demands of a national market. They produced better products at lower cost than their smaller competitors through the economics of scale that resulted from using the newest processes and combining operations for- merly performed by separate companies. High salaries were offered in order to get expert managers. At the same time, they increased efficiency by establishing sepa- rate departments for specialized functions such as purchasing, production, research, distribution, and sales. In conducting their operations, big com- panies organized work to gain maximum production from their employees. A steel company engineer, Frederick W. Taylor, developed a system to study and time workers and to make changes so their jobs could be performed more efficiently. Such studies even included counting the steps a worker took in moving from one place to another on the job and determining what size shovels were best for shoveling coal, rice, and iron ore! The advantages of big business were shown dramatically by the development of large meat-packing companies. In the past, fresh meat was slaughtered locally, and every town had at least one slaughter- house. When the refrigerated railroad car made it possible to ship fresh meat over long distances, huge companies such as Swift and Armour appeared, selling their products throughout the country. The big packers were so highly organized and effi- cient that they could sell meat at a loss and make their profit from the rest of the 540 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"carcass.

The companies they organized, American Tobacco, General Electric, and United Fruit, for example, came to domi- nate their industries and sold products not just nationwide, but to the entire world. In attaining success, however, many entrepreneurs showed few scruples in driving competitors out of business, evading the law, bribing officials, de- stroying labor unions, and devastating the environment. They commonly sold prod- ucts at below their cost until local busi- nesses were forced to close down or sell out. The American public, therefore, had Because of their efficiency, organization, and size, large businesses were frequently in a position to take advantage of their competitors and sometimes of the public. Big companies could demand volume dis- counts from shippers. They could sell their products in an area at a loss until local competitors were forced to shut down or sell out. If a large company succeeded in getting a monopoly in its industry, it could raise consumer prices and pay less to suppliers of raw materials. Economist David Wells recognized these trends in 1889: ^jl^^> . . . the smaller flour mills in the United States are being crushed, or forced into consolidation with the larger companies, the latter being able, from dealing in such immense quantities, to buy their wheat more economically, obtain lower rates of freight, and, by contracting ahead, keep constantly running And what has been thus affirmed. . . might be equally affirmed of a great t'ariety of other leading commodities. Big business in the hue nineteenth cen tury resulted from the vision of people who recognized great opportunities lor GusTAVus Swift 1839-1903 At 16, Gustavus Swift borrowed $25, bought a cow, slaughtered it, and sold the beef at a $10 profit. From that point on. Swift devoted his life to making money from meat. Swift first opened several butcher shops. With a talent for buying onlv the best cattle, he next moved to C^hicago — capital of the cattle mar- ket — and went into business shipping livestock by rail to Eastern cities. He soon realized, however, that he could make more money butchering the ani- mals in Chicago and shipping the meat. At first, to prevent spoilage. Swift could ship only during winter months. But then he hired an engineer who developed a refrigerated railroatl car that made it possible to ship year round. As hungry workers swelled the si/e of eastern cities, Swift & Co. made great profits by shipping huge qii.iiiti ties of meat ro feed them.

Yet others admitted that they benefited from big business's efficiency, its lower prices, and the jobs it created. Success in business became a best-selling theme in popular fiction. Horatio Alger became wealthy himseh when he wrote novels like Mark the Match Boy, Tattered Tom, and over 1 00 others — all \"rags-to-riches\" stories of young men who became successful in business because of hard work and lucky breaks. The Role of Corporations American law allowed the formation of business corporations, and conditions in the United States encouraged their exis- tence. As a business form, the corporation offered a number of advantages over a partnership or a sole proprietor. The corpo- ration had a permanence that lasted beyond the lives of its owners or stockholders. So company managers could confidently plan tar into the fiiture. Examining Political Cartoons In this 1888 cartoon big business is portrayed as a hydra — a many-headed monster from Greek mythology — that is threatening the nation. Each head on the hydra represents a trust. The cartoonist is calling for laws, represented by the club, to give the government the power to destroy the monster. Why did some Americans oppose big business? 542 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"By selling stocks and bonds, a corporation could raise the capital, or investment money, for its operations. Small amoitnts of capital, from many individual investors could be pooled into the huge sums needed to start or expand a large company. In that way no one investor would have to take a big financial risk. To reduce risk even more, investors could spread it out by purchasing stock in several corporations. One specialized form of corporation, the holding company, became very popular. Holding companies manufac- tured no products and had no customers. They existed only to own stock in other cor- porations. Through holding companies, wealthy capitalists could own controlling interests in many businesses. Other companies were organized into trusts. A trust was formed when several companies gave control of their operations to a single board of trustees. The sharehold- ers of each individual company continued to own it and keep its profits, but manage- ment ot all companies in the trust was in the same hands. Through holding compa- nies and trusts, entrepreneurs formed the huge business combinations that dominat- ed the late nineteenth century. Business consolidation — that is, combin- ing companies into one unit — took various forms. Sometimes companies were consoli- dated by horizontal integration, in which several firms engaged in the same kind of business were joined together. If a horizon- tal combination became large enough, it could achieve a monopoly of that industry. Companies also were consolidated by vertical integration, which joined busi- nesses engaged in different but related activities. A vertical combination might include, for example, under the same ownership individual companies that pro- vided raw materials; transported those raw materials to factories; manufactured a product from those raw materials, and distributed and sold the finished product. A horizontal combination, once estab- lished, was able to expand vertically because of the control its size gave it over both sup- pliers and distributors. And a vertical com- bination could become so efficient that it expanded horizontally by buying its com- petitors, forcing them into trusts, or driving them out of business. iiiTiTiiiiiiiiiiiia Section Two Review ITIlIIIlIITIIflTi™ Summary Corporate structure allowed the growth of big business. By combining management in trusts or holding compa- nies, or in horizontal or vertical business combinations, these colossal corporations further extended their control.

Big businesses frequently used these advan- tages to destroy smaller competitors and to smash labor unions. Moreover, big business leaders broke laws and devastat- ed the environment.

Rising from poverty to attain enormous wealth and power, John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie represented to many the Ameri- can Dream. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Compare the methods used by Carne- gie and Rockefeller to achieve success. • Explain social Darwinism and the Gos- pel of Wealth. Although giant combinations arose to control the beef, flour, whiskey, tobacco, lead, and sugar industries, as well as many others, by 1900 the American econ- omy ran on oil, and its backbone was steel. No industrialists exemplified the principles of doing \"big business\" in late- nineteenth-century America more than the entrepreneurs who dominated these two basic industries — ^John D. Rockefeller in oil and Andrew Carnegie in steel. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Trust The most successful example of hori- zontal consolidation was the Standard Oil Trust, which gained a near-monopoly of oil refineries and pipelines. The guiding genius behind Standard Oil was John D. Rockefeller, who during his 98 years, from 1839 to 1937, amassed what was at the time the world's largest fortune — almost $1 billion. Rockefeller went to work at age 16 as a bookkeeper in a wholesale commission and produce company in Cleveland, Ohio. Dominated by the idea that he was \"bound to be rich,\" he saved $800 in 3 years, on a salary of $15 per week. At 19 he left his job and opened his own commission house. In only 4 years he increased his capital to about $100,000. Then in 1865, at age 23, he put all his money into a new and grow- ing industry — petroleum refining. Until the 1850s, petroleum, then called \"rock oil,\" had been used only as a patent medicine. In 1855 scientists discovered that petroleum, when refined into kero- sene, was better than whale oil in lamps and made a much better lubricant than animal fat. The first oil well, drilled in 1859, set off a stampede to western Pennsylvania much like the California gold rush of 1849. Land values jumped from a few dollars an acre to hundreds of dollars a square foot, new towns appeared overnight, and the demand for kerosene spread worldwide. In spite of the Civil War, the petroleum industry grew so fast that by 1865, oil products had risen to fourth place among American exports. Drilling for oil was always a big gamble, and Rockefeller realized oil refining was a much safer investment. But the entire oil business was highly disorganized. For- tunes were made and lost overnight as the price of oil fluctuated wildly. Rockefeller 544 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"believed these unstable conditions resulted from competition among thousands ot small producers and hundreds of small refiners. By 1870 Rockefeller's firm, the Stan- dard Oil Company of Ohio, with capital stock of $1 million, was the largest of 26 refineries in Cleveland, processing 2 or 3 percent of the crude oil produced in the United States. Over the next 9 years, Rockefeller gained control of more than 90 percent of the nation's refining busi- ness and brought order to a chaotic indus- try. But to achieve stability and efficiency in the oil business, Rockefeller used meth- ods so shrewdly brutal that when they were revealed he became one of the most hated men in America. One of Standard Oil's major weapons was the rebate, or discount, on freight charges. In 1872 the company offered to give certain railroads all its shipping busi- ness if those railroads secretly agreed to charge Standard Oil 25 to 50 percent less than they charged its competitors. In return for its business, these railroads also promised to tell Rockefeller the destination of all his competitors' shipments. This Examining Photograplns Although he was a ruth- less businessman.

Once it controlled oil refining in Cleve- land, Standard Oil moved rapidly toward a nationwide monopoly by allying with the strongest companies throughout the indus- try. In 1880 a committee of the New York legislature reported on the extent of Stan- dard Oils domination of the oil business: It owns and controls the pipe lines of the producing regions that connect with the railroads. It controls both ends of these roads. It ships 95 per cent of all oil. . . . It dictates terms and rates to the railroads. It has bought out and frozen out refiners all over the country. By means of the superior facilities for transportation which it thus possessed, it could overbid [its competitors for crude oil] in the producing regions and undersell [its competitors] in the markets of the world. By a secret agreement that became known as the Standard Oil Trust, Rocke- feller moved in 1882 to consolidate his control of the oil industry further by com- bining 40 companies under a single man- agement. Controlling interest in the stock of these companies was turned over to 9 trustees headed by Rockefeller. Once in control of most of the refining and transportation ot oil in the United States, Standard Oil expanded vertically. It gained control of oil fields to have an independent supply source, and it market- ed natural gas. At the other end ot the production process, Standard Oil moved into the distribution of petroleum prod- ucts, both in the United States and over- seas. Eventually Standard Oil controlled a fleet ol ocean-going tankers and door-to- door delivery wagons in Europe. It even manulactured and sold cooking stoves to increase the demand lor kerosene! Standard Oil's spectacular success led others to establish horizontal combinations of companies in industries as varied as whiskey, bituminous coal, and rope. The purpose of these combinations was main- ly to prevent overproduction and to keep prices up. But it was difficult to control an entire industry and to keep new firms out ol the market. Such efforts to obtain monopolies were greatly resented by small business people and consumers. Vertical combinations, on the other hand, were not monopolistic. The savings that resulted from the economies they brought to production were passed on to consumers in lower prices. Vertical com- bination thus became a common form of business organization that is still seen today in such giant organizations as Gen- eral Motors and American Telephone and Telegraph. Although Rockefeller's rivals in the oil industr}' were painfully aware of his ruth- less methods, it was a young investigative journalist who exposed them to the pub- lic. In 1903, in a series of brilliant articles in McClures Magazine, Ida Tarbell revealed Rockefeller's secret deals and high-pressure tactics. She explained how companies controlled by Standard Oil continued to do business under their for- mer names. She documented how, to con- ceal his control ol these companies, Rockefeller appointed \"dummy directors, \" who were sometimes employees such as errand-runners or secretaries. Rockeleller, a devout churchgoer and Sunday school teacher, did not think that his actions in what he called \"system- atizing\" the oil industry were wrong. He pointed out that what he had done to destroy his competitors had not been ille- gal when he first did it. Rebates, for exam- ple, were granted by railroads to big shippers in many other industries. When buying out his competitors, Rockefeller offered to pay them in either cash or Stan- dard Oil stock, advising them to take the stock. Those who took his advice became rich. Much ot Rockefeller's advantage over competitors came from his passion for efficiency and his hatred of waste. Stan- dard Oil continuously improved its prod- uct. The company had few labor troubles because it paid its workers well. It tried to protect their jobs in times ot depression 546 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"and was one of the first companies to pay old-age pensions. Andrew Carnegie, Master of Steel The most remarkable example of the creation of a vertical combination was the giant steel corporation built by Andrew Carnegie. Coming to Pittsburgh from Scotland at the age of 13, Carnegie went to work in a cotton factory, where he earned $1.20 for working a 72-hour week. He saw an opportunity to grow with the railroad, however, and in 1853 he went to work as a clerk and telegraph operator for the Pennsylvania Railroad. His ability, energy, and ambition were so great that at age 23 he became superintendent ol the railroad's western division. While working for the railroad, Car- negie wisely invested his earnings in iron companies. As the railroads grew, Car- negie foresaw his opportunity for personal success in the increasing demand for rails, bridges, and locomotives. By age 30, when he left the railroad to manage an iron bridge company, his investments were producing an annual income of nearly $50,000. After seven years making iron bridges, Carnegie again looked at the future and saw it was in steel. He decided to \"put all his eggs in one basket and watch the bas- ket.\" In 1873 he formed a group ot investors to build the largest and most modern steel mill in the world near Pitts- burgh. Carnegie was the first person in the United States to use two new ways of making steel — the Bessemer process and the open-hearth process. These processes enabled him to produce steel so cheaply that it could now be used for rails and construction girders, as well as for cutlery and precision machines. Between 1866 and 1876, the produc- tion of American steel jumped hom 20,000 to 600,000 tons; by 1897 it had skyrocketed to more than 7 million tons. Almost overnight Carnegie changed the character of the industry. Previously iron and steel had been manufactured at hundreds ol small furnaces all over the country. But Bessemer converters and open-hearth furnaces required heavy investments of capital, and huge amounts of coke and ore to keep them going.

Fewer than 20 years after putting all his eggs in one basket, Carnegie was the greatest steelmaker in the world. One rea- son for his phenomenal success was that he took the guesswork out of making steel by getting the best technical and scientific experts he could find. Carnegie liked to boast that he \"was smart enough to sur- round himself with men far cleverer than himself.\" For example, his managers were able to determine almost to the penny what it cost to produce a ton of steel. With this knowledge, Carnegie could set prices below his competitors and still make a profit. His chemists found uses for by-products previously considered to be industrial waste, and they discovered how to use low-grade ores formerly considered worthless. Seeking out the ablest people in the industry, Carnegie bought their loyalty by making them partners. Equally alert for ability inside his companies, he rapidly promoted exceptional employees. Com- mon laborers in his mills fared less well, however, as he drove wages down and hours up. In 1892, with his partner, Henry C. Frick, he crushed the steelwork- ers' union, so that the 12-hour day remained standard in the industry for many years. During the three major depressions of the late 1 800s, while other steel companies closed down and laid off employees, Carnegie expanded. He rebuilt his factories to be even more efficient and acquired his Examining Fine Art The Hatch Family by American artist Jonathan Eastman Jotinson por- trays a family in fine ciotfiing enjoying a comfortable afternoon in their home.

That was what gave me my leading interest in this steel business.\" Carnegie \"gambled on the fiiture of America,\" as he put it, \"and won.\" In his constant effort to be more effi- cient, Carnegie combined all the processes required for making steel into one great vertical combination. In addition to blast hirnaces and steel mills, Carnegie Steel ('ompany controlled: rich iron ore deposits near Lake Superior, fleets ot ships to carry the ore over the Great Lakes, a railroad to carry the ore from the Lake Erie region to Pittsbiugh, coal mines in Pennsylvania to fire the blast furnaces, and factories tor producing finished steel products such as wire. Social Darwinism and the Gospel of Wealth Andrew Carnegie was making $25 mil- lion a year, at a time when there was no income tax. His workers, on the other hand, earned $8 or $9 a week. He made steel so cheaply and competed so merci- lessly that remaining steel companies faced bankruptcy. Carnegie and most other great industrialists foimd justifica- tion tor these actions and their conse- quences in a philosophy known as social Darwinism, which applied the biological theories of naturalist Charles Darwin to himian society. Darwin believed that in n.uiue a competition exists in which only the fittest — the strongest, most clever, most efficient — plants and animals sin- vive. I he weak individuals die out, and CuAPTPR 18 Tun Rise of Industriai Ami-,ric:a 549"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"each species thereby remains strong and healthy. Philosophers such as Yale profes- sor William Graham Sumner argued that this competition also operated in human society, and that industrialists like Rocke- feller and Carnegie had succeeded because of their rare talents. \"The millionaires are a product ot natural selection,\" Sumner wrote. \"They get high wages and live in luxury, but the bargain is a good one for society.\" Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rocke- feller both believed wholeheartedly in the philosophy of social Darwinism. Carnegie called it a method better than elections lor selecting leaders. \"By a process ot pitiless testing we discover who are the strong and who are the weak,\" he wrote. \"To the strong we give power in the form of the autocratic control of industry and of wealth.\" Rockefeller told his Sunday school class that his business practices merely demonstrated \"the survival of the fittest a law of nature and a law of God.\" But for Carnegie the achievement of great power and wealth was not enough. He looked beyond success to question whether those who profited from society owed anything to it in return. His answer was what he called his \"Gospel of Wealth.\" Writing in the North Ainerican Review in 1889, Carnegie maintained that a wealthy person should: . . . consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as trust fimds, which he is called upon to administer. . . in a manner which, in his judgment, is best calculated to produce the most beneficial results for the community. . . . becoming the mere agent and trustee for his poorer brethren, bringing to their service his superior wisdom, experience, and ability to administer, doing for them better than they woidd or could do for themselves. Business people should invest their wealth not as charity to the poor, but \"to help those who will help themselves,\" he wrote, \"to provide part of the means by which those who desire to improve may do so.\" Carnegie practiced what he preached. In 1901 he sold his steel properties to the newly formed United States Steel Corpo- ration for $250 million and withdrew from business to devote the rest of his life to philanthropy, that is, to actions bene- fiting society. By the time he died, in 1919, he had donated $350 million— mostly to building public libraries, improving education, and promoting re- search. Rockefeller also returned much of his fortune to society in gifts that totaled more than $500 million. Sherman Antitrust Act In 1881 Atlantic Monthly published an article entitled \"The Story of a Great Monopoly,\" by Henry Demarest Lloyd, telling how the Standard Oil Company had monopolized the oil-refining busi- ness. It caused such a sensation that the magazine had to print three times as many copies as usual. Throughout the next decade, as it was revealed that indus- try after industry was in danger of being monopolized, demands for federal regula- tion came from many different groups — small businesses, farmers, consumers, and laborers. Officials of the great corporations began to have concerns about growing public cries for reform. Henr)' O. Havemeyer, head of the American Sugar Refining Company, which controlled a trust pro- ducing more than 90 percent of the na- tion's sugar, urged that manufacturers of products in general use should submit to some federal regulation. In the election of 1888, both political parties promised action, and in 1890, with only one dis- senting vote. Congress passed the Sher- man Antitrust Act. The Sherman Act wrote into federal law a traditional principle of English common law — that private monopolies and artifi- cial restrictions on trade were wrong. In the words of the act: 550 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"Every contract, combination, in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal For a number of reasons the Sherman Act had little effect on preventing business consolidation. It was not strictly enforced and was so loosely worded that its mean- ing was doubtful. Did the law mean, for example, that all mergers were unlawful, that all business transactions must be open and public, that any contract that permitted one company to take business from another was illegal? Under the Constitution, the answers to such questions are left to the federal courts, which in the 1890s were probably more favorable to business interests than at any other time in American history. In the United States v. E. C. Knight Company, the Supreme Court in 1895 agreed that the American Sugar Refining Company was a trust and that it enjoyed a near monopoly in the manuflicture of sugar. But the Court ruled that the company's activities did not violate the Sherman Act because manufac- turing was not interstate commerce. The Supreme Court's decision in the Knight case was followed by one of the greatest periods of business consolidation in American history. In 1890 there had been 24 trusts worth a total of $436 million. In 1900 there were 183 huge combinations with a total worth of over $3 billion. At the same time, big business simply turned away from trusts and toward holding companies in creating combinations. In spite of its early failures, the Sherman Act was a very important law. It signaled to large corporations to be more aware of how their activities looked to the public. Corpo- rate image and public relations became important business concerns. Later regula- tion of big business would depend on addi- tional legislation, die interpretations of future courts, and on altitudes in the exec- utive branch about enforcement. »»» Section Three Review ss a«M»»! Summary Business growth was driven by the ambition of captains of industry such as Rockefeller and Carnegie. Beginning with nothing, both men built enormous indus- trial empires — Rockefeller in oil, and Carnegie in steel. They forced out compe- tition and manipulated prices, using social Darwinism to justify their actions. Although the nation benefited from their efficiency and innovation, the public demanded restriction of big business.

They toiled long hours for low wages, earning from $9 to $20 a week, depending on their skills. In an attempt to improve working condi- tions, workers began to organize. In spite of rapid growth after the Civil War, unions encountered many difficulties. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe the difficult conditions under which people worked during the late 1800s. • Explain the obstacles faced by labor unions during this period. size of the work force, and the nature of work itself Many workers were forced to make the transition from skilled to J semiskilled or unskilled labor. The experi- ' ence and skill of such artisans as carpen- ters, silversmiths, and furniture makers no longer gave them any advantage over the unskilled. It took little training to tend a machine. Problems in the Workplace With the growth of industry, the number of factory workers rose from about 900,000 in 1860 to more than 3.2 million in 1890. Industrializa- tion affected many aspects of workers' lives — where they worked and lived, the With machines taking the place of human skills, work became monotonous. Workers concentrated on highly specific, repetitive tasks and could take little pride in the fruits of their labor. As factories increased the efficiency of production, more and more people worked for fewer and fewer employers. The workers began to feel like \"cogs in a wheel.\" Machines were designed to work at a given pace, and the workers had to keep up. Low wages and long hours posed addi- tional burdens for industrial workers. Workdays of 10 to 14 hours were com- mon. Although real wages — wages adjust- ed for inflation — rose more than 10 percent berween 1870 and 1900, the aver- age income remained inadequate. Most industrial workers earned between $400 and $300 a year during the 1890s; $600 was the minimum annual income needed to maintain a decent standard of living. In some industries workers were required to live in company towns, built and run by the companies. The best known was the town of Pullman, Illinois, where every citizen worked lor the Pull- man Palace Car Company. The usual practice was for companies to deduct from the workers' pay money for rent and advances to the company store, as well as medical and fuel fees. Some companies paid their workers in scrip, or company monev, that could only be redeemed at the company store. Added to workers' other problems was the fact that factory work was unhealthful as well as dangerous. Miners breathed coal dust all day. Factory workers breathed sawdust, stone dust, cotton dust, or toxic 556 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America-. 1 860- 1 900"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"fumes. Heavy machines, grouped together on shop and mill floors for the sake of efh- ciency, caused an appallingly high injury rate among workers. An 1884 government report described working conditions tor women in a small factory in Boston: The work is dangerous. . . [they] are hable to get their fingers jammed under the bench, or caught in the die when it comes down to press the parts of the buttons together A man (although not a surgeon) is provided to dress wounds three times for each individual without charge; afterwards, the person injured must pay all expenses. There are 35 machines in use, and accidents are of very frequent occurrence. Children, some as young as six, were regularly employed as factory workers. Throughout the 1800s there were some efforts to restrict child labor but state laws were usually worded in such a way that they could be easily evaded both by employers and by parents who needed the income. In 1885 in New Jersey, there were 340,000 children of school age. About 90,000 of them did not attend school; most worked full-time jobs. Industrial work was neither less difficult nor less dan- gerous for children than it was for adults. As a Pennsylvania newspaper, the Luzerne Union, reported in January 1876: Examining Photographs Young boys often worked as coal sorters in mines for low wages and under dangerous conditions. Wtiy were early efforts to restrict child labor unsuccessful? During the past week, nearly one boy a day has been killed, and the public has become so jamiliar with these calamities that no attention is given them after the first announcement through a newspaper or friend. Always looming was the threat of pay cuts or layofls. Workers were vulnerable to the business cycle — a recurring sequence ot change in business activity. Beginning with a period ot prosperity, business activ- ity declines until a low point, or depres- sion, is reached. A period ot recovery follows when business conditions become more active. A period ot prosperity is again reached. The cycle is then repealed. In the late 1800s, business weni through many such cycles.

Today, union members also include white-collar and college-educated members: teachers, musicians, retail workers, and radio and television artists.

What were the difficulties that unions encountered in organizing Immi- grants? their wages slashed during depressions of 1873, 1882, and 1893. Workers looked to labor unions for protection. The Revival of Labor Unions The growth of labor unions during the early 1800s had been h;ilting and sporadic, but conditions during the Civil War spurred the revival of unionism. With hun- dreds of thousands of workers serving in the army, unions were in a strong position to demand better pay. During the war, the number of local unions rose dramatically. To strengthen local unions, labor also began to organize on a national scale. In spite of rapid growth during the Civil War and afterward, labor unions faced serious difficulties, including the mobility and diversity of the American labor force. Workers who did not \"stay hitched,\" but moved from job to job were difficult to organize. The constant influx of large numbers of immigrants — averag- ing more than one-third of a million a year between 1870 and 1900 — also pre- sented a problem. Differences in lan- guage, religion, and customs among the immigrants made it hard to unite them into an effective union. Another problem was that different labor leaders had different goals. Some leaders envisioned uniting all workers into one large union in order to promote widespread reforms. Others believed that unions should be organized by particular crafts or industries, and work only for short-term benefits. Unions also faced strong opposition from employers. Workers were often required to take oaths swearing they would not join a union. If found to have been involved in union activity, a worker would be fired and often could not get another job because of blacklists, or records kept by employers of \"trouble- makers.\" Once blacklisted, a laborer could get a job only by changing residence, trade, or even name. Another way employers retaliated against union orga- nizing in a workplace was the lockout — whereby the factory was shut down — or by firing union members and hiring scabs, or replacement workers. In any lockout or strike, the odds favored employers. Few unions had enough money to support their members through the long period of unemployment caused by a strike. Labor unions also had to fight public opinion.

Only infrequently did public opinion condemn employers when labor disputes resulted in violence. This happened during the Homestead lockout in 1892, when the Carnegie Steel Company hired a private army of 300 Pinkerton detectives armed with repeating rifles. Generally, however, labor unions were held responsible when disorder occurred. Another problem for unions was that law enforcement agencies usually sided with the employers. Employers suffered no penalties for lockouts and blacklists. Union strikes and boycotts, on the other hand, were judged to be \"conspiracies in restraint of trade,\" for which labor leaders miglu be jailed or fined. Cx)ntracts between employers and unions were not usually enforceable by law. When violence occurred, or was even threatened, the police — and sometimes armed troops — were sent to the aid of employers. Railroad Strike of 1 877 Despite these obstacles, labor unions survived — sometimes just barely. Union membership fluctuated according to busi- ness conditions. Following the panic of 1873, 5,000 businesses closed, causing widespread unemployment and homeless- ness. Union membership dropped from more than 300,000 to 50,000. Three mil- lion workers were unemployed. At this time there were no unemployment or relief benefits available from either the state or federal government, liamps and hobos roamed the countryside; workers' rallies to demand relief were suppressed by mounted police.

As other railroads cut wages, the strike spread to Chicago and beyond. In city after city, strikers seized and sometimes destroyed railroad property. In Pittsburgh alone the Pennsylvania Rail- road lost 2,000 cars, 25 locomotives, 2 roundhouses, and a railroad station. At the height of the strike, more than one- half of the freight on the nation's 76,000 miles of track had stopped running. Troops and workers clashed in the streets of Martinsburg, West Virginia, as well as Pittsburgh and Baltimore. Although the clashes were usually spontaneous, newspa- pers viewed them collectively as: . . . an insurrection, a revolution, an attempt of Communists and vagabonds to coerce society, and endeavour to undermine American institutions. This reaction was indicative of the extent to which a smoothly running rail- road system had become central to the economic health ol the nation. In several cities order was restored only after Presi- dent Rutherford B. Hayes had sent in fed- eral troops. But Hayes himself was troubled. He felt railroad officials had brought on the crisis by their own ruthless actions. The President confided in his diary, \"Shall the railroads govern the country or shall the people govern the railroads? \" When the railroad strike was over, more than 100 persons were dead, 1,000 had been jailed, and 100,000 workers had gone on strike. In addition, there was such fear of violent revolution that state militia were reorganized. National guard armories were built in many large cities as fortresses, where troops could hold out against strikers if necessary. Union leaders learned ftom the strike that they were not united or strong enough to defeat the powerful combination of business and government.

Moreover, they suffered unemployment during declines in the business cycle. Labor orga- nizers were hampered by the diversity of the workers, differing goals of organizers, public opinion, decreasing membership during hard economic times, and opposi- tion from employers. Law enforcement agencies generally supported employers against the unions, breaking up strikes with troops and police. Even so, workers showed their strength during the railroad strike of 1877, nearly bringing the nation's railway system to a standstill.

Often a man did not so mud) work for his family as he did for his boss. Further, working conditions and pay were often a source of discontent. Labor unions began to organize, and although their intent was to lend support to exploited employees, it often made workers feel they were helpless to take care of themselves. a. Locate and list in order of appearance (he main ideas expressed in the material: America experienced a shift from an agriculture-based economy to an industrial- based economy. This change required a shift away from selt- determinism. • Men at city jobs worked to please a boss, not their fam- ilies; yet they were unhappy with work- ing conditions and pay. • Labor unions made workers feel they were helpless to take care of themselves. b. Summarize by rewriting the main ideas in your own words: The shift from agri- culture to industry caused many to feel they were not as self-reliant as they had been in the past. Now they worked to please a boss, even though they were unhappy with pay and working conditions. Even labor unions caused people to feel they were too reliant on the union and not enough on themselves.

When little was done to improve their lot, workers in growing numbers came to accept the idea of forming new, better organized unions. Two important organizations were the Knights of Labor and the American Fed- eration of Labor. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify two of the strongest labor unions of the late 1800s. • Evaluate the gains labor unions achieved during this period. As industrialization was an urban phenomenon, so, too, were unions. Those states with the highest percentage of workers in industry had the greatest urban popula- tions. It was in these industrial areas of the North and the Midwest that a score ot new labor organizations were established in the late 1860s. By tar the most influen- tial was the Noble Order of the Knights ot Labor. Founded in 1869, the Knights ol Labor attempted to bring all laboring people — skilled and unskilled, black and white, men and women, white-collar and blue-collar — into one big union. The Knights of Labor and the AFL Unions At the head of the Knights of Labor was Terence V. Powderly, an immigrant who rose from a railway switchtender to mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania. An eloquent speaker and tireless organizer, Powderly had great hopes for the Knights: We seek and intend to enlist the services of men of every society, or every party, and every religion, and every nation in the crusade ive have inaugurated against those twin monsters, tyranny and monopoly. Powderly persuaded the Knights to sup- port equal pay for women, temperance, the abolition of child labor, and above all, the establishment of cooperatively owned industrial plants. A man of peace, he opposed strikes and wished to submit labor disputes to arbitration, that is, a process whereby an impartial third party helps workers and management reach an agreement. Membership in the Knights grew rapid- ly in the early 1880s — especially after the striking Knights won against Jay Gould's Wabash Railway. Membership in the Knights soared from 100,000 in 1885 to 700,000 in less than a year. Conservative newspapers feared that Powderly, the \"labor czar,\" would become stronger than the President. The Knights of Labor, however, were soon swamped with troubles. The union had wasted its funds in unsuccessfiil attempts to set up cooperative businesses. Moreover, the effort to unite different kinds of labor into one big union had tailed. Workers in different crafts and industries often had little in common with one another and little interest in working for the same goals. 562 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"Examining Illustrations Membership In the Knights of Labor was open to men and women of all races. Here, Frank Farrell (left) Introduces Ter- ence Powderly, the founder of the union, at the Knights' tenth annual convention. What alms did the union strive to achieve for Its members? The decline of the Knights was has- tened by the Haymarket Square riot in Chicago on May 4, 1 886. This event fol- lowed a peaceful meeting of some 3,000 workers who gathered together to protest the shooting of striking McCormick Har- vester Company workers by the police. As the meeting was breaking up, someone threw a bomb into a group of police offi- cers. Seven persons were killed and more than 60 were injured. Although the iden- tity of the bomb-thrower was never estab- lished, 8 anarchist leaders were arrested .uid lound guilty of taking part in the crime. Four were later executed for mur- der. Although the Knights of Labor could in no way be held responsible for the Haymarket affair, it became identified with radicals and violence. From then on, the Knights of Labor declined as rapidly as it had grown. In 1886, the year the Knights of Labor began to decline, the American Federation of Labor was organized. In its principles as well as its structure, the AFL differed greatly from the Knights. While the Knights had accepted a large number of imskilled workers, the AFL accepted only skilled workers. This policy indicated the reluctance of the AFL to accept women, African Americans and immigrants — the majority of whom were unskilled — into their union. Another difference was that the AFL organized workers into separate unions, each covering a particular craft. F.ach union managed its own affairs with only occasional help from the national organization. The AFLs fees were relatively high, in order to restrict mem- bership, build up strike funds, and pro- vide benefits to members and their families in cases of sickness, unemploy- ment, or death.

What effect did the Haymarket Affair have on the labor movement? in London, Gompers brought to the United States some of the ideas of British trade unions, the best estabhshed in the world. Gompers, who prided himselt on being practical, was interested only in day-to-day gains of AFL members — high- er wages, shorter hours, and benefits tor disabled workers. So effective was the organization and leadership of the AFL that when hard times hit again in 1893, its member unions not only survived but thrived. Between 1890 and 1900, when other labor organizations lost members, AFL membership rose from 190,000 to 500,000. The Pullman Strike of 1894 To address the needs of unskilled and semiskilled labor — and yet avoid the \"one big union\" approach favored by the Knights — a new type of labor organiza- tion developed. This was the industrial union, in which all classes of workers in a single industry are joined together. Among those who saw the advantages of an industrial union was Eugene V. Debs, an officer of the Brotherhood of Locomo- tive Firemen, one of several railway unions. He felt that the separation of railway workers into different unions weakened their power. Conductors and engineers, the \"aristocracy of labor,\" looked down on less skilled and lower paid workers, and the unskilled had no organization at all. Debs, therefore, start- ed a new organization in 1893 — the American Railway Union. This union included all types of railroad workers — from conductors, firemen, and engineers to telegraph operators and station clerks. By 1894 the union was powerful enough to force James J. Fiill, the owner of the Great Northern Railway, to restore wage cuts to his employees. Hardly had the Great Northern strike ended than the Pullman strike began in Pullman, Illinois, the company town built by George M. Pullman for his workers. Losing profit because of a reduced demand for its railroad cars, the Pullman Palace Car Company laid off two-thirds of its employees and cut the wages of the rest. It did not, however, reduce either the dividends it paid to stockholders or the rents charged to workers in the town. When a delegation ol workers met with Pullman to protest the pay cuts, they were fired. At noon the following day, 10,000 Pullman workers walked o(i the job. The American Railway Union took up the Pullman workers' cause. Debs' first move was to propose that the dispute be referred to arbitration. Pullman, however, replied, \"There is nothing to arbitrate. \" Realizing that negotiating with Pullman was futile, the union called for members to refuse to work on any train that includ- ed a Pullman car. Railway workers answered the union's call. Within 5 days 100,000 railroad workers had walked ofiF the job. Railway traffic west of Chicago was almost paralyzed. Debs warned his followers not to interfere with the mail and appealed to them to be \"orderly and law-abiding.\" A lew mail trains were delayed, but there were few disturbances. Then President Grover Cleveland stepped in. Over the protests of the mayor of Chicago and the governor of Illinois, who claimed they had matters in hand, the President sent federal troops to guard mail trains.

Immediately, rioting broke out as angry mobs, sympathetic to the strikers, taunted the soldiers. Members of the American Railway Union kept out of trouble, but nevertheless received the blame. Even before the troops had arrived, the federal government obtained an injunction, or court order, f-orbidding the union to con- tinue the strike. Debs refused to obey the injunction and was imprisoned. Even out- side labor circles there was strong feeling that putting Debs in jail was an unfair extension of judicial power. The Spring- field Republican, noted that: mhUHHUhmmhSJimU Section Two Review If Debs has been violating the law, let him be indicted, tried by a jury, and punished. Let him not be made the victim of an untenable court order and deprived of his liberty entirely within the discretion of a judge. Without Debs' leadership, the Pullman strike collapsed and with it, the American Railway Union. From that point on, employers used the injunction as a means of breaking up strikes. Although labor unions lost more dis- putes than they won, and most workers remained unorganized (only 4 percent of American workers belonged to imions in 1900), workers made some gains in the late 1 80()s. 1-ederal and state legislation reflected the growing political influence of labor. Wages began to increase slowly, and the workday was shortened. Moreover, nearly every state passed laws regulating working conditions and requiring mini- mum standards ol health and safetv. BEE X Summary The Knights of Labor attempted, with only limited success, to bring all skilled and unskilled workers, into one big union. The American Federation of Labor, an association of separate unions, was more successful but excluded unskilled labor. The industrial union included all classes of workers in a given industry. One such union, the American Railway Union, forced the Great North- ern Railway to restore wage cuts. Subse- quently, however, the union collapsed following the arrest of its leader in the Pullman strike. In spite of the unions' difficulties, workers made some short- term gains.

Another 14.5 million came between 1900 and 1915. Even more significant than the increase in numbers was the changing character of immigration during these years. The vast majority no longer came from northern and western Europe but from southern and eastern Europe. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify the reasons that immigrants came to the United States. • Distinguish between the \"old\" and the \"new\" immigration. The 13 colonies had been setded mainly by English setders. Other senders from Holl;ind, Sweden, France, Scodand, Ireland and Germany came later. Afrer 1815, however, increasing numbers ot immigrants started to arrive from Ireland. During these early years, a total of only about 400,000 immi- grants had come to America. Beginning in the 1850s and continuing afrer the Civil War, immigration rose sharply. Tlie \"Old Immigration\" During the period of \"Old Immigra- tion,\" which started in the 1830s and reached a high point in the 1840s, there was a great wave of immigration to Americas shores. Between 1840 and 1850, an additional 1.5 million new- comers journeyed to the United States. Nearly one-half were from Ireland, which was suffering from a potato famine. Between 1846 and 1860, about 1.5 million Irish immigrated to America settling in New York and Boston, which functioned as ports of entry into the United States. In the 1840s large numbers of Ger- mans also began to come to America. Some left their homeland because of crop failures. Others came to escape political persecution after the failure of the Revolution of 1848. Still others were German Jews seeking religious freedom. Large numbers of German immigrants settled on farms and in cities in the Midwest — areas that were rapidly grow- ing and had job opportunities. The Ger- mans gave a distinctive flavor to such cities as Cincinnati, Milwaukee, and St. Louis. Then, in the 1850s, after the Gold Rush, Chinese immigrants began to come to the Pacific Coast. Many were hired to help build the railroads. About 100,000 Chinese had setded in the far West by the mid- 1870s. During the colonial period, most immi- grants were readily accepted. Workers were badly needed in all the colonies. In the 1840s and 1850s, however, some native-born Americans began to resent the newcomers, especially the Irish and Ger- man immigrants. The Irish in particular suffered discrimination. Some Americans resented them because they dressed and sounded \"different\" and because they were Catholics. 566 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"c as \\_ D) E E -a (0 (/) O IMMIGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES, 1861-1920 1861 1865 1870 1875 1880 1885 1890 1895 1900 1905 1910 1915 1920 Northern and Western Europe (chiefly England, Ireland, Germany and Scandanavia) Central and Eastern Europe (includes Russia, Poland, Austria-Hungary and its successor states, Romania) Historical Slatislics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970 (1975) Southern Europe (chiefly Italy but also Greece, Spam, and Portugal) Asia (chiefly Turkey in Asia, China, and Japan in the period covered) _a Canada Latin American and the West Indies (no record of Mexican immigration, 1886-93) Note: Immigration from Africa and Australia seldom reached more than a few hundred persons annually during the period covered. The \"New Immigration\" Until rlie 1880s most newcomets had come from the nations ot western Europe. After 1885, however, large numbers came from nations of southern and eastern Europe. The new immigrants were from Italy, Russia, and Poland, as well as from the nations of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Fhese newcomers were for the most part poor. They hoped to find a bet- ter life in America. In part, it was their labor that made the rapid industriali/ation of the United States possible, lor many lews, Poles, and C}/,cchs immigrating to the United States was the only way for them to escape persecution in their home- land. One Jewish immigrant noted that \"the only hope for the Jews in Russia is to becomt Jews out of Russia.\" The new immigrants flocked to the cities.

Life of the Times Italian Cuisine Between 1890 and 1910 about 2.7 mil- lion southern Italians immigrated to the United States. Coming from farms in Italy, they settled primarily in the cities on America's east coast. By 1920 New York City had become home to more Italians than there were living in Venice, Genoa, and Florence combined. Italian- Americans adjusted to many changes in their adopted country, and they adapted their cooking to substitute some more readily available ingredients. These Italian dishes became a lasting con- tribution to American culture. Pasta was enjoyed by everyone, sometimes sev- eral times a week. Maca- roni, manicot- ti, spaghetti, and lasagna were first intro- duced to Americans by the little shops nestled among the blocks of tenements. Often macaroni or some other form of noo- dles could be seen drying in the windows. Italian bakery ovens produced the first pizzas, which had been a strictly Neapolitan item back in Italy. Opening in 1905, \"G Lombardi\" on Spring Street in New York's Little Italy became the first known pizzeria in the United States. Deep-dish, Chicago-style pizza, cooked in a black skillet, did not come along until 194.3, when it was created by Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo at Pizzeria Uno in Chicago. After World War II, the pizza industry boomed in the United States. Within 10 years there were few cities that did not have at least one pizzeria. into American life. Some people, especial- ly workers, blamed them for low wages. Others resented that many immigrants were Catholics or Jews. The railroad strike of 1877 and the Haymarket Square riot of 1886 resulted in many people's fear of immigrants who, it was thought, believed in socialism and anarchism. A few politicians, notably Sen- ator Henry Cabot Lodge of Mas- sachusetts, were strongly reactionary in their response to the issue of immigration. They wanted immigration from southern and eastern Europe to be stopped com- pletely. In 1896 Lodge argued for a bill that would exclude all prospective immi- grants who could not read or write 25 words of the United States Constitution in some language. Lodge concluded that such a test would: . . . bear most heavily upon the Italians, Russians, Poles, Hungarians, Greeks, and Asiatics. . . races most affected by the test are those whose emigration has. . . swelled rapidly. . . . and who are most alien to the great body of he United States. 568 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"Examining Photographs During the late 1800s. \"new\" Immigrants poured into the United States, braving the long and difficult journey to start a new life. Why did many people perceive these newcomers as a threat? In the late 1800s, hostility toward many of the new racial and ethnic groups com- ing into the new country grew. The differ- ences in the customs, dress, and language oi the new arrivals created a basic distrust of the foreign born by many native-born Americans. Some historians believe that this reaction was a response to the rapid changes occurring in America because of industrialization. For those native-born Americans who were uncertain and dis- turbed by social change, immigrants became easy targets of hostility. Some Americans formed groups to counter what they considered the immi- grant threat. One of these groups, the American Protective As.sociation, was founded in 1887 to protest the large number of C^atholic immigrants. In some parts of the country, local laws were passed that prohibited immigrants from holding certain kinds of jobs and denied them other rights. Jewish immigrants, for example, were denied admission to some universities. In addition, the immigrants faced actual physical attacks. The anti-immigration movement was not limited to groups such as the Ameri- can Protective Association. Some well- known scholars of the time were suscepti- ble to these feelings as well. Historian and future-President Woodrow Wilson and frontier historian Frederick Jackson Turn- er lamented the lessening flow of immi- gration from northern Europe and the rise in numbers of \"inferior stocks'coming to America.

By the end of the 1870s, there were almost 75,000 Chinese in California alone. Their willingness to work for low wages prompt- ed a violent anti-Chinese movement among the white workers of California. Such feelings intensified during hard eco- nomic times. During the depression that followed the panic of 1873, unemployed workers in California attacked the Chinese. Some Americans began to demand that Chinese immigrants be excluded from the United States. In 1879 Congress forbade the import- ing of foreign workers under contract — a kiw aimed primarily at the Chinese. Then, in 1882, Congress, responding to pressure from the western states, suspended nearly all immigration Irom China for 10 years.

In the 1880s, immigrants began arriving from southern and eastern Europe. Their labor made rapid industri- alization possible, but some Americans blamed immigrants for keeping wages low. They tended to cluster in ethnic neighborhoods, maintaining their own language and customs.

Railroads crisscrossed the continent. Where farms once stood, factories spewed forth black smoke. Thousands of Americans left the nation's farms hoping to make their for- tunes in the city. Millions of immigrants came to better their lives and share in the benefits of the new industrial age. Obj- ectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify the factors that led to the growth of cities during the late 1800s. • List the problems resulting from an increase in the urban population. A II over the nation — but cspc- ci.illv in ihc Northeast — cities were growing rapidly. This .urban growth was a result of indiistriali/ation. In 1840, one out ol every 12 Americans lived in a city with a pofnihuion of more than 8,000. By 1900, however, one out ot every three Americans lived in a large city. Why were so many people attracted to the cities? One reason was that rising new industries held out the promise ot jobs and opportunity. Where else could immigrants — or other Ameri- cans lor that matter — fulfill the \"rags to riches\" dream of making a fortune overnight? The cities of the 1890s held the promise of excitement and activit)' in contrast to the isolation ol rural farm life. There were bright lights, running water, modern plumbing, museums, libraries, theaters, shops, convenient transporta- tion, and countless things to do and see. City people found in the noises, the crowds, the excitements a charm they were unable to resist. Urbanization Between 1860 and 1900 American urban areas grew twice as last as the total population. Chicago, which in the 1830s had been a frontier town with a few hun- dred residents, became a vast metropolis of almost 2 million people. New York became the second-largest city in the world. The day dreaded by Thomas Jef- ferson — when Americans would abandon farm life — was clearly on the way. The new industrial cities were essential- ly the product of the mines, the factories, the steamships, and the railroads. New cities appeared, or old ones mushroomed, near coal and iron deposits (Birmingham and Pittsburgh), near sources of water power (Lowell and Lawrence, Mas- sachusetts), shipping centers (Baltimore and New York City), and at railroad cen- ters (Omaha and Chicago). Once established, cities seemed to gen- erate their own growth. To serve industry, such facilities as banks, insurance compa- nies, docks, and warehouses were devel- oped. Ihesc, in turn, attracted more industry and workers. Immigrants, lack- ing the agricultural skill or money to buy a farm, could often find employment only in urban industriali/.ed areas.

But by then peace had become her passion. In 1915 Addams urged Euro- pean leaders to find a way to end the mounting carnage. When the United States entered the war, she was labeled unpatriotic for holding true to her pacifist ideals. After the war ended in 1918, Addams worked to assure no repetition of the \"war to end all wars.\" She was elected president of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom in 1915 and held that office until 1929. Her devotion to world peace was recognized in 1931, when she was named corecipi- ent with educator Nicholas Murray Butler of the Nobel Peace Prize. real-estate speculators. People poured into the cities faster than housing could be built to accommodate them. Many had no choice but to live in tenements, poorly constructed five- or six-story buildings that housed many families. Many of the rooms had no windows and were often dark, narrow, and airless. As more and more people were crowded together and the buildings began to dete- riorate, city slums developed. Lacking proper sanitation, tenements became foul- smelling and vermin-infested. Typhoid and other epidemic diseases often spread rapidly. Other city services besides housing were inadequate. There was a shortage of police and firefighters. City water was impure and the sewers were often clogged. Garbage collection was sporadic. In addi- tion, there were no attempts at city plan- ning. Little was done to provide for open spaces, parks and playgrounds, or to take advantage of rivers and other natural fea- tures. The few open spaces were more often than not used as garbage dumps or simply left vacant, where a scanty growth of grass and weeds competed with cinders and tin cans. Rivers and harbors were polluted by sewage and factory wastes, and the air was made foul by smoke from thousands of chimneys. In many ways the new environ- ment seemed a sort of prison, cutting off people from sun, air, and natural beauty. The growth of cities created many prac- tical and social problems. There was, for example, a demand for new sources of water, as wells and brooks provided too scanty a supply and were often polluted. New York City, the first of the major cities to meet this problem head-on, built the Croton Aqueduct 25 miles outside the city limits. Another issue that had to be addressed was transportation. Cities had become so large in area that a more efficient means of inter-city transportation had to be developed. This was accomplished by the horse car, and later by the elevated rail- way, trolley car, and subway. The demand for space in preferred localities such as Will Street in New York or the Loop in Chicago resulted in the creation of huge 572 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1 860- 1 900"},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"skyscrapers, which, in turn, added a verti- cal dimension to transportation — in the form of the elevator. An unexpected problem ol urban Hte, however, was the increase in crime. Until the rise of the city, there had naturally been occasional violence and theft, but never on a scale demanding an organized police force. There had been nothing resembling modern police until the for- mation of the Metropolitan Police of Lon- don, known as \"bobbies,\" about 1830. But because the problems experienced by growing urban centers were new, old solu- tions could not be relied upon. Indeed, sometimes it seemed as if the answers were as varied as the problems. Some peo- ple looked back to an earlier morality. Especially pious people sought to enforce the Puritan Sabbath as a means of regen- erating the city. As a result, restaurants and amusement places were closed, and there were even efforts to forbid the run- ning of trains and streetcars. Such reactions, however, seemed out ol touch with the realities of lite in factories, shops, and slums. One of those who did face these realities was Jacob A. Riis (REES), a l^anish-American police reporter for New York newspapers. In the course of his work, Riis had seen again and ag.iin ihe coniuxiion beivvecii slums and human degradation. In 1890 he focused public attention on the ill-effects of slum-living in a best-selling book. How the Other Half Lives. By appealing to pub- lic conscience, Riis secured legislation that reduced the worst slum conditions, along with other measures that improved the lives of city dwellers, such as playgrounds for schools. Among his close friends was a rising young Republican politician, Theodore Roosevelt, whom he \"educated\" by taking him into tenements, sweat- shops, and jails. The year before How the Other Half Lives was published, Jane Addams found- ed in a Chicago slum, the most famous settlement house in the United States, Hull House. About this neighborhood, Addams wrote: [ rihe streets were inexpressibly dirty. . . the street lighting bad. . . .

Above all, Addams was interested in helping children, believing that \"a fence at the top of a precipice is better than an ambulance at the bottom.\" To that end, Addams surrounded herself with young people glad to enlist in a war against human suffering. Religious conviction and the desire to serve humanity were also the motivating forces behind the founding of other settle- ment houses, including the Henry Street Settlement in New York City, the Santa Maria Institute in Cincinnati, and South End House in Boston. In addition to providing immediate services to neighbor- hood people, settlement houses were schools where hundreds of men and women learned social responsibilit)'. Many of these people later entered poli- tics and helped to promote reform legisla- tion, either as lobbyists or as officeholders. \"Graduates'\" of Hull House, for example, were instrumental in securing the first play- grounds in Chicago, better garbage collec- tion, and the first Illinois factory inspection law. Frances Perkins, trained in a New York settlement house, embarked on a political career that led to her appointment as Secre- tary of Labor, the first woman in the Presi- dent's cabinet. Beautifying the City Among the indictments against sprawling industrial cities were their ugliness and their lack of provision for rest and recreation. Architects and landscape designers were 574 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"among those who sought remedies. In 1876 New York City opened Central Park, designed by Frederick L. Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, as \"a great breathing space for the toiling masses. \" Olmsted was the first person to use the term landscape architect as the name for this kind ot work. He also designed Prospect Park in Brooklyn. Many other cities followed New York's example. In 1892 and 1893 Chicago cele- brated the 400th anniversary of European arrival in America by putting on a great World's Fair. The fairgrounds were designed by Olmsted, who turned \"a rough, tangled stretch of bog and dune\" along Lake Michigan into a gleaming \"White City,\" with buildings in the classi- cal style surrounded by lagoons and land- scaped grassy areas. The Chicago Columbian Exposition revealed that American architecture was emerging from the period of ignorance and bad taste into which it had fallen earlier in the 1 800s. The best American architects now thoroughly understood European styles and adapted them for modern use. The firm of McKim, Mead, and White used the Italian Renaissance style in their design tor the Boston Public Library. Henry Richardson adapted Romanesque style in his design tor churches, libraries, warehous- es, and even department stores. Two notable examples ot his style are Trinity Church in Boston and the Marshall Field's department store in Chicago. The Transportation Building at the Chicago Exposition, designed by Louis Sullivan, did not, however, imitate earlier styles. Sullivan preached a new concept: \"Form tollows function.\" By that he meant that the architect should create designs that reveal a building's purpose and method ot construction. Sullivan was one ot the first architects to design skyscrapers. His influence, both directly and later through the work of his pupil Frank Lloyd Wright, reached worldwide.

Hung from great steel cables with a span half again as long as that of any previ- ous bridge, it was designed and constructed by two German-Americans, John Roebling and his son Washington Roebling. During the project John was killed on the job. His son continued directing the work until he himself was injured. The work was then taken over by John's wife, who with her son's direction, completed the project. Examining Photographs Before 1880 buildings rarely were higher than five stories. Skyscrapers such as the Flatlron Building In New York transformed America 's cities. What did architects mean by \"form follows function\"? For those who wished to continue their education, American cities provided opportunities that had never existed before. Perhaps the most important agen- cies promoting adult education were improved public libraries. In 1876 the American Library Association was found- ed to encourage \"the best reading for the largest number at the least expense. \" By 1900, the public libraries, which receive support from taxes, revenues, and private donations, came to be recognized as \"no less important than the schoolhouse in the system of popular education. \" To meet the needs ot the hundreds of thousands of workers in the nation's industrial cities, new means of merchan- dising, or the buying and selling oi goods, were created. One striking example was the department store. Stores such as A. T. Stewart and John Wanamaker were retail centers where nearly all kinds of goods were sold in one location. These stores had an enormous appeal to people of all classes, particularly women. Here the working class could mix freely with those who were better ott, and be, at least for a short time, on an equal footing with them. As a result, the downtown areas of cities became centers where women came to shop. Merchants who wanted this new business were active in making sure that the areas were kept clean and attractive. New streets, sidewalks, and buildings were constructed. Despite some setbacks, achievements were made solving some of the problems facing major cities. The availability of electricity enabled shops and factories to remain open after dark and thus stimulat- ed urban nightlife as well. And municipal governments and private organizations made gains in their efforts to solve some of the public-health problems that accom- panied the rapid growth of the cities. Throughout the late 1800s city govern- ments turned their efforts toward provid- ing the services needed for their citizens. Steps were taken to reduce crime and to improve recreational opportunities and living conditions. Methods of identifying criminals, such as the use of photographs, were improved. Electric street lights added a large measure of safety on city streets. 576 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"Many parks were built, usually toward the edges of already congested cities. Public utilities provided electricity, clean water, and sewage services for many urban areas. By 1898 approximately 350 communities had built public owned electric light companies, and by 1900 more than 3,500 public waterworks had been constructed nationwide. The need for better communication accompanied the growth for better urban- ization and industrialization. As a result the use of the telephone spread rapidly. Within a tew years after the telephone was invented in 1876, telephone exchanges were established in more than 80 cities. Within 20 years, nearly 800,000 tele- phones were in use throughout the Unit- ed States, twice as many as were in use in Europe. The impact of the telephone upon American life was enormous, linking many ot the urban and rural areas of the nation almost instantly. Despite these changes for the better, many reformers felt that this was only a start and that it was essential to find solu- tions for problems before they occurred. More and more reformers urged govern- ment to deal with the causes of social and economic problems. Jacqueline Shaw Lowell, the founder of the New York Charity Organization Society, expressed this attitude when she noted: [There are] five hundred thousand wage earners in this city, 200,000 of them women, and 75, 000 of those working under dreadfid conditions If the working people had all they ought to have, we should not have the paupers and the criminals It is better to save them before they go under than to spend your life. . . taking care of them afterwards. fllTHIIITIIflllllll Section Four Review XKXXSXIX!

Unionizing was hampered by employers, the public, and workers themselves. Even so, workers made their presence felt during a violent railroad strike in 1877. Two early labor unions were the Knights of Labor, one big union, and the American federation of Labor, an association of separate unions. These were followed by the American Railway Union, which took in all railroad industry-related workers. Despite difficulties in gaining their objectives, union activities eventually won some concessions in wages, hours, and conditions for their members. Immigration from Northern and Western Europe gave way to new arrivals from Southern and Eastern Europe in the later 1 800s. As always, immigrants were driven by old fears and new hopes. Although con- tributing much to Americas rapid industrialization, the tendency of the newer immigrants to keep to themselves created tensions with native-born Ameri- cans. Cities became a place to live and work for more people. However, the attractions of jobs and conve- niences were soon outweighed by the drawbacks of slums, crime, and pollution. Gradually, efforts were made to improve living conditions, recreational opportunities, and the appearance of cities, although poverty only became more visible. * Using Vocabulary Use the following terms in sentences or short para- graphs.

Scandinavian Americans are stereo- typed as lacking a sense of humor. Likewise, Italians are stereotypically members of the Mafia. A stereotype is a way of thinking about a person or group of people that follows a fixed pattern and cioes not allow for individual differences. Stereotyping is harmful because it portrays people as having only one trait and lacking in the depth that \"real\" people have. Also most stereotypes are negative and can lead to prejudice and discrimination. Example Two methods can be used to help you rec- ognize sicreotypes in written material. One is to exam- ine your sources and note the practices of the author or characters in them. I'rom these practices, you can determine whether or not their views arc stereotypic. For example, your text states that \"Conductors and engineers, the 'aristocracy of labor,' looked down on less skilled and lower paid workers. \" The less skilled workers were often recent immigrants who did not speak English well or understand local customs. How- ever, they were stereotyped as being coarse, less intelli- gent, and unable to do the more skilled jobs. The other method of recognizing stereotypes is to examine your source for the expression of a stereotype. A good way to check this is to look for absolutes (use of the word all): \"All Irish immigrants are drunkards\", or \"All librarians are stuffy and boring. \" Practice Read the examples below and, using the methods described above, decide whether or not they include stereotyping. Give reasons for your decisions. l.The following is a fictional statement by an Ameri- can factory owner: \"I would never hire a union member. All union members are troublemakers. Once they join the tinion, they are no longer dependable workers.\" 2. The following is a statement by a citizen who voted against President John F. Kennedy in the 1960 elec- tion: \"The U.S. should never have a Catholic as its president. All Catholics are puppets of the Pope.\" 3. The following statement is from a speech by Martin Luther King, African-American civil-rights leader during the 1950s and 1960s: \"The marvelous new militancy (among African Americans) must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers. . .have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. ... 1 his offense we share. . .must be carried forth by a biracial army.

Don't we find them selling articles cheaper? We do not need to trust the modern moralist to tell us those things.

Plunkitt New York City politician, 1905 Section Focus The voters of this postwar era swarmed to the polls, at the rate of 80 percent of all those eligible. The grass-roots level was a tar more active center for political activ- ity than nationally. Indeed, the voting public practiced their right out of necessi- ty — with thousands of jobs handed out to political allies and votes bartered for ordinary needs of citizens, political par- ticipation became a matter of survival. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify the major causes of increased political corruption in the post-Civil War era. • Give examples of corruption at local state, and national levels. J The Gilded Age was a phrase coined by two authors of the period — Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner — in a novel about the corrupt years of the Grant administration. They saw this era as a time when politicians were irrespon- sible, loyalties were shallow, and money was tainted. In this post-Civil War period, the most ambitious and talented people were no . longer attracted to politics but to busi- ness. Indeed, politics itself became some- thing of a business. The goal of political entrepreneurs was to achieve power and position through political office. Quite often politicians were also able to line their pockets with money as a result. Cor- ruption appeared to flourish at evety level of government. Political Machines Some of the most outrageous examples of graft, or thievery in office, were those at the grass-roots level of city government. A major factor that contributed to corrupt city government was the rapid growth of cities. In 1840 there were only 131 cities in the United States; by 1880 there were 939. In addition, cities often doubled, tripled, or even quadrupled in size within a single decade. Services for these large populations had to be expanded at a rate that had never been experienced before. Providing increased police and fire protec- tion, water supplies, and sewage disposal was a daunting task for what often were untrained and ill-paid city officials. At the same time, businesses were eager to get lucrative contracts for paving streets and building new schools. The result was an alliance between business and politics that fostered corruption. The usual democratic restraints on abuses of power did not work well in the cities of this era. Large portions of the population of cities were immigrants who had little or no experience with democrat- ic government. Many were accustomed to corruption in government. Both poor immigrants and native-born resi- dents alike had little time to worty about abstract notions of government. They worked from dawn to dusk just to keep food on the table. Those more well-off, who might have gone into politics, were busy making money in business and real estate. As a result, almost every major city 582 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1 860- 1 900"},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"was dominated by a political machine — a party-linked political organization that maintained power by controUing votes, controlling the courts, and controlling the police as well. The strength of a political machine came from the bottom up, not from the top down. Local politicians took care ot the needs of their voters. They ofren pro- vided groceries to families who were needy, organized free celebrations on important national holidays, attended ethnic religious and social events, and even helped get peo- ple out of jail. In this way politicians earned the loyalty of their neighborhood citizens. When election time came around, the votes were always there, keeping the helpful politicians in power. The most notorious city machine was the \"Tweed Ring\" in New York City. In 1868 \"Boss\" William M. Tweed gained control of New York's Democratic machine, known locally by the name of its central meeting place — \"Tammany Hall.\" For the next 3 years, he and his underlings managed to steal millions of dollars of city funds. The usual way this was done involved a process known as the \"kickback.\" A kickback was an arrangement whereby contractors would pad, or increase, the amount of their bills for city work, and pay or \"kickback\" a percentage of that amount to politicians in the ring. In one example, a county courthouse that should have cost taxpay- ers $250,000 actually cost $11 million. One plasterer was paid almost $3 million for 9 months' work. In 1871 The New York //>«« published evidence of Tweed's rampant greed. At the same time, Thomas Nast, a brilliant polit- ical cartoonist, ridiculed Tweed in his car- toons for Harper's Weekly. Nast's cartoons found their mark and were devastating. Tweed was dtiven to complain: \"1 don't care a straw for your newspaper articles: my people don't know how to read, but ihcy cant help seeing them... pictures. Tweed and his cronies were ultimately convicted <>( (.rimiiial (.ondiiLt ami driven irom office. In spite of Tweed s removal, laminany Hall continueil to be an active influence in New York politics. This was true because local machine leaders drew their power from the local neighborhoods that they served 24 hours a day. A good deal of the graft, however, was used to help needy residents of the neighborhood wards, or small administrative divisions of a city. As Henry Adams, grandson of John Quincy Adams, described it: . . . The Tammany district leader. . . keeps watch not only on the men but also on the women and children; knows their needs, their likes and dislikes, their troubles and their hopes Is it any wonder that scandals do not permanently disable Tammany and that it speedily recovers from what seems to be crushing defeat'! Occasionally city graft became so fla- grant that voters were driven to \"throw the rascals out\" and put in a reform administration. Such movements often failed. Reform candidates focused on economy and honest administration but failed to understand the reasons why the political machines commandeered so much loyalty and met with such success. Widespread Corruption Politics at the state level was nearly as corrupt as in the cities. In many states big business stood to gain or lose tremendous amounts of money as a result of legislative voles on various matters, ranging Irom lax rates to internal improvements. Accord- ingK', companies spent large sums to influence legislators' votes. In pre-Civil War times, businesspeople influenced politicians by writing letters and inviting ihcm to expensive dinners. After the war the demands on government increased to the point ihai ihe amouni of money spent by state governments was (\"maim IK 20 'Till (Ji \\M\\^ A(;e S83"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"Linking Across Time American Political Participation By the time of the Gilded Age, the pool of citizens eligible to vote had expanded consid- erably. In the early days of the Repub- lic, only white, male, property owners over age 2 1 could vote. By the 1850s, property — and in some states religious — restric- tions had disap- peared and most white adult males could vote.

Businesses now began to employ lob- byists — people paid to represent a com- pany or special interest group. Sometimes they tried to influence votes by offering money in the form of campaign contribu- tions. If it was unclear who would win a race, contributions were given to both parties. Such payments were regarded by legislators and lobbyists alike as \"insur- ance\" against unfavorable legislation. At other times money was offered in the form of outright bribes. When Jay Gould controlled the Erie Railroad, he was reported to have spent $500,000 in bribes during a single session of the New York state legislature. Ol the relations between the Standard Oil Company and the government of Pennsylvania, one observer wrote, \"The Standard has done everything with the Pennsylvania legisla- ture except to refine it.\" In general there was more corruption in state and local politics than in national politics. Nonetheless, corruption did exist. By far the worst misconduct in the federal government occurred during the administration of President Grant. Grant had been a great general, but he was a poor President. Although he was personally honest, he seemed unable to distinguish decent people from the dis- honest. Dazzled by wealth, he fell under the sway ol the financial speculators James J. Fisk and Jay Goidd, who reaped millions of dollars from their relationship with the President. Members of Grant's family, personal staff, and Cabinet ped- dled influence and jobs in return for cash. At one time Grants brother managed to hold four jobs by farming out the duties to other men. In 1872 the scandals spread to Congress as well. A New York newspaper revealed that officers of the Union Pacific Railroad had formed their own construction com- pany called the Credit Mobilier. The con- tracts this company received enabled the railroad officers to reap enormous personal profits.

Postwar Political Parties In The American Commonwealth, British author James Bryce found it diffi- cult to explain the positions Democrats and Republicans took on major issues such as the tariff and railroad regulation. He wrote: Neither party has, as a party, anything to say on these issues; neither party has any clean-cut principles All has been lost except office or the hope oj it. One reason that parties seemed so simi- lar was that their strength was evenly divided. At every level, from wards to townships, or smaller divisions of a coun- ty broken up into local government dis- tricts, political parties were popular, and democratic participation was high. They did not avoid any of the issues; rather, they were split internally on most of them. In the Northeast, for example, with its strong banking system, both parties favored the gold standard. In the Midwest both parties favored increasing the amount of money in circulation. Republicans in the Midwest were protarilf while southern Democrats were antitariff Both parties in the Northeast were divided on the tariff issue. rile humorist \"Mr. Dooley,\" created by Finley Peter Dunne, described a hypothet- ical candidate for President as someone who was pulletl in dilterent thrections by /\" (jiAi'iKR 20 1 ill (111 1)1- 1) Age 385"},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"such varied positions and needed to be a! tilings to all people: Wanted: a good, actwe Dimmycrat, sthrong iv lung an' limb; must he... a sympathizer with th' crushed an down throdden people but not be anny means hostile to vested inthrests; must advocate sthrikes, govermint be injunction, free silver, sound money, greenbacks, a single tax, a tarijf f'r rivinoo. . .at home in Wall sthreet an ' th' stock yards, in th' parlors iv th' r-rich an th' kitchens iv th' poor.

As a group, the Republicans tend- ed to be Protestants of old-immigrant stock — Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Methodists, or Baptists. The great prob- lem of the Republican party was to keep together its eastern and western wings, which were likely to break into open war- fare over such issues as greenbacks, free silver, tariffs, and banking. The Republicans' \"patron saint\" was Abraham Lincoln, whose birthday they honored with banquets and oratory. As the party that had led during the Civil War, they had great prestige in the North and West. \"The party that saved the nation must rule it,\" they proclaimed. While critics attacked the Republicans for keeping alive war hatreds by \"waving the bloody shirt, \" appeals to the memory of the Civil War were much more than that. Republican strength came from gen- uine devotion to the idea of the United States as a nation rather than as a federa- tion of states. Many Republicans contin- ued to be inspired by the party's early idealism. They felt that government exist- ed to advance the public good. Democrats, too, looked back to the Civil War.

The Democrats had allies among western farmers, especially when prices for their crops were low, and among certain groups of businesspeople and owners of import companies who favored a lower tariff. The Democratic party had two \"patron saints\" — Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. Like these leaders, the Democrats claimed to represent the interests of ordinary Americans. The Democrats took issue with the Republican view of the United States as a nation. \"This is no nation,\" said one Democrat. \"We are free and independent states.\" In contrast to the Republicans' view that the federal govern- ment should take an active role in help- ing the needy and shaping national growth, the Democrats wanted to keep the federal government on a skimpy allowance and a short leash. \"That gov- ernment governs best which governs least\" remained their motto, and it appealed to many Americans. The Democrats were so used to being out of office, according to the hinnorist Dooley, that when writing their platform they forgot how to say \"we commend\" but aiuomatically began to \"denounce and deplore. \" During the entire period from 1865 to 1900, Democrats held the presidency for only two terms. Although they usually lost the White House, the Democrats were seldom far oiu of the rimning. Democratic candidates often got almost as many popular votes as their victorious opponents, and it was rare that the Republicans did not have to deal wuh Democrats in control of at least one house of Congress. !«!

Corrup- tion was worst at local levels, where party political machines held power. The Grant administration, too, was shaken when it was discovered that high-ranking officials, including the Vice President and mem- bers of Congress, had accepted bribes.

Under Nast's pen, Tweed and his cronies were depicted as vultures, jailed criminals, and smiling deceivers.

If reformers wanted rebellion, they were dis- appointed; but through their efforts, a slow and steady movement away from the abuses of the Grant administration began to occur. And the first hopeful sign was the election of Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876.

Hayes, one of tlu common practices h.ul lucii patronage — the assiuiicd liglii of elected officials to control political appointments to unelected positions. Moreover, the federal government was die epitome of apathy and astonishingly idle. With the election of Hayes, the tone of national politics began to change. Civil Service Reforms After his inauguration in 1877, Hayes named Carl Schurz, owner of a German- language newspaper in St. Louis, Mis- souri, and U.S. Senator from Missouri, to take charge of the Department of the Interior, which had previously been the scene of some of the worst examples of patronage. The practice was soon curbed. Hayes also forbade the practice of \"shak- ing down\" federal workers — forcing them to make campaign contributions. Hayes also defied congressional leaders by preventing important appointments favored by individual members of Congress. In addition, he refused to sign otherwise acceptable legislation if Congress had attached riders-irrelevant amendments-of which he disapproved. Through his actions, Hayes not only cut down on corruption but began to restore the balance of power between Congress and the presidency.

After Hayes declined to run for a second term, the party became divided between the Stal- warts, who wanted to nominate Grant for a third term, and the \"Halfbreeds,\" who opposed Grant. After a prolonged dead- lock at the National Convention, the Republicans nominated dark horse James A. Garfield, a former Union general. To blunt the old charge of disloyalty in wartime, the Democrats nominated Gen- eral Winfield S. Hancock, a Union hero Susan B. Anthony 1820-1906 From her Quaker upbringing, Susan B. Anthony learned that men and women were equal before God. She spent most of her 86 years trying to convince others of that equality. After teaching school for several years, Anthony returned home to help run the family farm. While living in her father's house, she began to focus on the great reform movements of the day. Anthony first joined a temper- ance group and experienced gender discrimination firsthand when she was refused permission to speak at a tem- perance rally. Realizing that as long as women were properryless and voteless they would also be powerless, Antho- ny began devoting her considerable energies to securing equal rights for women. Throughout the four decades from the end of the Civil War to her death, she was the nation's foremost crusader for women's right to vote. of the battle of Gettysburg. The intellec- tual level ol the ensuing campaign may be judged by the following excerpt from the speech of a Republican orator: / belong to a party that believes in good crops; that is glad when a fellow finds a gold mine; that rejoices when there are forty bushels of wheat to the acre. . . The Democratic party is a party of famine; it is a good friend of an early frost; it believes in the Colorado beetle and in the iveevil. Despite such inflammatory rhetoric, Garfield narrowly won the election. Under Hayes and Garfield, govern- ment was cleaner than it had been during the Grant administration, but the spoils system remained a constant source of inefficiency and sometimes of graft. Dis- putes over patronage poisoned the rela- tionship between the President and Congress. Still, there was little momentum for reform. In July 1881, however, as Presi- dent Garfield entered the Washington, D.C., railroad station, he was shot by a disappointed office seeker. The unbal- anced man cried, \"I am a Stalwart and Arthur is President.\" Garfield clung to life for two months, but in September Vice President Chester A. Arthur, a New York Stalwart, did indeed succeed to the presidency. Garfield's assassination excited public opinion against the spoils system. In 1883 Congress responded to public pres- sure, passing the Pendleton Act, which has been called (with some exaggeration) \"the Magna Carta of civil service reform.\" This law allowed the President to decree which federal jobs would be filled accord- ing to rules laid down by a bipartisan Civil Service Commission. Candidates competed for these jobs through exami- nations, and appointments could be made only from the list of those who 590 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"took the exams. Once appointed, a civil service official could not be removed tor political reasons. Although President Arthur was a vet- eran of machine politics, he supported the Pendleton Act, placing 14,000 jobs (about one-tenth of the total) under the control ot the civil service. The federal government had finally begun a shift away from the spoils system. Cleveland in Office The major theme of the presidential election oi 1884 was honesty in politics. The Republican nominee. Representative James G. Blaine, was a man of great abil- ity and personal charm, but his reputa- tion was clouded by charges that he had taken money in return for helping a rail- road. As a result, some independent reformers in the Republican party, called \"Mugwumps,\" refused to support him. The Democrats won Mugwump support by nominating Grover Cleveland, who earned a reputation for stubborn integri- ty as mayor ot Buffalo and governor of New York. The campaign of 1884 was a negative one, focusing less on issues and more on character assassination. Blaine was por- trayed as a \"tattooed man\" with railroad stocks and bonds indelibly engraved on his skin. Cleveland was attacked on the grounds that he had hired a substitute to fight for him in the Civil War and that he had fathered an illegitimate child. Republicans chanted: Ma! Ma! Where 's my pa? Gone to the White House, Ha! Ha! Ha! To which ihc Hemocrats coimtered: Blahie, lilaiue. James (i. li/a/i/e. The eonti)ieiital liar fro))i the State of Maine.

Had about 600 voters switched to Blaine, he would have won the state — and the presidency. The Republicans retained control of the Senate, but the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives. Unskillful in political maneuvering, Cleveland often met defeat in his dealings with Congress. Nevertheless, his devotion to the public good did much to restore the prestige of the presidency. Cleveland's first problem was to deal with the Demo- cratic officeseekers who swarmed to Washington seeking the fruits of his vic- tory. If he were to make appointments on merit alone, he would split his party wide open. If he were to give in to the spoils system, he would lose the support of the Mugwumps and other reformers who had played a decisive part in electing him. As a compromise, Cleveland appointed many \"deserving Democrats\" to office among the two-thirds of federal offices that changed hands after his elec- tion. He also made every effort to see that the new appointees were qualified for their jobs. Cleveland entered office with a weak understanding of most national issues but worked intensely at the job. Few Presi- dents have put in more study to deter- mine what course of action to follow. His Republican predecessors, for exam- ple, had signed hundreds of private bills giving pensions to veterans unable to qualify imder regular laws. Examining such bills with care, Cleveland found many of them fraudulent. One veteran, for example, asked for a pension for an injury he had suffered while intending to enlist. C]leveland disapproved of so manv private pension bills that his vetoes totaled more than those of all previous Presidents. Cleveland worked to improve govern- ment efficiency and integrity. He sup- ported the Presidential Succession Act, which established a line of succession to the presidency in the event of the death of the Vice President. 1 le also won iipcil of the leiuire of Office Act, which strengilu luil ihe indepeiulence of the Linking Across Time Democrats AND Republicans Grover Cleve- land was the first Democratic Presi- dent elected in 28 years.

Interested in the preservation of public lands, Cleveland reclaimed gov- ernment land from private companies that had not lived up to the terms of their land grants. Tariffs and the Election of 1888 The public question that Cleveland studied most seriously was the tariff During the Civil War, duties had been raised from an average of 19 percent in 1861 to more than 40 percent in 1865. The high rates, which benefited man- ufacturers, were constantly attacked by farmers, consumers, shippers, and importers. These free-traders argued that a protec- tive tariff was unfair government interfer- ence with the normal laws of supply and demand. Tariffs, they said, were subsidies paid to manufacturers out of the pockets of consumers. Protectionists, on the other hand, defended the tariff as a means of nurtur- ing fledgling industries in the United States. They argued that tariffs kept wages high by shielding them from competition with cheap foreign labor. Previous bills to lower the tariff had been defeated. Shortly after he took office, Cleveland was asked to give his opinion on the tariff question. \"You know 1 really don't know anything about it,\" he said. But true to form, Cleveland investigated the problem thoroughly. His studies convinced him that the existing tariff was responsible for the treasury's large surplus. Cleveland argued that the surplus was a sign of over- taxation. He proposed a reduction of the tariff — not because he was a free-trader, but because he was in favor of limited government. Excess money in the trea- sury, he said, was not good for the econo- my; it was a temptation to Congress, which was apt to spend it wastefully. The President's dramatic effort to lower the tariff was blocked by House Republicans. 592 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1 860- 1 900"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"The tariff then became the major issue in the presidential election of 1888. Openly avowing protection tor the first time, the Republicans collected a record- breaking campaign fund. \"Put all the manufacturers of Pennsylvania under the fire,\" said a Republican campaign man- ager, \"and fry that fat out of them.\" The Republicans revived Henry Clay's name for the protective tariff calling their eco- nomic program the \"American system.\" Renominating Cleveland, the Democrats campaigned against unnecessary taxation. As in 1880 and 1884, the result was extremely close. Although he got fewer popular votes than Cleveland, the Repub- lican candidate, Benjamin Harrison, won a majority in the electoral college. The new President was a quiet, reserved man, whom one observer called a \"human iceberg.\" Harrison was, in fact, too reserved to make a good Gilded Age politician. Still, he had an able legal mind and a distinguished career as attorney in Indiana. He was elected to the Senate in 1881. Harrison had fought under Sherman at Atlanta and was not shy about \"waving the bloody shirt\" for votes. An ardent protectionist, he was conservative in fiscal policy and liberal when it came to veter- ans' pensions. Once in office, the Republicans promptly disposed of the treasury surplus by spending it, and it was the last time in history that the government held one. Within two years the \"Billion-Dollar Congress\" had created a deficit, mostly through handouts to special-interest groups. The number of Civil War pen- sioners increased by more than half — many ot them the same ones who Cleveland had turned down.

It dried up revenue by levying rates so high that some foreign products were kept out of the country entirely. Nearly every foreign product that competed with American- made products were heavily taxed, including food, clothing, furniture, and tools. Western silver states supported the tariff in exchange for the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which authorized the federal government to buy up 4.5 million ounces of silver a month. Millions were spent on the improve- ment ot harbors and waterways, coastal defenses, federal buildings, and naval expansion. In addition to these measures. Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act and provided for admission to the Union of North and South Dakota, Montana, Washington, Idaho, and Wyoming. The Republicans' position on protec- tive tariffs, which had helped them win the presidency in 1888, hurt them two years later. Because there was little com- petition in the market, prices for the most part were falling; thus debts were harder to repay. In addition. Republicans were hurt nationally by local Republicans in such states as Wisconsin and Massachusetts, who supported compulsory public school attendance where instruction was in English. Many Catholic and Lutheran immigrant families resided in these states and wanted public funding for their parochial schools in which students were taught in their language. Republi- cans also pushed Prohibition at the grass- roots level. Democrats used these issues, together with that of a backfiring tariff, to attack the Republicans. The congres- sional elections of 1890 resulted in a Democratic landslide. By 1892 the Republicans' position was even worse. Disspiritedly, they renominated Har- rison, and the Democrats nominated Grover Cleveland again. Popular discon- tent with the Republicans was so high that, for the first time since before the Civil War, Democrats won not only the White House but both houses of Congress. xos Section Two Review !»» I^U*& Summary Presidents Hayes, Garfield, and Cleve- land worked for reform of civil service and sought to restore a balance of power between the presidency and Congress.

The period after the war was a time of rapid change. Some satirized the values of post-Civil War society, as in Twain and Warner's description of a poorly maintained Washington Monument. Others cele- brated the country's emergence as an industrial giant. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss developments in literature, art, and higher education. • Describe how various leisure activities expanded. The United States was quickly becoming an urban, industrial- ized society. It needed citizens who could understand complex political and economic questions, and it needed literate workers and managers who could staff its offices, shops, and fictories. In the late nineteenth century, the nation reformed its educational system. Education By 1 900 many states had or were work- ing toward compulsory school attendance. In cities, graded schools replaced one- room school houses. The school year, which had traditionally been squeezed in between fall harvest and spring planting, was lengthened. Many cities also intro- duced free secondary education, and the number of public high schools increased from a few hundred in 1860 to more than 2,500 in 1890. Yet there was still great room for improvement: in 1900 the aver- age child in the United States received only 5 years of schooling. The most far-reaching development in education in the latter half of the nine- teenth century was the expansion of high- er education. At mid-century most colleges and universities in the United States had poor equipment, scanty libraries, and ill-trained, overworked fac- ulties. Their fixed curriculum, which emphasized ancient Greek and Roman thought, included no training in modern languages, history, or science. There were no first-rate graduate schools in law, medicine, or the liberal arts, and no American scientific school deserved to be mentioned in the same breath with the best in Europe. By 1 900 these weaknesses had been vig- orously attacked. Responding to the need for more practical education, colleges in the United States reformed their curricula. Courses in the social and natural sciences were made available, and the elective sys- tem, first introduced at Harvard, made it possible tor students to choose an individ- ual course of study. Young scholars from the United States trained in the world's best universities — in Germany — brought back higher standards of scholarship and scientific research. Existing private univer- sities were greatly expanded, and new ones were foimded — most with the aid of wealthy biisincsspeople who supported the trend toward making education more useful. More than two dozen new schools CjiAIM I'.R 20 lllL GlLDLU AcL 595"},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"were devoted specifically to technical training. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and others like it supplied industry with highly trained engineers, metallurgists, and chemists. Also during this period the first graduate schools of business, such as the Wharton School of Finance, were established. Along with the growth of privately endowed universities and technical schools came an expansion of state universities. Such institutions owed a great deal to the Morrill Act of 1862, which gave public lands to each state as a grant to finance the endowment of colleges. While the main goal of these schools was to extend knowledge of \"agriculture and the mechanic arts,\" they were funded to teach Life of the Times Personal Hygiene For polite society in the late nineteenth cen- tury, a virtual wall of silence surrounded the bathroom and related subjects. Such modest}' would have been unthinkable in colonial America, or even on the farm, where privacy ivas rare. The inven- tion of indoor plumb- ing — and with it the flush toilet — exempli- fied a revolution i>2 personal hygiene and habits that transpired during the Gilded Age. The word toilet reflected this change. Americans borrowed it from the French toilette, which referred to grooming, as a euphemism for the British water closet, or simply, W.C. Only when privy facilities were moved indoors did it become possible to treat this most human of topics with delicacy. The first household bath- room was installed in the New York residence of George Vander- bilt in 1855. Other wealthy families soon fol- lowed suit, although early plumbing systems wete far from safe or sanitary. With the mass production of enamel-coat- ed fixtures around the turn of the century, indoor plumbing in private homes became more commonplace. After cities acquired water and sewage systems, piping was run first to the kitchen. Next connected were washbasins, and finaUy the bathtub and toi- let. The bath thus became a room of genuine ptivacy. science and classical studies as well. In addition to such southwestern universities as the University of California and Texas A&M, most of the large state universities of the Midwest began as land-grant col- leges. Univetsities in the Midwest also played an important role in opening higher educa- tion to women for the first time. In the pre-Civil War era, women had been admit- ted to Oberlin and Antioch colleges in Ohio. After the war, coeducation became common west of the Appalachians. In the more conservative East, women founded private colleges of theit own, such as Mount Holyoke, Vassar, Smith, Rad- cliffe, and Bryn Mawn These colleges shared the same educational goals as all- male institutions. The adult public also cried out for more learning. Beginning in 1874 as a summer program to train Sunday school teachers, the Chautauqua (shuh TAW kwuh) Institute in westetn New York sparked a movement that provided the masses with instruction in such subjects as literature, economics, science, and gov- ernment through summer school instruc- tion and correspondence school. Literature United States writers responded to the post-Civil Wat era in different ways. One populat school of postwar writers looked backward, sttiving to capture the tomance of vanishing tural ttaditions. A center of such \"local-color\" writing was the South. Civil War and Reconstruction had swept away an entire way of life there, leaving poverty and destruction in its wake. In the 1870s and 1880s, southern local colorists wrote nostalgically about antebellum, or prewar, manners, customs, and institu- tions. Through their wotk they created a myth ol an aristocratic order that appealed to people the world over. The movement was not confined to the South, howevet. Local colorists also wrote of vanishing ways of life in the small towns and fishing villages of New England, on the farms of the Midwest, on the ranches of the plains, and in the mining camps and boomtowns ot the Wild West. 596 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"Examining Fine Art Winslow Homer's Snap the Whip, 1872, captures the joy of a school recess. Homer became famous for his vivid use of color and attention to detail. What Euro- pean artistic styles did he reject? One of America's greatest writers was a local colorist named Samuel Clemens, who wrote under the name of Mark Twain. Twain wrote vivid and hilarious stories about his travels in the West. His most enduring works — The Advciitures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckle- berry Finn — are tales of his boyhood home on the Mississippi River. Twain's books were not only acclaimed by critics but loved by the public. He combined shrewd observation and irreverent wit. His writing bridged the gap between pop- ular and highbrow literature, between ordinary local-color writing and realism, a European-innuenced movement that strove for accurate representation without idealization. Realist writers wanted to get away from the emotional preoccupations of the romantic movement and the pretty, senti- mental themes of popular liieraiure. Real- ist writers set out to take a close look at real people's lives and problems. One of the leading realists, 'William Dean How- ells, declared that novels should \"speak the dialect, the language, that most Americans know. \" In The Rise of Silas Laphanu How- ells depicted a crude, but likeable bump- kin — the new American millionaire. In The Red Badge of Courage, often called the first modern war novel, Stephen Crane depicted a Union soldier's fear and cow- ardice under fire. Other realists undertook to expose the seamy underside of urban life. Critics of realism argued that realistic fiction was not uplifting, that its subject matter was often ordinary or even ugly, and that its characters' misdeeds were not always suitably punished.

Some of America's greatest painters, however, became expatriates — people who choose to live outside their native country. John Singer Sargent lived in England and became a brilliant portraitist ot Europe's upper classes. James Abbott McNeill Whistler, creator of \"Whistler's Mother,\" and Mary Cassatt also chose to live in Europe. Cassatt, in particular, was influenced by a style of painting called Impressionism. Impressionists tried to capture the play of light, color, and pattern as they made immediate impres- sions on the senses. The architecture of the Gilded Age was heavy and ornate. It is often called \"Victo- rian,\" after Queen Victoria of Great Britain, who reigned from 1837 to 1901. On the outside, fashionable Victorian houses were festooned with turrets, towers, porches, and gables.

As machines took over the work of more and more hands, the time required to produce a shirt, a bucket, a pin, or a table was reduced to a small fraction ot what it had been. Hours of work, although still long by the standards of the twentieth century, were gradually reduced. As leisure time increased, new forms of entertainment developed. One was a new form of journalism. In the late 1800s, improvements in paper- making and printing made it possible to produce newspapers far more cheaply than ever before. At the same time there was such increased demand for advertising space that newspapers could make their profits entirely from advertisers, selling copies below cost in order to attract the greatest number of readers. The new penny-newspapers strove to amuse readers as much as to inform them. Their intend- ed audience was not the educated middle and upper classes but clerks, laborers, and housewives. I he pioneer among the penny newspa- pers was the New York Wuiid. purchased by Joseph Pulitzer in 1883. In 15 years its circulaiion rose from 15,000 to more than 1 million. Pulitzer, dedicating his paper \"to the cause of the people rather than the purse-proud potentates,\" attacked unfair employers and grafting politicians with vigor. But the real source of Pulitzer's success was not politics but sensationalism. He was one of the first to use \".scare headlines\" like \"Baptized in Blood\" and \"Death Rides the Rails.\" 1 le also introduced the colored Sunday sup- plement and the serialized comic strip. From the yellow ink he used in his comics came the term \"yellow journal- ism,\" which critics applied to the subject matter and style of the World and all its imitators. If he could not find news, Pulitzer made it. Once he sent a young woman, Nelly Bly, to travel around the globe in less time than it took the hero of Jules Verne's popular novel.

When the operator touched a letter on the keyboard, a lead mold was placed in line with other letters. Each complete line of type was molded onto a single slug, and the slugs were made into printing plates. The linotype allowed text to be assembled much taster into columns and pages.

Dime novels also portrayed the worlds of business and crime in such works as Jay Gould's Office Boy and The Terrible Mystery of Car 206. Moralists sus- pected that these early paperbacks would corrupt the young, and they were often hidden from the eyes ot alarmed parents. Defenders pointed out, however, that because dime novels were not the work ol realists, no bad deed ever went unpun- ished; no good boy went without his just reward. Magazines were another important source of information and leisure reading in the late 1800s. New kinds of special- ized publications appeared. Women's magazines such as Ladies' Home Journal were highly popular. Sports and Entertainment As work became less strenuous, many looked lor leisure activities that involved physical exercise. Golf, croquet, and lawn tennis — all imported from Great Britain, were popular sports with the middle and upper classes. College students brought in still other British sports, including rowing, track, and rugby (from which the American game ol football was derived). Baseball, however, was a truly Amer- ican invention — its earliest form was played before the Civil War. College and club teams sprang up all over the country in the late 1800s. The first team to turn professional was the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1869; in 1876 the National League was organized.

There appeared, as if from no- where, a plague of grasshoppers that destroyed not only the wheat but the morale ol farmers on the Great Plains. They ate anything green, choked wells to the brim, broke the branches off fruit trees by their weight, and even devoured harnesses and tool handles. They came in clouds that darkened the sun and covered the ground. The Norwegian- American writer, Ole Rolvaag, described the coming of the grasshoppers in his novel Giants in the Earth: They actually hurt me as they flew against my face and hands. The wagon. . . was literally filled with them. The road was seething. . . . I saw Tather standing almost in despair.

There was always the threat of prairie fires, dust storms, and, worst of all, drought, which combined with hot winds and tempera- tures over 100°F to bake crops in the ground and cake farmers' laces with the salt ol their sweat. Farm prices began to decline in the 1880s; the price ol wheat fell from 91 cents a bushel in 1883 to 69 cents in 1886. This decline was largely the result of overproduction of crops. New inven- tions, such as steam-powered harvesting and threshing machines, improved crop yields, and more efficient techniques greatly increased farm production. As prices declined, farmers had to borrow more and more money. Costs ol the new farm machinery that assisted with large harvests were high. So were the costs of shipping crops to market. The more farm prices lell, consequently, the harder it became for larmers to pay back the princi- pal and interest on their loans. Farmers believed that the government was the tool of the industrialists and the bankers and that politicians were ignoring the interests of the larmers.

Industrialization had created complex new problems that few people understood. For their prob- lems farmers blamed the railroads, the dis- tributors of farm goods, industrialists, bankers, and the shortage in the money supply. They wanted the government to regulate railroads and to put more money into circulation. Railroad Abuses Railroads opened vast stretches of the West to settlement, making it possible for farmers to get their crops to markets and to get manufactured goods from the East. Soon, however, many farmers began to view railroad companies as their enemies. Indeed, the railroads were guilty of a number of abuses of the public interest. Railroad companies spent millions of dol- lars in bribes to state legislators and other public officials in exchange for special favors such as land grants, cash subsidies, pro-railroad laws, and tax exemptions. But they often evaded laws designed to make them provide services in return for the benefits they were granted. Railroad financing was marked by a common abuse called \"stock watering, \" the practice of increasing the number of shares of a company without adding to the company's assets. For example, when Jay Gould and James J. Fisk gained con- trol of the Erie Railroad in 1868, they issued $71 million of stock on property worth $20 million. They made money by selling this \"watered stock\" to the public, who did not know of the stocks actual lower value. Such action cheated all the stockholders. It also hurt the public because the railroads that had raised the value of their stock had to keep their rates high to pay dividends. In a day when trucks and highways were not yet dreamed of, railroads often enjoyed a natural monopoly, that is, in certain places there wa.s no competition tor ser- vices. In some areas there was only one rail- road line and no other possible means of transportation.

What brought a temporary end to this legislation? The Patrons of Husbandry, commonlv called the Grange, was the first national farm organization. It was founded in 1867 by Oliver Hudson Kelley. At first, the main purpose of the Grange was to relieve the isolation and loneliness in the lives of farm families by having social activities. And recognizing the importance of women on the farm, the Grange was the first fraternal organization to admit women on an equal basis. The panic ot 1 873, however, turned the Grange into a reform lobby. As crop prices tell and interest rates rose, farmers began to talk about how to solve their common problems. Local Grange organi- zations pooled farmers' resources to set up mills, factories, banks, insurance compa- nies, grain elevators, and cooperatives, or non-profit stores owned by the farmers themselves. The local Granges involved themselves in local and national politics and pressed for state laws to help farmers. By 1874 the Grange had 1.5 million members in states throughout the Mid- west, South, and West. Its solidarity met with such success that several states passed \"Granger laws\" that fixed maximum freight and passenger rates, forbade rail- roads to discriminate between places or shippers, and attempted to regulate monopolies of such farmer necessities as 2,rain elevators and warehouses. WiLLA Gather 1873-1947 Life on the prairie was a memorable experience for a young girl in the 1880s and 1890s. The beauty of the land and the hardy determination of the pioneers lasted long in the memo- ry of Willa Gather. Born in Virginia in 1873, Willa moved with her family to a farm near Red Cloud, Nebraska, at the age of nine. The next eight years would provide the reflections for several novels, written years later. Gather tried her hand at writing while teaching school in Pittsburgh in 1901 and then became an editor for McClure's Magazine. But her real suc- cess did not begin until she started writing about life on the plains. Many of her famous novels, such as O Pio- neers! (1913), tell of the tough, yet sensitive nature of the immigrants who matched their determination against the demanding and lonely life on a plains farm. 608 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1 860- 1 900"},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"Private businesses protested loudly against the Granger laws. Their main argument was that government should not interfere with private enterprise. \"Can't I do what I want with my own?\" demanded Cornelius Vanderbilt. Rail- road lawyers argued that Granger laws were unconstitutional because the Four- teenth Amendment forbade a state to \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" They viewed a railroad corporation as a legal \"person\" that should not be de- prived of its property by being forced to lower its rates. Defenders of the Granger laws said rail- roads that had accepted generous aid Irom federal and local governments should not claim to be devotees of laissez-faire capital- ism. Further, they argued that laissez-faire rules did not apply to natural monopolies because there was no competition to keep prices down. The Grangers maintained that government must regulate railroads and other such monopolies in order to protect the public. In 1877 the Supreme Court decided in favor of the Granger laws in the case of Munn V. Illinois. The Court stated that common carriers, such as railroads, and public utilities, such as grain elevators, \"stand in the very gateway of commerce\" and \"take toll ol all who pass.\" Therefore, these carriers must exercise \"a sort of pub- lic office\" and \"submit to being con- trolled by the public for the common good.\" In spite of such Court decisions, the Granger laws were unsuccessful. The rail- roads fought the laws by cutting services or threatening to lay no more track until the acts were repealed. Moreover, in the late 1870s, membership in the Grange declined and so did its political activity. The main cause of the Grange's collapse was its venture into business activities. The Grange set up plow and reaper facto- ries, grain elevators, packing plants, and banks. Bitterly opposed by private compa- nies and often not well run, these Ciranger businesses usually biled. Their collapse discredited the Grange, and by 1880 its membership was less than one-fourth ol what it had been in 1874. The remaining Granger laws were dealt a mortal blow by the Supreme Court in 1886. In the Wabash Railway decision, the Supreme Court held that the states could only control railroad traffic within each state's own borders. They did not have the power to regulate railroad traffic that crossed state borders. Because most railroad traffic crossed state boundaries, the Wabash Railway decision effectively wiped out state regulation of railroad rates. Interstate Commerce Act The Supreme Court's ruling in the Wabash decision made it clear that regula- tion would have to come at the national level. In 1887 Congress passed the first fed- eral law to regulate interstate commerce. Examining Illustrations Most farmers ordered their household goods through catalogs such as this.

What was the duty of the Grange? The Interstate Commerce Act declared that railroad charges must be \"reasonable and just\"; it forbade pooling, rebates, and high- er rates for short rather than long hauls. The companies were required to publish rates, give advance notice of all changes, and make annual financial reports to the federal government. Violations of these provisions were punishable by fines of up to $5,000 for each offense. Enforcement of the law was placed under the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), a five- member panel appointed by the President. As far as its immediate purpose was con- cerned, the Interstate Commerce Act was a failure. The ICC, lacking power to set rates, could only make recommendations or bring suits in the federal courts. Of 16 such cases that reached the Supreme Court, the Court held for the railroads in 15. In retrospect, though, the Interstate Commerce Act was a very important law. It established the precedent that the feder- al government might control large-scale private enterprise if the public good seemed to require it. It also provided a model for regulatory commissions today. Section One Review » Summary Along with the environmental hazards of life on the plains, farmers faced eco- nomic problems. Farm prices declined as a result of overproduction, making it diffi- cult for farmers to pay back money they had borrowed for equipment. Their eco- nomic and natural hardships were intensi- fied by abuses by the railroads that enjoyed a monopoly. Discontented farm- ers formed the Grange.

Discontent in rural areas grew to new heights. Farm prices continued to fall, money was in short supply, and more and more people were losing their land to creditors. Many blamed their problems not only on the drought that was baking crops in the ground summer after summer but on human forces as well: greedy bankers, industrialists, and railroad com- panies that were accused of controlling government policies and bleeding rural areas dry. Like the Grangers, these men and women believed that farmers were the backbone of the country both economi- cally and morally. Once again they turned to politics to solve the problems caused by rapid economic change. The Farmers' Alliances, which spawned the Populist Party, succeeded beyond the dreams of the Grangers. Greenbacks and Free Silver If there was anything that farmers in the late nineteenth century demanded more strongly than the regulation of natural monopolies or the reduction of the mar- keters' profits, it was \"cheap money.\" The value of money, like that of any other commodity, changes according to the sup- ply. If the number of dollars in circulation increases while there is no increase in the amount of goods and services for sale, the dollar buys less, and prices go up. This sit- uation is called inflation. On the other hand, if the number of dollars in circula- tion decreases while there is no decrease in the amount of goods and services for sale, the dollar buys more, and prices go down. This situation is called deflation. In the three decades after the Civil W;tr, the pro- duction of agricultural staples, such as wheat and cotton, nearly quadrupled while the supply of money increased very little. 1 hus, the prices received by hirmers dropped by nearly rwo-thirds. A period of deflation lasted for nearly 30 years. In 1865, with the value of currency inflated by the wartime issuance of United States notes, or greenbacks, there was $ 1 0.6 in circulation for every person in the coun- try. By 1 895 per capita circulation had sunk to $4.5.

A country that adopted the gold standard made all its cur- rency convertible into gold. Formerly most countries had been on a bimetallic standard whereby the govern- . ment coined both gold and silver and established the official value oi each. In spite of official \"mint prices\" for gold and silver, their relative value often changed sharply. The difficulty with the gold standard in the late nineteenth century was that world production of gold did not increase as fast as world production of goods. This restricted the currency supply and drove prices down. Deflation was hard on farm- ers, who borrowed money more heavily than ever before. This resulted in thou- sands of farm owners losing their land. As soon as greenbacks began to be called in during the late 1860s and prices began to drop, farmers started to demand inflation. They protested that bankers and bondholders had lent 50-cent dollars dur- ing the war; they now wanted to be repaid in 100-cent dollars. Western delegates to the Democratic Convention of 1868 even forced an inflationist plank into the party platform. In the midterm election of 1878, a Greenback party polled more than 1 million votes, electing 15 members of Congress. The Greenback movement declined after the mid- 1870s as inflationists turned to free silver. Ever since the gold rush of 1849 had lowered the price of gold, silver miners had sold their silver commercially rather than selling it to the Treasury. In 1873 Congress, unaware of the potential of new silver mines, decided to stop coin- ing silver money and adopted the gold standard. Six years later, after building up a gold reserve, the federal government resumed specie, or coin, payments. These events caused a howl of protest from west- ern silver miners because new mines, espe- cially the famous Comstock Lode, produced a flood of silver that would no longer be coined. Denouncing what they called \"the Crime of '73,\" silver miners demanded a policy of free silver, meaning that the government should coin all silver brought to the mint. They were joined by farmers of the West and South who expected that free silver would mean a cheaper dollar and higher prices. The strength of the silver movement was shown by the Bland-Allison Act of 1878, which was passed over President Hayes's veto. This law required that the treasury buy from $2 million to $4 mil- lion worth of silver a month and issue currency against it. Although adding to the money supply, the Bland-Allison Act did not halt deflation. The increase in business far exceeded that in currency. The Populist Movement The election of 1892 was notable because for the first time since 1860, a third party, a minor political party, won electoral votes. The new organization, the People's, or Populist party, was principally an expression of farmers' grievances. Ever since the Civil War, federal policies had favored industry over agriculture and the city over the country. In spite of clamor for a cheaper dollar, the United States remained on the gold standard — to the Examining Photographs Mary E. Lease of Kansas was an often-quoted Populist leader.

The protective tariff raised the price of the goods farmers bought, to the advantage of manufactur- ers, but American agricultural staples were sold overseas in an unprotected mar- ket. Legislation that favored agrarian, or farming, interests proved ineffective. State and federal regulation of railroads had been frustrated by adverse judicial deci- sions. The Homestead Act offered free farms to settlers, but the greater part of the public lands actually went to railroads and speculators. When drought hit the Great Plains region in the late 1880s, the farmers were in a rebellious mood. \"Those who could submit quietly to such outrage,\" said a western editor, \"must be either more or less than men.\" In the West in general, economic distress was widespread; after the depression of 1893, feelings became so bitter that many citi- zens feared a revolution. The Populist party originated from two great farmers' organizations, which were formed after the decline of the Grange — the Southern Alliance, which covered the cotton and tobacco belt, and the North- ern Alliance, especially strong in the Plains region. Although the two alliances failed to merge, they made similar demands — free silver, more paper money, cheaper credit, government ownership of railroads, and the restoration of railroad bounty lands to the federal government. After several congressional election suc- cesses and conferences in Cincinnati in 1891 and St. Louis in February 1892, a new political party was formed. The Peo- ples party held a national convention in Omaha in July 1892. Although mostly from farm organizations, delegates also represented the Knights of Labor and fol- lowers of social reformers Henry George and Ldward Bellamy. Following the custom of the time, the convention nominated for President ,i Civil War veteran, James B. Weaver. There was nothing customary, however, about the platform. Instead of the usual resounding double talk, the Populists made clear iheir position anti presented specific demands. The Omaha Platform The preamble of the Omaha platform expressed indignation at the existing political and economic conditions, which were, it claimed, bringing the nation \"to the verge of moral, political, and material ruin.\" It condemned politi- cal corruption, newspapers dominated by business interests, the mortgage bur- den, and the condition of labor. The influence of social reformers was seen in the statements that \"the land is concen- trating in the hands of the capitalists\" and that governmental injustice breeds \"two great classes — tramps and million- aires.\" Turning to money and banking, the Populists characterized worldwide adoption of the gold standard as \"a vast conspiracy against mankind... organized on two continents.\" The following was perhaps the most zealously radical statement in the pream- ble of the Omaha platform: We believe that the powers of government — in other words, of the people — should be expanded . . . as rapidly and as far as the good sense of an intelligent people and the teachings of experience shall justify. The Omaha platform revealed that it was the agriculturalists rather than orga- nized labor who dominated the Populist party. \"Lhe demands of organized labor, were given a subordinate position. \\L\\- cluded from the platform proper, labors demands were placed among a miscella- neous list of resolutions that were given the title \"Expression of Sentiments.\" lhe Omaha platform now seems less radical in perspective than it did at the time.

The Populist platform reveals an important function of third parties in the United States — to bring to public atten- tion measures that the major parties later adopt as their own. The Populists\" enthusiasm as they entered the campaign of 1892 had a reli- gious tone. They adapted revival meeting hymns as parry songs. Huge rallies were addressed not only by men but also by \"women with skins tanned to parchment by the hot winds, with bony hands of toil, and clad in faded calico.\" The ballot- ing revealed the distinct character of various regions in the People's party. All of its 11 electoral votes came from states lying west of the Mississippi River. In the South sympathy with Populist aims was widespread, but thete was fear that the new parry might divide the Democratic vote and let the Republicans back into power. Southern Democrats with Populist principles — \"Popocrats\" — nonetheless helped elect their own parry's candidate, Grover Cleveland. Cleveland's Second Term Cleveland's second term proved diffi- cult. Inheriting a treasury deficit from the Harrison administration, he had scarcely taken office when the panic of 1893 burst upon the country. Although Cleveland could not have prevented this disaster, he was blamed for it. Furthermore, he man- aged to antagonize almost every element in his party. Above all, he antagonized farmers by defending the gold standard. Fearful that the Sherman Silver Purchase Act would flood the U.S. Treasury with so much silver that it could not be redeemed in gold, he called a special ses- sion of Congress in 1893 and forced repeal of the law. Because most western and southern Democrats opposed him, he was able to do this only with Republican 614 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"support. Even after federal buying of sil- ver ceased, the gold standard was endan- gered because it was difficult for the government to keep an adequate gold reserve in the treasury. To obtain the pre- cious metal, the Treasury Department sold United States bonds. In one transaction J. Pierpont Morgan, the most powerful banker on Wall Street, obtained federal bonds so far below their market value that he and the bankers associated with him made $1.5 million. Western fury at the Morgan bond trans- action was unbounded. The gold stan- dard was bad enough, but to pay bankers to preserve it seemed to them almost treasonable. More and more, western Democrats turned against the President, became \"Popocrats,\" and demanded that the Democrats favor free silver. The President faced other problems. Never popular with \"machine\" politicians, he angered them further by putting 120,000 civil service jobs on the merit system. Cleveland also infuriated workers by using troops in the 1894 Pullman strike. The President's hope of lowering the prohibitive duties ot the McKinley Tar- iff faded when a few Democratic sena- tors joined the Republicans in tacking 633 amendments on a new tariff bill, thereby keeping rates almost at former levels. Cleveland let the resulting Wil- son-Gorman Tariff of 1894 become a law without his signature, but he de- nounced the action of the rebellious senators as \"a piece of party perfidy and dishonor.\" Meanwhile the Republicans had be- come, more than ever, identified with business interests. A dominant figure in the party was Mark Hanna, an Ohio businessman-politician. Big, bluff and low-browed, Hanna became, perhaps unjustly, a symbol of the alliance between corporate wealth and politics. Anti- Republican cartoons habitually portrayed him in a suit covered with dollar signs. In 1896 Hanna used his great organizing tal- ents to secure the Republican nomination lor his friend William McKinley, on a platform pledging high larilfs and mainte- nance of the gold standaril. Republicans in 1896 boasted that they could \"nominate a rag-baby or a yellow dog and elect it\" because of divisions among their opponents. The Democratic national convention opened with such a bitter fight between Gold Democrats and Silver Democrats that it was almost impossible to keep a semblance of order.

The most serious weakness in Bryan's campaign was that free silver was a poor issue on which to base an entire cam- paign. No one knew what the result of free coinage of silver would be; it would not have ended fluctuation in the value of money, and it might have caused a busi- ness panic. The Republicans won the election ol 1 896 by a decisive margin, carrying all the thickly populated states of the Northeast and Midwest. It was a victory for industrv over agriculture, the city over the councry, the North and East over the West and South.

IiaAftAHHI^^b Summary The Populist parry pressed for inflation- ary policies that favored the farmer. To this end they protested the gold standard and supported free silver. In addition, they opposed national banks and proposed nationalization of railroad and telegraph lines. Populists entered the campaign of 1892 with the full support of farmers and some support of laborers. In 1896 they sup- ported the Democratic party's narrow focus on free silver, which split the Democrats and gave the Republicans an easy victory. Checking for Understanding 1.

R cforms of the Civil W;ir and Reconstruction periods encour- aged people in the United States to look to government as the agent ot social change. In the years ot its unquestioned dominance, the Republi- can party had treed slaves, imposed a new way of life on the Souili, .nul opened ilu- West to settlement. After the war, reform- ers who were dissatisfied with various aspects of life in the Gilded Age also looked to the government for action. Temperance and Women's Rights The period after the Civil War was not just a time of industrial progress, urban growth, and agrarian and labor discon- tent. Like the Jacksonian period, it also produced \"a fertility of projects for the salvation of the world\" — reforms designed to cure the ills of the new industrial soci- ety of the United States. Several reform movements that had begun earlier contin- ued to reach toward their goals. Support- ers of Prohibition, for example, formed a national political parry in 1869; from 1872 on they ran a presidential candidate. The temperance movement had never been more active. Most effective were two national orga- nizations that waged a ceaseless campaign against the evils of liquor and the saloon: the Anti-Saloon League and the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU).

Frances Willard, the head of the WCTU, made her group an effective force for causes other than temperance, such as prison reform and protective labor laws. Because women were far more likely than men to favor temperance, temper- ance advocates usually favored women's suffrage. The women's suffrage movement had its beginnings in the antebellum period; its first leaders were female abolitionists, like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who decided to put the antislavery cause ahead of their own. After the war women's suffrage was championed with renewed vigor. Oppo- nents of women's suffrage argued that women's interests were represented by their male relatives and spouses and that politics was a dirty business that would degrade \"the fairer sex.\" Wendell Phillips, a former abolitionist, argued for the suf- fragist cause as follows: Life of the Times BOARDINGHOUSES Beginning in the 1830s, farm girls moved to Lowell, Mas- sachusetts, to work in the textile milk there. The mill owners set up hoardinghoiises ivith strict curfews and com- fortable if sparse accommodations for the girls. Young workers in other towns generally boarded with families who took them in to help pay the rent. Later in the centu?y, immi- grant workers often boarded with other immigrants who had lived in the same vil- lage in the old country and had preceded them to America. The practice of Soarding offended the sensibilities of some middle- class reformers. They com- plained that boarding weak- ened the family unit and - Iped spread disease. But many immi- grants had a different point of view. They knew that all boardinghouses were not the same. In some tenements, as many as ten immigrants slept in a room. But other boardinghouses were like the establishment of one immigrant woman who thought she would own her own home in America. Having difficult)' just making ends meet shortly after she arrived in the United States, she cooked for four boarders. Initially she resented having to share her home, pre- pare meals, and attend to the needs of people she did not e\\'en know. However, the woman's attitude changed. She began to enjoy providing a home for new immigrants who otherwise would have no place to stay. One of two things is true: either a woman is like a man — and if she is then a ballot based on brains belongs to her as well as to him; or she is different, and then man does not know how to vote for her as well as she herself does. In 1878 Susan B. Anthony of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) persuaded a sympathetic senator to propose the first women's suffrage amendment to the Constitution. It was voted down many times in the next 40 years. These defeats reflected the opinion of the majority. Most people in the Unit- ed States, male and female, thought women's suffrage was an outlandish idea. At the state level, suffragists had better success. By 1900 about half of the states allowed women to vote on school issues, where their special knowledge of children was presumed to be a benefit. On the frontier, where women shared the hard- ships and dangers equally with men, sup- port for women's suffrage was more widespread. By 1900, 4 states — Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, and Idaho — had granted women the right to vote. It would take 20 more years lor all the women of the Unit- ed States to win this right. Women workers especially suffered ex- ploitation during the new industrial age. By 1900 almost 5 million women were employed in the United States. It was not uncommon for women to work in \"sweat shops\" for 10 to 14 hours a day, often for less than S4 a week. Most unions, howev- er, refused to accept women as members. One exception was the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, which had wom- en leaders as well as women members. In 1903 a group of women formed the 620 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern Anierica: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"Examining Photographs In the early 1900s, the professions were largely reserved for men. while typing and secretarial jobs were thought to be women's work.

Socialism Wherever industrialism appeared, there were people driven toward extreme solu- tions for the problems it created. Some- thing seemed wrong with a system that produced both the idle rich, who lived in mansions, and the unemployed poor, who lived in slums. Some were impelled toward socialism. Eugene V. Debs, tor example, became a lifelong convert to socialism because ot unjust treatment after his imprisonment in an Illinois jail during the Pullman strike. Declaring that in a democracy workers could gain control of the governnicni and use it to change the free enterprise system, he organized the American Socialist parly. Unlike Debs, Socialists in the early 180()s did not attempt to change the eco- nomic system by gaining control of the govenunent. While early European Sociah ists believed private property to be incom patible with the emerging industrial system, they tried to effect change by experimenting with cooperative commu- nities. Robert Owen brought his idea of cooperative control of industry from En- gland to New Harmony, Indiana, in 1825. Such socialist communities reached their peak in America in the 1840s. Linking Across Time Women's Garment Worker Unions The ILGWU (International Ladies' Garment Workers Union) continues its 90- year history of social activism. \"We've always seen ourselves as forces for social change, \" says Vice President Susan Cowell. Because so many members are single mothers, day care and maternity or family leave are important issues. Working with employers, the union has set a policy of six months' paid fami- ly leave accompa- nied by job assurance. Another union employer agreement has resulted in low- cost childcare.

Marx had been a student at the University of Berlin during the emergence of a new philosophical and literary movement that questioned established values. Searching for meaning in history, Marx finally wrote his economic philosophy in The Commu- nist Manifesto in 1847 and Das Kapital, the first volume published in 1867. Marx, who wrote with force and buttressed his opinions with great learning, predicted that capitalism was doomed. Fewer and fewer capitalists, he said, would control all wealth, while the mass of the people would be pushed into the ranks ol the proletariat (people without property). Eventually the proletarians, preferring the risk of death at the barricades in violent revolution to slow starvation in the poor conditions of factories and slums, would rise and overthrow their masters. History, said Marx, had seen continual class strug- gles, but the conflict between industrial workers and capitalists would be the last. When the workers eventually took control of society, Marx believed they would establish a classless society. Using the slo- gan \"Workers of the world, unite!\" Marx called on workers everywhere to join his crusade. Marxist socialism enlisted many work- ers in the industrial countries of Europe to its cause. In the United States, however, it gained only a small following, mostly among intellectuals and immigrant groups in big cities. Henry George and the Single Tax Another writer with a proposal for re- making society was Henry George, whose major work. Progress and Poverty, was pub- lished in 1879. George attacked the central problem posed by the socialists: Why should the advance of the industrial revolu- tion, with more and more machinery lor producing wealth, apparently result in more poverty? George said the problem was that ownership of land — the source of all wealth — was being concentrated in the hands of speculators. These speculators did not put the land to use. They merely wait- ed for it to increase in value, meanwhile charging high rents that drove down wages and business profits. George criticized the growing gap between rich and poor: We need not look far from the palace to find the hovel When people can charter special steamboats to take them to watering places . . . build marble stables for their horses and give dinner parties tuhich cost. ..a thousand dollars a head, we may know that there are poor girls on the streets. . . [facing starvation. A believer in private property, George did not propose socialism as a remedy. Instead, he urged what he called the \"sin- gle tax\" on land values. The rate of the single tax would be based not on existing value but on potential value if the land were used eftlciently. Thus there would be no profit in keeping land out of use and waiting for it to increase in worth; owners would either have to develop it themselves or sell it to someone else who would do so. George argued that this would cause prosperity by promoting maximum pro- ductivity and by plowing the profits of the land monopoly back into society. George's ideas had great appeal to the people of the United States who were dismayed over the growth ol monopolies and who had begun to realize that the fiontier was clos- ing. Single-tax clubs and magazines spread his ideas. Although the single-tax idea was too radical a change to be accepted com- pletely, it influenced methods of taxation both in this country and abroad. Dissenting Voices Another widely read book. The Theory of the Leisure Class, was published in 1899 by Thorstein Veblen. The son of Norwe- gian immigrants, Veblen was influenced by Populism in his early days in Wiscon- sin. Attending Yale and Johns Hopkins University, he became interested in the 622 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900"},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"social sciences, especially economics. His appreciation for science led him to write with the cool detachment of an observer, not a fiery revolutionary. NXTiile he be- lieved in the evolutionary process of natu- ral selection, Veblen argued that the \"leisure class,\" those who had great wealth, was not an example ot the most fit. In fact, he said the leisure class hin- dered progress and evolution. Veblen believed that, like the dinosaur, the leisure class would disappear. Veblen used the phrase \"conspicuous consumption\" to describe the life oi the upper class. These were the people who wasted vast resources just for show. The phrase had deep meaning because the contrast between wealth and poverty was not hidden in the United States. The mansions that lined the streets of cities like New York and Chicago were within a few blocks of immigrant ghettos. Howev- er, Veblen's vision ot a community of equals governed by an elite group of social planners was judged impractical by most Americans of his time. Probably the reason why radical formu- las for altering society did not gain wide support was that Americans were, on the whole, too prosperous to want change. Even those at the bottom often felt they had bettered their position from an earlier time. A New England farm boy might prefer drawing wages of a dollar a day for a 60-hour week in a factory to working from dawn to dark trying to make a living from a rocky farm. An immigrant might be living with his or her family in a single room and working in a windowless sweat- shop, but for the first time in his life he was wearing shoes. Even the poorest workers believed that, in time, they would also be able to \"get ahead\" and become property owners. If they destroyed proper- ty rights, what would happen to the American dream? Furthermore, the United States was so large and had so many different interests that no one idea attained universal appeal. People in the United States, wanting lo promote (heir interests, worked habitually through political par- ties. These parties tried to appeal to as many groups as possible. UIAI Section Three Review^ Summary Following the Civil War, reform move- ments aimed to cure the ills of the new industrial society. Women began to press for voting and working rights. Because most unions excluded women, they formed their own. Temperance advocates formed the Prohibition party and began to sponsor presidential candidates. Some people turned to socialism as the answer to the problems of industrialization. Karl Marx wrote of classless socialist societies free ol private ownership, capitalism, eco- nomic inequities, and exploitation. Dis- senters such as Thorstein Veblen and Henry George attracted a reading audi- ence, but most Americans resisted change. Checking for Understanding 1. Identify Susan B. Anthony, Eugene V. Debs 2.

Ameri- can farmers now faced hard times because oi their own overproduction of crops. Economic factors caused farm prices to drop sharply. Overburdened with debt and at the mercy of the elements, many lost their farms. Farmers sought solutions to their social and eco- nomic problems through the Granger Laws and the Populist party. These were successful in bringing attention to a number of political reforms later adopt- ed by the Democratic and Republican parties. Among the most important reform efforts was the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887. Attempts to regulate such monopolies as the rail- roads failed when new laws were not strictly enforced. Other attempted reforms included voting and work- ing rights for women and socialist proposals to improve industrial society. * Using Vocabulary Use each of the following terms in a statement that might have been made by each of the following peo- ple: Railroad owner: pooling Farmer: cooperatives Banker: inflation * Reviewing Facts 1 .

The salesperson made an unstat- ed assumption, that is, assumed or took for granted that your residence is carpeted. There are many kinds of unstated assumptions. Sometimes an author makes an unstated assumption regarding what the reader knows. Assuming that the reader understands or has knowledge ot certain infor- mation, the author may move on to make a point — one that is unclear to the reader because of the unstated assumption. Another kind of unstated assumption made by an author may be a result of the author's own lack of information. In this case a reader may become aware that an author has made an assumption that is not true. This type of unstated assumption is usually discovered only by informed readers or those who have a special interest in the subject. While it may be very difficult for you to identify incorrect assumptions made by the author of a history textbook, it is a valuable skill to learn to identify unstated assumptions made by historical figures or groups. I'or example, the farmers in the late 18()()s who distrusted banks made the unstated assumption that a better alternative to banks could be found. To identify an unstated assumption, follow these guidelines. • First read the statement to determine its meaning. • Review the context of the statement. Who is the speaker? What special focus may this person or group have? • Study the content of the statement. What are the historical facts upon which the speaker relies? What facts are not included in the statement? • Use the answers to these questions to identify the missing idea or information that the author takes for granted — the unstated assumption. Example Following is a list of statements that were made by an identified historical figure or group. An unstated assumption follows each statement. • The fanners. . .produce the largest share of wealth, but they are getting . . . the smallest share for themselves. — Washington Gladden, Protestant pastor and social reformer; assumption: Each group should receive on the basis of what it produces. • We believe that the powers of government — in other words of the people — should be expanded.... Omaha Populist platform; assumption: If the government had greater power, it could solve people's problems. • Burn down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic... William Jennings Bryan, Democratic and Populist presiden- tial candidate; assumption: Gities depend upon farms for their existence. Practice Read the statements below, each of which contains at least one unstated assumption. Follow the guidelines above to identify the unstated assumptions. Look on the page noted for each item to find the name of the speaker. 1. ; Workers of the world, unite! {p. 622) 2. : Can't I do what I want with my own?

The Plains frontier was settled, and the rise of industry brought unparalleled growth to the economy. America ceased to be a rural nation ot small farms and became an industrial nation of cities and city dwellers. It was, according to writer Mark Twain, a Gilded Age, bright and attractive on the surface but corrupt underneath. Chapter 17 Opening the Trans- Mississippi West In the early 1860s, many Indian nations lived on the Great Plains with the buflalo herds that provided their food. Settlers from the East believed early explorers' descriptions of the area as a \"Great Ameri- can Desert.\" The federal government reserved this vast area for the Indians. Then, beginning in 1869, transcontinen- tal railway lines opened the West. The discovery of gold and other minerals and the promise of wealth from cattle also lured many people. Before long, the once- desolate region blossomed into a land of farms, towns, mining communities, ranches, and open ranges. Native Americans fought the intrusion of the railroads and the settlers, but their cause was doomed. Their way of life was disappearing. White hunters had slaugh- tered the buffalo almost to extinction, and farmers, miners, and ranchers had taken much of their land. In 1890 at Wounded Knee, their resistance came to an end. The American \"old West\" frontier was gone. The Homestead Act made land in the West easy to obtain and the railroads actively promoted settlement. Pioneer farmers poured onto the plains by the thousands and, with the aid of new tech- nology, overcame the harsh realities of the region. Many farmers failed, in part, because they were heavily mortgaged and grew only a single cash crop. Chapter 18 The Rise of Industrial America The key to the growth of the American economy was industrialization. The Unit- ed States had all the necessary ingredients for industry to grow — abundant natural and human resources, investment money, a growing transportation system, a free enterprise economic system with few gov- ernment restrictions, and new inventions and technology. By 1900 huge companies dominated the economy. One business after another consolidated. The efficiency of business combinations resulted in cheaper produc- tion, higher quality, and lower prices that drove smaller competitors out ot business. Corporations, monopolies, and trusts became the norm. John D. Rockefeller and the oil industry and Andrew Carnegie and the steel industry typified \"big busi- ness.\" Industrial leaders used social Dar- winism to explain and justify their actions and rise to wealth and power. The Sher- man Antitrust Act, passed in 1890, did little to stop the consolidations. Chapter 19 Labor, Immigrants, and Urban Life With industrialization the work force grew and workers' lives changed. Gone was the personal relationship between workers and employers. Hours were long, wages low, and work places hazardous. Machines had taken over many traditional tasks. Unable to improve their lot individ- ually, workers turned to labor unions. Opposed by the big corporations, man- agement, and to a certain extent, govern- ment, the unions resorted to strikes. But even major strikes, like the 1 894 Pullman railroad strike, failed to win significant gains for the workers. 626 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1 860- 1 900"},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"An important influence on the efforts of labor were the large numbers ot immi- grants who provided unskilled labor lor urban industries. The United States had always been a nation of immigrants, but the nature of immigration changed during the late 1800s. The \"new immigration\" consisted primarily of southern and east- ern European and Chinese immigrants rather than northern and western Euro- peans. The immigrants flocked to the cities, where they created their own ethnic communities. Their unfamiliar languages and customs and willingness to take any available job aroused anti-immigration sentiment. Along with the influx of immigrants from other countries, rural Americans also migrated to the cities. As a result, cities across the nation grew in size. A new way of life evolved in this urban environment. While new opportunities emerged in edu- cation and some other areas, human and technical problems plagued the cities. Chapter 20 The Gilded Age With industrialization and urbanization came political corruption. Scandals arose at every level oi government. Political machines dominated almost all major cities. Graft was common, and at the state level, businesses bought favors from legis- lators. Scandals even touched the Presi- dent and Congress. Government in general lacked lead- ership. Under Presidents Hayes and Garfield, reform efforts met with limited success. Less graft occurred, but patronage and the spoils system still prevailed. Civil service reform finally came in 1883 with passage of ihe Pendleton Act. The tariff and the currency question, however, con- tinued to provoke controversy. In addition to these reforms, the society and culture changed as well. Education expaniled and improved. Local-color writ- ers like Mark Twain described their locales with realism and detail. Sports events bec.une a favorite leisure-time activity as dill vaudeville, pennv-newspapers, aiul tlime novels. Chapter 21 Pohtics, Protest, and PopuHsm The prosperity of the Gilded Age did not extend to farmers. Burdened with high costs, low incomes, and heavy debt, they blamed their plight on unfair rail- road practices, greedy banks, and the fed- eral government's monetary policy. To solve the farmers\" problems, they organized into groups such as the Grange and the farmers' alliances. Ultimately these groups turned to politics. One of their major concerns was the railroads. The farmers' calls for reform led to the passage of Granger laws in some states and prompted passage of the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887. The farmers wanted to raise prices for their produce by putting more \"cheap money\"' into circulation. They joined with labor and other reform groups to form a new national political party — the Populist party — and made paper money and \"free silver\" a campaign issue in the 1 892 presi- dential election. The Omaha Platform of the Populist party clearly reflected the interests of the farmer. The Populist party had some successes, and eventually some of its reform ideas were adopted by the two major parties. But the Populist movement itself died soon after William Jennings Bryan lost the 1896 presidential election. Republican victory made that election .i triumph of industry over agricultute. Farmers were not the only ones seeking reform. The temperance movemeiu had never been more active — nor had women. Women's suffrage became a popuLuh' debated issue across the country. Some women, like Susan B. Anthony believed that it would take a constitutional amend- ment to improve their position in society.

Big business enjoyed many advantages. Big compa- nies could manufacture enough products to meet the demands of a national market. They produced better products at lower cost than their smaller competitors by using the newest processes and by combining oper- ations formerly carried on by separate companies. They paid high salaries to executives to get expert managers. At the same time, they increased efficiency by establishing separate departments for specialized functions such as purchasing, production, research, distribution, and sales. By using its efficiency, organization, and size, big business was frequently in a position to take advantage of its competitors and sometimes of the public. Big companies could demand volume dis- counts from shippers. They could sell their prod- ucts in an area at a loss until local competitors were forced to shut down or sell out. It a big company succeeded in getting a monopoly in its industry, it could raise consumer prices and pay less to suppliers of raw materials. Big business resulted from the vision of people who recognized great opportunities for wealth and were willing to take risks to get it. In attaining success, however, many entrepreneius showed few scruples in driving competitors out of business, evading the law, bribing officials, destroying labor unions, and devas- tating the environment.

Naturalist writers carried the vivid detail of realism a step further by depicting environmental factors. Characters seem to be caught in a web of circumstances and events that they can not control or do not understand. Theodore Dreiser was a master of the naturalist style. In his first novel Sister Carrie, published in 1900, he describes the compelling attraction as well as the cold indifference of life in growing cities such as Chicago and New York. Theodore Dr from Sister Carrie innie's flat, as the one-floor resident apartments were then being called, was in a part of West Van Buren Street inhabited by families of labourers and clerks, men who had come, and were still coming, with the rush of population pouring in at the rate of 50,000 a year. It was on the third floor, the front windows looking down into the street, where, at night, the lights of grocery stores were shining and children were playing. To Car- rie, the sound of the little bells upon the horse-cars, as they tinkled in and out of hearing, was as pleasing as it was novel. She gazed into the lighted street when Minnie brought her into the front room, and won- dered at the sounds, the movement, the murmur ol the vast city which stretched for miles and miles in every direction. Mrs. Hanson, after the first greetings were over, gave Carrie the baby and pro- ceeded to get supper. Her husband asked a few questions and sat down to read the evening paper. He was a silent man, American born, of a Swede father, and now employed as a cleaner of refrigerator cars at the stock-yards. To him the pres- ence or absence of his wife's sister was a matter of indifference. Her personal appearance did not affect him one way or the other. His one observation to the point was concerning the chances of work in Chicago. \"Its a big place,\" he said. \"You can get in somewhere in a few days. Everybody does.\" It had been tacitly understood before- hand that she was to get work and pay her board. He was of a clean, saving disposi- tion, and had already paid a number of monthly installments on two lots far out on the West Side. His ambition was some dav to build a house on them. In the interval which marked the prepa- ration of the meal Carrie found time to study the flat.

One could see that the furni- ture was of that poor, hurriedly patched together quality sold by the install- ment houses. She sat with Minnie, in the kitchen, holding the baby until it began to cry. Then she walked and sang to it, until Hanson, dis- turbed in his reading, came and took it. A pleasant side to his nature came out here. He was patient. One could see that he was very much wrapped up in his offspring. \"Now, now,\" he said, walking. \"There, there,\" and there was a certain Swedish accent noticeable in his voice. \"You'll want to see the city first, won't you?\" said Minnie, when they were eating. \"Well, we'll go out Sunday and see Lin- coln Park. \" Carrie noticed that Hanson had said nothing to this. He seemed to be thinking of something else. \"Well,\" she said, \"I think I'll look around tomorrow. I've got Friday and Sat- urday, and it won't be any trouble. Which way is the business part?\" Minnie began to explain, but her hus- band took this part of the conversation to himself \"It's that way,\" he said, pointing east. \"That's east.\" Then he went off into the longest speech he had yet indulged in, concerning the lay of Chicago. \"Youd bet- ter look in those big manufacturing hous- es along rr.inkliii Street and just the other side ot the river,\" he concluded. \"Lots of girls work there. You could get home easy, too. It isn't very far.\" Carrie nodded and asked her sister about the neighborhood. The latter talked in a subdued tone, telling the little she knew about it, while Hanson con- cerned himself with the baby. Finally he jumped up and handed the child to his wife. \"I've got to get up early in the morn- ing, so I'll go to bed,\" and off he went, disappear- ing into the dark little bed- room off the hall, for the night. \"He works way down at the stock-yards,\" explained Minnie, \"so he's got to get up at half-past five.\" \"What time do you get up to get breakfast?\" asked Carrie. \"At about twenty minutes of five.\" Together they finished the labour of the day, Carrie washing the dishes while Min- nie undressed the baby and put it to bed. Minnie's manner was one of trained industrv, and Carrie could see that it was a steady round ot toil with her. She began to see that her relations with Drouet would have to be abatidotied. He could not come here. She read trotn the manner of Hanson, in the subdued air ot Minnie, and, indeed, the whole attno- sphere ot the fiat, a settled opposition to anything save a conservative round to toil.

The latter had changed considerably since Carrie had seen her. She was now a thin, though rugged, woman of twenty-seven, with ideas of life coloured by her husband's, and fast hardening into narrower concep- tions of pleasure and duty than had ever been hers in a thoroughly circumscribed youth. She had invited Carrie, not because she longed for her presence, but because the latter was dissatisfied at home.

She wanted to make some reference to their relations upon the train, but was too timid. She concluded by thanking him for his kindness in a crude way, then puzzled over the formali- ty of signing her name, and finally decid- ed upon the severe, winding up with a \"Very truly, \" which she subsequently changed to \"Sincerely.\" She sealed and addressed the letter, and going in the front room, the alcove of which contained her bed, drew the one small rocking-chair up to the open window, and sat looking out upon the night and streets in silent won- der. Finally, wearied by her own reflec- tions, she began to grow dull in her chair, and feeling the need of sleep, arranged her clothing for the night and went to bed. When she awoke at eight the next morning, Hanson had gone. Her sister was busy in the dining-room, which was also the sitting-room, sewing. She worked, after dressing, to arrange a little breakfast for herself, and then advised with Minnie and could probably get work and pay her board here. She was pleased to see her in a way but reflected her husband's point of view in the matter of work. Anything was good enough so long as it paid — say, five dollars a week to begin with. A shop girl was the destiny prefigured for the new- comer. She would get in one of the great shops and do well enough until — well, until something happened. Neither of them knew exactly what. They did not figure on promotion. They did not exact- ly count on marriage. Things would go on, though, in a dim kind of way until the better thing would eventuate, and Carried would be rewarded for coming and toiling in the city. It was under such auspicious circumstances that she started out this morning to look for work. Before following her in her round of seeking, let us look at the sphere in which her future was to lie. In 1889 Chicago had the peculiar qualifications of growth which made such adventuresome pilgrimages even on the part of young girls plausible. ^iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii(iiiiiiiiiiiiiiriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii 636 Unit 7 Entering a New Century: 1880-1914"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"iiiiiMiiniiiniiiniiniii»ijiiiniiiiiiiMiiiiiiiiiniiiiiiiiiii»iniiiiiiiiiiinii»iniMiiniiiiiiniininniiiinnniiiiiiMiiiiiiiiiii[iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii[iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Its many and growing commercial oppor- tunities gave it widespread fame, which made of it a giant magnet, drawing to itself, from all quarters, the hopeful and the hopeless — those who had their fortune yet to make and those whose fortunes and affairs had reached a disastrous climax else- where. It was a city of over 500,000, with the ambition, the daring, the activity of a metropolis of a million. Its streets and houses were already scattered over an area of seventy-five square miles. Its population was not so much thriving upon established commerce as upon the industries which prepared for the arrival of others. The sound of the hammer engaged upon the erection of new structures was everywhere heard. Great industries were moving in. The huge railroad corporations which had long before recognised the prospects of the place had seized upon vast tracts of land for transfer and shipping purposes. Street- car lines had been extended tar out into the open country in anticipation of rapid growth In the central portion was the vast wholesale and shopping district, to which the uninformed seeker lor work usually drifted. It was a characteristic of Chicago then, and one not generally shared by other cities, that individual firms of any pretension occupied individual buildings. The presence of ample ground made this possible. It gave an imposing appearance to most ol the wholesale houses, whose olfices were upon the ground floor and in plain view ol the street. Ihe large plates ot window glass, now so common, were then rapidly coming into use, and gave to the ground floor offices a distinguished and prosperous look. Ihe casual wanderer could sec as he passed a polished array of office fixtures, much frosted glass, clerks hard at work, and genteel business irien in \"nobby\" suits and clean linen lounging about or sitting in groups. Polished brass or nickel signs at the square stone entrances announced the firm and the natine of the business in rather neat and reserved terms. 1 he eiuire metropolitan center possessed a high and niigluy air calculated to overawe and abash the com- mon applicant, and to make the gulf between poverty and success seem both wide and deep. Into this important commercial region the timid Carrie went. She walked east along Van Buren Street through a region of lessening importance, until it deterio- rated into a mass of shanties and coal- yards, and finally verged upon the river. She walked bravely forward, led by an honest desire to find employment and delayed at every step by the interest of the unfolding scene, and a sense of helpless- ness amid so much evidence of power and force which she did not understand. These vast buildings, what were they? These strange energies and huge interests, for what purposes were they there? She could have understood the meaning of a little stonecutter's yard at Columbia City, carving little pieces of marble for individ- ual use, but when the yards of some huge stone corporation came into view, filled with spur tracks and flat cars, transpierced by docks from the river and traversed overhead by immense trundling cranes of wood and steel, it lost all significance in iier little world. It was so with the vast railroad yards, with the crowded array of vessels she saw at the river, and the huge factories over the way, lining the water's edge. Through the open windows she could see the fig- ures of men and women in working aprons, moving busily about. The great streets were wall-lined mysteries to her; the vast offices, strange mazes which con- cerned far-off individuals of importance. She could only think of people connected with them as counting money, dressing magnificently, and riding in carriages. Wiiat they dealt in, how they laboured, to what end it all came, she had only the vaguest concepiion.

The burning question is whether the American people will accept the gifts of events; whether they will rise as lifts their destiny; lohether they will proceed upon the lines of national development. . . . — Albert]. Beveridge Senator from Indiana, in a campaign speech, 1898 Section Focus Beginning in the 1500s, European na- tions built vast colonial empires. By the mid- 1800s, however, many of these colonies had won their independence. The Industrial Revolution pushed several nations into new empire-building. Ger- many, France, Belgium, Portugal, and Japan joined the race for colonies. The United States had grown entirely by expansion on the North American conti- nent. Would the race for empire tempt a once-colonial people to seek colonies of their own? Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss the emergence ol the United States from isolationism. • Cite two examples of arbitration avert- ing war. European colonialism was motivat- ed by trade and adventure, power and profit, idealism and national patriotism. These nations also believed they had a \"civilizing mission\" toward nonwhite populations. The Industrial Revolution generated a need for markets for manufactured goods and new sources of raw materials. Imperialism — the policy of establishing colonies and building empires — answered these needs. New weapons made the subjection of native people easier. Steamships and ocean cables required coaling stations and cable bases; they also tightened control over dis- tant colonies. Isolationism, or separation from the political affairs of other countries, was a policy established early in United States history. George Washington, in his fare- well address, had warned against entang- ling alliances. Later the Monroe Doctrine emphasized the United States' desire to keep the Americas separate from Europe. While Washington had recognized that the United States was too weak to partici- pate in European struggles, James Mon- roe's policy was meant to prevent what he saw as the corrupting influence of Euro- pean affairs on the Americas. Another fac- tor affecting American foreign policy was the Declaration of Independence — based on the idea that people had the right to govern themselves. This key principle argued against any United States colonial ventures. By the 1890s, however, the United States was faced with the opportunity of building a colonial empire. Expansion on the continent was complete, but a Cuban revolt against Spain provided the nation with a timely circumstance with which it could expand beyond its natural bor- der — \"the gifts of events\" to which Bev- eridge referred. The urge to imperialism, practiced by Europe, proved infectious. The United States, like Europe, began to expand its influence onto islands in the Caribbean and South Pacific areas. Securing an American Continent The United States challenged a French expansion effort in 1861. Ignoring the Monroe Doctrine and taking advantage of the United States' divisiveness and its Civil War, the French emperor Napoleon III overthrew the Republic of Mexico.

The purchase of Alaska was in keeping with the Monroe Doctrine. Why then were Americans not eager to make this purchase? hoped to establish a French empire in the Western Hemisphere. The French venture began when Mexi- co's reform government under Benito Juarez (HWAHR uhz) stopped payment of its foreign debts. French, Spanish, and British troops entered the country. The debts were collected and Spain and Britain left, but the French remained and quickly occupied Mexico City. In 1864 Napoleon III installed Austrian prince Maximilian as Mexico's emperor. The United States protested and, alter the Civil War, sent nearly 50,000 troops to the border at the Rio Grande. Napoleon's forces withdrew. The Mexi- cans promptly defeated Maximilian's army and executed Maximilian. The United States had proved willing to back the Monroe Doctrine with h)rce if neces- sary. The purchase ol Alaska removed another North American territory from F.uropean control. Secretary ol State -William 1^. Seward was among those Americans who believed in manifest des- tiny. He envisioned a future United States empire and wanted to expand by annexing Canada, 1 lawaii, and several Caribbean islands. Although he did not achieve this, Seward had i)ne great suc- cess: the purchase of Alaska in 1867. This imdevcloped territory, twice the size of Texas, was inhabited by only about 20,000 people. Although Alaska was hekl by Russia, the tsar saw little value in a territory so unproductive and so far away. In 1867 the Russian minister to the United States informed Seward that the tsar wanted to sell Alaska. In a few hours, the eager secretary of state arranged a treaty in which the United States would buy Alaska for $7.2 million — less than two cents an acre. Americans knew little of Alaska and could not anticipate the dis- covery of gold in 1899 or other valuable resources later. Newspapers called it \"Seward's icebox.\" After four months of selling the idea to Congress, the transac- tion was completed. Charges of bribery to get the deal through, however, further soured the public's attitude toward Alaska and expansion in general for the next ,^0 years.

While commercial shipping reqtiired these supply stations, an armed Battle of Santiago de Cuba by James G. Tyler, 1898 navy needed them evefi more. The sup- plies, according to Mahan, were \"first, fuel; second, ammunition; last of all, food.\" Fuel became essential to shipping as nations switched from sail to steam power at the turn of the century. No ship could steam away from its home port for any great distance without refueling. A fleet that wanted to trade or fight very far beyond its home waters needed coaling sta- tions in distant lands. Mahan did not favor unchecked expansionism. Too many supply and fueling bases in foreign lands, he warned, could drain the resources of the parent country and could become \"a source of weakness, multiplying exposed points, and entailing division of force.\" Making The Technology Connection 1.

He tried, without much success, to include reciprocirv' provisions in the McKinley Tariff of 1890. He was able to chair a Pan-American Congress in Washington, D.C., in 1889. The goal of the group, which later became the Pan-American Union, was to promote economic_cooper- ation and trade between the Americas. Success was limited, however, because the United States intervened, often forcibly, in Latin American affairs. The United States also intervened in, and only temporarily resisted, the temp- tation to annex Hawaii. American mis- sionaries and traders first ventured to Hawaii in the early 1800s. American sugar growers followed. By the 1890s Hawaii was closely connected to the United States through commerce and the many Americans living there. While many nationalities lived in Hawaii, native Hawaiian rulers were controlled by the American business communirv until the Hawaiian Queen Liliuokalani (lee LEE OO oh KAH LAH nee) came into power in 1891. She was determined to return control to her own people. In response, some American business leaders, with the help of marines from the cruiser Boston, took over the government, raised the American flag, and requested that the United States annex the islands. The American minister to Hawaii wrote the Department of State: \"The Hawaiian pear is now fully ripe, and this is the gold- en hour for the United States to pluck it.\" President Cleveland disagreed. He decid- ed that the use of American troops to overthrow the Hawaiian government was a violation of \"national honesty.\" Despite criticism for lowering the Stars and Stripes and \"turning back the hands of civiliza- tion,\" Cleveland withdrew American sol- diers from Hawaii. He also tried, but failed, to oust the revolutionary provision- al government and put Liliuokalani back on her throne.

Challenging Great Britain After the Civil War, the United States appeared ready to take a position among the powers of the world, even if it meant challenging Great Britain. Twice the Unit- ed States forced Britain to submit to arbi- tration, or the settlement of a dispute by an impartial group. In the first case, in 1868, (Charles Sumner, head ol the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, claimed that Great Britain owed the United States more than $2 million in damages for allowing Confederate ships to use British ports during the (^ivil War. If the British would not pay. Senator Sumner declared, the United States shoukl lake British-con- trolled Canada. In 1871 Secretary of State 1 huiiilioii Fish cooled the situation by arranging tor arbitration. Britain did not want to risk war in Canada and feared that a hostile United States might supply Britain's ene- mies with warships. The United States backed down on its demand for \"indi- rect\" damages and agreed to refer the matter to an international arbitration commission. In the resulting Treaty of Washington, the United States was awarded $15.5 million, which Britain promptly paid. The martial spirit in America raised the threat of war with Great Britain again in 1895. President Cleveland requested that the British ptit a long-standing Venezuela- British Guiana boundary dispute to arbi- tration. In July 1895, Secretary of State Richard Olney wrote the British govern- ment that their refusal to arbitrate was a violation of the Monroe Doctrine. He warned: The United States is practically sovereign on this continent and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition. After waiting several months, Britain's for- eign minister answered that the Monroe Doctrine had no standing in international law and did not apply to the Venezuelan situation. Aware of the possibility that his actions might lead to war, Cleveland asked the Congress for authorization to appoint a commission to determine the boundary without consulting Britain. Americans responded with excitement over Cleve- land's bold move, but Britain thought it \"monstrous and insulting.\" for a lew days, war seemed imminent. Britain's fleet was made ready to sail, and American coastal defenses were strengthened. Once again some Americans began to talk of invading C^anada. I'oriunately, events made the British gov- ernment willing to back down. Harly in lanuary 1896, Britain's attention was diverted from Venezuela by a disptite with Germany involving South Africa. Seeking to improve relations with the United States, Linking Across Time Hawaii's Strategic Importance Hawaii's strate- gic position — just a \"hop, skip and a jump \" from Amer- ican shores — made the islands highly attractive to the United States. The government expanded its coal- ing stop at Pearl Harbor into a naval base that proved invaluable in World War II. Attacked by the Japanese on December 7, 1941, the harbor and naval base sus- tained crippling casualties: 18 ships, 200 planes, and 3,700 troops. The United States rebuilt the harbor, however, and ran the victorious Pacific campaign from Pearl Harbor Naval Base.

The boundary settle- ment turned out in Britain's favor and a new era of Anglo-American understanding emerged. The Venezuelan crisis called attention to the fact that the United States had only three modern battleships to pit against Britain's huge fleet. The crisis also popu- larized the writing of an American naval officer, Captain Alfred T. Mahan. Although Mahan's best-known work, The Influence of Sen Power on History, 1660-1783, was published in 1890, it had been delivered as a series of lectures at the new Naval War College in 1886. Mahan believed that as America developed its industrial strength, the nation should look outward. Great nations of the past had built up foreign markets, expanded their merchant fleets, constructed navies to pro- tect their commerce, and planted colonies in distant territories. Mahan argued that a modern nation needed sea power in order to become great. A country that neglected its navy was courting disaster. At first Mahan had more influence abroad than in his own country. Kaiser (Emperor) Wilhelm II of Germany stud- ied his books and instructed German naval officers to read them. In Great Britain Mahan was showered with honors. Mahan influenced rising American leaders such as Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and Theodore Roosevelt and helped to shape United States naval policy. While American commercial interests searched for overseas markets, those who favored naval power worked hard to build the United States navy in the 1880s. Congress established a Naval Advisory Board in 1881 — a group that pressed for ever larger naval appropriations. In 1883 Congress gave the secretary ol the navy authority to construct 1 more cruiser and 3 battleships. By adding 3 heavier and more powerful ships in 1890 and by vot- ing for 13 new ships in 1895, Congress made ir clear that it intended to have a navy capable of matching any enemy on the high seas. The United States moved from twelfth to third place among naval powers by 1900. Its new ships built before 1898 were soon tested in war with Spain. *A*A**A*ik ******* Section One Review *••*•** •**•** Summary The United States increased its influ- ence in the world community from 1861 to 1900.

When captured by Spanish authorities, they demanded protection by the United States. Not all sentiment supported the Cubans, however. American business interests had invested more than $30 mil- lion in Cuba — mostly in sugar plantations — and wanted the revolt to end. Some plantation owners, doubting the capacity of the Cubans for self-government, fa- vored the restoration of Spanish rule. The force of public opinion, however, caused many in the business community to change their minds. Although President Cleveland preserved strict neutrality in the Cuban struggle, he warned that if \"the useless sacrifice of human life\" went on, the United States might have to abandon the policy of \"patient waiting.\" \"Remember the Maine\" President McKinley, who came into office in the middle of the conflict, was also committed to maintaining neutrality. He even offered to buy Cuba to \"avert this terrible calamity\" but was rejected. A peaceful solution seemed possible when Spain recalled General Weyler and offered Cuba a measure of local self-government. Assistant Secretary of the NaNy Theodore Roosevelt was impatient with McKinley's negotiation with Spain and described the President as having \"no more backbone than a chocolate eclair.\" William Ran- dolph Hearst's New York Journal and loseph Pulitzer's New York World fanned pubhc anger with exaggerated and some- times fabricated stories of Spanish atroci- ties in Cuba. This \"yellow journalism\" helped sell papers, but it also encouraged war. Public sentiment in favor of war was growing when, on February 9, 1898, the Journal printed a private letter written by Enrique Dupuy de Lome, the Spanish amba.ssador to the United States, in which he called McKinley \"weak and a bidder for the admiration of the crowd....\" Less stinging, perhaps, than Roosevelt's com- ment, it was a national insult coming 64 S"},{"pageNumber":684,"pageContent":"from a foreigner.

Commodore George Dewey, commander of the United States fleet, would try to prevent a Spanish fleet in Manila Bay from going to sea. As soon as war was declared, Dewey's fleet set sail; it penetrated Manila Bay on May 1 and rapidly destroyed the weaker Spanish fleet.

Many African Americans had responded to the call for soldiers both because they identified with the Cubans' struggle for freedom and because they hoped it would improve their own lot. At least four of these black soldiers were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. At the outbreak of hostilities, an Ameri- can squadron of new battleships under Admiral William T. Sampson was given the task of intercepting a Spanish squadron under Admiral Pascual Cervera (pahs KWAHL suhr VAIR uh). Knowing that Cervera had left the Cape Verde Islands off the west coast of Africa in April, Americans feared he would attack the undefended Atlantic coast of the United States. They canceled hotel reser- vations at seaside resorts and prepared for defense, but Cervera headed directly for Santiago harbor. Sampson's superior force found the Spanish fleet at Santiago and immediately blockaded the harbor. Once the American army took the heights overlooking Santia- go, Cervera had the choice of surrendering or trying to break the blockade.

Section Two Review »»»» Summary The Spanish-American War, though short-lived, demonstrated a number of principles that were to become part of the American tradition. The United States established its willingness to become involved in conflict to help oppressed people and to protect its own self-inter- ests, even though American life and secu- rity were not threatened. The war also demonstrated the power of the media to influence public opinion. A big difference between this and later conflicts was that the United States emerged a clear-cut winner with little loss of life, a matter of great national pride. Checrfng for Understanding 1.

Congress debated what to do about the Philippine Islands. Commercial and in- dustrial interests argued for annexation, but how could colonialism be reconciled with the principles of the Declaration of Independence? If acquired, how should the new territories be governed? Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain why the Philippine Islands were the most difficult of the new colonies to govern. • Discuss the constitutional difficulties involved in colonization. The Spanish-American War and the prospect of expanding in the Pacific brought a change of policy toward the Hawaiian Islands. Cleveland had resisted a move to annex them in 1893, and in 1897 the Senate had turned down an annexation treaty presented by McKinley. But Hawaii, the halfway point between California and the Philippines, would be valuable as a naval base. In July 1898, before the war ended, the Hawaiian Islands were annexed by a joint resolu- tion of Congress. The Philippines The armistice left Americans in con- trol of the Spanish-owned Philippine Islands. The debate over whether or not to acquire and annex the Philippines was a stormy one. Several leading Demo- crats, including former President Grover Cleveland, were opposed. Many influen- tial private citizens agreed with them. Prominent Republicans such as Speaker ot the House Thomas B. Reed and sev- eral senators fought annexation as a vio- lation of American tradition. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge spoke for those who wanted a larger American role in world affairs. Business interests thought ol new markets and fields of investment. Public opinion was excited by the prospect of acquiring an empire. Patriotism merged with belief in social Darwinism, or the belief in the \"survival If the United States was oTthe fittest. the most fit to govern the Philippines, why should it haul down the Stars and Stripes and allow Japan or Germany or some other power to step in and take them?

More than 60,000 troops — tour times the number sent to Cuba — and three years ol fighting were required to suppress the Filipino patriots. At the conclusion ot the fighting, Andrew Carnegie commented to a friend in the government: Actually, Catholic missions had been started in the Philippines in the 1500s. McKinley instructed his peace commis- sioners to ask for all of the Philippine Islands. When Spain resisted, the United States offered to pay $20 million for them.

Resentment against American rule in the Philippines was somewhat relieved in 1901 when Theodore Roosevelt, now President, appointed William Howard Taft as the first civilian governor. Gen- uinely devoted to the interests of the island people, Taft started a program to prepare the Filipinos for self-govern- ment, and public schools were estab- lished. The United States bought out large foreign landowners and passed laws to keep property in the hands of the Fil- ipinos. Taft did not believe that the Philippines would be ready for indepen- dence for many years, though. In 1907 an elective legislature was established, and in 1916 the United States promised the Philippines eventual independence. That independence was finally granted in 1946.

The Supreme Court decided that the Constitution did not cover overseas pos- sessions. Puerto Rico, the court ruled, was a dependency; therefore Congress could set tariffs on its products. Other decisions determined that inhabitants of dependencies enjoyed full civil rights only if granted them by congressional legislation. According to the Teller Amendment, the United States pledged to withdraw from Cuba when order was restored. After three years of civil war, however, the island was in terrible condition. The United States Army remained in Cuba to set up a republican government, oversee Cuban finances, and establish public health and sanitation programs. In 1901, to protect its interests in Cuba, the Unit- ed States Congress added the Piatt Amendment to an army bill. This Amendment, which governed the rela- tions between Cuba and the United States for 33 years, provided that: (1) Cuba should not make any treaty with another nation that weakened its inde- pendence; (2) Cuba should allow the United States the right to buy or lease naval stations; (3) Cuba's public debt should not exceed its capacity to pay; and (4) the United States should have the right to intervene to protect Cuban inde- pendence and keep order. These condi- tions, written into Cuba's constitution and into a treaty with the United States, made Cuba an American protectorate — a nation or region controlled by a stronger state. The attitude that Cuba was part of \"the white man's burden\" was reflected in an editorial by William Allen White in Kansas's Emporia Gazette: Only Anglo-Saxo)is can goveni themselves. The Cubans will need despotic government for many years to restrain anarchy until Cuba is filled ivith Yiiiikees. For almost four years, Cuba was under military rule directed by General Leonard Wood. The greatest achievement of Wood's administration was the suppres- sion of yellow fever. An American medi- cal team under Dr. Walter Reed proved the theory of a Cuban physician, Carlos J. Finlay: that yellow fever was transmit- ted by the stegomyia mosquito. Ameri- can doctors and volunteers allowed themselves to be bitten by mosquitoes, and some of them died as martyrs to medical progress. Major William C. Gor- gas, an army doctor, carried on a cam- paign to eliminate mosquitoes from Havana. By 1901, tor the first time in centuries, there was no yellow fever in the Cuban capital. Life of the Times Imperial Fruits Tropical fruits, such as lemons and oranges, first came to North America in the 1500s by way of the Spanish explorers and mission- aries in Tlorida. But 7nore exotic tropical fruits were unavailable to the average person until the late nine- teenth century. Only wealthy and infuoi- tial Americans and Europeans could afford these rare delicacies. One stu'h person was Benjamin Disraeli, the English prime minister, who proclaimed, \"There is notl.iin^ so delicious as a banana. \" Tropical fruits like bananas, coconuts, and pine- apples appeared on the break- fast tables of ordinary Americans for the first time when steamships reduced travel time from die tropics. Foods such as bananas, which easily rotted, could be transported expeditiously by steamship from the Caribbean islands to the United States. The imperialistic impulse that brought the United States distant colonies ;ilso inspired business entrepreneurs to build plantations, hi 1899 Lorenzo Dow Baker and Minor Keith founded the United Fruit Company; their goal was to own and operate banana plantations in Central America. Baker and Keith realized enormous profits and indirect- ly helped coin the term, \"banana republics' for Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Nicaragua — where American corporations often influ- enced United States policy.

As a result of the Spanish-American War, the country had expanded into the Caribbean and extended its frontier 6,000 miles across the Pacific to the Philippines. Americas attention now turned toward East Asia. Some felt the events of 1898 marked a deviation from American principles. Others thought they were part of the United States' destiny. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss the goals and results of the \"Open Door\" policy in China. • Explain the reasons for McKinley's change in viewpoint on American isola- tionism. American expansion into the Pacific brought closer contact with Pacific Rim nations, par- ticularly China. Several Euro- pean countries, along with Japan, were liercely competing hir trading rights in China. The United States entered a new and complex arena of international poli- tics, more dangerous than any it had expe- rienced before. The problems that arose in East Asia, along with moral questions about Ameri- ca's adventure into imperialism, soon became political issues. In the presidential election of 1900, Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan led the nation- wide debate against imperialism. China and the Open Door At the close of the nineteenth century, it looked as though China, like Africa, would be partitioned, or divided among stronger powers. Though China had a great cultural heritage, its power as a nation had declined during the 1800s. In 1895 Japan easily defeated China and annexed Formosa (Tai- wan) and the Pescadores Islands. In 1898 and 1899, Russia, Germany, France, and Great Britain forced China to lease its ports, some of them for 99 years. Each \"leasehold\" was expected to become the center of a sphere of influence — an area where a European nation controlled eco- nomic development. Although American missionaries had remained in China, Chinese-American trade had slowed since the great days of the tea clippers. By 1898 only 2 percent of China's trade was with the United States, partly as a result of other nations' spheres of influence. The acquisition of the Philip- pines revived American interest in business opportunities in China. Manila, some people predicted, would become as impor- tant a center for commerce with China as the great British port of Fiong Kong. The United States and Great Britain, in order to ensure open avenues of trade with China, decided to oppose the parceling out of Chinese territory. Fhe United States feared that it would not be able to benefit from its possession of Manila if it did not increase its share ol trade with C'hina. Great Britain, controlling 80 percent of the trade, feared that some of its profits would be diverted to other countries. Pearly in 1898 the British government proposed ClIAPIKR 22 IMI'I KIAl ISM 655"},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"a joint declaration with the United States in favor of the \"Open Door\" — with the goal of preserving equal trading opportu- nities in China for all foreign nations. At that time the United States was cool to the idea, but its annexation ot the Philippines changed the American attitude. John Hay, secretary of state, thought that the days ot American isolationism must end. Having defended the acquisi- tion of an overseas empire, he agreed with Great Britain on the policy ot an Open Door in China. In September 1899, Hay sent notes to countries with leaseholds in China asking that they keep the ports open to vessels of all nations on equal terms, set equal tariffs on imports, and charge equal railroad rates within their spheres of influence. Because none of the nations wished to state publicly that it intended to discrimi- nate against the trade of other countries, none disputed these points. Hay immedi- ately announced that the Open Door had been \"guaranteed.\" He was credited in the United States with having achieved a great diplomatic victory. The results of the Open Door notes were less important than they seemed. The polite but evasive replies ot leaseholding countries hardly amounted to a guarantee. Further- more, the notes did not affect exclusive rights to build railroads and exploit natural resources. Hay's well-publicized actions were a serious move into international poli- tics, however, and achieved the goal oi pop- ularizing McKinley's expansionist aims. Boxer Rebellion While loreign countries debated who could control what in China, Chinese secret societies were organizing to oust foreign control. One ol these, the Righ- teous and Harmonious Band, was called the Boxers by westerners, because o'f the physical exercises they practiced. When a falsified stor\\' was printed in sev- eral American newspapers suggesting that westerners were negotiating the dismantling of a Chinese monument, the Boxer Rebel- lion, a violent uprising, broke out. With secret aid from the Chinese government, the Boxers intended to wipe out \"foreign devils\" and their Christian converts. They killed more than 200 foreigners, mostly missionaries and their families. For 7 weeks the Boxers laid siege to foreign embassies in Beijing where 900 diplomats and their fam- ilies held out. These people were finally res- cued by a joint military expedition to which the United States contributed 2,500 troops. During this crisis Hay worked to pre- vent full-scale retaliation and war against China and to persuade the leaseholding powers not to use the Boxer Rebellion as an excuse to partition the country. In July 1900, he sent a second set of Open Door notes. This time he declared that the poli- cy of the United States was to seek ways to \"preserve Chinese territorial and administrative entity.\" Hay did not ask for a commitment and gave no guarantee that the United States would back the policy with force. But he used his influence to decrease the amount China was forced to pay as punishment. Of the $333 million that China paid, $25 million was awarded to the United States. This was more than enough to satisf)' all Americans who claimed to have suffered in the rebellion. As a gesture of good will toward China, the United States returned $17 million. The Chinese government used the money to educate Chinese youths at American universities. The Election of 1900 Imperialism became an issue in the pres- idential election of 1900. In October 1899, an anti-imperialist congress met in Chicago. The delegates denounced the attempt to subdue the Philippines as \"open disloyalty to the distinctive princi- ples ot our government.\" They quoted what Abraham Lincoln said about slavery: When the white nuin governs himself, that is self-government, but when he governs himself and also governs another man, that is more than self-government — that is despotism. 656 Unit 7 Entering a New Century: 1880-1914"},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"In 1900 William Jennings Bryan, again the Democratic candidate, attempted to make imperialism the paramount issue of the presidential campaign.

As much as possible, the Republicans avoided discussion of imperialism, a ques- tion on which they themselves were divid- ed. Adopting the slogan \"the full dinner pail,\" they claimed credit for the country's prosperity during McKinleys administra- tion and predicted a depression if Bryan were elected.

SRS mMi Section Four Review Summary By the end of the nineteenth century, Americans were caught in a dilemma. Tied to the old notions of isolation, they were anxious to capitalize on the increased productivity resulting Irom industrialization. New markets in East Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean were inviting. The call ol commercial ventures ended isolationism — a change further justified by the need to Christianize less fortunate populations. Checking for Understanding 1 .

Roosevelt was resolved that the United States should be a great power. In the Western Hemisphere, he enlarged the scope of the Monroe Doctrine and secured United States domination of the Caribbean. In the Pacific and East Asia, he attempted to keep a balance of power and restrain first Russian, then Japanese, ambitions. He was the first President to interest himself in the peace of Europe. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Give examples of Roosevelt's Stick\" diplomacy. • Discuss America's concerns over Russo-Japanese Wir. Big the Prcsiikiii IvoosL'vcli had a genius h)r the dramatic gesture. He told young men, \"Don't flinch, don't loul, hit iho line hard!\" His actions were sometimes impulsive, some- times luiwise, but he firmly believed that power imposed responsibility. One of Roosevelt's mottoes in foreign policy was a West African saying, \"Speak softly and carry a big stick.\" The \"Big Stick\" was most in evidence in the Caribbean. The acquisition of Puerto Rico and the estab- lishment of a protectorate over Cuba gave the United States a new interest in this region. The acquisition of the Panama Canal Zone showed the nation's willing- ness to do whatever was necessary to fur- ther its interests in the area. The Panama Canal Roosevelt's most dramatic and debated action in the Caribbean was his acquisi- tion of the Panama Canal Zone in 1903. Roosevelt and others believed that in addition to saving time for commercial shipping, a canal would answer the strate- gic need to shuttle warships between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. This was clearly demonstrated during the Spanish- American War. The battleship Oregon, ordered from Puget Sound to Cuba, was forced to steam 14,000 miles around Cape Horn — 3 times as far as if there had been a canal. In the 1880s a French company had made a vain and costly effort to cut through Panama. Early in the 1890s, an American company started to dig a canal through Nicaragua, but soon abandoned the attempt. In 1901 Britain, which also had an interest in the canal, agreed that the United States could build, control, and fortify a canal, providing ships of all nations were charged equal tolls. Immediately, Secretary' of State John Hay offered Colombia, which controlled Panama, $10 million and the yearly rent of $250,000 for the right to construct the canal and control a narrow strip of land on CllAI'lh.R 22 JMI'I.KIAI ISM 659"},{"pageNumber":698,"pageContent":"Examining Political Cartoons President Roosevelt as The World Constable waves ttie \"big sticl<.\" How did Roosevelt defend this policy in Panama?

However, feeling that the price was too low and fearful of losing control of Panama, the Colombian senate unani- mously refused to ratify the agreement. Roosevelt was furious. He considered seizing Panama but settled for letting it THE PANAMA CANAL be known privately that he would not mind if Panama revolted. On November 3, 1903, a revolution (financed by French canal company agents who wanted to recover their investments) broke out on the isthmus, and an independent Repub- lic of Panama was proclaimed. Although the United States had previously agreed to uphold Colombia's sovereignty, a cruiser was sent to assist the revolution- aries. On November 6 the United States recognized Panamas independence. Less than two weeks later the United States and Panama signed a treaty not only allowing the canal, but enlarging the Canal Zone. Roosevelt defended his Big Stick diplo- macy in Panama on the ground that he advanced \"the needs of collective civiliza- tion\" by speeding up the building of an interocean canal. But he also said, \"I took the canal zone and let Congress debate.\" His action was widely condemned in the United States as unjustifiable aggression. In Latin America it aroused dislike and distrust of the United States, the \"Colos- sus of the North.\" The engineering difficulties involved in cutting through the Isthmus of Panama were enormous, and were compounded by the tremendous health problems en- countered in the tropics.

Gorgas, who had cleaned up Havana, reduced the health threats in Panama. The Big Stick Roosevelt, like Cleveland, defended Venezuela from possible European aggres- sion, strengthening the Monroe Doctrine. By 1902 Venezuela owed money to citi- zens of several European countries. Cipriano Castro, the Venezuelan dictator- president, refused either to pay the debts or submit them to arbitration. Roosevelt, who had little sympathy tor Castro, said the Monroe Doctrine did not protect Latin American nations against punish- ment tor misbehavior but only against loss of territory. After consultation with the American State Department, Great Britain and Ger- many, Venezuela's two principal creditors, blockaded Venezuelan ports to force pay- ment. Although there was no threat of annexing territory, the blockade was very unpopular in the United States because it was perceived as a violation ot the Mon- roe Doctrine. Feeling was intensified when Venezuelan gunboats were sunk and Venezuelan ports bombarded. Public anger moved Roosevelt to press for an end of the blockade and the submission of the dispute to arbitration. Although both parties agreed lo arbiir.i lion.

What difficulties were encountered? distrust of the rising German empire, which had the best army in the world and was building a modern navy. He wrote his friend Senator Henry Cabot Lodge that the Germans might take some step \"which will make us either put up or shut up on the Monroe Doctrine.\" In 1903 Argentine foreign minister Luis Drago urged that forcibly collecting debts from bankrupt countries be made a viola- tion of international law. The Drago Doc- trine posed a problem for the United States. If the United States opposed Drago and allowed foreign nations to block the coasts and bombard the cities of default- ing Latin American nations, the door was left open to further aggression. It, howev- er, the United States outlawed forcible collection of debts, it might be pushed into defending financial dishonesty. The President's reply to the Drago Doctrine became known as the Roosevelt Corol- lary, or addition, to the Monroe I^octrine. Whenever an American republic was guilty of \"chronic wrongdoing,\" said Roo- sevelt, the United States might have to intervene itself. 1 he Rooseselt Corollary was first .ipplied in ihe Dominican Republic.

The United States Marine Corps collected the duties and divided them to support the Dominican government and to pay European debts. Many Latin Americans resented the interference of the United States. To charges of imperialism, Roosevelt replied that the United States had no more desire for Dominican territory than \"a gorged boa constrictor might have to swallow a porcupine wrong-end-to.\" Still, the Unit- ed States retained control over the finances of the Dominican Republic until 1941. Roosevelt's successor, President William Howard Taft, continued Roosevelt's poli- cies, but with a shift of emphasis. Taft's secretary of state. Philander C. Knox, pro- moted American business interests abroad, with the slogan, \"Every diplomat a salesman.\" In Latin America this \"dollar diplomacy' resulted in increased sales ot United States goods — including war- ships — and in efforts to increase American investments there. Although Taft described his brand ol diplomacy as \"substituting dollars for bul- lets,\" in Nicaragua he used both. In 1912 marines were sent to Nicaragua to install a government acceptable to the United States, to force acceptance of a loan from New York bankers, and to put the cus- toms office under the control of a former United States colonel. Knox declared that the United States wished only to exercise \"a measure of benevolent supervision.\" But the economic imperialism and armed intervention that he fostered increased the unpopularity of the United States in Latin America. Balance of Po'vver in East Asia Roosevelt realized that the position of the United States in East Asia was weak. He called the Philippines the \"Achilles heel\" ot American defense; they were easi- ly vulnerable to attack by Japan. In China the United States lacked sufficient mili- tary power to enforce Hay's Open Door notes of 1899 and 1900. Equal trading opportunities in China and the preserva- tion of China's territorial integrity lay in maintaining a \"balance of power\" among the nations with ambitions in East Asia. \"The Open Door Policy,\" wrote Roo- . sevelt, \"completely disappears as soon as a powerful nation determines to disregard it....\" China's two closest neighbors, Japan and Russia, were especially threatening. The Japanese had first opened trade with western nations when Commodore Matthew Perry impressed them with a show of naval strength in 1853. From that point on, the Japanese moved quickly to establish an elected parliament, speed industrial development, and build a strong militar)' establishment. Japan believed its manifest destiny was to expand onto the Asian mainland. In 1893 Japan established a protectorate over the inde- pendent kingdom of Korea and obtained Formosa and other islands off China's northeast coast. Japan had designs on the resource-rich Chinese province of Manchuria, in which Russia was already established. The Rus- sians hoped to move into Korea. This clash of interest led to the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. American opinion was at first over- whelmingly pro-Japanese. The Russian tsarist government was unpopular because of its tyranny and persecution. America regarded the Japanese with an almost pa- ternal air because of Commodore Perry's exploits and admired their rapid western- ization. To the astonishment of the world, Japan won victories over Russia both on land and sea. By the summer of 1905, however, both countries were ready to make peace — ^Japan, because it was nearing the end of its resources; Russia, because of fear of revolution at home. The Japanese secretly asked Roosevelt if he would serve as go-between. After consulting the tsar, Roosevelt formally offered to help make peace. Both nations accepted the Presi- dent's proposals and sent diplomats to a peace conference in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in August 1905. The President induced Japan to give up claims for a money indemnity, or payment 662 Unit 7 Entering a New Century: 1880-1914"},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"for damages, and Russia to give up the southern half of the island of Sakhalin (SAK uh LEEN). Japan also took over Rus- sian interests in southern Manchuria. Although Roosevelt was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for bringing hostilities to an end, the Treaty of Portsmouth had unhappy results. By siding with Russia on the indemnity question, he caused such ill feeling in Japan that anti-peace riots broke out in Tokyo. The war itself altered the balance of power in East Asia. Now it was no longer Russian expansion that was most to be feared, but Japanese. Roosevelt himself believed that there was potential danger of war. Both Americans and Europeans were alarmed that the \"yellow race\" might over- whelm the \"white race.\" This idea of a \"yellow peril\" was played up by sensation- seeking newspapers. Resentment against Japanese immigrants led to the segrega- tion of Japanese children in California's public schools. In a complicated series of maneuvers, Roosevelt attempted to soothe Japanese anger, satisfy their ambition, save the Philippines from aggression, and show the Japanese that he was not afraid of them. The President persuaded California to stop discriminating against Japanese chil- dren. Japan in turn agreed to halt the emi- gration of laborers to America. This compromise, arranged in 1907 and 1908, was known as the Gentlemen's Agreement. To check Japanese expansion toward the Philippines, Roosevelt recognized Japan as dominant in Korea and Manchuria. At the same time, he attempted to impress [apan with American naval power by sending an American fleet to Tokyo during its voyage around the world in 1908. The resolution of the Russo-Japanese War was an example of Roosevelt's efforts to use arbitration rather than war to settle controversies. Although his bluster and statements of bravado made him appear ready to lead the nation to war over minor incidents, Roosevelt's actions were usually milder than his words. While he upgraded America's military power, he believed that the United States had an obligation as a leader of an interdependent world to act responsibly and to show restraint. Section Five Review JUIIIIIIIIIITIIfll Summary The personality and Big Stick policy of Theodore Roosevelt dominated the period from 1900 to 1908. He extended Ameri- can influence over Venezuela and Argenti- na. Through the Roosevelt Corollary, he had occasion to exercise police power in the Dominican Republic and the Canal Zone. He even exerted influence in the imperial activities of Russia and Japan as peacemaker in the Russo-Japanese War. William H.

Goods from U.S. protectorates could be taxed, tmlike products exempted from tariffs by the interstate com- merce clause. Congress could determine the extent of citizenship privileges to be granted. United States intervention in foreign countries was accomplished with the use or show of force — sanc- tioned by Roosevelt's Big Stick diplomacy. A war was fought with Spain to liberate Cuba. Confrontations with Great Britain and Germany in Venezuela led to the Roosevelt Corollary sanctioning American involvement in Latin American affairs when the situa- tion warranted. This policy was justified by the popu- lar theory of social Darwinism and acceptance of the \"white man's burden\" to rule over the disadvantaged. Big Stick diplomacy, effective in Latin America where the United States was in a position to back up threats with force, was not practical in the Pacific and East Asia. There a combination of diplomacy and dol- lars allowed this country to engage in trade on an equal basis with other nations. * Using Vocabulary Assume that you are a reporter for an antiadminis- tration newspaper covering the Latin American situa- tion in 1903.

These two do not rightfully belong together. Their present partnership is at once poverty's worst hardship and our worst blunder. — Jacob Riis American journalist, in The Battle With the Slum, 1902 Section Focus The 1900s presented the United States with many challenges and opportunities for change. As city populations exploded with immigrants and rural Americans attracted by jobs, squalid slums and worker discontent also grew. As a result, a variety of politically moderate, middle- class reformers worked to protect, pre- serve, and improve American society in the face ot threats of radical change. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss the role of the muckrakers in promoting social change. • Explain how methods used in business and education influenced social reform. Despite widespread social, polit- ical, and economic change in the late 1800s, the Gilded Age produced no broad effort to improve societ)'. Populism was a large movement, but it was farm-based and did not attract urban workers to its goals. The labor movement was also large, but involved itself primarily with issues related to workers' jobs, wages, and work- ing conditions. Not until the 1890s did Americans begin to show widespread jconcern about the direction in which their society was moving. Alternate periods of prosperity and depression accompanied industrialization in the late nineteenth century. Economic contractions shook the United States in the mid- 1870s and in the mid- 1880s. But the depression that followed the panic of 1893 was the worst the nation had yet seen. As the split between rich and poor became too wide to ignore, Americans of all classes began to ask hard questions about the nation's political and economic systems, and they saw much that alarmed them. Inequality in America Millions of American laborers worked long hours for low wages in the late 1800s. Wages of industrial workers averaged $10 to $12 for a 60- to 80-hour week. One of ever)' 5 women worked, frequently for as little as $6 to $8 a week, and children received even less. If workers were injured in industrial accidents, laid ofl when business slowed, or became unemployed for any reason at all, their income completely stopped. At the other end ot the scale were the immensely rich, people who owned huge yachts, palatial estates, private railroad cars, and summer retreats covering thousands of acres. In 1900, when Andrew Carnegie earned $25 million from his steel company, the average worker made $500. While 20 percent of the nation's fami- lies lived in comfort, 80 percent barely subsisted. A 1904 study estimated that 10 million Americans — 12 percent of the nation's poptilation — were \"underfed, underclothed, and poorly housed. \" Relief for the poor was of little help because it was local, unsystematic, and largely dependent on private charity. It was not just the disparity of wealth that was alarming but also the distribu- tion of political power. Not only did wealthy industrialists seem beyond the reach of government, thev appeared to 672 Unit 7 Entering a New Century: 1880-1914"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"dominate it. At every level of government, Americans could see what newspaper editor William Allen ^X^ite called \"the alliance between government and business to the benefit of business.\" With such vast wealth and power at the top of society and such grinding poverty at the bottom, many Americans feared revolution. Some Americans turned to socialism as the answer. Edward Bellamy's 1887 novel Looking Backward 2000-1887 made socialism seem an attractive alternative to the existing industrial society. His book tells the story of a nineteenth-century person in the United States who awak- ens from a prolonged, hypnotic trance to find himself alive in a socialist paradise in the year 2000. All business has been merged into one big trust run by the people themselves; and there is work and leisure for all, without a trace of poverty or crime. Bellamy's vision of a socialist Utopia made such an impact that his book sold one million copies, and num- erous Nationalist Clubs were founded to advance his ideas. Bellamy had no real program for action, however, and his fol- lowing eventually drifted toward other reform movements. Bellamy's influence, however, was reinforced by other socialist writers. Socialist ideas were widely circu- lated by popular authors such as Jack London and Upton Sinclair. Influential Protestant theologian Walter Rauschen- busch, in his widely read 1907 book, Christianity and the Social Crisis, con- demned capitalism: The force oj the religions spirit should he bent toward asserting the supremacy of life over property. Property exists to n/aimain and develop life. It is unchristian to regard human life as a mere instrunioit for the production ofioealth. Popular labor leader luigcne V.

Progressive Leadership The Progressive Era occupied the first 15 years of the twentieth century. Although the reforms of this period are sometimes called the Progressive Move- ment, that label can be misleading. Unlike the Populists, the progressives were not a political -party. Although a Progressive party was formed in 1912, progressives also were found in both Republican and Democraticr-parties. Nor were progressives united by a geographic section or by an occupation. Instead, they were a broad and largely unorganized group of reform- ers who often worked independently, each seeking solutions to a specific social, eco- nomic, or political problem. Some were local relormers, while others worked for 674 Unit 7 Entering a New Century: 1880-1914"},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"change at state or national levels. The reforms progressives advocated sometimes even conflicted. In spite of their differ- ences, what the progressives shared was their desire to improve society. Also unlike the Populists, the progres- sives were generally not the victims of existing conditions. They were mostly urban middle-class professional men and women who worked as journalists, social workers, educators, and clergy. Although they were not suffering themselves, they sympathized with the victims of what they saw as injustice. Progressives among Catholic priests, Jewish rabbis, and Protestant ministers began to preach a new social gospel that rehgious organizations should work to improve society as well as to meet the spiritual needs ol their congregations. In 1908 the National Council of the Churches of Christ, representing 32 denominations, was founded and pledged to support a program of social reform. In every large city the Salvation Army, a reli- gious group devoted to helping the needy, provided food, lodging, and hope for the despairing and poor. Like the settlement houses ol the late 1800s, urban churches began to consider the whole person by providing recreational facilitites, adult- education classes, nurseries tor children of working women, and counseling for unemployment and alcoholism. The settlement-house movement, which women continued to lead, expand- ed into broader areas of reform such as slum clearance and legislation to limit working hours and outlaw child labor. Florence Kelley left Jane Addams and Hull House in Chicago and founded the National Consumers League, where she organized boycotts of goods produced by children or by workers in unsafe or unhealthful conditions. Another former 1 lull House social worker, Julia Lathrop, became the first head of the federal Chil- dren's Bureau, created in the Department of Labor in 1912 and now part of Health and Human Services. Other female pro- gressives included Carrie Chapman Catt, widely known for her work in the women's suffrage movement. Elizabeth Piatt Decker headed the General Federa- tion of Women's Clubs, which attracted nearly 1 million women in the early 1 900s to promote the arts, education, and community health. Ironically, progressive reformers owed a great debt to the big businesses that so many of them detested. Unlike Populists, who believed that common people could solve society's problems, progressives put their faith in experts. Although critical of the methods and power of business lead- ers, progressives admired their ability to run large companies smoothly and effi- ciently. Progressives were confident that just like the trained managers, scientists, ^ fOj Ida Tarbell 1857-1944 I After teaching school briefly, Ida ;| Tarbell made her career as a writer 1 and editor.

Educators and Investigators In the mid- 1800s, most American col- leges were small, church-supported insti- tutions whose concern was less with knowledge than with shaping the charac- ter of their students. Graduates who want- ed to pursue further studies often went to Germany, where universities awarded an advanced degree, the Ph.D. These students brought back to America a learning style that emphasized questioning and research instead of memorizing facts. They pio- neered changes in American colleges. Coupled with educational reform was a new way of thinking known as pragma- tism, an approach to problem-solving that was popularized by Harvard philosopher William James. Pragmatists questioned the absolute truth of science. They believed that scientific laws stated only what was probably true and that ideas must be tested to see if they worked. By the late 1800s many American col- leges offered courses in social work, eco- nomics, political science, and sociology and granted advanced degrees. Professors such as social scientist Richard Ely at the University of Wisconsin taught students to solve problems pragmatically. At Johns Hopkins University, historian Henry Adams taught students how to do research and told them, \"By the instrumentality of scholars great improvement of society is to be made.\" American colleges thus provid- ed a core of reformers to study society and change it. Pragmatist John Dewey, who taught at the University of Chicago, argued that the value of government actions should be measured by the good they do. Harvard Law School professor Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., was a pragmatist. In his book Examining Photographs In 1903 S. S. McClure. editor and publisher of one of the nation's most popular magazines, decided that the press had a responsibility to expose wrongdoing In society.

When Holmes was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1902, his ideas began to influence its decisions. Other more popular writers played a major role in investigating and exposing a variety of social problems. President Theodore Roosevelt compared these writ- ers to a character in John Bunyan's book. The Pilgrinis Progress, who constantly looked downward and raked filth, and he labeled them \"muckrakers.\" Most muckrakers were journalists who wrote for popular magazines like McChire's Magazine, Costnopolitau. and Collier's. Although similar to the \"yellow journalism\" of the period, these articles were not written to boost sales but because the writers were deeply disturbed by the conditions they uncovered. For example, in 1902 Lincoln Steffens wrote a series of articles f or McClures Magaz ine that described shocking graft and corrup- tion in city governments across the nation. He was followed in the same mag- azine by Ida Tarbell, who exposed the cor- rupt business practices of the Standard Oil Company. In 1906 David Phillips shocked the nation with a series in Cos- mopolitan about links between big busi- ness and 75 United States senators. Other muckrakers revealed the results of their investigations in books. In 1906 John Spargo's Bitter Cry of the Children documented abuses of child labor, and two years later, Ray Stannard Baker's Fol- lowing the Color Line revealed the long pattern of discrimination against blacks in both North and South.

Summary Concerned about the direction society was taking in the early 1900s and fearful of radical remedies, middle class men and women from all professions became part of a widespread effort to bring about reforms. These reformers helped the needy, founded settlement houses, cru- saded lor better working conditions, and called lor child-labor reform. Attorneys and judges reexamined the law to make it relevant to existing conditions. Writers exposed graft, corruption, and deplorable living and working conditions. Educators and social scientists developed new ways to investigate and solve problems. Con- scientious politicians passed laws to reform business and government. Chkcking for Understanding 1.

People began to speak out against chil- dren working in mines, mills, and facto- ries, and for women's suffrage and temperance. Although early accomplish- ments were mainly local changes, later reforms occurred at state and national levels as reform gained ever wider appeal. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain how reforms strengthened democracy. • Describe the advances made in protect- ing adult and child workers. It is fitting that the earliest evidence of progressive activism dealt with cities. Being primarily city residents, pro- gressives were viewed as moderate in political opinion and representative of the increasing importance of the nation's urban centers. What is perceived as the initial progres- sive reform came even before the muck- rakers began to write. This reform was inspired not by a book or a magazine arti- cle but by a natural disaster. Reforms in Government In 1900 a hurricane roared in from the Gulf of Mexico and devastated the coastal city of Galveston, Texas. When the politi- cal niachine that controlled city govern- ment proved incapable of responding to the disaster, local reformers and business leaders convinced the state legislature to allow them to take control. In April 1901, the mayor and city council were replaced by five commissioners chosen in a non- partisan election. Four of the commission- ers were local business leaders who applied their management experience to running the city, and it quickly recovered. Reform- ers in other cities, dissatisfied with their corrupt bosses and inefficient political machines, were impressed. Galveston's experience demonstrated the benefits of running a city like a business, dividing government into departments and placing each under the charge of an expert com- missioner. From the commission plan developed another progressive reform — the city- manager plan. In this reform an elected city council hired a professional manager to run city government, much like the directors of a business would hire a super- intendent to run a factory. Early cit)' man- agers often were engineers, because much of the business of running a modern city — such as sewage disposal, water sup- ply, and paving streets — was technical in nature. By 1915 more than 400 cities had adopted commission or city-manager plans. Even in cities where progressives could not reshape government, reform mayors fought powerful combinations of political bosses, unethical business leaders, and corrupt city officials. Mayors such as Tom Johnson in Cleveland, Samuel \"Golden Rule\" Jones in Toledo, and Hazen Pingree in Detroit gained national attention. All three left successful businesses to battle corruption in city government and to 678 Unit?

At the state level, political reform was first achieved in Wisconsin Robert La Follette, after twice failing to become Republican candidate for governor, finally was elected in 1900. He used his office to attack the tradition of party nominating conventions. Because parry bosses con- trolled the selection of convention dele- gates, they also controlled^tlie selection of election candidates. From his own experi- ence, La Follette knew that reformers had little chance of being chosen to run for office. In 1903 he pressured the state leg- islature to require that each party hold a direct primary, a preliminary election in which voters choose candidates for the general election. This reform took the nomination of parry candidates from the bosses and their political machines and gave it to the people. To reduce the control that big business and the party bosses had over state legislators. La Follette introduced three other reforms. The initiative allowed a group ot citizens to introduce legislation and required the legislature to vote on it. The referendum allowed proposed legis- lation to be submitted to the voters for approval, and the recall allowed voters to remove an elected official from office by holding a special election. Although none of these ideas originated icu Wisconsin, La Follette's great success in achieving them there gave the state a reputation as \"the laboratory of democ- racy,\" and progressives in other states copied Wjscp nsJilS-Jefo r m.s . It was difficult to argue that the people should have a greater voice in government without including women, especially because they were increasingly holding jobs in factories, business offices, and schools, as well as taking prominent roles in reform movements. In addition, some progressives believed that if women gained the right to vote, their influence would help push through other reforms.

Itah and Idaho WET NOT XIV NEBBISEA? By 1914, 11 western states had granted women full suffrage. In the East, women promoted their cause by holding parades and circulating petitions. Many women believed, however, that a constitutional amendment would be needed to gain the vote nationwide. The most significant political reform that the progressives accomplished at the national level was the direct election of senators. The United States Senate had long been known as a \"millionaires' club.\" In 1905 muckraker Charles E. Russell described senators as nothing more than \"butlers for industrialists.\" Because they were chosen by their state legislatures, senators were shielded from direct public pressure. Progressive reformers telt that if its members were elected, the Senate would be more responsive to the public will and less influenced by powerful busi- ness interests. The call for this reform became so great that in 1913 the Seven- teenth Amendment to the Constitution provided for direct election of senators. Consumer Protection A basic principle that American busi- ness inherited from Great Britain was cai^eatemptor, or \"let the buyer beware.\" This meant that people who purchased worthless life insurance, bread made with sawdust, or colored water labeled as medicine had only themselves to blame for not being more careful. Progressives argued that consumers had no way of knowing when meat was prepared under unsanitary conditions, children's cough syrup was dosed with opium, or other products were similarly misrepresented. In 1905 Ch arles E van s Hugh es, a lawyer who worked for the New York leg- islature, investigated the insurance indus- try. He uncovered bribery of elected officials and huge salaries insurance execu- tives paid to themselves and to family members they hired. Consequently, New York — and later other states — passed laws to regulate insurance companies and to protect the interests of policyholders. Hughes used his reputation as a progres- sive reformer, gained from this investiga- tion, to become the governor of New York in 1907 and a Supreme Court justice in At the local level, protection for con- sumers ofi:en came in the form of city zoning laws. The laws regulated how land and buildings could be used. Building codes prohibited some of the worst fea- tures of tenements by setting minimum requirements for light and air, fire escapes, room size, and sanitation. 680 Unit 7 Entering a New Century: 1880-1914"},{"pageNumber":719,"pageContent":"Passage of pure food and drug laws demonstrated the effectiveness of the muckrakers in influencing consumer protection.

There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roof would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it. Examining Photographs Factory workers make sausage in 1906. What does the Food and Drug Administration do? An outraged President Theodore Roo- sevelt demanded reform, and Congress responded with legislation. The Pure Food and Drug Act established a govern- ment agency, the Food and Drug Admin- istration, to protect consumers from unsafe medicines and foods. The Meat Inspection Act was passed on the same day in 1906. These laws regtilated the content and inspection of food, prohibit- ed the use of addictive drugs in non-pre- scription medicines, and required accurate labels on lood and drug products. Because the Constitution gave Congress control only over interstate commerce, state gov- ernments followed with similar legislation to regulate food and drugs that did not cross state lines. Protecting Workers \"I aimed at the public's heart, \" Upton Sinclair complained, \"and by accident I hit it in the stomach.\" Sinclair did not intend The Jungle to focus public atten- tion on impure food. Instead he wanted to expose the terrible working conditions in slaughterhouses. One ol the grim reali- ties of industrialization was the frequency of industrial accidents. Until the twentieth century, workers who suffered industrial accidents had lit- tle protection. Employers argued that industrial accidents were not caused by unsafe conditions but by carelessness, and they often fired employees who were seri- ously disabled. The tew injured workers who could afford to hire lawyers and sue their employers found that neither judges nor legal precedent were on their side. And with no income, they seldom had enough money to afford medical treat- ment or to get through a long period ot recovery. Impressed by what Germany and New Zealand were doing about this problem, progressives joined labor union leaders to pressure state legislatures tor workers'- compensation laws. These laws estab- lished insurance timds into which employers made payments. Workers who were injured by industrial accidents were paid trom the fund.

Examining Photographs A major concern of reformers was protecting chil- dren, l-low was ctiild labor reform achieved? 10 of the states had workers'-compensa- tion laws on the books. Workers'-com- pensation laws not only helped injured workers, they improved working condi- tions for all workers because employers with low accident rates paid lower insur- ance premiums. Related progressive legis- lation established state agencies to inspect factories, limited workers' hours, and attempted to end crowded, unsanitary work environments. Many progressives involved in labor reform were especially interested in improving working conditions for women. By 1900 about 20 percent of all workers were women, and progressive reformers believed women workers need- ed special protection. In 1903 Oregon passed a law limiting female factory work- ers to a 10-hour day. Employers chal- lenged the law as violating a woman's civil right to work as long as she chose, and in 1908 the case was appealed to the Supreme Court. To defend the law in Midler v. Oregon, progressive attorney Louis D. Brandeis presented research data gathered by his sis- ter-in-law, Josephine Goldmark, and by Florence Kelley, both of the National Con- sumers League. The data convinced the Court that long working hours damaged women's health, and the Oregon law was upheld. After the Muller decision, several other states quickly passed similar laws. Aiuller V. Oregon was a revolutionary legal decision. For the first time, the Court looked beyond legal principles and precedents and applied pragmatism to the law. The Court began to weigh what was best for society when it decided cases. In so doing, it took the first step in becom- ing an instrument of social reform. Probably the most emotional progressive labor reform was the campaign against child labor. Although children typically worked on family farms, urban children found factory work monotonous and con- ditions often unhealthy or dangerous. Children were often treated like adult workers. One foreman stated that his child workers \"don't have many accidents, once in a while a finger is mashed or a foot, but it does not amount to anything.\" Reformers established a National Child Labor Committee in 1904 to campaign for the abolition of child labor. Muckrak- er John Spargo's 1906 book, The Bitter Cry of the Children, presented detailed evi- dence of the conditions of child labor in America. He told of anthracite coal mines, where thousands of \"breaker boys \" were hired at age 9 or 10 to pick slag out of coal and were paid 60 cents for a 10- hour day. He described how the work per- manently bent their backs and often crippled their hands. He revealed that in textile mills more than one-eighth of the employees were less than 1 6 years old, and that some children entered cotton facto- ries at age 7 or 8. Spargo reported that: During the long weary nights many children have to be kept awake by having cold water dashed on their faces, and when morning comes they throw themselves upon their beds — often still warm from the bodies of their brothers and sisters — without taking off their clothing. . . .[Do not] judge the ages of working children by their physical appearance, for they are usually behind other children. ..as much as two or three years. 682 Unit 7 Entering a New Century: 1880-1914"},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"Public opinion was so stirred by such information that by 1914 all but one state set a minimum age for employment, and many established other limits on child labor as well. At the federal level, the newly established Children's Bureau had few powers, but it investigated and pub- lished information that helped the cam- paign to improve the well-being of child workers. Varieties of Reform In addition to reforming labor practices, many progressives insisted that business be regulated in ways to protect the public interest. Because of their great influence and power, large corporations commonly got tax breaks from state legislatures. In Wisconsin, for example, Governor La Fol- lette determined that railroads paid less than half the property taxes of other busi- nesses, and he obtained reform laws to tax railroads more equally. In addition, he established a commission of experts — many from the University of Wisconsin — to regulate the operation of railroads in the state. Other states followed Wiscon- sin's lead. On the federal level, Congress began to tax corporate profits in 1909. Although the Supreme Court in 1895 had declared an income tax unconstitutional, in 1913 the Sixteenth Amendment empowered the federal government to levy such a tax. The Progressive Era also was a time when reformers called for regulation of public utilities such as street-car lines, waterworks, and electric-light companies. Many states set up public service commis- sions with the power to control the rates charged by public utilities. Some cirv reformers, doubiful that regulation could force utility companies to act in the pub- lic interest, called for citv governments to buy them out and run the utilities direct- ly. By 1915, for example, all but 1 of the 36 largest cities owned or operated their own waterworks. Progressive reform expressed itself in many other ways. It resulted in play- groimds and dental clinics for children. The Boy Scouts, Campfirc (iirls, .iiul (iirl Scouts were founded during ibis period. Private charities multiplied and broadened their social usefulness. The Rockefeller Foundation, for example, led a campaign to eradicate hookworm, which was caus- ing serious health problems in rural areas of the South. Juvenile courts and reform schools were established to care for young lawbreakers. Progressives began to show concern about America's natural resources. State and federal governments passed con- servation laws and set aside public recre- ation areas. The reform impulse also resulted in great progress in education. Many states passed laws requiring children to attend school, and the number of high schools more than doubled between 1900 and 1920. The school year was lengthened Life of the Times Boy Scouts While many progres- sive reformers focused on social issues, such as worker protection, tax- reform, and temper- ance, others concen- trated on keeping the nation's youth under control. Without farm chores to co>nmiind their fill attention, urban hoys were becoming, to their parents' dismay, an unsuperi'ised leisure class.

The Boy Scouts of America was designed, in part, to reinforce what were perceived at the time to be traditional American male values.

The pragmatism of philosopher John Dewey influenced schools to revise their traditional curriculum and offer studies relevant to the needs of modern society. Among the most controversial progres- sive reforms was the campaign for family planning. Margaret Sanger, a nurse who worked with poor residents of New York's Lower East Side, came to believe that high birth rates, poverty, and infant mortality were related. In 1914 she began a move- ment to educate women about family planning. Although Sanger faced strong opposition, and was twice arrested tor vio- lating obscenity laws, her organization endured to become the Planned Parent- hood Federation. Some progressives saw tejnpetarice as another reform to protect women anS children, arguing that money spent for alcohol deprived families of necessities, and that drunken men sometimes beat their wives and children. Others supported it because of the well-known connection between saloonkeepers and corrupt city politicians. Temperance also had the support of many business leaders, who believed that alcohol use among their employees increased absenteeism, decreased efficiency and productivity, and contribut- ed to industrial accidents. Long at the forefront of the temperance movement was the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), founded in 1874. By 1890, it already had 150,000 members. The WCTU was typical of many progressive organizations. While its main focus was a crusade against the use of alcohol, it spoke out on a variety of issues and supported other changes such as women's suffrage, prison reform, and world peace. Like so many progressive reforms, temperance was first accomplished at the local level. By 1914 nearly half the people of the United States lived in areas where the sale of alcohol was illegal, and 12 states had passed statewide Prohibition laws. In 1919 Prohibition became nation- wide when the Eighteenth Amendment was added to the Constitution. !! Section Two Review !»***! Summary Although some progressive reforms were national in scope, most occurred at the state and local levels. The power of political bosses was reduced by reforming the structure of city governments and through primary elections. Other political reforms also gave voters a more direct voice in government at all levels. Legisla- tion protected consumers from poor products and workers from horrible work- ing conditions and disabling injuries. Although court decisions did not always reflect the reform spirit, a wide variety of reforms were accomplished in govern- ment, the economy, and society. Checking for Understanding 1.

Through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Ameri- cans subscribed to the adage that the best government was the least government. For more than 100 years, govern- ment planning generally was limited to tariff policy. Social programs did not exist. As a result, government was small in size and limited in function. But beginning in the Pro- gressive Era, reformers planted the seeds of a new concept — that government was responsi- ble for maintaining a stable, smoothly functioning, and just society. This goal could be achieved, they believed, through planning and control by expert managers. In this belief, government bureaucra- cy — and \"big government\" — was born. Before the Progressive Era government generally reacted to social problems by passing legisla- tion directed at specific condi- tions — the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, for example. But after 1900, areas of concern were increasingly managed by \"bureau- crats\" — unelccted officials who provided daily oversight in their specialties. Ciovernment grew rapidly as new executive agencies arose to fulfill this regulatory function. The Department of Commerce, created in 1903, pro- vided President Theodore Roo- sevelt the business experts he need- ed to battle the trusts, as this 1904 cartoon depicts. In his progressive Theodore Roosevelt about to battle the trusts. campaign for President in 1912, Woodrow Wilson summarized the new approach to government by saying \"America stands for a gov- ernment responsive to the interests of all.\" This theme was echoed in 1913 when a new Department of Labor began to promote worker welfare. The progressive ideal of the rela- tionship between government and society inspired President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal programs aimed at achieving recovery from the Depression of the 1930s. New agencies like the Social Security Administration involved gov- ernment in social planning by providing for aged, dependent, and disabled Americans. The progressive spirit was extended again in the 1960s as President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society established the Equal Employment Opportu- nity Commission, the War on Poverty, and many other govern- ment protections and programs. Today, of more than 90 inde- pendent executive agencies and commissions, about two-thirds are involved in some way in regulating society or in protect- ing its members. All but one of these agencies were created during or after the Progressive Era. Partly because of the progres- sives nearly a century ago, gov- ernment began to take on more and more functions, and the \"hands-off\" government of the late 1800s began to change to the \"hands-on\" government of today.

Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe progressive attitudes about immigrants and racial minorities. • Explain why black leadership changed. effective campaigns on a smaller scale. The federal government also was more difficult to prod into action. The Senate, chosen by boss-dominated state legislatures until 1913, was a highly conservative body. In the House of Rep- resentatives, powerful figures such as committee heads and the speaker usually resisted change. The Supreme Court became somewhat less conservative than it was in the 1890s, as progressives Oliver Wendell Holmes (1902), Charles Evans Hughes (1910), and Louis D. Brandeis (1916) were appointed to the Court. Yet the majority of justices seldom were willing to extend federal power into new areas. The Court demonstrated this reluctance when it declared unconstitutional a federal law providing workers compensation for rail- road workers in 1908 and a federal child labor law in 1918. Partly because of the attitude of the courts, many of the evils described by the rrmgkrakers — child labor, city corruption, and industrial accidents, for example — were considered outside the constitutional sphere of the federal governments powers, making national reform of these conditions nearly impossible. The benefits of progressivism were spread unevenly in othet ways, too. Many middle-class progressives feared labor unions almost as much as they did trusts. So although progressives worked with labor leaders to improve working conditions, few objected when businesses organized effectively to prevent unions in their plants — often with cooperation from local courts and police. Therefore, wage gains during the Progressive Era came only among skilled workers. The earning power of unskilled workers — the largest part of the labor force — actually dropped because prices increased more rapidly than their rates of pay. The achievements of progressive reform at the national level were less far-reaching than its suc- cesses at local and state levels. It was more difficult to create nationwide demands for reform than to organize Reformers and Immigrants Among the many factors that held down the wages of unskilled workers was the continuing flood of immigrants 686 Unit 7 Entering a New Century: 1880-1914"},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"to the United States, averaging one million a year during the Progressive Era — largely from southern and eastern Europe. This \"New Immigration\" caused widespread alarm, as immigrant men and women competed for unskilled jobs in American mines, mills, and factories.

As middle-class reformers, pro- gressives wanted to change capitalism, not abolish it. Many also worried about pre- serving existing values and culture. There- fore, many progressive reforms weakened the political strength of immigrant num- bers and instilled in newcomers what reformers thought were proper American values.

When progressives reformed government by defeating political bosses and machines, they also destroyed the system that provided immigrant groups with a political voice, political jobs, and political power. As reformers obtained child labor laws and compulsory school attendance laws, they forced immigrant children out of factories and into classrooms. Many states made the study of American history a required course in public schools during the Progressive Era. Educator John Dewey advised that it was essential to teach stu- dents to be good citizens. Immigrant groups opposed many pro- gressive reforms. Many poor immigrants needed their children to work to aid the family income. Those from countries where drinking wine or beer was accept- able behavior objected to attempts to force temperance on them. Many immigrant women resisted the efforts of settlement-house social workers to teach them about \"proper\" diet, hygiene, or child care. 688 Unit?

Like the majority of Americans at that time, most progressives believed that nonwhite races were inferior. Therefore, reformers did not object to the segregation of Japanese Americans in San Francisco schools in 1906, nor did they oppose sharp cuts in Japanese immigration to the United States that began in 1907. In addition, progressives generally accepted widespread discrimination against African Ajnericans. Although many pro- gressives sympathized with their plight, most reformers agreed with Theodore Roosevelt, who stated that blacks \"as a race and in the mass are altogether inferior to the whites.\" Few progressives objected to the Jim Crow laws that southern states had passed after Reconstruction to restore segrega- tion. In 1896, when the Supreme Court ruled in Pjes sy v. Ferguson that^ segregation was constitutional as Idng as separate facilities were equal, no progressive cam- paign was launched for reform. While southern whites were lynching black peo- ple and barring them from voting or holding public office, progressives were crusading for primary elections, direct election of senators, and other reforms to spread democracy. Like most whites, pro- gressives generally accepted the Souths - Jim Crow system , partly due to inditler- ence, and partly because northern blacks also were restricted to low-paying jobs, segregation, and inferior social status. These circumstances help explain a shift in black leadership during the Progressive Era. At the turn of the century the most influential black leader was Booker T Washingt^n^ A- fotmfiJ'-siavei -Washington founded Alabama's Tuskegee Institute in 1881 to train African Americans in 30 trades. Washington argued that equality would be achieved not through campaigns for reform, but when blacks gained the education and skills to become valuable members of their communities. In 1895 he spelled out this view: Examining Photographs To blend immigrants into American society, settlement liouse social workers organized recreational activities, visited immigrants' homes, conducted home- making and parenting classes, and worked with individual families.

No race that has anything to contribute to the markets of the world is long in any degree ostracized. Yet as the great changes in society that accompanied progressive reform largely bypassed African Americans, a new black leadership arose that rejected Washing- ton's approach to achieving equality. The most prominent new black leader was W. E. B. Du Bois, a Harvard-educated histo- ry professor at Atlanta University. Du Bois rejected Washington's emphasis on job skills and argued that suffrage was the way to end white supremacy, stop the ^ lynching of blacks, and gain better schools. In 1905 Du Bois and 28 other black leaders met at Niagara Falls to demand full political rights and responsi- bilities for African Americans as well as an end to racial discrimination. This call eventually resulted in the founding of the National Association for the Advance- ment of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909. \"The power of the ballot we need in sheer self-defense,\" he said, \"else what shall save us from a second slavery?\" Despite the failure of most progressives to be concerned about such questions, progressive reform helped change Ameri- can society in many ways. Although they excluded large groups from their efforts, the progressives expanded democracy, reformed education, and improved the quality of life for millions of men, women, and children.

While all progressives want- ed \"progress\" for society, they disagreed over what that meant.

In addition, progressives generally agreed with the racial attitudes of most Ameri- cans in the early 1900s. Asian v\\mericans and African Americans were bypassed by progressive reform.

That artificial turf must have been too slippery to play on.\" Couldn't there be other reasons the team lost? The state- ment that you heard is an example ot a fallacy in a line ot reasoning. Explanation A fallacy in a line of reasoning is an error in thinking something out. The fallacy may be an unsupported argument or a mistaken conclu- sion. In the above example, it was a fact that your team played on artificial turf. It was also a lact that your team was defeated by 20 points. But to say that it lost because the artificial turf was too slippery is a fallacy. The other team won while playing on the same turf, so there must have been other reasons your team lost. More facts are needed to explain it. To determine whether there is a fallacy in a line of reasoning, ask the following questions: • Is there any connection between the facts and the conclusion? If not, the statement contains a fallacy. If there is a connection, go on to the next question. • is thcie oiiK' .1 loose connection l)ctwcen the facts and the conclusion?

But more facts are needed to support that abili- ty' was the reason. What roles did Lick of educational opportunities for women and biases of male bosses play? The co)iclusioii that women did )wt have management ability is not supported. The reasoning contains a fallacy.) In the late 1800s immigrants lived in the poorer sections of American cities. This indicates that they did not care about how they lived. (There is a loose connection between the fact a)id the concluding statement, but more infor- mation is needed to explain why inimigmnts lived in the poorer sections of American cities. In reality, immigrants held the least desirable low- paying jobs and often did not have the educational opportunities that would have given them the skills needed to perform the higher-paying jobs.

Influenced by German education and American prag- matism, these reformers — called \"progressives\" — were the first to thoroughly investigate a variety of social problems that they felt were unjust and undemocratic. Progressives were concerned that if society's problems were not solved, democracy and capitalism might be threatened. The growing popularity of socialism in the early 1900s seemed to confirm their fears. Progressives believed that the methods developed to manage big businesses in the late 1800s could be applied to running the country. Their goal was an effi- cient, smoothly functioning nation where each social problem could be managed by experts trained in that area. The many areas in which the progressives focused their efforts included the following: reform of the political system, business regulation, consumer protection, immigrants, tax reform, protection of women and children, labor reform, education, and temperance. Journalists called muckmkers brought many of these problem areas to public attention, and most Americans supported calls for change. Reform occurred first at local and state levels. Many went on to be national in scope. While progressives had the nation's best interests at heart, some reforms came at the expense of immigrant and racial minorities. Reformers tried to extinguish immigrant cultures and they neglected African Ameri- cans almost completely. With America's entrance into World War I, the pro- gressive reform fervor slackened. Instead, people turned their attention to world affairs. * Using Vocabulary Imagine that you are a muclcraker who is investigat- ing the need for reform in your city.

Chances are that you would take the comment to mean that the color of your jacket makes you stand out in a crowd. On second thought, however, you might decide that the comment was not meant as a compliment but as a criticism of your jacket. Situations such as the one described above arc not unconinion. I'hey ohen happen because someone has made an ambiguous or equivocal statement. An ambiguous statement is a statement that is unclear or misleading by accident. An equivocal statement is a statement that is unclear or misleading on purpose. Both can be interpreted in a variety of ways and can be confusing, twisted, or contradictory. To identify an ambiguous or equivocal statement ask yourseh the following questions: • Is the statement unclear and or not understandable? • It the statement is clear, can it be interpreted or understood in more than one way? It your answer is \"yes\" to both questions, you have identified an ambiguous or equivocal statement. Example Look at the following statements and the comments in italics accompanying them: l.\"0 kings, lords and rulers ot us all, listen to our plea!\" (This statement is clear but can be interpreted in more than one way. Are kings being called lords and rulers, or are three different kinds of leaders being addressed?) 2. The spirit of progressive reform resulted in dental clinics and playgrounds tor children. (This statement is unclear. Were the dental clinics for children, too, or only the playgrounds?) On first reading, the statements above may have seemed perfectly clear. However, after reading the questions that follow each of them, you can see why some people would consider them ambiguous or equivocal. Practice Read the tollowing passage carefully, check- ing each statement to determine if it really is clear and understandable. Identify' those statements that are ambiguous or equivocal: John Dewey was a well-known philosopher and educa- tor He believed that ideas are plans of action that serve their purpose by solving problems.

And with Roosevelt's first speeches, their worst fears were realized. The President made it clear that he intended to carry out his pledge of a \"square deal.\" Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain why Theodore Roosevelt became known as a \"trust buster.\" • Identify the series of events that led to settlement of the 1902 coal strike. • Examine Roosevelt's efforts for conser- vation of wilderness areas. • Discuss Roosevelt's legacy to the United States. When Theodore Roosevelt received the Republican vice-presidential nomina- tion in 1900, the powerful Republican leader Mark Hanna warned that there would be only one life between \"that cowboy\" and the White Fiouse. When the election resulted in a Republican victory, F^anna turned to McKinley and said, \"Now it is up to you to live.\" But McKinley would not live. After McKinley's assassination in 1901, Theodore Roo- sevelt — the \"cowboy,\" the reformer, the progressive — did indeed become President of the United States. The Trust Buster After McKinley's death, Roosevelt had promised America that he would \"contin- ue absolutely unbroken the policy of Pres- ident McKinley.\" Not having become President by election, though, Roosevelt felt he did not have the authority to push a general program of reform through Congress. Even members of his own party urged him to \"go slow.\" During this time, however, industries were merging at an all-time high rate. This was especially evident with the for- mation of the United States Steel Corpo- ration, which produced more than half of America's steel, and the Northern Securi- ties Company, which tried to attain a monopoly of northwestern railroads. This rash of mergers prompted Roosevelt to urge Congress to pass legislation regulat- ing big business. When Congress did not respond, Roo- sevelt went to the American people, mak- ing a series of speeches to garner support for his program. The response was over- whelming — every day Roosevelt's popu- larity grew. And government leaders responded by beginning a series of moves designed to limit the trusts. First, the attorney general took Northern Securities to court. In 1904 the Supreme Court overturned previous court decisions and ruled that Northern Securities had violated 696 Unit?

This decision resulted in the dissolution of Northern Securities. Roosevelt was not opposed to all trusts, however. He also understood that trust- busting suits were not the most effective means of regulating business; they did not prevent monopolies but only tried to break them up after they had already been formed. But Roosevelt was less interested in the economic effects of carrying out antimonopoly laws than he was in using them to force even the most powerful businesspeople to obey the law. Still, Roosevelt's reputation as a \"trust buster\" grew. When he thought that a trust damaged the public or worked out- side the law, he acted quickly. At one time, |. i'icrpont Morgan, tlie brilliant billionaire financier who helped construct both the United States Steel and the Northern Securities trusts, asked Roo- sevelt, \"Are you going to attack my other interests?\" Roosevelt responded, \"Cer- tainly not, unless wc find oiu ih.it in any case they have done something we regard as wrong.\" Eventually, Congress followed Roo- sevelt's lead regarding the regulation of trusts and, in 1^)0.^, passed the Expetlition Act, which gave Federal antitrust suits precedence on the dockets of circuit courts. A few days later, an act of Con- gress also established the Department of Commerce and Labor, empowered to investigate corporations involved in inter- state commerce. In addition, the Depart- ment ot Justice started more trust-busting suits against corporations than they had at any time during the three previous administrations. And in most of these cases, the government won. The Coal Strike of 1902 One of the most prolonged strikes in United States history started in May 1902, when nearly' 150,000 workers walked out of the anthracite mines of eastern Penn.sylvania. Terrible conditions precipitated this strike: low wages and fre- quent layoffs were common for the anthracite miners, whose earnings aver- aged less than $300 per year. Living in cheaply built company towns, the cash- poor miners were forced to trade at com- pany stores that charged exorbitant prices. Such conditions drew widespread public support tor the strikers.

He asked mine operators to consider allowing three men, two of them clergy, to determine whether miners' wages were adequate. But George F. Baer, principal spokesperson for the mine employers, refused Mitchell's sugges- tion, saying that \"anthracite mining is a business and not a religious, sentimental, or academic proposition.\" Baer further alienated a public already sympathetic to the plight of the workers when he refused to listen to the miners' complaints, to sub- mit to arbitration, or to recognize the United Mine Workers as the true represen- tative of the mine workers. This attitude and the strong conviction behind the min- ers' position caused the strike to drag on, through the summer and into the fall, with no prospect of settlement. Appeals for action poured in to the President. Roosevelt had no power, either by law or by precedent, to force the mine opera- tors and miners to come to an agreement. Yet he resolved to use whatever influence he had to end the strike. Early in October, Roosevelt invited representatives of the operators to meet Mitchell at the White House. Nothing was accomplished in this stormy session, but public opinion soured even more toward the employers. Faced with this deadlock, Roosevelt considered a legally questionable seizure oi the mines by federal troops. But before he decided on such drastic action, a com- promise was reached. After a conference between Elihu Root, the President's repre- sentative, and J. Pierpont Morgan, whose banking firm indirectly controlled most of the anthracite mines, Morgan was able to put enough pressure on the operators to force them to back down.

Theodore Roosevelt, a Theodore Roosevelt and John Miiir at Yosemhe Ndiiniud Park champion oi conservation, made an effec- tive case for the wise and scientific use of natural resources to people of all ages. To the Society of American Foresters in 1903, Roosevelt said, 'Tirst and foremost, you can never afford to forget for one moment what is the object of forest policy Your attention should be directed not to the preservation of the forests as an end in itself, but as the means for presei\"ving and increasing the prosperity of the nation.\" His 1907 Arbor Day message to school children said in part, \"Within your lifetime the nation's need for trees will become serious You will want what nature once so bountiful- ly supplied and man so thoughtlessly destroyed; and because of that want you will reproach us, not for what we have used, but for what we have wasted \" Making The Environment Connection 1.

We are witnessing not merely the ending of the coal strike, but the definite entry of a powerful government on a novel sphere oj operation. Efforts at Conservation Hven before Iheodore Rooseveli be- came President, the nation was adopting a policy of conservation. In 1872 an act of Congress created Yellowstone National Park, and the 1890s saw the establish- ment of four more national parks. In 1891 Benjamin Harrison's administration enacted the Forest Reserve Act, empower- ing Presidents to set aside land for national forests. But it was not until after Theodore Roosevelt took office that \"conservation \" became a household word. Roosevelt's efforts to preserve the nation's natural resources stemmed from a deep commitment to conservation, born of a love for America's wilderness. Before this time, great forests had been felled without thought of erosion or Riture timber needs; grasslands turned barren from overgrazing and overplanting; and the indiscriminate slaughter of wildlife had resulted in the ex- tinction of many species, such as the pas- senger pigeon. Roo,sevelt's beliefs made conservation popular. He stimulated public interest in the subject by writing, and by taking pub- licized holiday trips to the West, by con- stantly pushing for better conservation Cl lAI' il.K l'\\ 'Wl II i L I iOUiL RIiIORMIlKS 099"},{"pageNumber":738,"pageContent":"^ ^..«r. rri^ »ii^^^ Examining Photographs Roosevelt and his con- servationist friend Joiin Mulr ride In Yosemlte National Park. How mucti land did Roo- sevelt add to the national forests? laws. Roosevelt also used the power and prestige ot the presidency to promote the cause. From the beginning of his presidency, Roosevelt encouraged legislation aimed at preserving the nation's natural resources. The Newlands Act of 1902, supported by Roosevelt, provided federal aid to irriga- tion projects in arid states. He also en- forced laws against the illegal occupation of public lands. Using the Forest Reserve Act, Roosevelt more than tripled the amount of land previously set aside tor national forests. Roosevelt also enlisted states' aid in the conservation effort. In May 1908 he called a national conference on conservation at the White House. This conference result- ed in the creation of more than 40 state conservation commissions as well as a National Conservation Commission, which began an inventory ot the nation's natural resources. Wisconsin senator Robert La FoUette, though often critical of Roosevelt, paid tribute to the \"high statesmanship\" the President showed in advancing the idea oi conservation. La FoUette predicted that future historians would conclude that Roosevelt's greatest achievement was not the Square Deal, but the preservation of the nation's natural resources for the bene- fit of all. Further Regulation After being elected to a lull term in 1904, Roosevelt lelt confident enough to respond to the growing public clamor for stricter regulation oi the railroads. The Interstate Commerce Commission, lack- ing authority to set rates or to examine railroads' financial records, had only limit- ed success in controlling the unfair prac- tices and political influence of these powerful businesses. In defense of govern- ment controls, newspaper editor William Allen White spoke for many when he wrote: The railroads cannot name senators, pack state conventions, run legislatures, and boss politics generally. . . and then successfully maintain that they are private carriers doing a private business. Some well-known figures, among them William Jennings Bryan, proposed that the railroads be owned and operated by the government. Thinking such a step would lead to disaster, Roosevelt instead called for tighter regulation. The result was the Hepburn Act of 1906, which strengthened the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 in several ways. It 700 Unit 7 Entering a New Century: 1880-1914"},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"abolished the \"free pass\" that railroads granted to politicians and other influen- tial people such as newspaper editors. It widened the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission to include ex- press companies, pipelines, ferries, and sleeping-car companies. Railroad corpora- tions were restrained from operating other businesses. And most important ol all, the Interstate Commerce Commission was granted power to fix rates, although its decisions could be appealed to the courts. After reading Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel. The Jungle, Roosevelt urged legisla- tion to address the abuses in the food and meat-packing industries. The Meat In- spection Act of 1906 gave government the right to inspect meats sold in interstate commerce and the right to enforce cleaner conditions in meat-packing plants. Assessing Roosevelt's Progressive Policies In spite of Roosevelts many accom- plishments. Congress offered much resis- tance to his ideas. Legislative achievement under Roosevelts leadership was so unimpressive that some critics accused Roosevelt of producing \"more noise than accomplishment.\" Often the President could persuade Congress to act only when he had overwhelming public opinion behind him. In addition, although Roosevelt favored revision of the tariff he failed to effect a revision, regarding the issue as \"political dynamite.\" He did use the issue to his advantage, however, occasionally threaten- ing to bring it up unless congressional leaders supported other legislative mea- sures. Roosevelt also never seriously sup- ported long-overdue efforts to make the banking system more stable and the cur- rency system more flexible. Although he accomplished less than he seemed to promise, Roosevelt restored the people's faith in the power of the fed- eral government to serve their interests. Through his Square Deal philosophy, he promoted the idea that the cure for the evils o( luirestrained individualism was not socialism bin moderate relorm. iiiiiiTiTfiiiiiiira Section One Revie-sv Summary During Theodore Roosevelt's presiden- cy, legislation was passed regulating rail- roads, supporting union efforts to get higher wages and better working condi- tions, and reclaiming wilderness land for national forests. Labeled a \"trust-buster,\" Roosevelt was concerned with the regula- tion of big business and forcing powerful owners to obey the law. Although Roose- velt never exerted strong leadership over Congress, he was very popular with the American people and restored their faith in the power of the federal government to protect their interests.

He had enough influence, however, to choose his successor, William Howard Taft. Although Taft was a supporter of Roosevelt's progressive policies, his presi- dency led not only to a split between him and Roosevelt but also to a division of the Republican party itself Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the impact of the Aldrich Tariff • Examine the public reaction Ballinger-Pinchot controversy. • Describe the reactions of Roosevelt and the public to Taft's leadership. Payne- to the Although a distinguished public servant, having ser\\'ed as a fed- eral judge, as governor of the Philippines, and as Roosevelt's secretary of war, Taft was a reluctant Presi- dent. His true ambition lay in the judicial. not the executive branch of government. Remarking on the snow, sleet, and rain that pelted the people coming to the inau- guration, Taft said with sorrow, \"Even the elements do protest. \" Taft in Difficulty Taft began his term as President by addressing the tariff issue, largely ignored during Roosevelt's eight-year tenure. Since passage of the Dingley Tariff of 1897, prices had advanced more rapidly than wages, and many blamed the resulting high cost of living on unduly high tariff rates. Some, including Taft, also believed that high rates encouraged monopoly. Congress met in March 1909, and within less than a month the House of Representatives passed a measure, intro- duced by Sereno Payne of New York, that provided lor substantial reductions in the tariff without abandoning the principle of protection. Under the leadership of con- servative Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island, however, more than 800 amendments were tacked onto the House bill. Many of these amendments were designed to conceal higher rates, such as changing a duty on certain small articles trom so much \"per hundred-weight\" to so much \"per hundred.\" When Aldrich attempted to railroad the amended bill through the Senate, he was met with resistance in his own party. Sev- eral Republican senators, nicknamed the \"Insurgents, \" used their privilege of un- limited debate to reveal the way Aldrich and his allies were carrying out the de- mands of high-tariff lobbyists instead of the people. Too late, Taft attempted to persuade the Old Guard leaders to reduce the rates, but they made only slight con- cessions before the bill received Senate approval. By the time the bill reached Taft's desk, the Payne-Aldrich Tariff con- tained high duties on iron ore, coal, and hides and increases on other materials. The bill however, allowed for a corpora- tion tax, established a tariff commission to make a scientific study of rates, and pro- vided for some flexibility in rates at the discretion of the President. For these rea- sons, and because he feared a split 702 Unit 7 Entering a New Century: 1 880- 1914"},{"pageNumber":741,"pageContent":"between the Old Guard and the Insur- gents in his own party, Taft signed the bill, despite its weaknesses. The public saw Taft's action as a betray- al of his campaign promise. On a speak- ing tour in the Midwest, Taft argued that the bill ftilfilled the Republican platform, adding: If the country. . . wishes the manufacturers all over the country to go out of business, ami to have cheaper prices at the expense of the sacrifice of many of our manufacturitig interests, then it ought to. . .put the Democratic party in power Despite his efforts, there coiuiiuicd to W widespread dissatisfliction with the i,iiifl and with Taft for supporting it. Another blow was dealt to liitt's popu- larity when a conflict developed between laff s Secretary of the Interior, Richard A. H.tlliiiger, and the chief forester, Clifford I'iiichoi. B.illiiiger reopened for [irivate pinch. ise cert. tin l.mds in Moiii.in.i, Wyoming, and Alaska that had been withdrawn while Roosevelt was President. Pinchot, a well-known conservationist, protested these actions and publicly accused Ballinger of fraud. Taft, convinced of Ballinger's innocence — later confirmed by a congressional investigating comrnit- tee — dismissed Pinchot for insubordina- tion. But the public viewed Taft's action as a move against the conservation effort begun by Roosevelt, and Tafts popularity plummeted. Even though Ballinger was exonerated of the charges, he eventually resigned his post. Immediately following the Ballinger- Pinchot controversy came an outbreak of insurgent Republicanism in the House of Representatives, which took the h)rm of an attack on the Old (luard Speaker of the House, Joseph (i. \"Uncle Joe\" ('an- iioii. The speaker had come to enjoy a power over legislation greater in some wavs than that of the President.

And Cannon had long been an opponent of conservation. Finally, in March 1910, a coalition of Democrats and Republican Insurgents forced a change in the rules of the House that stripped the speaker of much of his power. This attack on Cannon hurt Taft, who in order to keep party harmony aligned himself with the speaker. Thus, by signing the Payne-Aldrich Tariff, by sup- porting Ballinger against Pinchot, and by backing Cannon, Taft gave the impression that he had \"sold the Square Deal down the river.\" Popular indignation was so great that the congressional elections of 1910 resulted in a sweeping Democratic Life of the Times Elderly in Greenwich Village Although Progressive leaders used the poiver of government to improve society, not all Americans benefited from reform efforts.

Grouting old for many in the early 1900s meant a life of poverty or near-poverty and dependence for many Americans. The aged poor showed imagi- nation and ingenuity in making ends meet.

Roosevelt Proclaims \"New Nationalism\" During his retirement Roosevelt tried hard to maintain faith in the man he had chosen as his successor. But he found public opinion toward Taft had worsened. In spite of Roosevelt's intention to remain out of politics, Taft's disappointing perfor- mance as President soon drew Roosevelt back into the political arena. Roosevelt aligned himself with the in- surgents in the Republican part)', who had started to call themselves 'Trogressive Republicans,\" or simply \"Progressives.\" In a speech at Osawatomie, Kansas, during the congressional election of 1910, Roo- sevelt spoke of what he called the \"New Nationalism.\" His words reflect the Pro- gressive outlook: 704 Unit 7 Entering a New Century: 1880-1914"},{"pageNumber":743,"pageContent":"mm The man ivho wrongly holds that every human right is secondary to his profit must now give way to the advocate of human welfare In his New Nationalism speech, Roo- sevelt outlined a much more radical pro- gram of action than he had ever proposed as President.

Attacking the courts for declaring certain progressive legislation unconstitutional, Roosevelt suggested that state judges be subject to recall and that Supreme Court decisions be reversible by popular vote. By taking such stands, Roo- sevelt established his position as the natu- ral leader of the Progressive Republicans. Taft's Successes Despite Taft's political problems, his ad- ministration experienced several successes. Although it was Roosevelt who was nick- named the \"trust buster,\" Taft actually prosecuted twice as many antitrust cases in four years as his predecessor had in seven. Tah established the Tariff Board to investi- gate tariff rates, and under his leadership a federal budget began to take shape. Tah also supported the Sixteenth Amendment, giving Congress power to collect income taxes or taxes on the income of individuals and companies, and the Seventeenth Amendment, calling for direct election of United States senators. And his adminis- tration saw the admittance ol New Mexico and Arizona to the United States. Taft genuinely supported Roosevelt's Square Deal policies, but unlike Roo- .sevclt, who claimed an executive right to do anything not forbidden, lafts judicial background allowed him to use \"only those powers expressly authorized by law.\" laft also lacked his predecessor's gift for dramatizing issues and enlisting public support.

As the election of 1912 approached, he remained convinced that Taft was unfit for another term as President. Despite his no-third-term pledge of 1904, it was not in Roosevelt's nature to sit on the sidelines. Thus the great question in American politics as the campaign began was whether Roosevelt would run again for the presidency. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Relate the events that led to the forma- tion of the Progressive party. • Explain how a split in the Republican party helped lead to Woodrow Wilsons election in 1912. Senator Robert La Follette, a man of great abilit>' and a leader of the recently formed National Progres- sive Republican League, had the support of many Progressive Republicans for the 1912 presidential nomination. When La Follette suffered a temporary ner- vous collapse, however. Progressives turned to Roosevelt. Explaining that his no-third- term pledge referred to a third consecutive term, Roosevelt declared himself a candi- date against Taft for the Republican nomi- nation. Now began a heated, emotional batde for control of the Republican party. Roosevelt Challenges Taft The struggle for control of the Republi- can party reached its climax at the national convention in June. Conservatives rallied behind Taft, as did many former supporters of the Square Deal who thought Roosevelt too radical or who disliked his running for a third term. Except for some devoted follow- ers of La Follette, the Progressive Republi- cans lined up tor Roosevelt. The Taft forces, however, had the im- mense advantage of controlling the parry machinery. Of 254 convention seats dis- puted by Taft and Roosevelt, the conven- tions Credentials Committee gave 235 to Taft. When Taft received the nomination on the first ballot, Roosevelt charged the Republican party leaders with stealing the nomination.

After a protracted struggle, Woodrow Wilson, who had won national fame as a reform governor of New Jersey, received the nomination on the 46th ballot, partly through the help of Bryan. In the ensuing campaign Taft was not active, privately expressing the opinion that Wilson was sure to win. The real bat- tle took place between Roosevelt and Wil- son. Both men supported progressivism, although under different labels. Wilson countered Roosevelt's New Nationalism with what he called the \"New Freedom.\" Although there appeared to be little dis- tinction between the philosophies of the two candidates, they did in tact differ. Roosevelt's New Nationalism accepted big business as a fact of life and proposed a more powerful federal government and a strong executive to keep it under control. Wilson's New Freedom viewed monopo- lies as absolute evils, the antithesis of free competition. He also advocated the use of federal power to insure more equality ot opportunity. The contrast between Wilson and Roosevelt was striking. Roosevelt had long been the best known political figure in the country. Wilson, a former university presi- dent and college professor, had been active in politics tor only three years. Roosevelt, the former Rough Rider, was thought of by the public as a fighter in a war on privi- lege. While Roosevelt enjoyed mixing with all sorts of people, Wilson was aloof Although Wilson lacked his rival's mag- netism, he was a persuasive speaker, and he knew how to touch people's conscience and appeal to their reason. I'hc results of the election fulfilled Tift's prediction of victory ior Wilson. Al- though he won the presidency, Wilson actually had fewer popular votes than Roosevelt and laft combined. But because of the split in the Republican vote — and also a surprisingly strong Socialist party vote — Wilson carried 40 of the 48 states, with a total of 435 electoral votes; his opponents together received only ')6. So, for the first time since (irover ( 'leveLuids election in 1892, a Democrat became President of the United States. ww»ww Section Three Revie'w » Summary During the presidential election of 1912, the Republican party was divided between progressives and Old Guards. Taft's nomination by the Republican con- vention prompted Theodore Roosevelt to help form the Progressive party. Based on human-welfare principles, this new national party attracted reformers, educa- tors, literary figures, and philanthropists. Their platform was similar to that of the Democrats and the election became a bat- tle between Theodore Roosevelt's New Nationalism and Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom. With the Republican vote split between Taft and Roosevelt, Wilson won the election. Checking for Understanding 1. Identify Bull Moose party, New Free- dom 2.

In those two years, however, he had successfully worked for an elaborate program of progressive laws. Wilson be- gan his first presidential term determined to obtain major social reform at the feder- al level. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain why Wilson had congressional support for his programs. • List the accomplishments ol Wilson's domestic program, including legislation on tariffs and on trusts. The new President entered office with several handicaps. He was .1 minority President, chosen by only 42 percent of the voters. With no experience in national politics, he knew tew Democratic party leaders. In addition, the Democratic party at the time was comprised ol a loose alliance ol local interests not expected to work well together. Long out of office, the Demo- crats lacked people with experience in government at the federal level. Wilson and Congress Although inexperienced in national pol- itics, Wilson enjoyed certain advantages upon entering office. The 1912 election results sent Congress a clear message that most Americans demanded progressive legislation. If the Democrats did not sup- port the President in the creation ol this legislation, warned a member of Congress, they would be \"turned into the wilderness for 40 years more.\" However, no promi- nent Democratic leaders opposed Wilson, as Republicans Cannon and Aldrich had thwarted Taft. On the contrary, Wilson enjoyed the loyal support of most Demo- crats — including Bryan, the most influen- tial man in the party, whom Wilson appointed secretary of state. In his first inaugural address, Wilson stated his goals — not, he said. Democrat- ic or Republican goals but goals for all the nation. After calling for reform of tar- iffs and banking, equality of business opportunity, improvements in agricul- ture, and conservation of natural re- sources, he concluded: This is not a day of triumph. It is a day of dedication. Here muster not the forces oj party, but the forces of humanity / summon all honest men, all patriotic, all forward-looking men to my side. God helping me. I will not fail them, if they will but counsel and sustain me!

President- elect Wilson and Taft are shown here on inauguration day. 1913. What goals did Wil- son set forth in his inaugural address? The Underwood Tariff The President lost no time in embark- ing on his program of reform. Like Taft, Wilson at once called Congress into spe- cial session. Appearing in person before Congress — the first President to do so in 100 years — he delivered a special message on the tariff This short speech made headlines nationwide and illustrated Wil- son's long-standing belief that the Presi- dent's greatest power lay in focusing public attention on important issues. Wilson's message charged that high tar- iffs had: . . . built lip a set of privileges and exemptions from competition behind which it was easy. . . to organize monopoly; until. . . nothing is obliged to stand the tests of efficiency and economy and enterprising \" Opening the Ameri- can market to foreign products would at the same time open foreign markets to American goods. Wilson warned, howev- er, against undue haste, making it clear that he did not favor removing protective duties entirely. The House of Representatives soon passed a bill, sponsored by Alabama Rep- resentative Oscar W Underwood, em- bodying the President's recommendations. The real fight occurred in the Senate, where previous attempts to lower the tariff had foundered, and where the Democrats had only a six-vote majority. Lobbyists swarmed to Washington, pressuring sena- tors to alter the bill. But before senatorial opposition could crystallize, Wilson again appealed to the people. He denounced the \"insidious\" lobbyists and asked an aroused public to insist that Congress put an end to \"this unbearable situation. \" The Presi- dent then held personal conferences with Democratic senators and wrote letters to those threatening to oppose him. Under such varied and unrelenting pressure from the executive office, the Senate voted to accept the House bill with little change. The Underwood Tariff Act represented the first substantial drop in import duties since 1857. It attempted to ftx duties at a level where costs of production in the United States and abroad would be equal- ized, thus lowering the duty paid on almost 1,000 articles. It removed protection en- tirely from industries that already compet- ed successfully with foreign producers. A most important section of the Under- wood Tariff Act was the provision for levying an income tax, now legalized by the Sixteenth Amendment. Originally in- troduced merely to make up for losses in revenue created by lower tariffs, the income tax became the federal govern- ment's chief source of revenue in a very short time. Lower rates, he claimed, would help businesses by putting them under \"con- stant necessity to be efficient, economical, 712 The Federal Reserve Act As the tariff debate reached a crescendo, Wilson appeared before Congress to in- troduce the second major item in his reform program: a revision of the banking Unit 7 Entering a New Century: 1880-1914"},{"pageNumber":751,"pageContent":"and currency system. The purpose of the revision was to provide businesses with cheaper and more available credit. Like the tariff message, Wilson's speech was so brief that many influential newspapers published the entire text. In 1907 a sharp panic had revealed seri- ous weaknesses in the American banking and currency system. There were runs on banks, many of which closed or stopped lending as a result. In 1908 Congress set up the National Monetary Commission, headed by conservative Senator Aldrich, to investigate the situation and propose change. After tour years ol study, the Aldrich Commission reported that the financial organization of the United States was flawed in tour respects. First, American banking lacked stability in times of crisis. Banks did not keep enough money on reserve to cover sudden withdrawals, and there was not enough cooperation between banks. Second, Americas currency was inflexi- ble. The amount of money in circulation was based on the amount of gold and sil- ver in the treasury, plus the bonds held by the national banks. The present system provided no way to increase or decrease the supply of money according to the investment needs of the country. Third, there was no central control of banking practices. In other modern, in- dustrialized countries, central banks, such as the Bank ot England and the Bank of France, directed banking policy. Nothing similar had existed in this nation since Andrew Jackson had destroyed the second Bank of the United States. Finally, the commission found that too much bank capital was concentrated in New York City and on Wall Street. Mean- while, other parts of the country, especial- ly isolated rural districts, often sutfered from a lack ot adequate banking facilities and credit. Although tew questioned the list of ills in the banking and currency system, gov- ernment leaders disputed the cure. Bank- ers tavored a great central bank, privately controlled, like the first and second Banks ot the United States. But many progres- sives, especially Bryan, called for strict federal control of banking and credit. It was Wilson's difficult task to select a plan that would work and at the same time win support from both bankers and Bryan's followers.

Again, under constant pressure from the Presi- dent, Congress finally passed the law in December 1913. The Federal Reserve Act promptly became one of the most impor- tant and useful pieces of legislation in United States history. The new system provided lor 12 Fed- eral Reserve Banks situated throughout the country. All national banks were required to join them, and other banks could join if they wished. The Federal Reserve did not deal directly with in- dividuals but instead serviced member banks. These \"banks for bankers\" con- centrated reserves, so they could pro- vide support to individual banks in times of temporary difficulty such as a \"run.\" They also provided for local in- vestment needs and made it easier to move funds from one part of the coun- try to another. The Federal Reserve Act provided a compromise between private and public control. The Federal Reserve Banks them- •selves were privately owned, a majority of their directors being elected by the mem- ber banks. Overall control of the Federal Reserve Banks, however, remained in the hands of a Federal Reserve Board, whose seven members were appointed by the President, subject to approval by the Sen- ate, for 14-year terms. Thus the center of the nation's financial power moved from Wall Street to Washington, D.C. Before passage of the Federal Reserve Act, local banks frequently lacked funds to make sound loans to businesspeople and farmers.

The new money went into circulation when local banks needing cash brought businesspeople's promissory notes to Federal Reserve Banks. In return, the Federal Reserve Bank issued Federal Reserve notes, assessing the mem- ber bank a small fee called a rediscount. When a Federal Reserve Bank bought promissory notes, it could print and issue more paper money, using those notes as part of the security, or collateral, thereby protecting the value of the currency. Then, when the notes were paid and the money came back to the Bank, the cur- rency was retired. The Federal Reserve Ranks also con- trolled the amoimt of money in circulation by raising or lowering the rediscoiuit rate, or the rate at which they charged for redis- counting. Raising the rate discouraged banks from lending and so \"contracted\" the currency; lowering the rate encour- aged lending and \"expanded\" the curren- cy.

On the whole, the Federal Reserve Act made the banking system responsive to the needs of a great industri;d nation. It succeeded in its first great test, dining World War I, when it assisted industrial expansion and helped the federal govern- ment finance the war effort. Wilson Regulates Trusts Shortly after signing the Federal Reserve Act, Wilson asked Congress to pass an antitrust law more effective than the Sher- man Antitrust Act. Denying any desire to interfere with legitimate business activi- ties, his message to Congress proposed various methods of preventing the \"inde- fensible and intolerable\" abuses ol private nionopolv. Late in 1914, Congress responded to Wilson's requests by passing two laws. I'he first, the Federal Trade Commission Act, established a Federal Trade (ximmission to Linking Across Time The Federal Reserve System When the Feder- al Reserve System, or Fed, was estab- lished in 1913, its powers were more limited than today.

Since the United States went off the gold stan- dard in 1933, the Fed has served as watchdog over the nation's money supply.

The commission had power to order companies to \"cease and desist\" from unfair conduct. In actual practice, though, Wilson's appointees to the commission failed to take strong actions against trusts. In October 1914, less than a month after passage of the Federal Trade Com- mission Act, Congress passed the Clayton Antitrust Act.

The Clayton Act also contained two sections favorable to trade unions. As noted earlier, the Sherman Act, by forbid- ding conspiracies, had proven more effec- tive against labor unions than against business monopolies. To discourage such use of antitrust laws, the Clayton Act stat- ed that \"nothing in the antitrust laws shall be construed to forbid the existence and operation of labor... organizations.\" In addition, ever since the jailing of Eugene V. Debs for contempt of court in the 1894 Pullman strike, labor unions had protested the use of court injunctions for- bidding strikes and boycotts. The Clayton Act forbade federal courts to issue injunc- tions against peaceful strikes, picketing, boycotts, or union meetings. The Clayton Antitrust Act lost most of its effectiveness because of loose wording and unfavorable interpretations by the federal courts. The protection of labor unions from suits under the Sherman Act was limited to unions pursuing their \"legitimate\" purposes — and it was the courts that defined the word legitimate. Injunctions might still be issued when \"necessary to prevent irreparable damage to property or to a property right,\" which again left a large loophole for conservative judges. Other Accomplishments of Wilson The Clayton Act completed the legisla- tive program that Wilson had originally promoted. But Wilson did not stop there. Additional legislation passed during his first term included the establishment of 12 regional Federal Farm Loan Banks, endowed with public funds in order to provide loans for agriculture.

The Adamson Act, passed under threat ot a nationwide tie-up in transportation, es- tablished an eight-hour day for railroad workers. Under Wilsons directed eye, so much constructive legislation had been passed so quickly. Wilson supplied a skillkil and dynamic leadership, sometimes keeping Congress in session throughout the hot summer months. Chauncey Depew, a noted conservative Republican, said that for a man regarded as a mere theorist, Wilson had accomplished \"the most astonishing practical results.\" The reforms Wilson achieved did not have \"practical results\" for black Ameri- cans, however, as the President brought [im Crow to Washington. The nation's capital had been desegregated since Recon- struction, but Wilson, a native Virginian, strongly believed in separating the races. Therefore his administration segregated drinking fountains, rest rooms, and lunch counters in government office buildings and assigned jobs according to race. A number of prominent black leaders like W.E.B. Du Bois, who had supported Wil- son in 1912, turned against him. Black newspaper editor William Monroe Trotter blamed Wilson's New Freedom lor a \"new slavery for your Afro-American fellow citi- zens.\" Yet the President merely reflected the racial blindness of many other progres- sive reformers. Wilson's efforts during the beginning of his first term focused almost exclusively on domestic matters. In fact, foreign affairs did not even receive mention in his first inaugural address. But by the end of his term, world events overshadowed these domestic achievements, and soon Wilson's role as architect and promoter of progres- sive legislation was all but forgotten. It was obscured by growing tensions in foreign affairs that resultetl in tragedy for him ,iiul for the world. lIIIIIgtIIIIIIIIIIM Section Four Review IIITTTIIWIIIITgT« Summary The election of Woodrow Wilson brought in new reform legislation that focused on curbing anti-competition practices of big business, improving work- ing conditions, helping farmers, lowering the tariff, and revising the bank and cur- rency systems. Wilson's exercise of federal intervention and regulation was a blend of early Federalist and Democratic ideals — respect for the rights of the common people through federal control.

Roosevelt and Taft worked within the framework of the Republican party, which recognized the need for big business but sought federal controls. Wilson, a Democrat, believed monopolies were inher- ently wrong and wanted to eliminate them. Roosevelt's greatest achievement lay in the area of conservation. During Taft's presidency the Constitu- tion was strengthened with passage of the I6th Atnendment (providing for an income tax) and the 17th Amendment (allowing direct election of sena- tors). Taft had been Roosevelt's chosen successor but political difficulties caused manv progressives to turn against him. Roosevelt, aher a brief retirement, decid- ed to reenter national politics.

But propaganda can be used in both positive and negative ways. Nearly evervonc — ailver- tisers, editors, entertainers, teachers, political leaders, preachers, parents, friends — and even yourself — uses propaganda to influence the opinions o( others. Propaganda is a persuasion tactic used to influence people to believe cen.iin ideas, or to follow certain courses of action. It does this bv linking an iilea with a common symbol that elicits a powerful emotion or aiiitutle. lo determine whether or not ,i st.itemeiii contains propaganda, apply these guidelines: • Is the purpose of the message to persuade? If so, state the purpose. • Does it use a tactic such as name calling, speaking in generalities, testimonials, card stacking (listing only the good facts), transferring a reputation, urg- ing others to hop on the band wagon, and/or appearing to belong to the common people? If so, identify the tactic. • Does it associate its idea to symbols that many peo- ple feel strongly about? Such symbols can be posi- tive ones that refer to patriotism, beauty, justice, health, security, education, or negative ones such as prejudice, murder, hatred, or greed. If so, list the symbols and tell what powerful emotions or atti- tudes they elicit. Example These guidelines may be used to determine whether or not the following statement bv President Theodore Roosevelt contains propaganda: A man ivho is good enough to shed his blood for his country is good enough to be given a square deal after- ward. More than that no man is entitled to, and less than that no man should have. • The purpose of this statement is to persuade the public to look favorably on Roosevelt's progressive ideas. • It uses a tactic of transferring the positive reputation of a soldier (\"good enough to shed his blood\") to the common citizen. • Soldiers serve as a symbol that elicits feelings of respect and admiration for those who risk their lives for their country. The phrase \"square deal\" symbol- izes an attitude of justice.

At the start of the twentieth century, the nation felt strong and confident. Its people sought to expand their borders and to solve their pressing domestic problems. Chap Imp ter 22 erialism In the last decades of the nineteenth century, Americans reassessed and aban- doned their traditional isolationist policy. Following the Civil War, Alaska was pur- chased and a show of American force prompted the French to leave Mexico. Because of growing industrial power, trade and contacts with Latin America also increased. In the Pacific, American inter- est in Hawaii led to its annexation in 1898. Controversies developed with Britain over shipping loss claims dating from the Civil War and the Venezuela- British Guiana boundary. Both issues were resolved peacefully. In 1898 the United States went to war, not with Britain but with Spain. Ameri- cans sympathized with an independence movement in Cuba seeking to overthrow Spanish control. Yellow Journalism creat- ed a reading public that welcomed inter- vention. Thus when the Maine — an American battleship anchored in Havana's harbor — exploded, the United States de- clared war on Spain. The Spanish Ameri- can War was over in six months. As a result of the war, the United States gained a colonial empire and with it the challenge of governing overseas territo- ries — Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philip- pines. In the Philippines, several years were spent suppressing a nationalist upris- ing. Questions soon arose over whether native people living in colonial posses- sions were entitled to the same civil rights as American citizens. Eventually the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Constitution did not cover over- seas possessions. As the United States expanded into the Pacific, Americans were anxious to renew trade opportunities with the Chinese. To protect any potential trade between the two countries, Secretary of State John Hay asked the Chinese in 1899 to grant an \"open door\" trade policy. This accom- plished little but it popularized American expansionist aims in China. United States soldiers also helped rescue foreign diplo- mats from China during the Boxer Rebel- lion in 1899, and Secretary Hay worked to prevent full-scale retaliation against China lor encouraging the rebellion. President Theodore Roosevelt strength- ened American involvement in world affairs. He defended Venezuela from pos- sible European aggression and he issued the Roosevelt Corollary, a statement that attempted to justify United States inter- vention in Latin America. In addition, Roosevelt negotiated an end to the Russo- Japanese War. Perhaps most important, Roosevelt allowed American warships to prevent Colombia from putting down an insurrection in Panama City. This action allowed Panamanians to establish the Republic of Panama. Roosevelt quickly negotiated a treaty for the rights to build a canal across Panama. Chapter 23 The Progressive Era On the domestic front, urbanization and immigration contributed to the spread ol slums and to the exploitation of workers. Progressive reformers sought to remedy these conditions. Progressives included academics, religious leaders, and writers known as muckrakers. Progressive political reforms on the national level included women's suffrage and the direct election ol senators. Pro- gressive accomplishments in state and local politics were even more impressive. They included the direct primary, in which voters choose candidates directly; and the initiative, relerendum, and recall, 720 Unit?

Other state successes were cor- rupt-practice laws that regulated cam- paign spending, and the commission and city-manager systems of ciry government. Many progressive reforms sought to improve human welfare. These included laws prohibiting child labor, worker's compensation insurance, the regulation of public utilities, and tax reform. Laws were also passed protecting consumers from tainted foods, mislabeled products, and substandard housing. In addition, the progressive spirit in local government helped to bring about health clinics, new playgrounds, and public recreation areas. The Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and Camp- fire Girls were organized to provide wholesome activites for youth. But Progressive reform also had limits. For example, Progressives were satisfied with the regulation of capitalism. Social- ists such as Eugene V. Debs, however, were outspoken in their efforts to modify or replace capitalism. Many Progressives were also critical of the flood of new immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. There were calls for restrictions on immigration and a 1917 law required all immigrants pass a literacy test. Progressives also generally ignored the problems of African Americans. Increas- ingly, blacks found themselves legally seg- regated and denied their full civil rights. But many blacks refused to settle for an inferior position in society. As a result, black leadership shifted. Conservative Booker T. Washington was succeeded by W.E.B. Du Bois. Chapter 24 White House Reformers Roosevelt supported the progressive movement with his domestic goal to give everyone a \"square deal. ' He soon became known as a \"trust btister\" because he broke up trusts such as the U.S. Steel (Corporation and the National Securities C'ompany. Roosevelt also helped settle the coal strike of 1902, in which Americans sympathi/cd with the p()()rl\\' tre.ited miners. Furthermore, Roosevelt supported stricter railroad regulation by strengthen- ing the Interstate Commerce Commis- sion. Conservation was another of Roo- sevelt's major coticerns. He tripled the amount of land set aside for national forests. William Howard Taft was Roosevelt's chosen successor as President. He prose- cuted twice as many trusts in four years as Roosevelt had in seven. Taft also creat- ed the Tariff Board to investigate duties. He supported the Sixteenth Amend- ment, giving Congress power to collect income taxes, and the Seventeenth Amendment, calling for the direct elec- tion of senators. Yet Taft lost popularity when he raised tariff rates by signing the Payne-Aldrich Tariff; sided with Secretary of the Interior Ballenger against chief forester Pinchot; and backed conservative House Speaker Joseph Cannon in a leadership struggle within the House. Americans thought Taft had abandoned the \"square deal.\" Roosevelt, fearful that progressive reforms would be lost, returned to politics. In 1912 Roosevelt lost the Republican nomination to Taft, but he then formed the Progressive parry and ran as their can- didate. His \"new nationalism\" proposed a more powerful federal government and a strong executive. Roosevelt also accepted big business as a fact of life. Democrat Woodrow Wilsons \"new freedom,\" on the other hand, viewed monopolies as abso- lute evils. Republicans split their votes between Tift and Roosevelt, allowing Wilson to win the election. One of Wilson's first acts as Presidetit was to help pass the Underwood Tariff Act, which lowered import duties and introduced a federal income tax. Wilson .ilso ptishetl throtigh the Federal Reserve Act, which overhauled the nation's bank- ing and currency system. In additioti, he persuaded Congress to pass two bills that regulated trusts — the Federal Trade C'om- inission Act and the Cllayton Antitrust Act. Other Wilson accomplishments in- cluded laws that helped farmers, protect- ed children in the work force, and established an eight-hour da\\' lor railroad workers.

Americans remembered well their own struggle for independence against Great Britain, so it came as a surprise to learn that American troops were sup- pressing Filipinos fighting for independence. 7. Because Puerto Rico's culture was Spanish and Catholic, it was unusual that its inhabitants were granted United States citizenship. 8. When William Jennings Bryan, the anti-imperialist candidate, lost the election of 1900, it proved that more Americans favored an overseas empire than opposed it. 9.

Three poets who typify these movements are Edna St. Vincent Millay, Langston Hughes, and Carl Sandburg. In the first two of the following selections, Millay captures the tireless energy of youth. In the selections by Hughes, the poet uses rhythms of the jazz age to reflect his African American pride. Sandburg celebrates jazz and recreates the flavor of the tall tale, while displaying his affection for American slang. As you read, notice how the three poets differ in their view of American life during the \"Roaring Twenties. \" Edna St. Vincent Millay Recuerdo e were very tired, we were very merry — We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry, k was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable- But we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table, We lay on a hill-top underneath the moon; And the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon. We were very tired, we were very merry — We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry; And you ate an apple, and I ate a pear.

There is such a thing as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince others by force that it is right. — WooDROw Wilson Responding to the sinking of the Lusitania, 1913 Section Focus On the day he took office, President Woodrow Wilson remarked to a friend that it would be an irony ot fate if his administration had to deal mainly with foreign affairs. But Wilson's administration soon was confronted with difficult and complex foreign problems that involved the fate of the world. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe Wilson's foreign policy toward Latin American nations. • Identify the causes of World War I. • Explain why the United States had diffi- culty remaining neutral during the war. President Wilson's focus on domes- tic issues was demonstrated in his first inaugural address in 1913. He was comfortable with and very well-informed on matters such as the tar- iff and banking. Wilson's advisers in these fields were capable of solving problems when they surfaced. But in foreign affairs neither Wilson nor his advisers was expe- rienced. His secretary of state, William Jennings Bryan, had no diplomatic train- ing. However, circumstances catapulted this President, a former college professor. into an international spotlight where his political and ethical ideals would be witnessed in other parts of the world. Wilson's Moral Diplomacy As President, Wilson resolved to \"strike a new note in international affairs\" and to see that \"sheer honesty and even unselfish- ness... should prevail over nationalistic self-seeking in American foreign policy. \" However, as events during Wilson's presi- dency would demonstrate, other forces were at work at home and abroad that frustrated his hope to lead the world by moral example. In fact, Wilson's first international crisis was awaiting him when he took office in March 1913. For nearly 30 years, Mexico had been ruled by a dictator, Porfirio Diaz (pawr FEE rih oh DEE AHS), who brought sta- bility to that nation and encouraged for- eign investment in Mexico's economic development. When Diaz was overthrown in 1911 by a combination of unhappy peasants and middle-class reformers, Mexico entered a period of political chaos. Francisco Madero (frahn SEES koh mah DAY ROH) came to power, and investors in Mexico feared that the new president would confiscate all property owned by foreigners. Businesspeople and foreign diplomats, with the knowledge of the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, plotted with units of the Mexican army to overthrow Madero. Shortly before Wilson took office. General Victoriano Huerta (veek toh ree AH noh WEHR tah) seized power in Mexico, and Madero was murdered — presumably on Huerta's orders. American capitalists, who had more than $1 billion invested in Mexico, sup- ported Huerta in the belief that he would support business interests. Because foreign investors controlled most Mexican indus- try and commerce, other countries with large Mexican investments lost little time in recognizing the new ruler. But repulsed by Huerta's brutality, Wilson decided to support \"the submerged 85 percent\" of the Mexican people who were \"struggling 734 Unit 8 Conflict, Confidence, and Collapse: 1914-1932"},{"pageNumber":773,"pageContent":"toward liberty,\" and he refused to recog- nize the new government. Wilson was convinced that without United States sup- port \"the unspeakable Huerta\" would soon be overthrown. In the meantime, he said that the situation inside Mexico \"was no affair of ours.\" Wilson tried to prevent arms from reachinsj Huerta, however, and permitted Americans to arm his enemies. Because Huerta remained in power, Wilson decided to teach the Mexicans \"to elect good men,\" and he looked for a rea- son to directly intervene. In April 1914, American sailors on shore in the city of Tampico (tahm PEE KOH) clashed with Mexican authorities. Seeing a chance to overthrow Huerta, Wilson sent marines to seize the Mexican port of Veracruz (VEHR uh KROOZ). Although Wilson expected the Mexican people to welcome his action, anti-American riots broke out in Mexico and throughout Latin America. The President's intervention also was con- demned in the European press. Shocked by world reaction, Wilson accepted an offer from the ABC powers (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile) to mediate the dispute. The ABC powers supported Wilson by recommending that Huerta go into exile. Venustiano Carranza (vay noos TYAH noh kuh RAN zuh), a candidate favored by the United States, was installed as Mexico's president. Examining Political Cartoons Symbols in this cartoon illustrate thie conflict between Wilson and Huerta. What does Huerta's huge sword represent'i' Examining Photographs Americans saw Pancho Villa as a bandit; to Mexico's poor, he was a democratic savior What action did Wilson take against Villa ? Yet trouble continued between the United States and Mexico. Mexican forces opposed to Carranza conducted raids into the United States. Led by Pan- cho Villa (PAHN choh VEE yah), guer- rillas burned the town of Columbus, New Mexico, and killed 18 Americans. Wilson responded by sending 6,000 LI.S. troops under General John ). Pershing across the border to find and capture Villa. The year-long expedition not only tailed to capture the guerrillas but result- ed in a clash with the Mexican army. Tensions did not ease until January 1917, when Wilson's growing concern over the war raging in Europe caused liim to recall Pershing's troops. Wilson's Mexican policy clid not win ilie United States any friends. The British ridiculed the President's attempt to \"shoot the Mexicans into self-government.\" Latin Americans regarded his \"moral imperial- ism\" as no improvement on Theodore Roosevelt's Big Stick diplomacy. In the Caribbean, Wilson followed Roosevelt's example by ordering marines in Nicaragua, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic to preserve order and set up gov- ernments viewed by Americans as more stable than those in control.

Although Europeans had experienced almost 50 years of general peace, the tensions that developed during that period were ignit- ed by a single event that plunged the entire continent into war. The rivalries that exploded in 1914 resulted from decades of European nationalism and imperialism. In the late 1800s, as Europe became industrialized and nations sought to estab- lish or expand overseas empires, tensions arose among colonizing nations. As France sought to expand in Africa, for example, it risked war with Italy over Tunis, with Britain over the Sudan and Egypt, and with Germany over Morocco. Within Europe itself nationalism also heightened rivalries and tension. Much of EUROPE IN 1914 500 KILOMETERS central and eastern Europe was ruled by empires that included several nation- ality groups, each with its own language. Many of these groups wanted to form independent nations by joining with simi- . lar groups in other nations. In Austria- Hungary, for example, seven Slavic groups — Czechs, Serbs, Croatians, Poles, Ukrainians, Slovaks, and Slovenes — resented being ruled by the Germans and Magyars (Hungarians). They wanted to join other Slavic peoples to form a South Slav, or Yugoslav (YOO goh SLAHV), nation in the B;dkans. The Balkans were an area of Slavic peo- ples in southeastern Europe that for decades had been fought over by three major powers — Russia, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire (Turkey and its provinces). In 1908 Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina (HERT suh goh VEE nah), two Balkan territories once ruled by the Turks. Serbia, a Balkan nation on Austria-Hungary's border, lelt that the annexation reduced its hopes for Slavic unification and called on Russia, its historic protector, lor help. The Russians, weakened from their defeat by Japan in 1905 and wanting the Balkans for them- selves, did nothing. This was the situation when Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, visited Bosnia in the summer of 1914. This instability in Europe — and the complex rivalries of the European nations at home and overseas — led to a great arms race as each country sought to defend itself The arms race not only generated more mistrust but also helped military leaders achieve more power and influence in European governments. Seeking additional protection, the European nations entered into alliances with one another for mutual self-defense. The Triple Alliance drew together Ger- many, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. Fearing isolation in Europe, France and Russia agreed to help each other in the event either became involved in war with Ger- many or Austria-Hungary. France also arranged a separate partnership with Great Britain known as the Entente Cor- diale (AHN TAHNT KAWRD YAHL), meaning \"cordial understanding.\" After 736 Unit 8 Conflict, Confidence, and Collapse: 1914-1932 Vs"},{"pageNumber":775,"pageContent":"Russia's defeat in 1905 reduced Britain's fear of Russian power, all three nations came together to form the Triple Entente. These two great alliances — the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente — attract- ed weaker countries that sought protec- tion. This alliance system meant that any international incident could easily involve all of Europe in conflict. For years Europe had been preparing for war, but hoping to avoid it. Tensions were high in June 1914, when the assassina- tion of Archduke Ferdinand in Bosnia by Slavic nationalist Gavrilo Princip pro- vided the incident that ignited Europe into war. One ol the conspirators in the plot to kill the Archduke witnessed the event: As [Franz Ferdinand's] car came abreast, [Princip] stepped forward from the curb, drew his automatic pistol fro>n his coat, and fired two shots. The first struck the wife of the Archduke, the Archduchess Sofia, in the abdomen. She was an expectant mother She died instantly. The second bullet struck the Archduke close to the heart. He uttered o>dy one word: \"Sofia\" — a call to his stricken tinfe. Then his head fell back and he collapsed. He died almost instantly. Although the assassin was a Bosnian college student, Serbia, which was the center of Slavic nationalism, was blamed. Austria-Hungary wanted to use the inci- dent to punish Serbia and to expand its influence in the Balkans, but it was afraid that Serbia's ally, Russia, would resist this action. Germany, wanting to weaken Rus- sia in Europe, urged Austria-Hungary to be harsh with the Serbians.

Believing that Germany would aid Austria-Hungary, Russian armies mobilized along the borders of both nations. Germany demanded that Russia halt its threatening acts and that France pledge neutrality in the event of a war between Russia and Germany. Both Russia and France rejected Germany's demands. On August 1 Germany declared war on Russia; on August 3 it declared war on France. Great Britain still hoped to avoid war, but when the German army crossed neu- tral Belgium on its way to invade France, Belgium appealed to Britain for help.

From 1940 to 1942, U-boats sank thousands of tons of Allied ship- ping in the Adantic. After the United States joined the Allies, however, American shipyards increased production of war- ships. The war- ships accompanied Allied convoys, locating the raid- ing Germans with sonar and radar. By mid-1943, the Allies were sinking U-boats taster than Germany could replace them.

Why was submarine warfare considered bar- baric? the Triple Alliance — Germany and Aus- tria-Hungary — joined with the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria to form the Central Powers. United States Neutrality As war consumed Europe, Americans were hopeful that the protection offered by the vast Atlantic Ocean would keep them out of the conflict. President Wilson stated that this was \"a war with which we had nothing to do.\" Besides issuing a proclamation of neutralin', he called on Americans to be \"impartial in thought as well as in action.\" Despite the official neutrality of the United States, America could not help but take sides. The massive immigration of various European nationality groups to the United States over the previous half- century gave many Americans roots that influenced their opinions about the war. Many of the 8 million German Americans were sympathetic to their homeland. Many Irish Americans, seething from a long history of British domination of Ire- land, also hoped for a German victory. In general, however, the common heritage shared by the United States and Britain, and America's historic links with France, put American public opinion on the side of the Allies. In addition, American sup- port of the Allies was promoted through propaganda. Both sides used it, but Ger- man propaganda was clumsy and uncon- vincing. British propaganda, on the other hand, was extremely skillful, especially in accusing the Germans of wholesale atroci- ties in Belgium. But Wilson found that America's neu- trality did not protect it from either the Allies or the Central Powers. The British were the first to violate international law when they imposed a tight blockade on the Central Powers. They planted mines in the North Sea, forced neutral ships into British ports for inspection, opened Amer- ican mail, and redefined contraband, or prohibited materials, so that not even food could be shipped to Germany. The British blockade was so effective that trade between the United States and the Central Powers shrank to less than 1 percent of its prewar level. At the same time, exports from the Unit- ed States to the Allies nearly quadrupled, as American war materials and food helped to keep the Allies going. The American econ- omy experienced enormous prosperity as a result of this trade. Ties between the Unit- ed States and the Allies became even closer when the U.S. government allowed the Allies to borrow $2 billion.

To retahate against the British blockade, cut off Britain's war supplies, and starve Britain into submission, the Germans relied on a new weapon — the submarine. The \"U-boat\" broke long-established rules of warfare. International law required that unarmed ships not be sunk without pro- viding for the safety of passengers and crews. Yet U-boats continually sank unarmed ships. The 1915 sinking ot the British passen- ger liner Lnsitania illustrated the full hor- ror of submarine warfare. As a result ot this incident, nearly 1,200 passengers drowned — including 128 Americans. Some Americans felt that this act was grounds for war. But others thought that people who traveled on ships of warring nations did so at their own risk, especially when Germany had taken out newspaper ads warning Americans not to travel on the Lnsitania. In addition, recent evidence indicates that the ship was secretly carry- ing ammunition for the Allies. Wilson steered a middle course on the issue of the U-boats. He refused to take extreme measures against Germany, saying that the United States was \"too proud to fight.\" But he sent several diplomatic notes to Germany insisting that its gov- ernment safeguard the lives of noncom- batants in the war zones. Late in March 1916, Wilsons policy was tested when a U-boat torpedoed the French passenger ship Sussex, injuring several Americans on board. Although Wilson's closest advisers favored breaking off diplomatic relations with Germany immediately, the President chose to issue one last warning. He demanded that the German government abandon its methods of submarine war- tare or risk war with the United States. Germany did not want to strengthen the Allies by drawing the United States into the war. So it offered to compensate Americans injured on the Sussex and promised with certain conditions to sink no more merchant ships without warning. The Sussex Pledge, as it was called, met the foreign-policy goals of both Germany and the President by keeping the United States out of war a little longer.

This time the cam- paign focused on Wilsons diplomatic skills, using the slogan \"He kept us out of war.\" But Americans gave his policies a less-than-ringing endorsement. When the election votes were counted, Wilson won, but it was one of the closest races in Unit- ed States history. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify the events that led the United States to enter World War I. • Describe the role of the United States in helping the Allies to achieve victory over the Central Powers. Following his reelection, Wilson devoted his energies to finding a peaceful solution to the war. The President realized the only sure way to keep Americans out of the Euro- pean conflict was to end this terrible war altogether. A quick victory eluded both sides, as defensive weapons proved superior to offensive tactics. The war was especiallv gruesome. The use of poison gas and such other new weapons as the tank and the machine gun, along with enormous casu- alty lists, ended the optimism that had pervaded Western Europe before the war. \"Peace Without Victory\" On December 18, 1916, Wilson asked the warring nations to state their peace terms. As a neutral party, he hoped to negotiate a settlement, but both sides responded with terms that their oppo- nents would not accept. In spite of these replies, Wilson addressed the Senate on January 22, 1917, calling for \"peace with- out victory.\" \"A victor's peace,\" he argued, \"would leave a sting, a resentment, a bitter memory upon which terms of peace would rest only as upon quicksand. Only a peace between equals can last.\" The Germans soon dashed Wilson's hope of mediating an end to the war. Ger- man losses on the batdefield and the shortages caused by the British blockade forced Germany to resume unrestricted submarine warfare. German naval com- manders claimed they could starve Britain into submission in five months if the Ger- man government gave U-boats permission to sink ships on sight. The Germans felt that even if this violation of their Sussex Pledge drew the United States into the war, the Americans could not raise an army and transport it to Europe in time to prevent the Allies from collapsing. Iherelore, Germany decided to risk American involvement and, on January 31, 1917, announced that all vessels in waters near Great Britain, France, and Italy would be sunk without warning. On February 3, 1917, Wilson respond- ed to this threat by breaking off diplomat- ic relations with Germany. When goods piled up in American ports because ships feared to sail, he asked Congress for the power to arm U.S. merchant ships. This measure passed the House of Representa- tives easily, but an 11 -person filibuster blocked the bill on the Senate floor. The President refused to be stopped by the effort of this \"little group of willful men.\" Finding the authority in an 1819 law, Wilson armed the merchant ships. 740 Unit 8 Coni-lict, Confidence, and Collapse: 1914-1932"},{"pageNumber":779,"pageContent":"Meanwhile, other events caused the nation's antagonism toward Germany to mount. The British government revealed that it had intercepted a cable from the German foreign minister, Arthur Zim- mermann, to the German ambassador in Mexico. Zimmermann instructed the Ambassador to arrange an alliance between Mexico and Germany in the event that the United States entered the war. To encourage Mexico's cooperation, Germany promised that Mexico would regain Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico upon a German victory. American news- papers published the Zimmermann Note, outraging the public. ThSn, between March 12 and March 19, four American merchant ships were sunk without warn- ing. Two days later Wilson called a special session of Congress to consider \"grave questions of national policy.\" On April 2, 1917, 'Wilson appeared before Congress with a heavy heart. In one of the most eloquent speeches ever delivered in the Capitol, the President asked the members of Congress to declare war on Germany: It is a fearful thing to lead this great, peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things ivhich we have always carried nearest our hearts — for democracy, for the right of. .free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last fi-ee. To such a task we dedicate our liivs and our fortunes, everything we have. . . . the day has come when America is privileged to spoid her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other. In his war message, the President insisted that the United States' quarrel was only with the \"military masters\" of Germany, and he expressed friendship for the Ger- man people. Maintaining that the United States had \"no selfish ends to serve,\" Wil- son stated that the people of the United States would be fighting to make the world \"safe for democracy\" and to promote \"peace and safety to all nations. \" Four days after Wilson's message. Congress, after a spirited debate, declared war on Germany by an overwhelming margin. Raising an Army When the United States entered the war, the Allies seemed in danger of defeat. U-boats were sinking ships at a rate that threatened to wipe out the entire mer- chant tonnage of the world; the British Isles had only a two-month supply of food with no relief in sight. Late in 1917 the Italians suffered a severe defeat at the vil- lage of Caporetto. Russia's military effort slackened and then ceased after the over- throw of the tsar and the Bolshevik, or communist, revolution. In March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest- Li tovsk, surrendering to Germany immense areas of land including the Ukraine. With one of the richest grain-growing areas in the world now in its possession, Germany hoped to relieve the severe food shortages caused by the tightening blockade. Rus- sia's withdrawal from the conflict also freed German armies to fight on the west- ern front — the area along the French-Ger- man border where the war had been stalemated for nearly four years. The Allies did not expect the LInited States to participate in combat, because in the spring of 1917 American forces num- bered only 200,000. In addition, the army possessed only 1,500 machine guns, 55 obsolete airplanes, and no heavy artillery at all. Although these numbers looked dis- couraging, the United States mobili/xd rapidly. Supported by his able secretary of war, Newton D. Baker, Wilson called for a draft, which he said was based on the democraiic principle of \"a universal obli- gation to serve.\" Because conscription li.ul Linking Across Time Presidential Mediation Woodrow Wil- son's offer of medi- ation in 1916 was not without prece- dent.

Roo- sevelt's real aim had been to secure a place for the United States in world politics. The aim of Wilson's mediation offer was just the oppo- site of Roosevelt's, though. Wilson wanted to keep the U. S. out of world politics by ending the war before America was pulled into it. CHAnHu25 WoridWar 741"},{"pageNumber":780,"pageContent":"IF YOU WANT morale of the Allies.

To relieve the monotony of trench life, sol- diers organized musicals and variety shows, betting pools, and holiday celebrations. Inter-Allied boxing matches and baseball provided additional diversion. Military expe- rience proved a turning point in the lives and attitudes of many young men.

Black sol- diers encountered rampant discrimination and prejudice in the army, where their units were completely segregated from white units. In addition, black Americans were not allowed to serve in the Marine Corps, and the 10,000 who served in the navy found themselves restricted to the lower ranks.

Victory on Land and Sea In the spring and early summer of 1918, Germany made a last desperate effort to win the war and nearly succeeded in its attempt. Starting in March, the Germans almost penetrated the British lines; a sec- ond drive in June threatened Paris. United States troops helped to stop the advance, distinguishing themselves in a counterat- tack at Chateau-Thierry (SHAH TOH TEE EHREE), a town less than 50 miles from Paris. The tide turned in mid-July as Marshal Ferdinand Foch (FAWSH), supreme com- mander of the Allied armies, ordered a great counteroffensive along the western front close to the German border.

Victory in World War 1 was due, in large part, to the great eflorts and sacrifices made on the home front. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain how the war was financed. • Describe how public opinion was shaped by the government. • Discuss the goals of Wilsons Fourteen Points. The United States found itself ill- equipped for battle when it entered World War I. The most immediate domestic concern that Congress faced was to keep the Unit- ed States and Allied armies supplied by gearing U.S. industry to the war machine. In addition, the federal government need- ed to raise money to pay for the war and to mobilize the American people to sup- port the war effort. To accomplish these goals, Wilson and Congress applied the Progressive Era's ideals of efFiciency, con- trol, and conformity in society to the war effort at home. Mobilizing the Economy The governments solution to the prob- lem of supplying the troops was to place most industries under the control of fed- eral agencies. The most important of these — the War Industries Board — han- dled purchasing for both the Allies and the United States. Under the leadership of Bernard Baruch, a Wall Street stockbro- ker, the War Industries Board attempted \"to operate the whole United States as a single factory dominated by one manage- ment.\" Enlisting the most able business- people in America to direct the war effort, the government received the cooperation of business to convert factories to war production. Federal officials determined how raw materials would be allocated and what prices should be fixed. The Fuel Administration was in charge of boosting coal and oil production, while encouraging people to conserve. The agency introduced such conservation methods as daylight savings time and shortened workweeks for nonwar-related factories. The Railroad Administration took charge of the railroads and ran them as a single system. The War Labor Board worked to prevent labor disputes. Labor unions generally supported the war effort, however, hoping that coopera- tion would result in goodwill from the s:overnment and big business. Union lead- ers correctly saw in the war opportunities for higher pay, better working conditions, and the right to organize and bargain col- lectively Membership in labor unions doubled during the war, and with govern- ment support they won concessions, such as the 8-hour day that industries had long opposed. Wartime also meant increased opportu- nities for American women. Millions of jobs given up by men who volunteered or were drafted were filled by women.

Despite the progress toward social and economic equality the war offered them, many women wondered how the United States could be fighting to save democracy and still deny them the vote at home. Activists for women's suffrage continued to work during the war. African Americans might well have asked similar questions because southern states continued to deny them the right to vote. In addition, black soldiers fighting in Europe encountered far less discrimination from Europeans than they experienced in iheir own country. Nevertheless, the war offered new oppor- tunities for blacks at home. Job opportuni- ties and high wages during the war pulled 500,000 African Americans from southern farms to northern factories. Most were offered only unskilled or semiskilled jobs, but by war's end, more than 100,000 blacks held jobs as skilled workers or facto- ry supervisors. Although discrimination against black workers led to race riots in 26 northern cities in 1919, African Americans in the North made significant economic gains during the war. As a result, black migration northward continued after the war ended. One African American wrote a letter to a Chicago newspaper explaining this \"great migration.\" Blacks, he said were: . . . compelled to go where there is better wages nnd sociable conditions, believe me . . . many places here in [Alabama] the only thing that a black man gets is a peck of meal and fivin .> to -i lbs. of bacon per week, and he is treated as a slave.

The combined efforts of the Food Administra- tion and the American public were tremendously successful. The Great War was costly beyond all expectation. By its end the United States government was spending about $44 mil- lion a day, or a total of about $33 billion. Of that amount, $10 billion went to the Allies as loans. The government raised about one-third of the money to finance the war through taxation. Income taxes were increased, although only wealthier families paid income taxes at that time. Corporations also paid higher taxes, including an \"excess profits\" tax, designed to return war profits to the government. The government also levied excise duties on items as varied as theater tickets, chew- ing gum, and phonograph records.

Controlling Public Opinion Because the success of the war effort depended heavily on voluntary civilian cooperation, the government wanted to make sure that Americans understood and supported the nation's war aims. It estab- lished the Committee on Public Informa- tion under the leadership of journalist and author George Creel to \"sell\" the war to America. Creel described his job as \"the world's greatest adventure in advertising.\" He recruited advertising people, commer- cial artists, authors, songwriters, entertain- ers, public speakers, and motion-picture 748 Unit 8 Conflict, Confidence, and Collapse: 1914-1932"},{"pageNumber":787,"pageContent":"companies to help him. Millions of pam- phlets were distributed explaining the causes and aims of the war. Thousands oi \"four-minute men\" spoke at movie the- aters and public gatherings in support of the war effort.

Congress passed the Espionage and Sedition acts. The severe penalties imposed by these laws effectively silenced most opposition to the war. Loyalty Leagues, organized by Creel, encouraged Americans to spy on their neighbors and to report those who might be \"disloyal.\" Thousands of people were imprisoned, sometimes for opinions expressed in pri- vate conversations. People were arrested for criticizing the President, for question- ing the American form of government, for criticizing the army or even military uni- forms. Socialist leader Eugene Debs was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison tor merely telling an audience to \"resist militarism, wherever found. \" Peo- ple were even jailed for criticizing the Red Cross and the YMCA. Although war lever was responsible lor the vigorous enforcement of these laws, the courts generally upheld the principle behind them. During the war about 3,000 cases involving convictions under the Espi- onage and Sedition acts were heard on appeal in federal courts. After the war, some of these cases reached the Supreme Court. In the landmark case Schenck v. United States (1919), Jtistice Oliver Wen- dell Holmes, Jr., writing for a unanimous Court, stated: When a nation is at war, many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as (soldiers] fight and that no (iourl could regard them as protected by any co)istitutional right The Court refused, however, to support punishment when no \"clear and present danger\" of hurting the United States exist- ed or when the accused was jailed for unpopular political beliefs. War fever was also to blame lor the mis- treatment and persecution of German Americans. Despite Wilsons insistence that Americans were \"the sincere friends of the German people,\" anti-German sentiment ran high. Many school systems banned the teaching of the German language, and orchestras stopped performing the music of Beethoven, Schubert, and Wigner. George M. Cohan 1878-1942 By the time he wrote \"Over There\" — the most popular song of World War I— George M. Cohan was already a star. At the age of 14, he was creating songs and skits for his family's vaudeville act. By his early 20s, he was writing, producing, and starring in hit Broadway shows. Claiming that he had been born on the 4th of July (actually July 3), Cohan discovered early in his career that he could excite crowds with such patriotic appeals as liis \"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.\" When American troops lelt tor France in 1917, he quickly penned \"Over There,\" touching the chord of nationalistic fervor sweeping the coun- try.

Besides the cost in lives, the war was a financial drain, financed by increased taxation and borrowing.

For his dissent against the Ameri- can Revolution the jury sentenced Potter to be tortured and hanged. A nation that had been founded on the fundamental right to dis- agree was itself stifling dissent. Although the American gov- ernment no longer brutalizes dissenters, it has often sup- pressed those who disagree with its actions or policies, particularly during wartime. Seagoe Potter was not the only colonist to remain loyal to Britain during the Revolu- tion. Perhaps one-third of the population retained their ties to King George and Parlia- ment — some openly, some secretly. Although about 100,000 Loyalists emigrated, many as 400,000 remained America. Some Loyalists actively aided British armies. To the revo- lutionaries, their presence and opposition constituted a danger to the security of the nation. Loyalists were denounced in the press, reviled in the streets, tarred and feathered in barnyards, and some- times, like Potter, tortured and hanged. During the Civil War, dissenters who opposed Abraham Lincoln's attempt to force the South back into the Union resisted the draft system. Union troops forcefully suppressed rioting dissenters in New York ('ity and an uprising in the coal-mining region of Pennsyl- vania. Others supported the war but opposed the methods Lincoln used to wage it, particularK' his suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. The Emancipation Procla- mation, which for modern Ameri- cans defines the moral purpose of the war, caused widespread dissent at the time it was issued. Many officers of volunteer regiments protested by resigning, and thou- sands of enlisted men deserted. as in Junior Red Cross parading for patriotism, St. Paul, Minnesota During World War I, President Wilson called for all citizens who opposed the war to be silenced. German Americans were perceived to be treasonous dissenters simply because of their nationality. They were spied on by their neighbors, coerced into buying war bonds, and forbidden to speak German in public or on the telephone. The campaign of suppression was almost totally baseless. German Americans, about 8 percent of the population, were overwhelmingly loyal to the United States. Ihcrc was loud antiwar clissent before the United States entered World War II. But after Japan bombetl Pearl Harbor, Americans imited behind the war effort. I his lime lap.uiese Americans became the target of suspicion. As with German Americans in World War I, the threat was perceived rather than real. However, most Japanese Americans lost their businesses and homes and were detained in \"internment camps,\" for most of the war. Dissenters during the Vietnam war questioned the morality of involvement in another country's fight for democracy instead of using American resources to fight poverty and civil rights violations at home. The government used the courts, the FBI, and even the Internal Revenue Service to investigate and harass lead- ing dissenters. But as antiwar rallies grew to hundreds of thousands of people, public opinion increasingly influ- enced American withdrawal from that conflict. Although some dissent arose after American forces were sent to the Persian Gulf to fight Iraq in 1991, antiwar protests were coun- tered by rallies of equal size in sup- port of the war.

Now the AlHes faced the task of constructing a framework for peace. Wil- son still had support at home and enjoyed great popularity abroad. The opportunity to carry out his peace plan seemed at hand. But his political blunders and the demands of Allied leaders doomed his chances. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe the outcome of the Versailles Peace Conference. • Explain why the Senate rejected the Treaty of Versailles. • Identify domestic problems that arose after the war. Midterm elections in the Unit- ed States in November 1918 showed a changing attitude toward Wilson and his poli- cies. Realizing that Democrats faced heavy losses in the elections, the President appealed to voters to show support tor his peace program by returning Democrats to Congress. Instead, voters elected Republi- can majorities in both houses. Shortly after the election, Wilson announced his intention to head the American delegation to the peace conference. His decision was not received well by those who thought that as President his place was at home. Wilson faltered again when he failed to include any prominent Republicans in the American delegation to the conference. The Peace Plan Opposed The peace conference opened at the palace of Versailles in January 1919, but most of the sessions took place in Paris. Delegates from 27 nations attended. The proceedings, however, were dominated by the leaders of the three most powerful nations — the United States' Wilson, Britain's prime minister David Lloyd George, and France's premier Georges Clemenceau (klem uhn SOH). With Vit- torio Orlando, the Italian premier, these men became known as \"the Big Four. \" Because their meetings were held in secret, Wilson was robbed of an effective weapon — direct appeal to public opinion. Secrecy also seemed to violate the Four- teen Points, which pledged \"open covenants openly arrived at. \" Neverthe- less, the President scored an immediate triumph by forcing plans for a League of Nations into the peace treaty. In mid- February the covenant, or charter, of the League, written by Wilson Himself was accepted by the conference. During Wilson's absence his political influence in the United States weakened alarmingly. The likelihood that Wilson's peace program would tail became evident when 39 Republican senators and sena- tors-elect — far more than enough to pre- vent ratification of a treaty — signed a statement opposing the League of Nations. Instead of trying to jepair the rift, however, Wilson publicly denounced the \"narrow, selfish, provincial purposes\" of his opponents and insisted that the League be part of the peace treaty. At the peace table, he tried to appease his critics at home by calling for changes designed to protect American interests. But to accept such changes, the Allies required 752 Unit 8 Conflict, Confidence, and Collapse: 1914-1932"},{"pageNumber":791,"pageContent":"Wilson to make further concessions in their tavor.

But the greatest humiliation was reserved for the Ger- mans. Germany lost territory and was stripped of its colonies. In addition, Ger- many was required to pay for damage it had done in Europe and to repay what the Allies had spent to fight the war. Although many of the Fourteen Points were ignored, Wilson trusted the League of Nations to right injustices after the postwar desire for revenge subsided. The peace settlement complete, in July 1919, President Wilson came home to face his foes. Although he hoped Ameri- cans would support the treaty, they criti- cized it from all sides. Some thought it too soft, and others found it too harsh. Several nationality groups, including Ger- man Americans, considered it unfair to their native lands. Fear grew that the League of Nations would be the kind of \"entangling alliance\" that Washington, Jefferson, and Monroe warned against.

What territory on this map is now the state of Israel? with amendments that would preserve the nations freedom to act independently. Instead of compromising, Wilson insist- ed that the Senate ratify the treaty with- out changes. Convinced that he could defeat his opposition by appealing to pub- lic opinion, Wilson went directly to the people. Starting in Ohio in September, he traveled 8,000 miles and made 37 major speeches in less than a month on behalf of the treaty. Almost everywhere his recep- tion was warm; he seemed to be regaining popular support. Had his strength held oiu, he might have won the battle. But the physical strain proved too great for the President. He collapsed in Colorado on Sepicrnber 25 and was forced to abandon his speaking tour. Shortly after returning to the White House, Wilson suffered a stroke that paralyzed one side of his body and impaired his speech. He was bedrid- den for months, isolated from even his closest advisers. c:iiMMiK IS WoKii) War 1 753"},{"pageNumber":792,"pageContent":"Connections History Changing the Map of Europe Part of President Wilson's peace pro- gram following World War I called tor self-determination of nations. Before the war Europe was a complex mosaic, or pat- tern, of distinct ethnic grotips. Many of these grotips lived within the borders of nations dominated by other ethnic AND Geography groups. Wilson belieyed that national boundaries should be drawn to give each ethnic population its own nation. Other powers at the Versailles Peace Conference, however, had their own plans. Allied leaders wanted to weaken the Central Powers by dividing their land. Some Allies also wanted their enemies' territory for themselves. Wilsons secretary of state, Robert Lansing, noted that the boundaries created after the war were artificial and did not follow ethnic population pat- terns. Lansing stated that they would last only as long as dissatis- fied nations were too weak to change them. He believed that when one nation became confident of its strength and began to seek to remedy these boimdaries, a new war would take place. Twenty years later that became the case.

With the President silenced, in Novem- ber 1919, and again in March 1920, the Senate refused to ratify the Versailles Treaty. Instead, the United States negoti- ated a separate peace treaty with each of the Central Powers in 1921. America's Postwar Problems The fate of the treaty was only one of a number of problems the United States faced in the years after World War I. Demobilizing the armed forces, returning to a peacetime economy, and coping with fears of espionage presented the country with serious challenges. The United States began to demobilize as soon as the hostilities ended. Within a short time, the army was reduced to less than 500,000, and economic controls were lifted. The businesspeople left Washington, and industry converted to peacetime production. With Wilson pre- occupied with the peace treaty and later incapacitated, the nation received little overall direction. Industry enjoyed a brief postwar boom, resulting from the increased demand for consumer goods that had been scarce during the war. But government spending during the war brought inflation that nearly doubled the cost of living by 1919, and prices rose to a point where many consumers could not afford to pay for new items. Consequent- ly, after 1920 business activity slowed. Farmers were especially hard-hit. The slackening of wartime demands for food and the end of government price guaran- tees caused agricultural prices to plum- met. Many farmers who took advantage of high wartime crop prices and went into debt to expand their farms now faced bankruptcy. 754 Unit 8 Conflict, Confidence, /\\nd Coll\\pse: 1914-1932"},{"pageNumber":793,"pageContent":"High prices also contributed to labor unrest after the war, and when the War Labor Board disbanded, the truce between employers and organized labor ended. A record number — 3,600 — strikes occurred in 1919, most meeting with lit- tle success. But 4 ol them — the Seattle General Strike, the Boston Police Strike, the steel strike, and the coal strike — were highly disruptive and had effects that last- ed well into the 1920s. In January 1919, only 2 months after the armistice, 35,000 shipyard workers from Seattle, Washington, went on strike in an attempt to gain an increase in their wages. The next month union workers in all Seattle industries walked off their jobs in support of the shipyard strikers. Many city residents viewed the strike as revolutionary. They responded by hoarding food and fuel and by pur- chasing guns. Seattle's mayor blamed the situation on dangerous radicals and after 5 days used the state militia to break the strike. In September 1919, another major city was hit by labor unrest as Boston's police force went on strike for better wages and working conditions. Looters soon were in the streets, smashing windows and steal- ing goods. When the mayor was unable to restore order, Massachusetts governor Calvin Coolidge called out the state guard. A new police force was hired, and Coolidge received national acclaim for his view that \"There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, any- where, anytime.\" Later that month more than 350,000 steelworkers went on strike across the nation, demanding better wages, an 8-hour rather than a 12-hour day, and the right to join a union. Two-thirds ol the strikers were immigrants. Most of the office work- ers and supervisors, who reftised to join the strike, were American-born. The sieel com- panies blamed the strike on labor radicals who told \"these foreigners. .. that if tliev would join the union they would get Americans' jobs.\" When the companies hired replacement workers, violence broke out, and federal troops were called in to protect them. Alter 4 months, the strikirs gave up with no gains. While the steel strike was underway, 450,000 coal miners walked off their jobs nationwide. Overworked and underpaid, the strikers demanded a 60 percent pay increase and a 30-hour week. Since at the time coal was the nation's major energy source, the government responded quick- ly. Obtaining a court order, it forced the strikers back to work. Eventually, howev- er, coal miners won a large pay increase to an average of $7.50 a day. Many Americans had long suspected a link between labor unrest and political radi- calism. The strikes of 1919 helped fuel a larger \"Red Scare\" than the United States experienced after the war. Wlien the Bol- sheviks seized power in Russia in 1917, they called on workers everywhere to revolt. In 1919 communism seemed to have great appeal among the poverty-stricken peoples of wartorn Europe. Althotigh the over- whelming majority of American labor lead- ers were not allied with the communists, nervertheless, many Americans suspected them of planning revolution.

Some of the immi- grants deported had become American citizens, and some were deported without trials. Accompanying the Red Scare was a wave of racism. Racial tensions rose as white soldiers returning from Europe found themselves competing for jobs and housing with blacks who had come north during the war. During the summer of 1919, race riots broke out in many north- ern cities. The worst of these was in Chicago, where nearly 40 people were killed and more than 500 injured.

Wilson's Legacy Despite a lack of presidential leader- ship as Wilson's second term drew to a close. Congress and the states imple- mented important laws. In 1920 Congress passed the Esch-Cummins Act, which turned the operation of railroads back to their owners. This statute gave the Interstate Commerce Commission almost complete power to fix rates as well as to regulate railroad financing, but the commission was now less concerned with restraining railroad companies as it was with helping them. World War I helped to add two amendments to the Constitution — both the culmination of century-old reform movements. Prohibition, which had made great gains before the war, made even greater advances during the war. \"Hooverizing\" put the country in the mood to sacrifice, and war needs com- pelled the government to forbid the use ol grain to manufacture liquor.

The war also advanced the cause of women's rights. It was difficult to deny demands that women be allowed to vote after they had performed traditionally male jobs in factories and fields and served with courage and devotion behind the lines in Europe. On the eve of the 1920 presidential election, after decades of struggle, women gained suf- frage when the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified. Wilson's final year and a halt in office left the country virtually leaderless. The President had recovered sufficiently to transact routine business. But his atten- tion and energies still were focused on getting the United States into the League of Nations. Retaining a belief that the American people would not retreat from world leadership, he urged that the elec- tion of 1920 be a \"great and solemn refer- endum\" on the League issue. But the 1920 election saw Wilson's parry and the League repudiated at the polls. The country wanted to turn its back to world responsibilities.

His attempts to write many of his Fourteen Points into the peace treaty were thwart- ed by France and Great Britain who were more interested in repayment and revenge. Although some of Wilson's points were accepted in altered forms, the treaty faced opposition at home. In response, Wilson toured the United States promoting the treaty until his health failed. In addition, the nation's peacetime economy was hampered by a rising cost of living, labor unrest, and lower crop prices. Yet reform continued as Prohibition and women's suffrage were enacted by amendments to the Constitution. Checking for Understanding 1.

When longstanding tensions in Europe erupted in war in 1914, however, the United States attempted to maintain neutrality. Although several factors made American neutralit}' increasingly difficult, Germany's policies regarding submarine warfare brought the United States into the conflict in 1917. Because ot unprecedented govern- ment controls, the nation mobilized for war at an astonishing pace. Within months an army was drafted and sent to fight in Europe. To finance the war effort, the government sold bonds and borrowed money. To maintain popular support, public opinion was careful- ly controlled. With the help of American troops and supplies, the Allies broke the deadlock that existed on the western front and turned the tide against Ger- many.

Harding Speech to the Boston Home Market Club, May 1920 Section Focus The internationalism ol Woodrow Wil- son was reversed in the United States dur- ing the 1920s under the administrations of the next three Presidents — all Republi- cans. The party's slogan \"America First\" hailed the country's unparalleled prosper- ity, characterized by remarkable achieve- ments in the field ol business. Objectives After reading this section, you should be able to: • Describe the accomplishments of the Washington Conference. • Explain the provisions of the National Origins Act. • Describe the scandals in the Harding administration. The end of the war created new problems for the United States. After the dismantling of the War Industries Board, business lost the profitable military contracts of the war years. Four million recently demobi- lized service men and women needed work. In 1920 and 1921, unemployment soared, as did prices. Labor unrest was reflected in the United States Steel strike and the Boston police strike of 1919. Americans had to face the coming decade, as noted novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald stated, with \"all wars fought, all faiths shattered.\" The Election of 1920 Several prominent candidates sought the Republican nomination in 1920, but after a convention deadlock, the prize went to a dark horse, Ohio senator Warren G. Harding. Many saw in Har- ding a welcome contrast to Woodrow Wilson. While Wilson was intellectual and restrained, Harding was affable and easy-going. Wilson favored government regulation of business; Harding wanted to leave it alone. As Harper's magazine editor Frederick Lewis Allen explained: Wilson thought in terms of the whole world- Harding was for America first. . . . Wilson wanted America to exert itself nobly; Harding wanted to give it a rest. Harding's running mate was Mas- sachusetts governor Calvin Coolidge. To oppose Harding, the Democrats chose Ohio governor James M. Cox, a loyal Wilson supporter. Cox's running mate was Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, like his distant cousin, Theodore, had served as assistant secretary of the Navy. Cox need- ed to win votes away from the Republi- cans, the majority party at the time. The strategy chosen by Cox was as Wilson desired — to campaign for the League of Nations, in the hopes of turning the elec- tion into a referendum on this issue. The Republicans, however, would not debate the League, partly because they were divided on the issue. Harding said he favored \"a society of free nations\" to keep peace. Most prominent Republicans took this to mean that Harding supported their decision to join the League, but anti- League Republicans seemed certain that Harding opposed it. Thus, as journalist Walter Lippmann pointed out, Harding received support from \"men and women who thought a Republican victory would 762 Units Conflict, Confidence, and Collapse: 1914-1932"},{"pageNumber":801,"pageContent":"kill the League, plus those who thought it was the most practical way to procure the League.\" The election was an overwhelming Republican victory. \"It was not a land- slide,\" said Wilson's secretary, Joseph P. Tumulty, \"it was an earthquake.\" Harding carried every northern and western state and even broke the solid South by carry- ing Tennessee. A key to the election results may be found in the President's reassuring slogan — \"a return to normal- cy\" — coined by Harding during his cam- paign. It suggested a return to \"the good old days, \" to the conditions that prevailed before the shocks of World War 1. After the war, according to Frederick Lewis Allen, the nation was tired of fighting: Sick of Wilson and his talk of America's duty to humanity, [Americans] hoped for a chance to pursue their private ajfairs without governmental interference, and to forget about public affairs. There might be no such word in the dictionary as normalcy, but normalcy was what they wanted. Postwar Foreign Policy After his election, Harding announced that the League issue was \"dead as slav- ery. \" His administration, he said, would not lead the United States into the League ol Nations \"by the side door, back door, or cellar door. \" Ihe United States was too powerkil, too economically interconnect- ed, and too widely involved in world affairs to retreat into isolationism, howev- er, and participated actively in many League conlerences. One international problem ih.u ile- manded a solution, hir example was $10..^ billion in Allied war debts owed to the United States tor food and war materials. I he debtor nations had difficulty meeting their payments. They argued that high American tarills had closed the U.S. mar- ket to their imports and slowed their economic recovery, burthermore, debtor c^o'>^_A^ nations argued, because the United States had lost fewer people in the war than the other Allies, it should be willing to pay more of the financial cost. The United States government, however, took the position that it could not ask American taxpayers to assume the Allies' war debts; that the Allies had gained territory and reparations, or payments for damages, as a result of the victory while the LJnited States had claimed no reward; and that to cancel these debts would destroy faith in international agreements. Ibis long dis- pute resulted in hard feelings on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Eventually the United States made agreements with 17 of the 20 debtor nations, reducing the debts by ?>() to 80 percent. Most of the money the Allies paid actually came from Clermanv. lb pay its reparations, Germany obtained private bank loans from other countries — espe- cially the United States.

An international con- ference, meeting in Washington, D.C., in 1921, attempted to produce the first major disarmament agreement in modern history. At the time the Harding administration called the Washington Conference, the United States, Great Britain, and Japan were experiencing costly and competitive naval buildups that originated during the war. There was also friction in east Asia, caused mainly by conflicts over commer- cial rights in China and by western suspi- cion of Japan's recent territorial gains. After World War I, Japan had acquired all of Germany's Pacific islands north of the equator as well as the Chinese port of Kiaochow (jee OW JOH). Japan also treated the rest of the Chinese province of Shantung as its own. To further increase tensions, the United States and Japan were disputing possession of the tiny island of Yap, a key cable communications station between Guam and the Philip- pines — both United States possessions. In the hope of resolving these problems, the administration invited eight nations to the conference. These nations included the principal naval powers of the world, those with Pacific possessions, and those with an economic stake in China. The negotiations, which lasted from Novem- ber 1921 to February 1922, led to three important treaties. The Four-Power Treaty was signed by the United States, Great Britain, France, and Japan. It ended an Anglo-Japanese alliance, replacing it with an agreement by the four great powers to respect one another's Pacific holdings. In case of dis- agreements between the four powers or a threat from another nation, the signers also agreed to confer with one another \"fully and frankly.\" Under the Five-Power Treaty, the 5 naval powers of the United States, Great Britain, Japan, France, and Italy agreed to freeze their navies at 1921 levels and thus avoid the financial strain of further naval buildups. The signers further agreed to halt the building of large warships for 10 years; some ships under construction would even be scrapped. The treaty also included an agreement by the United States and Great Britain not to build new fortifications or naval bases in the western Pacific. This provision gave Japan control ol nearby waters in exchange for agreeing to remain at inferior naval strength. The Nine-Power Treaty signed by the United States, France, Great Britain, Japan, Italy, Belgium, China, the Nether- lands, and Portugal put the \"Open Door\" China policies of John Hay into a treaty. The signers agreed to preserve equal com- mercial rights in China and to refrain from \"taking advantage of conditions in China to seek special rights or privileges.\" Following this policy, Japan soon with- drew from the province of Shantung. The immediate results of the Washing- ton Conference were encouraging. Power- ful nations, hoping to avoid future large-scale wars, had peacefully agreed to arms limitations. By lessening tensions in east Asia, the conference made war there less likely. In retrospect, though, these diplomatic accomplishments did not fijr- ther long-term peace. One failure of the conference was that it reached no agreements limiting military forces on land. Moreover, the treaties had notable shortcomings. Under the Five- Power Treaty, naval powers could still build unlimited numbers of smaller com- bat vessels, such as submarines and de- stroyers. In addition, the Four-Power Treaty did not commit the signers to active military defense of their allies; indeed, such a commitment might have been unacceptable to the United States. And the Nine-Power Treaty made no pro- vision for entorcement of the Open Door Policy. Nonetheless, the conference gave Americans some reason to look forward to a period of peace and recovery. Business Normalcy From the start, Harding's handling of domestic problems made it apparent that normalcy meant a general retreat from government regulation of business. \"We want less government in business and more business in government,\" Harding declared. Although the federal govern- ment actively aided businesses by levying protective tariffs, promoting foreign trade, 764 Units Conflict, Confidence, and Collapse: 1914-1932"},{"pageNumber":803,"pageContent":"and breaking strikes, its policy in other matters was laissez-faire. There was little effort to enforce the antitrust laws that regulated business mergers. Regulatory agencies such as the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Trade Com- mission consisted largely of members who were unsympathetic to policies restricting private enterprise. The ineffectiveness of these agencies reflected the dominant feel- ing of the time. The new trend was immediately seen in the tariff laws. In 1922 Congress passed the Fordney-McCumber Act, raising import duties to high levels. This protect- ed agriculture as well as certain young industries, such as rayon, china, and the optical-glass and chemical products lor which the United States seized patents from Germany during the war. The Ford- ney-McCumber Act was designed to be \"flexible\"; it therefore authorized the Pres- ident to raise or lower duties by as much as 50 percent. The President could do this on the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, set up in 1916 to study costs of production at home and overseas. In practice, this provision meant that rates often went still higher. In putting more business into govern- ment, the Republican administrations introduced more accountability into fed- eral finances. Because World War I had raised the national debt from less than $10 per person to over $200, the Harding and Coolidge administrations attempted to lower this burden by making the gov- ernment more fiscally responsible. In 1921 Congress created the Bureau of the Budget in the Treasury Department. Until this time, income and outgo had never been coordinated. The efforts of the Bureau of the Budget to introduce savings were especially supported by Coolidge, who felt so strongly about curbing the nation's expenditures that he devoted seri- ous attention to routine federal purchases such as lead pencils and typewriter rib- bons. After the Washington Conference, there was no threat of war on the horizon, and even military expenditures were greatly lowered. Andrew Mellon, secretary of the treasury from 1921 lo 1932 and an immensely wealthy man in his own right, believed that heavy taxes on excess profits \"penal- ized success\" and discouraged investment in productive enterprise. At Mellon's insis- tence, Congress abolished the wartime excise and excess profits taxes and reduced tax rates on incomes by nearly two-thirds. Even with these cuts, the nation's tremen- dous prosperity produced enough tax rev- enue to reduce the national debt by $8 billion between 1921 and 1929. Labor and Labor Unions In 1927 Andre Siegfried, a French soci- ologist, wrote, \"A worker is far better paid in America than anywhere else in the world.\" Between 1921 and 1928, the average annual wage rose from $1,227 to $1,384.

In California, where Hispanic Ameri- cans make up more than one-fourth of the state's popula- tion, some resent- ment is caused by the misguided belief that Hispan- ics refuse to learn to speak English. A recent study showed, however, that 90 percent of Hispanic children do speak English and that 25 per- cent of the chil- dren speak no Spanish at all. jobs elsewhere, the transition was some- times difficult. Not only were they often forced to leave home to find employment, but they also frequently lost the benefit of long years spent learning a particular skill. The introduction of juke boxes and sound films, to cite an extreme example, caused widespread unemployment among musi- cians. And although the assembly line lowered the costs of production, many laborers could not stand the monotony and nervous tension caused by working at a speed set by the machine. This was par- ticularly true of middle-aged workers, for whom \"old at 40\" became a bitter slogan. The \"prosperity decade\" saw labor unions decline in number and strength. Even the American Federation of Labor, one of the largest workers' organizations, had difficulty holding its members in the face of the antiunion activities of employ- ers' associations. Employers joined to pro- mote the open shop — or a shop where workers did not have to join a union. Labeled the \"American Plan,\" in practice the open shop meant a shop closed to union members. To further reduce the power of unions, companies promoted welfare capitalism, a system to make employees feel more a part of the business by enabling them to buy shares of stock, by instituting profitsharing, and by pro- viding such fringe benefits as medical care, retirement pensions, and recreational facil- ities. Moreover, wages and working condi- tions improved somewhat for many during the 1920s. With some improvement in their standards of living and the relative weakness of unions, striking seemed point- less to many workers. Although Herbert Hoover, secretary of commerce, persuaded President Harding to make a successful personal appeal to the leaders of the steel industry to aban- don the 12-hour day, the federal govern- ment was usually on the side of the employers. Thus Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty helped to break railroad and coal strikes in 1922 by obtaining injunctions that prohibited every conceiv- able union activity, including picketing, making public statements to the press, and jeering at strikebreakers. In 1919 the Indiana State Guard — and eventually federal troops — protected strikebreakers at United States Steel. In addition, the Supreme Court continually whittled away at the protections that unions thought they had secured by the Clayton Act of 1914. Once again, injunctions were freely used to stop strikes and boycotts. Restricting Immigration In the decade before World War I, approximately 1 million persons a year came to live in the United States, over two-thirds of these from countries in southern and eastern Europe, such as Italy, Spain, Poland, Hungary, and Greece. Living standards in those coun- tries were low and educational opportuni- ties limited. To slow down this tide of immigration. Congress passed in 1917 an act requiring a literacy test, designed to exclude large numbers of immigrants. The act, however, had little effect. New immigrants congregated in such cities as New York and Chicago, where opportuni- ties for employment were greatest. Here immigrants formed homogenous ethnic communities — every major city had its own \"Little Italy,\" \"Little Poland,\" \"Little Greece,\" and so forth. But this in turn gave rise to the charge that the new immi- grants resisted \"Americanization. \" Estab- lished immigrants resented the new immigrants' increasing political power. Even more, they feared that the newcom- ers, most of whom were Catholic, would overthrow traditional Protestant values. Conservative labor unions were angered by the willingness of poor immigrants to work for very low wages. Employers, who had previously favored unrestricted immi- gration as a means of hiring cheap labor, now came to fear that the new immi- grants were radicals who would fight for a communist revolution. During and after World War I, feeling against \"hyphenated-Americans\" was stimulated by anti-German hysteria, by the \"Red scare,\" and by the sinister Ku Klux KJan. Wlien immigrants began to pour into the United States, fleeing their war-torn countries in the hopes of finding a mythical land of wealth and opportuni- ty. Congress took quick action.

According to this act, only 3 percent ot the total number of people in any nation- al group already living in the United States in 1910 would be admitted during a single year. Three years later the Nation- al Origins Act made restriction a perma- nent policy. This 1924 law temporarily reduced the quota still further, setting it at 2 percent of those residing in this country in 1890. It also provided that after 1927 a total of only 150,000 immigrants would be admitted to the United States per year, their nationalities apportioned on the basis of the 1920 census. This meant that more than 85 percent of the new immi- grants would be from Europe — mainly from Great Britain, Ireland, Germany, and Scandinavia. The intention of the National Origins Act was clearly to discriminate against cer- tain nationalities and races.

Scandals Among Harding's Advisers Although President Harding was person- ally honest, there was more corruption in his administration than in any previous one. Harding's poker-playing friends, known as \"the Ohio Gang,\" used their ties to the President and the attorney general to sell government appointments, pardons, and immunity from prosecution. Harding's choice for head of the Veterans' Bureau, tor example, arranged fraudtilent contracts that sold supplies from veterans' hospitals at a cost to the taxpayers of about $250 million. The worst scandal, however, involved Harding's secretary of the interior, Albert B. Fall, who secretly leased to private interests oil lands, which had been set aside for the navy, at Teapot Dome, Wyoming, and Elk Hills, California. In return. Fall received bribes totaling more than $300,000. Eventually the Senate investigated the Teapot Dome scandal, and Secretary Fall went to prison. When Harding learned what was going on, he complained privately that he had been betrayed. He said that he had no trou- bles with his enemies, but his friends — they were a different story: \"They're the ones that keep me walking the floor nights! \" In the summer of 192.3, Harding traveled to Alaska, deeply concerned and depressed over the .scandals in his administration. On his return from Alaska, Harding became severely ill with what may have been h)od poisoning, piieunionia, or a heart attack. He died on August 2, shortly before news of the scandals broke to the public. Section One Revie-w «» ] Summary President Harding's easy, comfortable style matched America's mood in 1920.

In occasional public speeches and magazine articles, he preached the old-fashioned virtues of honesty, thrift, and hard work. His philos- ophy of government was simple: economy and laissez-faire. To take as little action as possible was with Coolidge almost a prin- ciple of life; he once said, \"Four-fifths of all our troubles in this life would disap- pear if we would only sit down and keep still. \" As President, Coolidge was reputed to sleep 10 hours every night and take a nap every afternoon. By 1924 the scandals of the Harding administration had surfaced, thus present- ing the Democratic parry with a ready- made issue for the presidential campaign. But the Democrats threw away their chances for victory at their national con- vention. The party was deeply divided over two issues: Prohibition — which the rural regions favored and the cities opposed — and more importantly, the Ku Klux Klan. This secret society, which took its name and ritual from the southern organization of Reconstruction times, resembled the Know-Nothings of the 1850s in that it was designed to intimi- date African Americans, Catholics, Jews, immigrants, and \"foreign ideas\" such as the League of Nations. By the mid- 1920s the Klan had become a major force in politics, despite its willingness to use ter- ror and violence to carry out its goals. At the 1924 Democratic convention, the rivals for the nomination were William G. McAdoo of California — who fitvored Prohibition and was generally supported by the West and South — and Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York — a Roman Catholic and opponent of Prohibition whose following came mostly from urban areas of the Northeast. Smith's supporters wanted an outright condemnation of the Ku Klux Klan, which southern and west- ern delegates blocked. The two candidates were deadlocked for so long that the cow- boy-humorist Will Rogers suggested that the eventual nominee might be born at the convention. By the time a compromise candidate — John W. Davis of West Vir- ginia — was nominated on the one-hun- drcd-and-third ballot, the Democrats had lost all chance of winning the election.

Aiming good-natured barbs at ; famous people, he became known as the \"cowboy philosopher.\" By 1920 Will Rogers was a star of | both stage and screen. Starting in f 1926, his daily newspaper column ' spread his humorous views of life and politics throughout the nation. Claim- ing \"I dont make jokes — I just watch ;; the government and report the facts,\" he always poked fun in a lighthearted way and was never hostile; one of his favorite sayings was \"I never met a man I didn't like.\" By the late 1920s audiences were listening to his com- mentary on radio. To Americans, Rogers had become a national treasure. luxuries became necessities. A combina- tion of increased leisure time for both men and women, new gadgets, new amusements, and more money to spend resulted in something approaching glorifi- cation of wealth and of the material com- forts that went with it. The outstanding symbol of the new age was the automobile. In the early twentieth century, when the manufacture of auto- mobiles in the United States was just beginning, driving cars was a sport for the well-off, like racing yachts. By 1930, how- ever, with about 27 million automobiles registered, it was possible lor the nation's entire population to be on the highway at one time. Henry Ford almost single-handedly changed the automobile from a toy of the wealthy to a necessity for all. Ford's famous \"Model T\" — affectionately known as the \"Tin Lizzie\" — was so simple to operate that anyone could learn to drive, and so cheap that most families could afford it. Ford applied many of the famil- iar techniques of successful industrialists, such as the use of standardized parts and the formation of a vertical organization to combine different operations and elimi- nate \"middlemen.\" But Ford's greatest achievement was the assembly line, which divided operations into such simple tasks that most of the work could be done by unskilled labor. Furthermore, by bringing the parts to the workers, assembly lines sped up production so fast that Ford could boast that: . . . fRjaw iron ore at the docks at eight Monday morning could be marketed as a complete Ford car on Wednesday noon, allowing 15 hours for shipment. Ford's economies so reduced costs that an American automobile, which sold for an average price of $2,123 in 1907, could be bought for as litde as $290 in 1924. And while reducing costs, he staved off unionization by nearly doubling wages, in 1914, to $5 a day.

The chain store soon became a familiar sight on Main Street, capturing one-fourth of the grocery business by 1929. Whereas many Americans had formerly regarded big business as an enemy, they now relied on it both to supply cheap products and to create new opportunities for wealth. The stock market provided striking evidence of this when, for the first time in history, some members of the gen- eral public began to buy securities. The prices of shares of stock, especially those connected with new industries, mounted to dizzying heights. More and more pur- chasers \"invested in the future.\" With wealthier Americans speculating in the stock market, money to run business came from more and more diverse sources. Business, on the other hand, was becom- ing more and more concentrated. One device used by businesspeople to concen- trate financial power was the \"pyramiding\" of holding companies, whereby it was pos- sible — with a relatively small outlay ot capital — for businesspeople to gain control of immense industrial properties. Another legal method promoters used to gain the use of other people's money without sur- rendering control was the issuance of non- voting preferred stock. Both of these devices led to such flagrant abuses that they were later forbidden by law. The Plight of Agriculture Farmers were the one great economic group that did not share in the Coolidge prosperity. The average income for farm- ers in 1929 was less than one-third of the average income for the rest of the country. Technological advances led to greater pro- duction, which caused a slump in farm prices even while farmers' costs mounted. As one account puts it; Freight rates, wages, taxes, farm implements, and the like, all of which went into the farmers' cost of production, remained high or came down via the stairway, luhile farm prices took the elevator.

Wheat went from almost $2.50 a bushel to less than $1.50. The foreign market dwindled because the United States had changed from a debtor to a creditor nation. Before World War I, foreign investments in the United States exceeded American investment abroad; the princi- pal means of making up this unfavorable credit balance was for the United States to export agricultural staples, such as wheat and cotton. During the war the balance shifted the other way, principally because of United States loans to the Allies. With the return of peace, countries owing the United States money preferred not to buy its products. Great Britain, lor example, often bought wheat from Argentina or Canada rather than from the United States, especially after the Fordney- McCumber Tariff reduced the American market for British goods. The domestic market also diminished. The use of new fabrics such as rayon less- ened the demand for cotton; the substitu- tion of tractors and trucks for draft animals reduced the need for fodder. Faced with decreasing demands for the traditional staples, farmers might have been expected to shift to other products — but that was easier said than done. A Southern tenant farmer usually had no skill at anything but raising cotton. A Dakota wheat farmer usually lacked the capital and the knowledge to change, say, to dairy farming, which in any case was not well suited to that region. Moreover, credit and marketing facilities were geared to the existing staple crops of each region. Many farmers had borrowed heavily dur- ing the war to buy new land at inflated prices. The only obvious way to pay off the debt was to raise more crops. But more crops meant unsaleable surpluses; unsaleable surpluses meant low prices. And low prices made the debt binden even heavier. Early in Harding's administration, members of (\"ongress from the Midwest and plains slates formed what was known as the larm Bloc. It included about 25 Senators and 100 Representa- tives from both parties. Strong enough to hold a balance of power in Congress, the Farm Bloc was able to force through sev- eral laws favoring farmers. The Capper- Volstead Act of 1922 made farm cooperatives free of antitrust laws; the Intermediate Credits Act of 1923 set up federal banks to make loans to aid farm cooperatives. But none of the laws dealt with the farmers' major problem: surpluses they could not sell. If wheat farmers were to benefit from the 42-cent a bushel protec- tive tariff which eliminated foreign com- petition, they somehow had to limit the amount of wheat they themselves put on that market. The Farm Bloc supported the McNary- Haugen bill. Senator Charles McNary of Oregon and Representative Gilbert Hau- gen of Iowa presented the bill to Congress every year from 1924 to 1928. This bill proposed that the federal gov- ernment buy crop surpluses and sell them abroad, while protecting the U.S. market with a high tariff. This would immediate- ly raise the domestic price. Whatever loss- es the government suffered would be covered by an equalization fee — a tax charged against producers. Supporters of the McNary-Haugen bill claitned that it would help farmers as the tariff helped manufacturers. They claimed it would raise farm incomes by as much as one- third. Iwice the bill passed Congress, but both times President Coolidge vetoed it. The idea would not work, he insisted, and furthermore, a \"healthy economic condi- tion is best maintained through a free play of competition. \" Thus, farmers failed in their effort to obtain protections similar to those many businesses received at the time. Foreign Affairs During the 192()s both Republican Presidents worked to promote world peace through individual agreements rather than through membership in the League ot Nations, which they perceived as an entangling alliance. During Coolidge s administration, France and the United States took the lead in promoting Linking Across Time Government .AND Free Business — Late 1980s The 1980s, like the 1 920s, was a time when Presi- dents vowed to keep government out of business.

The treaty was hailed as a great victory for peace. The Pact, often called the Pact of Paris, was signed by most nations only under certain conditions. The primary condition oi most was to retain the right to defend themselves against acts of aggression. The United States, for example, also stated that the pact did not overrule the principles of the Monroe Doctrine. A serious weakness of the pact was no means of enforcement. No provisions were set down in the pact in the event there were acts of aggression among sign- er nations. Although the United States generally participated in talks and treaties with European and Asian nations during this period, its manner toward Latin Ameri- ca remained protective. The Harding and Coolidge administrations — follow- ing the Roosevelt Corollary to the Mon- roe Doctrine — occasionally sent troops to \"preserve order\" in Caribbean coun- tries. They became increasingly aware, however, that the Latin American peo- ple acutely resented such intervention. Although not willing to give up the right to intervene. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes believed troops should be sent to Latin America only to promote political stability, not to assist American investors. Accordingly, in the mid-1920s, U.S. marines withdrew from the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua, where they had been sent in the previous decade to maintain order. But in 1926 a revolt broke out in Nicaragua against President Adolfo Diaz, who had gained power with the help of American financial interests. Coolidge sent more than 5,000 marines to assist Diaz, arousing a storm oi pro- test both within this country and with- out. The rebels, led by Cesar Augusto Sandino, continued fighting until 1933. fllTIIITIIIB Section Two Review X lAKb Summary After Harding's death, Coolidge contin- ued Harding's probusiness economic poli- cies. The automobile industry symbolized the American public's postwar spending spree that was spurred by higher wages, mass production, and standardized prod- ucts. The economy boomed, but mem- bership in labor unions declined and prices for farm products dropped. The Kellogg-Briand Pact symbolized the world's efforts to solve international prob- lems without war. United States interven- tion, however, continued in Latin America's affairs.

Radio and film, the new entertainments, became immensely popular. The arts flowered. \"Coolidge prosperity\" provided more leisure time and more spending money for new gad- gets. The availability of credit helped many to buy more than they could afford. Women adopted new standards of behavior that would never have been acceptable before. To many, however, these changes suggested a loss of impor- tant traditional values. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe changes in women's lives dur- ing the 1920s. • Outline developments in the arts and education during this period. From ,1 Long Island airfield on May 20, 1927, a small plane called the Spirit of St. Louis took off tor France. Iwenty-five-year- old Charles Lindbergh set off to make the first nonstop solo Hight across the Atlantic. Thirry-three and one-half hours later, Lindbergh landed near Paris. Huge crowds greeted him. An American naval vessel brought him home, and even greater crowds welcomed him back to the United States. \"Lucky Lindy,\" as he was called, became a hero of the age. President Coolidge called him \"a boy representing the best traditions of his country.\" In an era when the ideals and heroes of history were questioned, when politics was riddled with graft, and when machines seemed to be replacing people, Lindbergh helped people restore some confidence in themselves. He proved that Americans were still capable of pioneer- ing, even in the machine age. Quiet, courageous, and self-reliant, Lindbergh showed that not all the old values of life had disappeared, despite the changing priorities of modern society. As writer E Scott Fitzgerald said of Lindbergh: A young Minnesotan who seemed to have nothing to do with his generation did a heroic thing, and for a moment people set down their glasses in country clubs and speakeasies and thougln of their old dreams. Radio and Motion Pictures Advertising and the increased demand for goods were especially stimulated by the spread of a new invention — the radio. In November 1920, station KDKA in Pittsburgh broadcast the news of Har- ding's landslide victory in one of the first commercial broadcasts in history. By 1927 the Federal Radio Commission was established to regulate broadcasting sta- tions — already numbering close to 700. The sales of radio equipment skyrocketed from $12.2 million in 1921 to $842.

By 1929 there were about 100 million paid admissions to movie theaters every week — proof that moviegoing had gained respectability'. Dur- ing the 1920s the motion-picture industry moved from New York to southern Cali- fornia. Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Gloria Swanson, and Clara Bow were among the first stars of the silent screen. In 1927 Warner Brothers introduced \"talking\" pictures, which made the movies more popular than ever. Together, radio and motion pictures helped to make the 1920s a \"golden age of sports.\" By listening to sportscasters and watching newsreels, it was possible for the general public to enjoy sporting events all over the nation. Well-estab- lished sports such as football, boxing, and baseball reached new heights of populari- ty, and traditionally upper-class sports such as golf, tennis, and polo gained new followers. Notre Dame's famous football backfield, the \"Four Horsemen,\" were better known than the cabinet members. Baseball star Babe Ruth became a national hero. Enthusiasm for the Jack Dempsey- Gene Tunney boxing match in 1927 reached such a frenzy that one department store sold $90,000 worth of radios in the two weeks before the event. New Directions in Society The rapid changes caused by the progress of technology in the 1920s did cause some serious problems, however. Automobiles, though they offered an exciting new freedom of movement, also killed as many Americans in 1928 and 1929 as had lost their lives in batde dur- ing World War I. Cities lost some of their attractiveness as automobiles enabled peo- ple and businesses to move to the suburbs. The easily available \"canned entertain- ment\" provided by radio and motion pic- tures seemed to discourage Americans from creating their own amusements. Unfortunately, during the 1920s crime became big business.

How did such people benefit from public behavior in the 1920s? Capone and Dutch Schultz consolidated the illegal liquor trade on many of the same principles used to consolidate the automobile and steel industries. The Pro- hibition Bureau, set up to enforce the law against the distilling and sale ot liquor, was understaffed, underpaid, graft-ridden, and ineffective. Although liquor con- sumption dropped substantially during Prohibition, illegal drinking by millions created an illegitimate billion-dollar industry. The entrepreneurs in this illegal business became wealthy enough to buy beautiful homes in Florida, steel-plated limousines, and fabulous jewels, such as Capone's eleven-and-a-half carat diamond ring. Some gangsters became powerkil enough to corrupt and even take over local governments. Rural America, with its traditional val- ues and churchgoing ways, tended to sup- port Prohibition, but the cities generally opposed it. The customary diets of several urban ethnic groups included liquor, and many city dwellers resisted Prohibition as the work of religious crusaders. Regard- less, Prohibition was never fully enforced. Many people supported Prohibition pub- licly while privately continuing to drink, prompting humorist Will Rogers to note that some folks would vote dry \"as long as [they] can stagger to the polls.\" Despite the success ot the illegal liquor trade, Prohibition actually gained in pop- ularity during the 192()s. In 1428 voters elected more supporters ot Prohibition to Congress than ever before, as well as a \"dry\" President, Herbert Hoover. The popularity of Prohibition was a sign of continuing taith in the possibility of achieving a better life, of a longing for the ideals that had eroded in the horrors of World War I.

To many, Prohibition seemed a way to halt this change in values. Women in the 1920s The 1920s saw women express greater personal freedom. A dramatic new woman of the 1920s — the \"flapper\" — demanded the same freedom enjoyed by men. She sometimes smoked cigarettes and drank liquor and dressed in a way her mother and grandmother would not have believed possible. While most women in the 1920s were not flappers, this new young woman demonstrated how modern women's behavior was changing. Life of the Times 1920s Fashion During the 1920s, postwar America revolted against many of the puritanical social mores that were in place at the turn of the century. The revolt was spearheaded by the American female who had been thrust fom her traditional role during the war. With the passage of the Nine- teenth Amendment in 1920, women demanded social free- doms that had been previously awarded males only. One of the clearest indica- tors of emerg- ing feminism was in women's fashions. Skirts that only years before had rest- ed at the ankles were raised to the knee. Dark cotton stock- ings were replaced by flesh-colored silk ones. Long hair that was once pulled back and formed into a bun was cut close to the head with a single curl at each ear. Camisole knickers came to symbolize the new equality between the sexes. Women revolutionized fashion during the 1920s as a display of their desire for greater status in society and as a response to societj's changing standards of prosperit)', indepen- dence, and beauty. A modern woman need- ed to look modern — different. The \"modern ' look involved not just clothing and coordinated accessories, but an updated \"face. \" Cosmetics sales soared as women copied the look of Hollywood movie stats. The average American woman used about one pound of face powder and eight rouge compacts vearly. American family life was also changing. Couples had fewer children because of increased knowledge about family plan- ning, divorce rates increased, and more women than ever before sought employ- ment outside the home. Having achieved the right to vote, women sought financial independence as well. Many young single women became salesclerks in department stores, secre- taries, or telephone operators, for exam- ple. In 1920, 25 percent of women workers were in clerical and sales work. Eventually the employees in those particu- lar jobs became almost exclusively female. Graduates of women's colleges began to seek jobs in business rather than in more traditional jobs such as teaching. But many women, especially married women who had to work to suppott families, were contmed to jobs with long bouts, poor conditions, and low wages. Women who worked outside the home sufi^ered severe discrimination, often receiving only 50 to 60 percent of a man's wages for the same work. And women continued to meet with difficulty when trying to enter presti- gious professions such as science and law.

What other contribu- tions did black Ameri- cans make to 1920s culture? Individual women, however, made great contributions in many fields — often under difficult circumstances. Amelia Earhart learned to fly planes and became the first woman to complete a solo flight across the Atlantic. Dorothy Thompson became a famous journalist. Mary McLeod Bethune — though a black woman born into poverty — founded her own college, founded the National Coun- cil of Negro Women, and served as a gov- ernment consultant. Most Americans — both men and women — continued to believe that a mar- ried woman's place was in the home. Thus, in spite of a spirit ot independence, most women continued to be bound by the belief that their role was different from that ot men, that they were to be mothers and homemakers. With new electric technolog)', the nature of being a homemaker changed. New household appliances, such as refrigerators and vacu- um cleaners, commercial laundries, and canned food made hard, time-consimiing domestic duties much easier. Many who stayed at home and became mothers, par- ticularly in middle-class families, managed motherhood by listening to child-rearing experts who promoted regularly scheduled feedings for children and regimented rou- tines for such children's extra-curricular activities as music lessons and clubs. Cultural Achievements American literature thrived in the 1920s. Some writers, such as the novelist Willa Gather and the poet Robert Frost, tried to recapture the spirit and traditions of rural America; others, such as poet Carl Sandburg, examined what was happening in America's cities. In Eugene O'Neill, the United States produced its finest play- wright. O'Neill found material in many aspects of American life — from the rage of a worker in the hold of a steamship in The Hairy Ape, to family tension in a decaying New England town in Desire Under the Ehns. Ernest Hemingway, who had driven an ambulance on the Italian front during World War I, wrote about the meaning- less violence ot war in A Farewell to Arms. His fiction created a new literary style characterized by direct, simple, spare prose. I he poet 1. S. Eliot saw a world filled with \"hollow men\" and, in I he Wasteland, one that would end \"not with a bang but a whimper.\" Postwar disillusionment was often man- ifested as criticism ot American lite. Henry Ford said that \"history is bimk,\" and a school ot \"debimking\" historians reexamined the past and reevaluated more acciuateU' liie lacis behind the nuths of many American heroes.

Although some women tound that laborsaving devices gave them more leisure time, others said that the dirt and soot caused by automobile traffic and nearby factories made their homes dirtier than those of the previous generation. Most of the women sur- veved said they spent less time on housework than their mothers, but other demands had increased. \"So man\\' things our mothers didn't know about, we feel that we ought to do for our children,\" said one woman. n hmmBmHI JUHU' Making The Technology Connection 1 .

Mencken saw no hope for improvement. \"If I am convinced of anything,\" he wrote, \"it is that Doing Good is in bad taste.\" Achievements in American literature were matched in the arts. The new city skyscrapers and suburban homes expand- ed the opportunities of architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, who achieved world- wide fame for his bold use of new materi- als and for architectural designs free of traditional influence. In jazz, which start- ed with black Dixieland bands in New Orleans, America produced a new form of music. At first seen as corrupting the morals of young people, jazz was soon accepted as an important art form. In the fine arts, the American scene was brilliant- ly portrayed by such painters as Reginald Marsh, I homas Hart Benton, George Bellows, and Edward Hopper. In photog- raphy, Alfred Stieglitz achieved an interna- tional reputation. Changes and Challenges in Education A significant amount of the new wealth of the 1920s went into education, both through taxes for new public schools and through private donations to colleges and universities. The introduction of the school bus made possible the gradual replacement of bare, one-room country schoolhouses with large, well-equipped central schools. High school was no longer the privilege of the well-off, but was also attended by the children of farm- ers and workers — although graduation from high school remained the exception rather than the rule. Both high school and college enrollment increased steadily. 782 Units Conflict, Confidence, and Collapse: 1914-1932"},{"pageNumber":821,"pageContent":"Examining Photographs Opposing attorneys Clarence Darrow (left) and William Jennings Bryan pose during the famous Scopes trial. Scopes was later freed on appeal, but the trial proved too much for Bryan, who died a week after it ended. What basic clash of values in 1920s' society did the trial illustrate? A philosophy of education, long champi- oned by John Dewey, emphasized learning through direct experience and experiment rather than through memorization. Greater emphasis was placed on science, which Dewey viewed as a way of using both thought and activity to investigate nature. Some religious groups found these new etiucational theories threatening and were able to gain laws in some states to prevent the teaching ol evolution in public schools. This set the stage for a battle between science and religion. It came in 1925, at the trial of John F. Scopes, a teacher in Dayton, Tennessee, who was willing to be arrested for teaching evolu- tion to his high-school class. The Ameri- can C^ivil Liberties Union (ACLU) had raised money to test the new anti-evolu- tion law in lennessee and had asked Scopes it he would volimteer lor the cause. I he himous attorney Clarence Dar- row defended Scopes, while William Jen- nings Bryan aided the prosecution lor the ami-evoliuion lorces.

Here they mixed with blacks for the first time, enjoying the entertainment but never see- ing the real lives of ordinary African Americans. White interest in black expres- sion in art, literature, and music produced a feeling among some blacks in Harlem that the race problem had been solved.

While some Americans were pleased with the outpouring of creativity as painters broke away from past traditions to explore new ways of portraying the world, others were shocked. African Americans, in particular, began to express their unique identity and heritage through art. Although the outpouring ot literature, art, and music known as the Harlem Renaissance involved only a handful ot artists and writers, the power of their work brought international attention and acclaim to Harlem in the 1920s and 1930s. The visual artists associated with the Harlem Renaissance were a diverse group of people. Some, such as Edwin A. Harleston and Laura Wheeler Waring, painted in a style that was virtually indistinguishable from that of their white European and American peers. Others, such as Lois Mailou Jones and Aaron Douglas, used African design motifs to shape a distinctively African-American art. Aaron Douglas, the best-known visual artist ot the Harlem Renaissance, was perhaps also the one most influenced by Ahican design. He developed his style ol geometric symbolism as a painter of murals on public buildings. I he painting shown here. The Creation, shows several elements charac- teristic of Douglas's style: a figure that represents not a particul.ii person but all humankind; subtle, barely different- iated shades of purple and gray; and shapes such as circles, arches, and waves. Douglas believed that art can be a bridge between different cultures and peo- ples. He asserts this belief through his paintings, which describe human experience in a streamlined visual language that peo- ple of different times, places, gen- ders, and races can easily understand. In addition to his creative talent, Douglas inspired the Harlem Renaissance by actively searching out and training other African-American artists. His efforts were rewarded in January 1928 when the first all-black art show in the United States was held in New York City. Many of the exhibitors became eminent in American art. Aaron Douglas became a professor of art at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee.

To establish peace, Harding negotiated a number of treaties with other nations to limit arms and to avoid future conflicts. Domestically, Harding put the United States on a course that stressed lausez- faire economics and the stimulation of business through high tariffs and low taxes. After Harding's death, his successor, Calvin Coolidge, continued the same probusiness economic programs. Economic changes produced social changes. Ameri- can industry produced an endless array of goods, including automobiles, that were eagerly snapped up by increasingly well-paid workers. Equally exciting was a burst ot creativity in art and literature, typified by the Harlem Renaissance. Women pushed tor more personal freedom and for a share in the prosperity.

When you warrant, or guarantee, what you say to someone, you are assuring that person ok the dependability and truth ot what you have said. There- fore, when you make a warranted claim, you are stat- ing something as a fact that has a basis in truth and can be proven. An unwarranted claim, on the other hand, is a statement that lacks any proof or facts to support it. Thus, to determine if a claim is warranted or unwar- ranted, you have to look for supporting proof. Even if a claim appears to be true, if no evidence is presented to back it up, it must be considered unwarranted, and you would be correcc to question it. In each case, you must ask yourself, \"What evidence is presented to prove the truth of this statement.'\" When you study history you need to determine if claims are warranted or unwarranted. The following guitlclines will help you: • Identify the claim th.it the speaker or writer is try- ing to make. • Ask yourself \"What evidence is presented to prove the truth of this claim.''\" • Realize that any claim that cannot be supported with evidence is an unwarranted claim. Example Study and analyze the two paragraphs that follow, and note how the guidelines have been applied. When married women of the 1920s sought employment outside of the home, their troubles soon began and American family life would never be the same. Divorce rates increased, women smoked and drank in public, and wore dresses with hemlines above the knees. If they all had remained at home and followed their traditional roles, their circumstances would not have been so difficult. (While it may be true that some women's behavior changed during the 1920s, the last statement is an assumption that cannot be proved by any facts. As a result, it is an unwarranted claim.) Most married women who worked in the 1920s did so because they had to and then they suffered severe discrimination. They often worked as maids, or in garment and canning factories for long hours in bad conditions for low wages. They also received only 50 to 60 percent of a mans wages, even for the same work. In addition, women were barred from many jobs that were thought to be unsuitable for them. (The claim that working women in the 1920s were discriminated against is supported by the statements that follow it. Therefore, the claim made at the beginning of the passage is a warranted claim.) Practice Think about what you have read in the chapter about the cultural achievements in the 1920s and then decide if the following claims are warratued or imwarranted. C'ite evidence tor those claims you consider warranted. I.Ernest Hemingway could write accurately about the destruction and violence of war because he wit- nessed it first hand. 2.

Many people believed that electing Hoover President would help continue the prosperity. With the great stock market crash of 1929, howev- er, and the chain of economic problems that lollowed, this optimism disappeared. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain how Hoover's philosophy affected his economic policy. • Explain the major causes of the Great Depression. Herbert Hoover easily won the Republican nomination in 1928. A successful geologist, he had spent eight years as Secretary of Commerce in the Harding and Coolidge administrations. The Democrats chose Alfred E. Smith, four-time governor of New York. Their race for the presidency was marked by the influence of a new invention — the radio. This important political tool, however, helped Hoover more than Smith. Although Smith had more personal sparkle, many listeners were repelled by his New York accent and witry off-the- cuff remarks. Hoover, on the other hand, sounded dignified and presented himself as a typical Iowa farmboy. The Election of 1928 The most visible issue in the election campaign was Prohibition. Both candi- dates vowed to continue enforcing Prohi- bition, which Hoover dubbed \"a great social and economic experiment, noble in motive and far-reaching in purpose.\" Smith candidly admitted that he occa- sionally broke the law by drinking a little wine. The Prohibition issue, however, masked other important differences between the candidates. Hoover repre- sented rural, agrarian interests; Smith represented urban, industrial interests. The candidates' personal views on Prohi- bition brought to light their religious differences. Simply put. Hoover was a \"dry\" Quaker and Smith was a \"wet\" Roman Catholic. Religion was at the core of a smear cam- paign against Smith's Catholicism. Wild tales circulated alleging that Catholics had turned certain Washington church sites into armories, or storehouses for guns. Some believed that the White House under Smith would become a branch of the Vatican. Although Hoover was embarrassed by these accusations and tried to squash them, they certainly hurt Smith's candidacy, especially in rural Protestant areas. Late in the campaign, Hoover made a speech to offer his ideas on the proper relationship of government to business. Government, Hoover claimed, should be \"an umpire instead of a player in the eco- nomic game.\" To be sure, government had a part to play — conservation of natural resources, scientific research, and flood control were places where Hoover 790 Unit 8 Conflict, Confidence, ,\\nd Collapse: 1914-1932"},{"pageNumber":829,"pageContent":"Examining Illustrations Campaign posters often depict major differences between candi- dates in an election.

To involve government in business, Hoover warned, would undermine \"the very instincts which carry our people forward to progress.\" He reminded his listeners that: Our experi/nent in human welfare has yielded a degree ofiuell-being ntiparalleled in the world... . We are nearer to the ideal of abolition of poverty and fear from the lives of men and women than ever before in any land. Indeed, prosperity was the campaign issue that proved most damaging to the Democrats. The almost uninterrupted prosperity the country had enjoyed during the 1920s was associated in the minds of many voters with the Republican party. Republican campaign slogans such as \"two cars in every garage\" meant ih.ii ihe Democrats never really had a chance of winning the election. Hoover won an impressive victory in the electoral college with a vote of 444 to 87. His appeal to rural Protestant voters even broke the Democrat's traditional hold on the solid South, resulting in a Republican win in 5 southern states. Although Smith lost the election, he won twice as many votes as had the Democrat- ic candidate in 1924. More importantly. Hoover became the first presidential win- ner to lose in the nation's 12 largest cities. A shift in the rural-urban balance of polit- ical power in America was in the wind. Hoover in the White House When he took office in March 1929, Herbert Hoover still radiated optimism. In his inaugural address, he predicted ih.it the United States would soon be \"in sight of the day when poverty will be banished from this nation.\" Hoover did not believe the federal government should let economic events run their course but rather that it should help peo- ple to lul|i themselves. He appointed commissions to investigate problems as diverse as housing, retirement pensions.

One commission in par- ticular, headed by former Attorney General George W. Wickersham, devoted 2 years to investigating Prohibition.

In April 1929, Hoover called Congress into special session to pass farming legisla- . tion. Members of Congress from farm states demanded that the federal govern- ment buy surplus farm products and sell them abroad. Hoover opposed this on the grounds that \"no government agency should engage in buying and selling and price-fixing ol products.\" Instead the President proposed that the federal government help farmers use their own organizations to market produce more efficiently and adjust supply to demand. Following this recommendation. Congress passed the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929, which created a Federal Farm Board with $500 million at its disposal to help existing farm organizations and to form new ones. The Farm Board estab- lished national cooperatives — such as the National Livestock Marketing Association and the American Cotton Cooperative Association and then loaned these organi- zations money to help keep prices stable. But it was too little, too late. Farmers were soon worse off than ever, as America and the rest of the world plunged into the worst depression in history. The Crash of 1929 The market value of securities, or stocks and bonds, on the New York Stock Exchange more than tripled between 1925 and 1929— from $27 billion to $87 billion. In the summer of 1929, for exam- ple, a share of American Telephone and Telegraph rose from $209 to $303. During the same period, a share of Gener- al Motors rose from $268 to $391 and by September 2 rose even higher — to $452 per share. As prices rose, more and more people began speculating. Speculation is engaging in a risky business venture on the chance a quick or sizeable profit can be made. People bought shares they thought would rise in price quickly, and after prices went up they would sell the stocks for a profit. To maximize the potential profits on their investments, speculators commonly 792 Unit 8 Conflict, Confidence, and Collapse: 1914-1 932"},{"pageNumber":831,"pageContent":"Connections History The Stock Market \"Sooner or later,\" said economist Roger Babson on September 5, 1929, \"a crash is coming.. .factories will be shut down. ..men will be thrown out ot work. ..the result will be a serious business depression.\" But most analysts assured Americans that the stock market was healthy and thriving. Outside the Neiv York Stock Excluvige. October 24, 1929 AND Economics A stock exchange is an organized sys- tem for buying and selling shares, or blocks of investments, in corporations. In the late 1920s, the value ot stocks on the New York Exchange climbed to dizzying heights. To take advantage of the boom, investors borrowed money to buy stocks, a practice known as buying on margin. The boom could last only as long as investors added money to the pool. By 1929, everyone with money to invest had bought into the market, and it ran out of new customers. Prices stopped rising. People sold shares to pay the interest on their loans. As shares were sold, prices fell. Panicked investors tried to minimize their losses. On October 29, less than two months after Babsons prediction, the market crashed. But the crash was a symptom not a cause ot the Great Depression. iiiniiTiTi Making the Economics Connection 1. What series of events occur when the stock market crashes? 2. Why did people begin selling shares of\" stock in the fall of 1929? Linking Past AND Present 3. Compare the 1929 stock market crash with the sav- ings and loan crisis of the 1980s. lITTTTIfTII bought stock on margin, lo buy stock in this way one made a small cash down payment and borrowed the rest from a stockbroker. For example, it one had $2,000, rather than paying cash tor 10 shares of stock at $200 per share, one could buy 100 shares on margin. The purchaser simply put down 10 percent ot the price (or $20 per share), and bor- rowed the other $18,000 from a broker, who would then hold the shares ot stock as collateral tor the loan. Brokers loaned billions ot dollars, which the borrower was obliged to repay on demand. But few borrowers were worried. So long as prices continued to rise, investors could sell the stock later, repay the loan, ami reap the profit. Some bankers, brokers, and economists were concerned, however, because thev knew the stock for many companies was greatly overpriced in comparison to the earnings and profits the companies were making. Yet most investors were swept along on the tide ot the day's optimism. Even President Coolidge abandoned his usual cautious silence to say that he saw nothing wrong with the great increase in brokers' loans. Meanwhile, the market continued its dizzying climb. By the end ot 1929, brokers' loans to those who had bought on margin exceeded $7 billion. The Federal Reserve Board tried to restore stability to the market by advising banks not to loan money for buying stocks on margin, but few banks listened. In September 1929, the market started to waver as some professional specidators sensed danger and began to pull out, and prices slipped. Late in October real disas- ter struck. On Thursday, October 24, almost 13 million shares of stocks were traded so frantically the ticker couldn't keep up. As stocks' values dropped below the amounts borrowed to purchase them, brokers demanded that investors repay their loans, it they could not, the brokers ottered the stock tor sale.

One cause of the Depression was overspeculation. What were the other causes? the nation. The dedining value of farms made it harder for farmers to get credit. Banks that had invested heavily in farm mortgages were in danger of failing. In addition, huge farm surpluses produced a drop in farm prices so great that farmers often spent more money growing and marketing their products than they received in selling them. The resulting loss in farmers' purchasing power further reduced the consumption of manufactured goods — a condition that only added to the problem of underconsumption. The Great Depression was not solely a result of economic practices. Many of the economic policies of the Harding and Coolidge administrations during the 1920s set the stage for problems by the end of the decade. Policies such as the prohibitively high Fordney-McCumber tariff, combined with the Republican administrations' insistence on collecting war debts, interfered with world trade and destroyed foreign markets for American products, especially in agriculture. The Mellon tax policies, which aided the From January to September 1929, for example, the number of automobile pur- chases dropped by one-third. Another cause of the Depression was underconsumption. In the 1920s the rich got richer much faster than the rest of the people. Some 30,000 families at the top of the economic pyramid had as much income as did the 1 1 million families at the bottom. Fhough production increased, employment stood still, and workers' wages went up at a far slower rate than executive salaries or corporation profits. In 1929 more than two-thirds of the nation's families were earning less than $2,500 per year, a sum said to be the min- imum income for a decent quality of life. About one-fifth of the nation lived in dire poverty. Thus there was insufficient piu- chasing power to support the nation's mass-production industries. A prolonged slump in agriculture, which affected the economic life of the entire coimtry was another factor.

Because these jobless workers could not meet mortgage pay- ments or repay loans, they lost their prop- erty. Banks that had lent them money failed, wiping out their depositors\" savings.

Section One Review a Summary Aided by a campaign based on prosperi- ty Herbert Hoover easily won the 1928 presidential election. During the cam- paign, Hoover stressed his belief that the role of government was to referee the booming American economy, but not to restrict it. But there were some troubling economic signs, including a continuing slump in farm prices and Americans' will- ingness to accumulate debt.

During the Great Depression, however, the government was forced to seek more vigorous remedies for the nation's vast economic problems. Failing to succeed, however, in domestic policies. President Herbert Hoover made peace the cornerstone of his administration. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • List the ways in which Hoover tried to end the Depression. • Describe the change in United States policy toward Latin America under Hoover. • Describe the Hoover-Stimson Doctrine and evaluate its effectiveness as a foreign policy. No sooner had ihe stock market collapsed than President Hoover asked leaders of industry, finance, and labor to come to the White I louse. He asked labor leaders to abandon wage demands, indtis- try leaders to keep employment high, aiul bankers to loiitiiuie lending, floover and Chafii:r 11 I'lu; Depres.sion Begins other leaders tried to restore public confi- dence by issuing optimistic statements. But their rosy predictions were contradict- ed by worsening conditions, and the phrase \"prosperity is just around the cor- ner\" became a joke. The Republican campaign slogan \"Two cars in every garage\" had become \"Two families in every garage.\" Domestic Concerns Loom In dealing with Congress and the public. Hoover was limited by his inflexi- ble views. A man of great abilit)' and possessed of a sincere desire to serve the nation, he lacked practical political experi- ence. Even with such skills, his position would have been difficult. Republican parry leaders never gave him their whole- hearted support, and members of the Farm Bloc were in open revolt. As a result ol the midterm elections of 1930, the Democrats made gains in the Senate and won control of the House of Repre- sentatives. This shift in power led to a Congress hostile to Hoover's policies during the last two years of his adtninistration. Like President Taft in 1909, Hoover was unable to control Congress on the tariff issue. The Hawley-Smoot Tariff started in the House as a protection for farmers, but by the time it passed the Senate it had turned into the highest pro- tective tariff in peacetime history. It raised the average duty on raw agricultural mate- rials and other items above the Fordney- McCumber Act levels. By the time the Hawley-Smoot bill reached the President's desk in 1930, more than a thousand leading economists had sigtied a letter urging him to veto it. They argued that it would help inefficient producers, raise consumer prices, reduce foreign markets, and cause ill will toward the L'nited States in other countries. This opinion w.ts voiced b\\- iiiain' conservative newspapers, by the American Bankers Association, and even by a number of mainifacturers. Now Hoover faced a tlilemma.

During this crisis, the Farm Board tried to main- tain the price of wheat and cotton by buy- ing up the surplus of these crops. The Farm Board also attempted — without suc- cess — to persuade farmers to plant less, in order to reduce the amount of farm pro- duce grown and thus to prevent further surplus crops. The immense quantities of wheat and cotton held by the government actually drove prices down, however, because buyers feared that the government would sell these surpluses as soon as prices rose. Finally, in 1931, the Farm Board acknowledged defeat and stopped its pur- chases. Immediately prices dropped even lower. By 1932 farmers were receiving only 38 cents a bushel for wheat that in 1929 had sold at $1.04. Even Hoover's relatives in Iowa suffered from the depressed farm economy Harry Terrell, a farmer who lived in the same neighbor- hood as President Hoover in Iowa, described conditions in the following way: Examining Photographs Work /s whai I want\" gives the feeling of wfiat it was like to be out of work during tfie Depression.

Even people like them, they had times just like the rest of us Corn was going for eight cents a bushel. One county insisted on burning corn to heat the courthouse, cause it was cheaper than coal Hoover's Strong Resolve Hoover was deeply affected by all the misery and poverty around him. But as a staunch believer in private enterprise, he feared direct government hand-outs would destroy personal initiative. Hoover therefore offered government help to banks and businesses in the hope that restored financial health at the top oi the economic pyramid would eventually trickle down to relieve unemployment at the bottom. Keeping his attitude positive and his resolve strong, Hoover sought to inspire confidence in a people ravaged by hopelessness and despair: \"Ninety percent of our difficulty in depression is caused by fear.\" In 1932, after Hoover's initial resistance, Congress established the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC). With $2 billion in resources, the RFC made loans to hard-pressed railroads, insurance companies, banks, and even state and local governments — but not to indi- viduals. The RFC favored projects that were \"self-liquidating\"; that is, projects designed to pay their way so the govern- ment would eventually get back its money. Thus projects such as toll bridges and dams that would produce electric power were favored over those which could have been socially useful bui brought in no revenue, such as play- grounds, schools, and city halls. There was a point beyond which Hoover refused to use the power and resources ol the federal government. He feared that too much reliance on federal action would result in the very \"paternal- ism\" and \"state socialism\" he had warned against in the 1928 campaign. He opposed direct federal relief for the unem- ployed on the grounds that it would weaken the self-respect of those who received it, undercut the efforts of private charity, and that it would destroy the tra- dition of local responsibility for the unfor- tunate. Hoover, therefore, vetoed the Garner- Wagner bill in 1932, which would have given direct aid to the unemployed. He also vetoed the Norris bill, which would have put the government in the business of producing and selling electrici- ty in the Tennessee Valley — thus setting up a direct competition with private com- panies. Efforts for Peace Ihe desire for world peace was strong during these hard times, partly because preparation for war was costly, and partly because few had forgotten the horrors of World War I. As a Quaker and a pacifist, Herbert Hoover believed that war was morallv wrong; as administrator of Belgian relief between 1914 and 1917, he saw the devastation of World Wir 1 firsthand. Hoover was committed to world peace. As he stated in 1928: / think I may say that I have witnessed as much of the horror and suffering of war as any other America)!. From it I have derived a deep passion for peace. Our foreign policy has one primary objective, and that is peace. Hoover's peace efforts were aided by his many years spent overseas. The most widely traveled man ever to occupy the White House, he had visited every conti- nent and knew many foreign leaders personally. As secretary of commerce, Hoover had come to understand that Latin America's resentment and distrust of the United States inhibited American trade with that region. To allay this ill will, he used the lime between his election in November Linking Across Time Foreign Factories In the 1980s, as in the 1930s, American corpora- tions shared simi- lar desires for opening foreign markets as well as promoting Ameri- can trade and goodwill abroad.

In his speeches, published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, Hoover stressed that the United States wished to be a triend to its neighbors in Latin America. Many expressed doubts about how effective Hoover's efforts would be. Commenting on Hoover's trip, one Cuban journal printed this statement: If Ah: Hoover wants to conquer the immediate sympathy of Latin America, he should at once announce a change in the policy of his country, declaring that the Monroe Doctrine does not mean that the American continent is only for the United States But Hoover's Latin American policies reflected a sincere desire to improve relations. In addition to successfully arbitrating a long-standing boundary dis- pute between Chile and Peru, Hoover abandoned military intervention in Latin American countries. The Clark Memo- randum, written bv Undersecretary of Examining Photographs Hoover said his Latin American visit was of \"one good neighbor to another \" Why were Hoover's efforts unsuc- cessful? State J. Reuben Clark, argued the position that the Roosevelt Corollary to the Mon- roe Doctrine had no historical basis. Clark wrote, \"The Monroe Doctrine states a case of the United States v. Europe, not of the United States v. Latin America. \" In other words, the Monroe Doctrine could no longer be used to justify American intervention in Latin America. In accordance with this principle. Hoover withdrew troops from Nicaragua and refused to intervene in the affairs of Latin American states that, because of political chaos, had repudiated their debts to the United States. While this noninter- vention policy helped to convince many Latin Americans that the United States had no aggressive intentions, it won Hoover little goodwill. The Hawley- Smoot Tariff had hurt Latin America's economy, and the regions underlying resentment of the wealth and power of the United States did not disappear. Nonethe- less, Hoover had laid the basis lor the \"Good Neighbor\" policy that Franklin Delano Roosevelt would develop during his administration. Disarmament and Moratorium Hoover strongly favored disarmament, not only because of his personal beliefs but also because military spending and increased taxes depleted valuable resources. Shortly after taking office. Hoover made arrangements for a new conference in London on naval disarma- ment. Its goal would be to extend the lim- its on battleships that had been set in the Five-Power Trear\\' signed in 1921-1922. After four months of talks, the London Naval Conference of 1930 produced a treat)' fixing ratios for the submarines, cruisers, and destroyers of the United States, British, and Japanese navies. Italy refused to sign. France, fearing aggression by Germany and Italy, said that it favored disarmament only if other powers would agree to give France assurance of protec- tion. In the end, France chose not to sign.

Its work was hampered by the activities of lobbyists for arms manutacturers and by mutual mistrust among the delegates. For five years it had gotten nowhere, focusing on such trivial issues as the influence of log on war. In 1932 President Hoover proposed to the Geneva Conference that the nations of the world either entirely abandon aggressive weapons or cut exist- ing arms by one-third. No action resulted. With Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, however, and Japanese inva- sions into China, disarmament now seemed like an invitation to aggression. Hoover's proposal could have succeeded only if the United States had been willing to join an alliance of nations committed to \"collective security,\" whereby members would all agree to come to the aid of any member nation who was threatened with aggression. By 1931 Germany was in the throes of a serious depression. Germans could not continue paying war reparations to the Allies without defaulting on their debts to American private investors. Hoover, like Harding and C'oolidge before him, believed that reparations were \"a European prob- lem. \" But heavy war debts and rising unemployment caused great discontent among the German people and led directly to the rapid growth of two antidemocratic parties — the Communist party and the Nazi parry. The Allies were unlikely to cancel Ger- man reparation payments, which they used to pay oil their own war debts to the United States. To address the problem in 1931, Hoover proposed an international moratorium that suspended, for one year, all war-debt payments to the United States. Hoover's aim was to protect Unit- ed States investments in Germany and to save the German Republic from collapse, as well as to stimulate international trade. Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson urged that war debts and reparations be canceled completely, but Hoover refused, lo do so would have been a highly unpopular measure and would have wors- ened Hoover's already poor relations with C Congress.

It also breached the Charter of the League of Nations, to which both China and Japan belonged. China appealed to the League of Nations, which turned to the United States lor help. President Hoover, howev- er, refused to consider either economic or military action. Instead, he sent a United States army officer to serve on a League commission to investigate Japanese actions in Manchuria. Secretary Stimson proclaimed in 1932 that the United States would refuse to recognize the legality of any territorial arrangement that violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The Hoover- Stimson Doctrine, designed to enlist world opinion against aggressor nations, did nothing to aid China and served only to irritate the Japanese. Although the nonrecognition policy had been worked out by Hoover and Stimson together, it meant different things to each of them. Stimson wanted the policy to act as a warning, which later might be backed up by economic or mili- tary aid. But according to Hoover, the statement itself was enough. The United States, he said, did not exist to police the world. Economic sanctions might lead to war, he said, and Japanese aggression in Asia did not \"imperil the freedom of the American people.\" Nor were the British and French governments willing to apply sanctions. The failure of western nations to take action only encouraged Japanese expansion into China and Southeast Asia. The American public was not prepared to support any interventionist effort that could potentially involve the United States in war once again. This feeling was evident in 1931 when Congress overwhelmingly overrode Hoover's veto and voted to give independence to the Philippines within 10 years. This measure pleased Filipino lead- ers; it also pleased the United States busi- ness community, who wanted to keep Filipino products out of America. But a major reason for passage of the bill was that the American people no longer want- ed to defend the islands, upholding the American anti-imperialist past. Section Two Review Summary The Great Depression deepened and Hoover's signature on the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act hurt American business. Ameri- can farmers were hard hit during the depression when crop prices fell so low that farmers could not make a living. Hoover, torn between helping people with direct aid and his belief in free enterprise, compromised by helping banks and busi- nesses. Hoover also sought to maintain world peace during the Depression. He estab- lished a good neighbor policy toward Latin America and proposed a one-year moratorium on German war reparations. Checking for Understanding 1.

Explanation A persuasive argument is one in which the reader or listener is urged to do something or believe in the same thing as does the writer or speaker. The following guidelines will help you organize and write a persuasive argument: a. Before writing, research the topic. What are the facts, and how do people feel about this subject? This will aid you in determining what arguments to use. b.Tailor your argument to your audience. Exactly who are you trying to persuade? Keep in mind that many people will share your point of view if they see some benefit for themselves. c.Support your argument with solid facts and examples. Use only those which are most likely to cause the reader to share your viewpoint. d.Save the most persuasive argu- ments for last, then end your paper by sLimmarizing your points. Example Hoover defending his war debt moratorium.

Germany, for all its past offenses, is teetering on the brink of collapse. Europe, like Atnerica, is fighting the eflects of this demoralizing depression. Internation- al trade is at dangerously low levels, and the spectre of debt hangs over all of us like a shadow. The time has come to close the gap between how we feel about that Great War, and what we know to be the just and proper way to revive our ailing economies. Let us consider our children's future, and not so much our temporary feelings of outrage for a war that is over. Abide with me in my decision to place a one year, international moratorium on all war debts. It is time to let go of the past, and resurrect the quality of life that has been obscured by this spectre of debt. After reading this, it should be clear to Hoover's audience that: a.Hoover researched the topic. He cited world conditions, international trade, and debt. b.He knew that France would be in opposition, since it was France that was most in favor of demanding payments from Germany. Hoover therefore tailored this paper for the French people. C.Hoover used facts about the low levels of trade and the political and economic problems of Germany. His remark about Americas suffering made the point that all countries were linked by common interests and needs. d. He mentioned the future of the world's children as perhaps the most persuasive argument, making the reader realize that feelings of revenge could affect the world for years to come. Then he summarized the argu- ment with an appeal to let go of the past and to restore the quality of life that had been lost.

Harburg Songwriter interviewed in Hard Times, 1978 Section Focus Between Election Day in November 1932 and Inauguration Day in March 1933, the nation's economy hit rock bottom. National income had dropped from $81 billion to $41 billion. Over 25 percent of the nation's workers were unemployed, and many others worked only part-time. Thousands of businesses were bankrupt, thousands of banks had closed, and farmers were in revolt. 2 months in 1931 over 800 banks failed, wiping out the life savings of thousands of depositors. Want in the Land of Plenty Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Compare the condition of workers and farmers in the early 1930s. . Discuss the mood of the country as the election of 1932 approached. The Depression was uneven in its impact. While many people lost their jobs, the majority of Americans did not. Instead many found their hours reduced. The few who kept their jobs and did not have their hours or wages cut, actually were better off because prices declined. But for most Americans the mood was gloomy — and for good reason. In 1932, over 30,000 companies closed. In just As the Depression deepened, fear and despair replaced the buoyant optimism of the 1920s. \"I'm afraid, every man is afraid,\" steel industrialist Charles M. Schwab admitted. \"I don't know, we don't know, whether the values we have are going to be real next month or not. \" Loss of confidence affected all sorts ol people. Some who lost their jobs suffered such emotional effects that they became unemployable. \"My father spent two years painting his father's house,\" one man later remembered. \"He painted it twice. It gave him something to do.\" Business leaders hesitated to build new factories or to bring out new products. Frightened bankers became unwilling to lend money, even to borrowers with good character and ample collateral. On the stock market, security prices dropped dramatically. Stock in Radio Corporation of America (RCA), for example, dropped from $101 per share in 1929 to $2.50 in 1932. One of the great ironies of the Depres- sion was that starvation existed in the midst of plenty. The productive capacity of farmers did not slacken. On the contrary, farmers' problems resulted, in part, from their ability to grow more food than they were able to sell. Already in a depression throughout most of the 1920s, the collapse of the farm economy after 1929 wreaked havoc on rural Amer- ica. Despite Hoover's programs, grain prices dropped so low that farmers heated their homes by shoveling their crops into their furnaces. They protested low agri- cultural prices by declaring \"farmers' holi- 804 Unit 8 Conflict, Confidence, and Collatse: 1914-1932"},{"pageNumber":843,"pageContent":"days\" and tried to prevent food ship- ments to cities. In Iowa, farmers blockad- ed highways and dumped milk trucks in an attempt to make milk scarce and raise its price. In Oregon, they slaugh- tered sheep because mutton prices were lower than what it cost to ship the ani- mals to market. Meanwhile, in America's cities people picked through garbage looking for scraps of meat. Virginia Durr, an Alabama activist for tenant farmers\" rights, described the suffering when she said, \"Have you ever seen a child with rickets shaking, as with palsy? No proteins, no milk. And the companies pouring milk into the gutters People with nothing to eat and they killed the pigs. The Human Cost of the Depression Although business leaders promised Hoover that they would not cut wages of remaining workers, as the Depression deepened, their situation changed. In October 1931, United States Steel Corporation cut salaries and wages by 10 percent, and employers in other industries soon followed. By 1933 salaries had decreased 40 percent and hourly wages by 60 percent. The average family's income fell from $2,300 in 1929 to $1,600 in 1932. More layoffs followed the wage cuts.

In cities throughout the country bread- lines and soup kitchens appeared on sidewalks as local governments and private charities struggled to feed the poor. In some cases the lines stretched tor blocks as people waited lor their only good meal each day. As unemployment grew, Hoover's Reconstruction Finance Corporation began to loan money to state governments for relief. But these and other relief funds proved woefully inadequate. Toledo, Ohio, for example, could only spend 2 cents for each relief meal it served. New York Ciry provided only $2.39 per week to each family on relief. But in many Life of the Times Depression Needy Few Americans lost millions of dollars when the stock market crashed in 1929. How- ever, according to the estimates of Fortune Magazine, // million were unemployed at the peak of the Depression. Counting the families of the unemployed and the underemployed — those who could find only part-time work — 34 million Americans were living without enough money to buy adequate food or to pay rent and mortgages. Many lost their homes or became sick. And many people, between the ages of 14 and 22, left home to ease their family's burden and look for work. The tragedies of the depres- sion became so commonplace that children played games with names like \"Eviction\" and \"Relief.\" But even play was a luxury tor some children who, foraging for food, had to fight grown men and women for the garbage in ciry dumps. Other people survived by eating weeds or dog bis- cuits that they stole from the local pound. The severe need of people during the Depression resulted in an increase in health problems. Poor or inadequate nutrition made Americans vulnerable to disease, and the incidence of r\\'phoid, dysentery, tuberculosis, and heart and stomach disorders increased. The problems ot families became acute when they could not pay their rent, and they were evicted from their homes. Homeless people often devised ingenious makeshift shelters in which to live. Some built shacks from packing boxes, and others camped in sewer pipes. other cities, after private charity was exhausted, there was nothing. I'hrougbout the nation, families who could not pay their rent or make their mortgage payments were evicted from their homes. Some moved in with relatives if they could. The less fortunate ended up in makeshift communities dubbed \"Hoovervilles\" on the outskirts of cities. One woman later remembered Oklahoma City's Hooverville: Here were all these people living in rusted-out car bodies. I mean that was their home. There were people living in shacks made of orange crates. One family with a whole lot of kids living in a piano box. This wasn't just a little section, this was maybe ten miles wide and ten miles long. People living in what ever they could junk together People who were even less fortunate slept in doorways or on park benches. Desper- ate men grubbed in garbage cans to feed their families. Nearly every street corner had its apple seller. So many apples were available because of a surplus of the fruit in the Pacific Northwest. To reduce the surplus, the International Apple Shippers Association set up a system for unem- ployed people to sell the apples. A person could get a credit for $1.75 for a crate of lOO-to-120 apples, then turn around and sell the apples for 5 cents each, making a small profit. However, as more and more people tried to make money this way, apple vendors reacted by raising the price to $2.25 a crate. Unless a person sold more than half a crate, he or she made no profit.

The Bonus Army In May 1932, some 1,500 unemployed army veterans marched on Washington, D.C., to demand early payment ot the bonus Congress had promised to pay them in 1945. Within sight of the White House, some set up a Hooverville in an area across the Potomac River known as Anacostia Flats. Others occupied abandoned buildings in the area. As they daily demonstrated in front ol the White House and the Capitol, their nimibers increased to more than 20,000. The government tried to keep the protesters peaceKil.

She wanted to be a photog- rapher — even though she had never used a camera. After taking a photography course, Lange journeyed from New York to San Francisco, where she ran a por- trait business for 10 years. Then the Depression struck. Lange became a documentary photographer, her com- passion showing clearly in her photos. By the mid- 1930s, she was docu- menting the life of California's migrant laborers, work that earned her a position with the Farm Security Adtninistration (FSA). Her FSA pho- tos revealed poverty's brutal effects on rural Americans.

C. to demand that Congress vote early bonuses for World War I veterans. What was Hoover's response to these demands? Many Americans blamed Hoover for the use of brutal and excessive force against the veterans. He seemed more than ever an inflexible leader. Fear of Revolution During this time of bewilderment and despair, fear of revolution started to spread. Lloyds of London, a British insurance company, began to write policies for riot insurance in the United States. Looking for scapegoats, Americans blamed the Depression on the very people they had admired and willingly followed a few years earlier — industrialists and bankers. Public outrage increased when a Senate investigation charged that some of the nation's wealthiest were trying to get away without paying taxes on their huge incomes. Others were accused of using unscrupulous business practices to increase their wealth in the midst of such widespread poverty and suffering. The unrest in society offered hope to both Socialists and Communists, who preached that the Depression marked the end of capitalism, which would soon be replaced by a system that distributed goods more fairly. Both groups proposed that government control the means of pro- duction and distribution. Both promised that a planned economy would result in greater abundance for all. \"Folks are restless,\" observed Mississippi governor Theodore Bilbo, \"communism is gaining a foothold In fact, I'm getting a little pink myself\" But such radical alternatives were weak- ened because Socialists and Communists bitterly opposed each other, and destroyed each others credibility. The Socialists pro- posed to gain their power by persuasion and the ballot box. The Communist party, however, held that capitalism could not be overthrown without violent revolution — what Earl Browder, the general secretary of the party, called the \"omelet theory.\" Just as it was impossible to make an omelet without breaking eggs, Browder explained, it was impossible to make a revolution without breaking heads. Fears of a revolution in the United States proved to be unfounded, however. Although many Americans were sufi^ering, angry, and wanted a change, protest move- ments tended to be splintered.

Most Americans clung to their democratic traditions and expressed their anger at the ballot box. The Election of 1932 As the presidential election of- 1932 approached, the Democrats sensed victory for the first time since 1916. The Demo- cratic national convention rejected AJ Smith's bid for renomination and instead chose New York governor Franklin D. Roosevelt as their candidate. In 1 928, while Smith was losing the presidential election, Roosevelt had won New York's race for gov- ernor and in the process proved himsell to be a remarkable vote-getter. In 1930 he had been reelected by a huge majority. The Democratic platform ol 1932 — the briefest in U.S. political history — urged the repeal ot Prohibition and made general proposals for reform and recovery The Democrats' most effective asset, how- ever, was Roosevelt himself Setting the tone for what became a whirlwind cam- paign, he flew by plane to the Democratic convention to become the first candidate to accept a presidential nomination in person. In his acceptance address, he pledged \"a new deal for the American people.\" In later speeches, however, he was vague and described the \"New Deal\" in broad terms only. But it remained clear that Roosevelt intended to take action that would help \"the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid. \" The Republicans, meanwhile, gloomily renominated Hoover, who suffered the problem of having to defend his policies in the midst of a terrible Depression. He maintained that hard times were the result of economic collapse abroad — for which his administration could not be held responsible — and that without his relief measures the disaster might have been Examining Photographs The American people looked upon the election of 1932 with optimism.

Linking Across Time \"Insider\" Public Anger In 1990 public anger ran high against unscrupu- lous speculators, much as it had in the 1930s. During the 1980s, Wall Street moguls had manipulated stocks to make huge for- tunes. In 1986 Ivan Boesky, first of these \"raiders,\" was fined $100 million and sen- tenced to three years in prison. In 1990 Michael Milken, convicted of similar crimes, received a ten-year sentence, a S600,000 fine, and 5400 hours of public service.

But Hoover flatly rejected Roo- sevelt's position that government had \"a positive duty to see that no citizen shall starve.\" \"You cannot,\" warned Hoover, \"extend the mastery of government over the daily life of a people without some- where making it master of people's souls and thoughts.\" On Election Day, the Republican victories of the 1920s were completely reversed as Roosevelt carried 42 of the 48 states. This landslide revealed not only a widespread willingness to blame the Republicans for the Depression but also a desire to use government as an agency for human welfare. Yet even at the bot- tom of the worst depression in history, few Americans favored the overthrow of capitalism, either by violent or peaceful means. The election restdts revealed that the Socialists polled 900,000 votes and the Communists only 100,000. This meant that their combined share was a little more than 2 percent ot the total vote. In the time between Roosevelt's elec- tion in November and his inauguration in March, the Twentieth Amendment was added to the Constitution, changing the date of the presidential inauguration from March 4 to January 20. Had this amendment gone into effect sooner, it would have been better for the country. But for four months, the nation was vir- ttially leaderless, as it had been in the months before Lincoln took office in 1861. Even though Hoover had been repudiated, the new President — Franklin Delano Roosevelt — was without power to act.

Given such a situation, even the most stable banks were bound to stop payments eventually because there was not enough gold in circulation to cover all deposits.

Hoover's leadership phi- losophy, which emphasized self-government, individu- al freedom, and equalir)' of opportunity, was chal- lenged by the crisis. The many effects of the Depres- sion were self-generating and created a chain reaction of negative consequences. Hoover's actions to end the Depression were ineffec- tive. His inability to stop passage of the Hawley- Smoot Tariff Act hurt American businesses instead of helping them. American farmers continued to suffer from plunging prices for their products. Hoover con- tinued to oppose direct federal relief, but he did give aid to banks and businesses in hopes that it would ease unemployment. In foreign policy, Hoover navigated a course to maintain world peace and avoid conflict. He abandoned military intervention in Latin America and pushed unsuccessfully for worldwide disarmament. The practicality of America's isolationism was chal- lenged by the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Despite Hoover's hopes for an economic lift, the Depression worsened.

Mach Inpothesis must be tested .igainst the information gathered. Hypotheses that are sup- ported by evidence can be accepted as explanations of the problem. Example The steps in the following example will help you hypothesize: • Read these statements. The Communists made mtieh of the fact that there was no unemployment in Russia. What the defenders of Russian Communism did not tell, however, was the terrible price in human suffering. In 1931, for instance, several million farmers in the Ukraine were alloived to starve to death because they refused to give up their land arul livestock to the government. • Ask yourself what the statement is actually saying. To do this, put the statement in your own words. For example: While Communism appeared to be doing ivell because many people had jobs, the fact was that many more people were actually suffering because of it. • Determine what you might logically assume from these facts. For example, two hypotheses might be: The price people paid for communism in Russia dur- ing the '30s was giving up their belongings. People might have been employed but they did not have jobs of their oivn choosing because the govern- tnent controlled everything. • Test each hypothesis to cietermine whether or not it is correct or true. Often, this can be done by asking yourself questions that relate to your hypothesis and then researching the answers. • Finally, based on your research, determine which hypothesis, if any, provides an explanation for or supports the statements in step 1. Practice Using the steps above and what you have read in the chapter, test the following h\\-pothescs and determine if they can be supported. l.Due to the publics tear about (Catholics having power in the White House, Herbert Hoover won the election in 1928. 2.

But with- in a short time, Wilson and the nation were caught up in World War I — one ol the bloodiest struggles in history. The war changed nearly everything — politics, the economy, and moral standards. Americans went from isolationism to worldwide involvement and from an economic boom to the depths of depression. Chapter 25 World War I Wilson, an idealist who believed in friendship and fair play, sought to change the direction of American foreign policy. He wanted the United States to stop using military force and economic pressure. However, he ended up imitating his Republican predecessors by sending Amer- ican troops to shore up Caribbean govern- ments he supported. And when Wilson rejected the new Mexican government because its leader had the previous presi- dent murdered, Latin Americans resented his \"moral imperialism\" as much as Roo- sevelt's \"Big Stick.\" When war ertipted in Europe in 1914 after years of European nationalism and imperialism, the United States declared neutrality. But eventually British and French propaganda and American busi- ness interests persuaded Americans to side with the allies. Furthermore, the German use of unrestricted submarine warfare endangered American lives and cargo and strained to the breaking point Wilson's efforts to keep the United States neutral. Reelected by a narrow margin in 1916, Wilson continued to press for peace. But warring countries were cool to his argu- ments for \"peace without victory.\" An apparent conspiracy between Mexico and Germany against the United States and the sinking of lour American merchant ships ended American neutrality. Congress declared war on Germany in April 1917. Unprepared tor war, Americans mobi- lized with incredible speed. The produc- tion of armaments became a priority, and government agencies such as the War Industries Board reorganized the economy to supply them. The draft was reinstated and a Committee on Public Information produced propaganda to influence public opinion to support the war. The govern- ment raised vast amounts of money for the war effort through taxes and the sell- ing oi bonds. Meanwhile, intolerance toward German Americans and all things German became rampant. American troops — and new forms of weaponry — tipped the balance ot the war in favor of the allies, and an armistice was signed in November 1918. Wilson pushed hard tor his Fourteen Points — a plan for preserving the hard-won peace. But the allies rejected most of Wilson's peace plan, and the Senate turned down the Treaty of Versailles because ot disagreements over the League of Nations. Afterwards, the United States experienced economic and social unrest, punctuated by strikes and race riots. Chapter 26 The Decade of Normalcy By the 1920s, Americans wanted to get on with their lives, forget about public affairs, and stay out ot wars. Warren G. Harding understood this when he promised \"normalcy,\" a return to the val- ues and practices of the past. But the United States was now too enmeshed in world affairs to return to isolationism. The government sought to improve rela- tions with Japan and Latin America and negotiated a series of important treaties with nations worldwide. Americans also won major diplomatic victories by leading disarmament talks and by promoting the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact — an attempt to outlaw international war that many !14 Unit 8 Conflict, Confidence, and Collapse: 1914-1932"},{"pageNumber":853,"pageContent":"nations eventually signed. President Harding, his successor Calvin Coolidge, and the RepubHcan party believed in \"less government in business and more business in government.\" So the government eased its restrictions on busi- ness and looked after business interests. These policies seemed to work because many urban Americans experienced un- paralleled prosperit)' during the 1920s. For the first time, the average person began to buy shares in businesses and to \"invest in the fixture. \" The growth of new industries such as home appliances and automobile-making fueled the economic boom. The growing prosperity was a key factor in the decline of labor unions' numbers and strength. The automobile affected more than the economy; it seemed to change the Ameri- can way of life. It helped shift homes, shops, and factories from the inner cities to the suburbs. Some people claimed that the automobile even contributed to the relaxation of moral standards. Other major social changes and cultural achievements took place during the 1920s. Prohibition brought on a crime wave. The success of radio and radio advertising increased the demand for con- sumer goods. The first \"talkie \" stimulated Americans' taste for the styles and morals shown in the movies. Along with their newly won suffrage, American women demanded economic opportunity. And in the art of the \"Harlem Rennaissance,\" African Americans reflected a new spirit of pride and protest. After World War I, however, feelings against immigrants fueled by a postwar hysteria \"Red scare,\" led Congress to seri- ously restrict all immigration into the United States. Chapter 27 The Depression Begins Herbert Hoover slid into the presitlency in 1928 full of optimism. In foreign poli- cy, Hoover made peace efforts a priority and practiced a \"good neighbor\" policy with Latin American republics. An advo- cate of disarmament, he proposed an international moratorium that suspended all war-debt payments to the United States. In domestic policy, he assured Americans that as long as business thrived, the country would prosper. But prosperity did not last. Farmers were already experiencing a depression. Government relief to farmers proved ineffective. At the same time, the stock market was booming. Stock prices rose, and people began speculating. Often investors paid only a small percentage of the total cost of the stock and bor- rowed the rest. Then a panic of selling started, requiring investors to repay the money they had borrowed. Many, how- ever, could not. On Black Tuesday, Octo- ber 29, 1929, the stock market crashed, losing much of its value. This touched off a business and ecomonic decline from which the country did not recover for more than a decade. The Great Depres- sion had begun, caused not only by stock- market speculation but also by the effects of World War I, the depressed condition of agriculture, overproduction or under- consumption, and unwise government policies. Soon the Depression had spread worldwide. By the end of the 1920s, thousands of Americans were jobless, and farmers lost the land they bought during the boom time of World War 1. The government searched for remedies. Hoover thought the Hawley-Smoot tariff would stimulate consumption of domestic goods. Instead the higher tariff caused foreign markets to curtail their American imports, hurting business even further. Hoover offered to help banks and businesses but opposed direct federal relief to the unemployed because he feared that government hand- outs would destroy Americans' drive to work. As a result, unemployed people blamed the President for their continuing financial troubles. The American economy had hit rock bottom by the 19.32 presidential election. Signs of instability and rebellion appeared evervwhere. Angrv and restless, Americans expressed their eagerness for change in leadership in the voting booth. Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt won the presidency by a wide margin. Synthesizing Unit Themes Relating Ideas 1. How did American foreign policy change under Presidents Wil- son, Harding, and Hoover? Identifying Trends 2.

People everywhere lost their jobs and hofnes. And in the nations Dust Bowl, sharecroppers had to leave the lands that their families had worked for generations. In The Grapes of Wrath, John Steinbeck chronicles the hardships of the Joads, an Oklahoma farm family whose plight resembles that of the downtrodden everywhere. As you read the excerpt from Steinbeck's novel, look for statements that reveal the beliefs, concerns, and attitudes of tenant farmers during the 1930s. John Steinbeck from The Grapes of Wrath he owners of the land came onto the land, or more often a spokesman for the owners came. They came in closed cars, and they felt the dry earth with their fingers, and sometimes they drove big earth augers into the ground for soil tests. The tenants, from their sun-beaten door- yards, watched uneasily when the closed cars drove along the fields. And at last the owner men drove into the dooryards and sat in their cars to talk out of the win- dows. The tenant men stood beside the cars for a while, and then squatted on their hams and found sticks with which to mark the dust. In the open doors the women stood looking out, and behind them the chil- dren — corn-headed children, with wide eyes, one barefoot on top of the other bare foot, and the toes working. The women and the children watched their men talk- ing to the owner men. They were silent. Some of the owner men were kind because they hated what they had to do, and some of them were angry because the hated to be cruel, and some of them were cold because they had long ago found that one could not be an owner unless one were cold. And all of them were caught in something larger than themselves. Some of them hated the mathematics that drove them, and some were afraid, and some worshiped the mathematics because it provided a refuge from thought and from feeling. If a bank or a finance company owned the land, the owner man said. The Bank — or the Company — needs-wants- insists-must have-as though the Bank or the Company were a monster, with thought and feeling, which had ensnared them. These last would take no responsi- bility for the banks or the companies because they were men and slaves, while the banks were machines and masters all at the same time.

The owner men sat in the cars and explained. You know the land is poor. You ve scrabbled at it long enough, God knows. The squatting tenant men nodded and wondered and drew figures in the dust, and yes, they knew, God knows. If the dust only wouldn't fly. li the top would only stay on the soil, it might not be so bad. The owner men went on leading to their point: You know the land's getting poorer. You know what cotton does to the land; robs it, sucks all the blood out of it. The squatters nodded — they knew, God knew. It they could only rotate the crops they might pump blood back into the land. Well, it's too late. And the owner men explained the workings and the thinkings of the monster that was stronger than they were. A man can hold land if he can just eat and pay taxes; he can do that. Yes, he can do that until his crops hiil one day and he has to borrow money from the bank. But — you see, a bank or a company can't do that, because those creatures don't breathe air, don't eat side-meat. They breathe profits; they eat the interest on money. 1( they don't get it, they die the way you die without air, without side- meat. It is a sad thing, but it is so. It is just so. The squatting men raised their eyes to understand. Gan't we just hang on? Maybe the next year will be a good year. God knows how much cotton next year. AntI with all the wars — God knows what price cotton will bring. Don't they make explosives out of cotton? And uniforms? Get enough wars and cotton 11 hit the ceil- ing. Next year, maybe. They looked up questioningly. We can't depend on it. The bank — the monster has to have profits all the time. It can't wait. It'll die. No, Taxes go on. When the monster stops growing, it dies. It can't stay one size. Soft fingers began to tap the sill of the car window, and hard fingers tightened on the restless drawing sticks. In the doorways of the sun-beaten ten- ant houses, women sighed and then shifted feet so that the one that had been down was now on top, and the toes working. Dogs came sniffing near the owners cars and wetted on all four tires one after another. And chickens lay in the sunny dust and fluffed their feathers to get the cleansing dust down to the skin. In the little sties the pigs grunted inquir- ingly over the muddy remnants of the slops. The squatting men looked down again. What do you want us to do? We can't take less share of the crop — we're halt starved now. The kids are hungry all the time. We got no clothes, torn an' ragged. It all the neighbors weren't the same, we'd be ashamed to go to meeting. And at last the owner men came to the point. The tenant system won't work any more. One man on a tractor can take the place of twelve or fourteen families. Pay him a wage and take all the crop.

We measured it and broke it up. We were born on it, and we got killed on it. Men made it, but they can't control it. The tenants cried, Grampa killed In- dians, Pa killed snakes for the land. May- be we can kill banks — they're worse than Indians and snakes. Maybe we got to fight to keep our land, like Pa and Grampa did. And now the owner men grew angry. You'll have to go. But it's ours, the tenant men cried. We— No. The bank, the monster owns it. You'll have to go. We'll get our guns, like Grampa when the Indians came. What then?

The monster isn't men, but it can make men do what it wants. But it we go, where'll we go? Howl! we go? We got no money. We're sorry, said the owner men. The bank, the fifry-thousand-acre owner can't be responsible. You're on land that isn't yours. Once over the line maybe you can pick cotton in the tall. Maybe you can go on relief. Why don't you go on west to California? There's work there, and it never gets cold. WTiy, you can reach out anywhere and pick an orange. Why, there's always some kind of crop to work in. Why don't you go there? And the owner men started their cars and rolled away. The tenant men squatted down on their hams again to mark the dust with a stick, to figure, to wonder. Their sunburned faces were dark, and their sun-whipped eyes were light. The women moved cau- tiously out of the doorways toward their men, and the children crept behind the women, cautiously, ready to run. The big- ger boys squatted beside their tathers, because that made them men. After a time the women asked, What did he want? And the men looked up tor a second, and the smolder ot pain was in their eyes. We got to get oft. A tractor and a superin- tendent. Like tactories. WTiere'll we go? the women asked. We don't know. We don't know. And the women went quickly, quietly back into the houses and herded the chil- dren ahead of them. They knew that a man so hurt and so perplexed may turn in anger, even on people he loves. They left the men alone to figure and to wonder in the dtist. After a time perhaps the tenant man looked about — at the pimip put in ten year agt), with a goose-neck hanclle and iron flowers on the spout, at the chopping block where a thousand chickens had been killed, at the hand plow lying in the shed, and the patent crib hanging in the rafters over it. The children crowded about the women in the houses. What we going to do, Ma? Wh ere we gomg to go? The women said. We don't know, yet. Go out and play. But don't go near your father. He might whale you if you go near him. And the women went on with the work, but all the time they watched the men squatting in the dust — perplexed and figuring. The tractors came over the roads and into the fields, great crawlers moving like insects, having the incredible strength of insects. They crawled over the ground, laying the track and rolling on it and picking it up. Diesel tractors, puttering while they stood idle; they thundered when they moved, and then settled down to a droning roar. Snub-nosed monsters, raising the dust and sticking their snouts into it, straight down the country, across the country, through tences, through dooryards, in and out ot gullies in straight lines. They did not run on the ground, but on their own roadbeds. They ignored hills and gulches, water courses, fences, and houses. The man sitting in the iron seat did not look like a man; gloved, goggled, rubber dust mask over nose and mouth, he was part of the monster, a robot in the seat. The thunder ot cylinders sounded through the country, became one with the air and the earth, so that earth and air muttered in sympathetic vibration. The driver could not control it — straight across the country it went, cutting through a dozen farms and straight back. A twitch in the controls could swerve it, but the driver's hands could not twitch because the monster that built the tractor, the monster that sent the tractor out, had somehow got into the driver's hands, into his brain and muscle, had goggled him and muz- zled him — goggled his mind, muzzled his speech, goggled his perception, muz- zled his protest. He could not see the land as it was, he could not smell the land as it smclled; his feet did not stamp the clods or teel the warmth and power of the earth Me loved the land no more than the bank loved the land.

At last, a new President promised action against the Depression. Congress and the Ameri- can public — some in eager anticipation and others out ot desperation — were ready to follow the President's lead. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify the traits that made Franklin Roosevelt an effective leader. • Describe how Roosevelt garnered ideas and support for his New Deal. Within his inaugural address Franklin D. Roosevelt made the same promises about the nation's recovery that Herbert Hoover and his advisers had been saying since 1929. Roosevelt promised that the nation \"will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. \" Unlike Hoover, however, the new President reflected the popular mood of the nation by blaming bankers, \"the unscrupulous moneychangers,\" for allowing starvation in the midst of plenty. The nation was in a kind of war, he said, and strong presiden- tial leadership was needed. If Congress failed to act quickly, Roosevelt promised to ask for executive authority \"as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe. \" A Master Politician Before taking office, Roosevelt dis- played little evidence of the leadership he would ofter in his 12 years in the White House. His outstanding attribute was his name, which his cousin Theodore Roo- sevelt had made well known in American politics. The only son of wealthy parents, FDR, as his friends called him, attended the best schools. At the time of his election, Roosevelt had been in politics for more than 20 years, yet his views on many issues were unknown. Nor did many Americans real- ize that he had overcome a serious physi- cal handicap. In 1921, at age 39, Roosevelt was stricken with polio. Fighting back against the crippling disease, he regained the use of his hands and arms, but he remained paralyzed from the waist down. His painful recovery toughened him and, at the same time, gave him genuine sympa- thy for the less fortunate. Playwright Robert Sherwood, a close associate, described his toughness and compassion: / tried continually to study him, to try to look beyond his charming and amusitig and warmly affectionate surface into his heavily forested interior But I never understood what was going on in there He could be a ruthless politician, but he was the champion of friends and associates who for him were political liabilities. . . and of causes which apparently competent observers assured him would be political suicide. 828 Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1 932- 1 960"},{"pageNumber":867,"pageContent":"Both friends and foes agreed that, despite his compiexit)', Roosevek was master of the art of pohtics. Few Presi- dents had such varied poUtical training — at local, state, and federal levels — in elected and appointed offices. Elected to the New York legislature in 1910, at the height of the Progressive Era, Roosevelt learned about local government. As assis- tant secretary of the Navy during World War I, he had an insider's view as the Wil- son administration organized the federal government to wage war. As governor of New York when the stock market crashed, FDR dealt with many of the same prob- lems he would face as President. Perhaps Roosevelt's greatest strength as a politician was his warm and understand- ing approach to people. Although Hoover had withdrawn to the isolation of the White House as the Depression settled in, Roosevelt reached out by radio to the American people in a series of \"fireside chats. \" These were informal talks in which the President calmly but confident- ly explained in simple terms the nation's problems and how the New Deal planned to defeat the Depression. Millions of radio listeners felt that the President was talking directly to them. After a fireside chat, Roosevelt sometimes received as many as 50,000 letters a day. Roosevelt also knew how to use the press better than his predecessor. Hoover had avoided reporters and refused to answer questions unless they were written out in advance. In contrast, FDR allowed reporters to barrage him with questions during frequent press conferences. This approach made him popular with the press — important shapers of public opin- ion — and focused public attention on Washington and his New Deal programs. \"Cione is the fortress that was the White House,\" wrote one reporter after Roo- sevelt took office. A product of the Progressive Era, FDR retained the progressives' approach to solving society's problems. As President he was a pragmatisi and an experimenter. He sometimes asked three or hiur people with conflicting opinions to do the same job.

What personal qualities did Roosevelt bring to the presidency? if it did not work tried another. Action, he felt, was better than inaction. Most Amer- icans, desperate for relief from the effects of the Depression, agreed with him. Humorist Will Rogers observed: The whole country is with him. Even if what he does is wrong, they are with hiui. Just so he does something. If he burned down the Capitol, we would cheer and say, \"Well, at least we got a fire started anyhow. \" CuAi'ii R 28 Tiii-NiwDiAi 829"},{"pageNumber":868,"pageContent":"Examining Photographs Frances Perkins, appointed secretary of labor by Roosevelt, is shown here greeting steelworkers. A long- time advocate of minimum wage and maxi- mum hour laws, child-labor restrictions, and other progressive reforms, she was one of only two cabinet members to serve through- out Roosevelt's four terms. What was unique about her appointment? Roosevelt also had trust in the ability of experts to plan for society. Even before receiving the Democratic nomination for President, he gathered a group of professors from Columbia University to advise him. This group of economists, political scien- tists, and attorneys was nicknamed the \"brain trust\" by the press. After Roosevelt became President, the brain trust stayed on to help him plan New Deal recovery pro- grams. In selecting his cabinet, FDR named people who presented a variety ol viewpoints and ideas — northerners and southerners, liberals and conservatives. He named Republican Harold Ickes as secre- tary of the interior, and for secretary of agriculture he chose Henry A. Wallace, whose father had the job under Harding. For secretary of labor Roosevelt named the first woman cabinet officer, former child labor reformer Frances Perkins. Other women held important positions in almost every New Deal agency. Like Secretary Perkins, many ol these women had been social workers. Now the President was call- ing upon them to administer the federal government's social and relief programs. Outside the brain trust, the adviser that Roosevelt relied on most was his wife, Eleanor. Because of his paralysis, FDR moved with difficulty in a wheelchair or with heavy braces on his legs. As a result, he asked Eleanor to assume a significant role in his administration. The President called her his \"eyes and ears\" outside the White House. During the first year of the New Deal, she traveled extensively to attend political rallies, tour factories, visit coal mines, and contact many peo- ple that FDR might not otherwise have met.

Although painfully shy as a young girl, Eleanor Roosevelt emerged as a vibrant public personalit)' during the 1920s when her husband, FDR, was recovering from polio. She did all she could to keep his name in the public mind. After Roosevelt's election, she spoke for people who otherwise would have been ignored — women, the underprivileged, and African Ameri- cans. Sensitive to racial injustice, she spoke up so strongly for civil rights that she won black support for the New Deal.

The Hundred Days President Roosevelt fulfilled his promise to provide \"action now.\" On Sunday, March 5, 1933, the day after his inaugu- ration, he called a special session of Congress. On Monday he used an old law still on the books to suspend the nation's banking activity. Many Americans had lost faith in banks after the crash, with- drew their money, and kept it at home. Banks needed depositors' funds to make loans that would help recovery, but, in many areas, the loss of deposits was so great that banks had to close their doors. After a week in office, the President went on the radio with his first fireside chat. He explained that only healthy banks would be allowed to reopen. He assured Americans that it would be \"safer to keep money in a reopened bank than under the mattress.\" The next day most banks began to do business again, and in a few days deposits exceeded withdrawals. As the President's calm assurances restored public confidence in the nation's financial sys- tem, the bank crisis ended. That first week was just the beginning of feverish activity. In the \"Hundred Days\" between March 9 and June 16, 1933, Congress passed 15 major bills, more than had ever been enacted in such a short time. Most were bills that the President submitted and that Congress passed with little debate.

How did Roosevelt handle the bank crisis? Linking Across Time New Deal Precedents The substance, style, and organi- zation of the New Deal followed dis- tinctly American precedents. The program had its roots in such late- 1 800s progressive legislation as rail- road regulation and antitrust acts. President Roo- sevelt's activist style was modeled after that of his cousin, Theodore Roosevelt. Much as Wil- son's administra- tion worked to fight World War I, the New Deal was mobilized to fight the Great Depres- sion. Many top New Dealers, including FDR, had been officials in the Wilson administration. Chm'ikr 28 Ti II' NiAV Di-.ai 831"},{"pageNumber":870,"pageContent":"President enjoyed such overwhelming support.

Roosevek toolc office with no clear idea of how to solve the nation's econom- ic crisis. \"There's nothing to do, \" he said, \"but meet each day's troubles as they come.\" The New Deal, therefore, was not a carefully worked out reform plan. Instead, it was a series of measures quick- ly drawn up to attack the Depression in many ways at once. Some laws were in response to special demands from specif- ic groups in society. Some were even passed against the President's wishes, but he signed them to head off something that he might like even less, or to avoid holding up other legislation. However, New Deal programs had three general purposes: recovery from the Depression, relief for its victims, and reform of the economic system. Much legislation reflected all three goals. From 1933 to early 1935, the dominant purposes were recovery and relief During the \"First New Deal,\" as this phase was called, the President and his advisers thought that a series of temporary mea- sures could get the economy moving again and then recovery would come on its own momentum. Therefore, little additional legislation followed the Hun- dred Days of the First New Deal. The administration merely implemented the laws Congress had created and waited for recovery to occur. dUb Section One Review IIIIIHIIIIIIIIIIM Summary President Roosevelt attempted to deal with the Depression on two levels.

People jokingly called them the New Deal's \"alphabet soup,\" yet the pro- grams gave the nation a sense of hope. Many were intended as stopgap measures, but their effects are still felt. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Give examples of how Roosevelt's poli- cies helped and hurt the rural poor. • Compare the effectiveness of measures aimed at farmers and city workers. Both Hoover and Roosevelt believed that prosperity would return with a little help to spark the economy. So, like Hoover, FDR sought the help of the business com- munity and spoke of an alliance ol \"busi- ness ami banking, agriculture and industry, and labor and capital.\" But he differed from Hoover in ihe amount and variety of legislation he proposed and in his willingness to call on the full powers of the federal government to solve nation- al problems. He also rejected Hoover's belief in \"rugged individualism \" and used government to help people. Financial Reform In June 1933 Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act. This law prohibited banks from investing in the stock market and created a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure depositors' savings. Although the program was opposed by the American Bankers' Associ- ation as \"unscientific, unjust, and danger- ous,\" federal insurance made people feel confident that their money would be safe in banks. Congress also responded to the demand that the government prevent stock market fraud. The Federal Securities Act of 1933 required companies that issued or market- ed stocks and bonds to provide complete and truthful information to purchasers. Congress followed this act in 1934 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate the stock market. When Roosevelt took office, he faced strong pressure to inflate the currency. A number of senators and representatives wanted to stimulate recovery by putting into circulation billions of dollars in new paper money. But Roosevelt rejected inflation and took a conservative approach in his early efforts to achieve recovery. During the campaign he had promised efficiency and economy in gov- ernment, and he was reluctant to create budget deficits. He realized, however, that to keep relief agencies from closing and millions of Americans from starving, deficit spending was necessary. In other words, the federal government's annual spending would exceed its income. Help for the Jobless From balancing the budget, the New Deal moved to pump priming — pouring government money into the economy through loans and federal spending in the hope of stimulating recovery. Roosevelt called for government to give money directly to people who would spend it.

Congress established the Ten- nessee Valley Authority (TVA), designed to promote the development of a seven- state region drained by the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers. Before the TVA, the natural resources of the Tennessee Valley had long been exploit- ed. Forests were leveled, and heavy rainfalls caused erosion and disastrous floods. Poor farmers attempted to work worn-out land, and many of the people in the Tennessee Valley were on relief Employing as many as 40,000 workers at a time, the TVA built 20 dams for flood control and improved 5 others. The TVA also moved farmers from marginal lands, reforested millions of acres, built power plants and fertilizer factories, and even started new towns. But the most notable change was the immense amount Examining Artifacts This poster by famous graphic artist Ben Shahn promotes a New Deal agency founded in 1935 to resettle poor farmers on good land and pro- vide them with equipment for a new start.

Its increased availability improved agriculture, allowing farmers to install refrigerators, milking machines, and other equipment. Cheap power also brought industry and jobs to the valley. Despite its obvious benefits, the TVA was one of Roosevelt's most controversial programs. Critics charged that it favored one small section by using government funds that could support programs nationwide. But above all, the TVA was attacked by the power companies. One goal of the TVA was to provide a basis to determine fair electricity rates all over the country. But private power companies argued that to use the TVA for this pur- pose was unfair because the government charged large parts of the cost of electrici- ty production to the cost of flood control and navigation. For the federal govern- ment to take over the production of pri- vate power, they argued was unfair and communistic. Although the power companies were powerful enough to prevent any more regional authorities like TVA, the New Deal did build other power plants. The most famous of these was the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in Washington State. Relief for Agriculture The impoverished condition of farmers in the Tennessee Valley was by no means unique in 1933. Farmers were in an angry mood everywhere. Since 1929 banks had foreclosed on the property of 10 percent of the nation's farmers. In foreclosure actions, when a borrower cannot make loan payments, the bank seizes the prop- erty that was put up as security for the loan. Bands of farmers prevented judges and sheriffs from enforcing foreclosures, and farmers threatened to stop producing food unless their debt burden and agricul- tural prices improved. The New Deal provided relief for heavily indebted farmers by placing a five-year moratorium, or freeze, on mortgage foreclosures. But New Dealers recognized that the root of the farmers' plight was low agricultural prices, and 836 Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1932-1960"},{"pageNumber":875,"pageContent":"rhat this situation was related to a problem that had plagued hirmers since the end of World War I — overproduc- tion. Roosevelt proposed an unusual approach: stop agricultural surpluses by paying farmers to not produce crops. In May 1933, Congress passed the Agricul- tural Adjustment Act (AAA), under which the government paid farmers who reduced production ot basic crops like cotton, wheat, tobacco, hogs, and corn. Funds for these payments came from a tax levied on flour mills, slaughterhouses, and other food processors. These proces- sors passed this cost on to consumers. In 1933 cotton farmers plowed under a quarter of their acreage, and hog producers killed 6 million piglets instead ot fattening them for market. In 1934 and 1935, farm- ers withdrew 10 million acres from pro- duction and received more than $1 billion in benefit payments. Surpluses were great- ly reduced by 1936, and total farm income rose by more than 50 percent. The AAA did not relieve the suffering of all farmers. Large commercial farmers, who concentrated on one crop, benefited more than smaller farmers who raised several. The crop redtiction program actually hurt some people. In the West and Southwest, Examining Photographs A homeless farm family was the subject of photographer Dorothea Lange. What farm programs did the New Deal offer? Examining Photographs Evicted share- croppers set up camp in southeast Missouri, near the Arkansas border Why did many sharecroppers and tenant farmers lose their farms? Mexican migrant workers suffered when growers raised less produce and so hired fewer pickers. Tenant farmers and share- croppers — black and white alike — were forced off the land they worked as owners took it out of production. About 1 50,000 white tenants and almost 195,000 black tenants left farming during the 1930s. To stop this trend, the New Deal created the Farm Security Administration to give loans to help tenants purchase land. But only 3,400 black farmers received any of this money. Landless farmers joined other urban and rural migrants who wandered the country in search of jobs. In 1934 and 1935 a terrible disaster struck the Great Plains and added to the number of farmers on the move. The ori- gins of the disaster arose during World War 1, when high crop prices tempicd hirmers to grow wheat and cotton on what iradilionally had been grazing lands.

As crops withered, leaving bare dirt exposed, the region's high winds lift- ed the fine topsoil to create dust storms called \"dusters.\" Large-scale mechanized farming on the plains after 1900 exposed huge areas of soil. Farmers eager to maximize yields overtilled the soil and burned wheat stub- ble to kill weeds. These poor soil-conser- vation practices and the long drought created a dust bowl on the plains through- out most of the 1930s, as millions of tons of airborne powdery topsoil buried crops and killed livestock. The dust bowl took its toll on people too. People sat helpless while their farms blew away. They sometimes lost their way and died in the thick storms while only yards from their houses. Thousands of families abandoned their land and became migrant farm workers.

Between 1934 and 1939, nearly 350,000 farm families left what came to be called the \"Dust Bowl.\" To take care of immediate distress. Congress provided the farmers in the Dust Bowl with funds for new seed and livestock. For long-term solutions, the Department of Agriculture helped farmers plant millions of trees in shelter belts to cut wind velocity and help retain mois- ture. The government also encouraged farmers to return the land to grazing. Yet there was much criticism of New Deal farm policies. Many farmers did not like being told what to raise or how much to plant. To others, decreasing food supplies when people were hungry seemed immoral. However, the New Deal provid- ed more direct assistance to farmers than to any other group, and saved thousands of farm families from poverty and despair. In addition, as Collier's magazine reported in a 1934 article: [The farmer's] morale has been strengthened not just with money but by the conviction that at last he is considered by Washington to be as important — perhaps even more important — than the capitalist and at last government is being administered in his interests. Industrial Relief In 1933 the condition of American industry was as desperate as the situation in agriculture. So in June 1933 the New Deal tried to help industry with the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), which Roosevelt hailed as probably \"the 838 Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1932-1960"},{"pageNumber":877,"pageContent":"LABOR UNION MEMBERSHIP"},{"pageNumber":878,"pageContent":"these workers were unemployed. The earn- ings of the rest had shrunk as their hourly rates or work hours were cut. The average laborer earned $375 in 1933, nearly half as much as in 1929. Women earned as little as $3 a week. Even outside the labor movement, the idea spread that the best way to restore workers' wages and pur- chasing power was to strengthen labor unions. And under Section 7a of the NIRA, every NRA code guaranteed work- ers the right to organize unions and to bargain collectively with their employers. As a result. Section 7a encouraged a revival of unionism, and between May and October 1933, American Federation ot Labor (AFL) membership jumped by about a million workers. After this initial success, however, the effort to enlist new members stalled. The AFL was not greatly interest- ed in organizing the mass-production industries such as steel and automobiles. In addition, employers generally opposed labor unions in their plants. In some cases they avoided organization while technical- ly complying with Section 7a by forming their own \"company unions,\" which lacked real power, ot course, because they were controlled by the employers. In 1934 a wave of strikes swept the nation as workers demanded the right to organize for improved wages and job secu- rit)'. Many of these strikes became violent, and most resulted in defeat for the work- ers, as police generally sided with employ- ers. Although sympathetic to organized labor, the only way the NRA could pun- ish a company was to take away its Blue Eagle symbol. Workers began to demand stronger labor laws. In November 1934, Americans showed they approved ot FDR's efforts by return- ing overwhelming Democratic majorities to Congress. But as the nation entered 1935 — the New Deal's third year and the Depression's fifth — American spirits noticeably sagged. Despite the New Deal, farm prices and industrial wages were well below 1929 levels, and workers remained unemployed and poor. To many Ameri- cans, the New Deal was taking too long and accomplishing too little. FDR and his advisers clearly saw that they must find other means to restore prosperity. Section Two Review TOM Summary To end the Depression, Franklin Roo- sevelt was willing to try anything and see what worked. He offered jobs and direct relief to victims of the Depression and tried to enlist cooperation among busi- ness, labor, and agriculture to achieve eco- nomic reform. But labor unions lacked the power to secure improvements for workers, and management would not give up control. Farm income continued to trail behind the income of the rest of the nation. By 1935, as Roosevelt's emergency measures failed to achieve full economic recovery, the need for a long-range plan became obvious. Checking for Understanding 1.

Technological advances, the rise of agricultural education, and the application of business practices to production and marketing, howev- er, changed farming dramatically. These changes led to an increase in farm production — and the begin- ning of a problem that plagues the American farmer to this day. Effi- ciency increased production, resulting in falling prices. But goods that farmers buy have not fallen in price as fast as those they sell. This disparity has been the root of much of the difficulties. The shift from local self-suffi- cient farms to specialized business farming began in the mid- 1800s. The most successful farms became large cash-crop operations that depended heavily on machinery. Specialization made the farmer dependent on weather conditions, markets, transportation, and finan- cial institutions that were stable. When times were good, farmers borrowed for machinery, increased cultivation, and hoped for good weather. Many who borrowed heavily lost their land when crop failures or low farm prices lowered their income. When their problems became widespread, farmers joined cooper- atives and turned to government for help. In farm crises before the 1930s, the federal government always left competition and the free enterprise system intact among farm businesses. The Great Depression of the 1930s, however, triggered actions that altered the lace of agriculture. Farmers, long thought of as free and indepen- dent, became largely dependent on government assistance.

These victims of the Depression were fer- tile ground for the radical ideas floating about in 1935. FDR recognized that the New Deal must be reassessed and redi- rected. Yet even after strong voter support in the 1936 presidential election, Roo- sevelt faced continued opposition to any extension ol the New Deal. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • List the special interest groups that challenged Roosevelt. • Outline the steps that Roosevelt's Sec- ond New Deal took to achieve perma- nent reform. • Identify the events that led to the end of the New Deal. For the 10 million unemployed Americans in 1935, \"Every Man a King\" was an appealing fantasy but a far cry from their reality. They received just enough relief to keep themselves and their families alive. Their miserable dole seemed hardly worth the humiliation it caused. Millions of elderly Americans faced a similar stark reality, without savings, without adequate medi- cal care, and without hope. Attacks on the New Deal The radical critics of the New Deal posed a greater threat to the Roosevelt administration than the Republican party. Every week Father Charles E. Coughlin, the \"Radio Priest\" whose broadcasts reached 40 million listeners, bitterly attacked Roosevelt. Originally a New Deal supporter, Coughlin became impa- tient with its moderate reforms. The priest accused the President of being too timid and of turning the New Deal into a \"raw deal.\" His political organization, the National Union for Social Justice, called for such socialistic measures as heavy taxes on the wealthy and a guaranteed income for everyone. An even more dangerous rival to Roo- sevelt was Huey Long, senator from Louisiana. With the backing of the rural poor, he became extremely powerful in his home state and used it as a base on which to build national popularity. With his folksy, humorous manner. Long knew how to win audiences. He proposed con- fiscating the property of the rich and giv- ing every family a home, $2,000 a year, and a free college education for their chil- dren. His tollowers organized hundreds of \"Share-Our- Wealth\" clubs. Less colorful than Father Coughlin or Senator Long but just as threatening, was Dr. Francis Townsend. A former public health official, Townsend was shocked by the plight of older Americans who were no longer able to compete for jobs. He proposed a plan that he claimed would provide relief for the elderly and at the same time stimulate economic recovery, calling for the federal government to pay all Americans over age 60 a pension of $200 per month. Recipients would be required to spend their entire pension check within 30 days. Townsend claimed that this plan not only would end the suf- fering of older Americans but the money they pumped into the economy would 842 Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1932-1960"},{"pageNumber":881,"pageContent":"Examining Photographs Father Charles Coughlln (far left) reached millions of listeners before the Catholic church made him stop his radio broadcasts.

The political groups supporting the New Deal also changed. In the election of 1932, Roosevelt had received support from many groups, including the busi- ness community. He had played down partisanship to gain the support of mod- erate and progressive Republicans. Now he devoted his energies to achieving his goals through the Democratic party alone. To strengthen it, he attempted to form a coalition, or combination, of separate groups whose members could be counted on to vote for Democrats. To the traditional source of Democratic political power — the South and northern urban political machines — Roosevelt attempted to add labor unions, farmers, and blacks. Many of the Second New Deal's programs were intended to appeal to these groups. Work Relief and Social Security The most immediate result of the New Deals shift in attitude was the Presidents demand for large-scale work relief Responding to Roosevelt's request, Congress appropriated ftinds in April 1935 for \"work relief and to increase employment by providing useful projects. \" An immense new agency, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) was set up under the direction oi Harry Hopkins to provide a chance for all people to use their skills to earn an income. In addition to work relief projects such as building roads and schools, the WPA employed writers, teachers, librarians, actors, musicians, and artists. A \"junior WPA,\" the National Youth Administration (NYA), helped high school and college students stay in school by giving them part-time work, such as typing and library catiiloguing. Existing work-relief programs were expanded. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation lent large sums to businesses and to local gov- ernments. The Civilian Conservation Corps increased the number it employed. The Public Works Administration finally rolled into high gear and provided hun- dreds of thousands of jobs. 844 Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1932-1960"},{"pageNumber":883,"pageContent":"The unemployable needed help during the Depression as much as the unemployed. Persons with no source of support and no ability to earn an income had no place to go. To remedy this prob- lem, Congress in 1935 passed the Social Security Act. Under this program, the federal government financed state unem- ployment insurance plans through payroll taxes paid by employers. Federal grants to states provided care for dependent moth- ers and children. The core of the program was retirement benefits, paid for by taxes on workers and employers, that people could collect when they stopped working at age 65. The Social Security Act had flaws. For example, the act did not protect some groups who needed it most, such as farm workers and domestic help. Since 65 per- cent of all black employees in the 1930s fell into these two categories, the act neglected blacks the most. Yet the Social Security Act was a landmark in reforming society. It set the policy that an industrial society was responsible for those who, through no fault of their own, are unable to work. Business and Labor Several pieces of legislation passed dur- ing the Second New Deal demonstrated Roosevelt's efforts to appeal to the politi- cal coalition he was forming. Early in the New Deal, taxes remained at levels set in the 1920s. Now Congress passed tax increases on the incomes of wealthy Americans, inheritance taxes on the prop- erty of deceased persons, and higher taxes on corporations. Although the law was attacked as communistic, Roosevelt was more interested, some felt, in heading off the various \"share-the-wealth\" schemes than he was in actually redistributing tiie nation's wealth. Next to the Social Security Act, the most important and lasting legislation of the Second New Deal was the National Labor Relations Act, also called the Wagner Act, passed in July 1935, after the Siipivmr Court declared the National liidustri.il Recovery Act unconstitutional. The Wag- ner Act set up a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which could liokl secret elections in factories to find out whether workers wanted to unionize. The board could arbitrate grievances, reinstate work- ers fired for supporting unions, and order employers to stop antiunion activities. The Wagner Act stimulated a burst of labor union activity. But the AFL was ill- equipped in both philosophy and structure to organize workers in mass-production industries such as radio, steel, automobiles, and textiles. The AFL was a federation of craft unions — unions where all members had the same skill. But in mass-production industries, workers from many crafts or skills often worked in a single plant. To have several unions undermined unity. So some labor leaders proposed that factory workers be organized in an industrial union — a union to which all workers in a single industry belong, regardless of the job they perform. When the AFL rejected this approach, these leaders abandoned it to form the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). \"If I went to work in a factory, the first thing I'd do would be to JOIN A UNION,\" read the slogan signed by Pres- ident Roosevelt on union recruiting posters, as the CIO moved into industries that the AFL had long neglected. By 1936 the CIO had signed up enough steel workers to threaten a nationwide strike. Instead, in March 1937 the nation's largest steel producer, the United States Steel Corporation, recognized the union as bargaining agent for its workers, estab- lished a 40-hour work week, and increased wages. Just beginning to recover from the Depression, the company was not willing to risk a major strike. The smaller producers did not follow this lead, however, and bloody strikes broke out around the country. But by 1941, the steelworkers' union had contracts with the entire industry. Meanwhile, the CIO moved iiuo the automobile industry, where management discouraged worker unity by exploiting racial and religious tensions among blacks, southern whites, and Catholic eth- nic groups. Although hourly wages in the industry were high, seasonal layoffs reduced the average worker's annual earnings to less than $1,000. Workers also Linking Across Time American Labor Laws The gradual reversal of govern- ment attitudes toward labor unions was com- pleted in 1935. The Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1 890 had declared illegal any \"combi- nation in restraint of trade. \" Courts consistently used this provision to break strikes and outlaw other activ- ities of labor unions. The Clayton Act of 19 14 aided labor by exempt- ing unions from the anti-trust laws. Section 7a of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1 933 legally recog- nized the right of workers to orga- nize unions, and the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 established rules to enforce this \"iiarantee.

The CIO did not want to challenge the auto industry until the struggle with the steel companies had ended. But autoworkers were impatient for change and they took matters into their own hands, using a strike strategy called the \"sitdown strike.\" Rather than walking off their jobs, strikers remained in the facto- ry. The company could not hire new workers to continue production nor could it remove the strikers by force without risking violence to the factory. One striker later remembered: Life of the Times Sitdown Strikes Passage of the Wag>ier Act boosted workers' morale and inspired imaginative techniques to bring rehictant man- agers to the negotiating table. Chief among their strategies was the sitdown strike. On December 30, 1936, the UAW members of General Motors' Fisher Body plant in Flint, Michigan, sat down at their work stations. Meanwhile, workers at other General Motors plants followed suit or struck in more tradi- tional ways: picketing factories, seizing plants by force, and jeering at scabs — workers sent to take their places. General Motors strike veter- an Bob Stinson described how work- ers managed to get food and keep in touch with their families during the sitdown: \"The soup kitchen was outside the plant. The women handled all the cooking, outside of one chef who came from New York. He had anywhere from 1 to 20 women washing dishes and peeling potatoes in the strike kitchen. Most- ly stews, pretty good meals. They were put in containers and hoisted up through the window We had a ladies\" auxiliary. They'd visit the homes of the guys that was in the plant. They would find out if there was any short- age of coal or food. Then they'd maneuver around amongst themselves until they found some place to get a ton of coal.\" Since the strikers were not going to starve, GM decided to freeze them out. It turned off the heat in the plant. But after six weeks, when the strikers still refused to give in. General Motors signed a contract with the UAW. We were nervous. We didn't know we could do it. Those machines had been kept going as long as we could remember. When we finally pulled the switch and there was some quiet, I finally remembered something. . . . that I was a human being, that I could stop those machines The sitdown strike was not originated by the autoworkers, nor was it unique to them. The radical International Workers of the World first used the technique against General Electric in 1906. But in the late 1 930s factory workers, taxi drivers, maids, secretaries, and sales clerks sat down at their jobs to protest their pay and working conditions. Union success in the auto, steel, and other industries swelled the ranks of orga- nized labor during the Second New Deal. The CIO grew especially rapidly because it was willing to organize women workers, whom the AFL had ignored. From less than 3 million in 1933, union membership more than tripled by 1939. Organized labor showed its appreciation tor the Wag- ner Act and other New Deal programs by giving political support to the Democrats. The 1936 Election The Democrats renominated Roosevelt for President in 1936, and they enthusias- tically endorsed the New Deal. The busi- ness communit)', however, contributed to his 1936 campaign only about one-fifth as much as it contributed in 1932, and many newspapers turned against FDR. The Republican nominee, Kansas governor Alfred M. Landon, denounced Roosevelt for endangering the \"American system of free enterprise.\" He labeled social security as \"unjust, unworkable, stupidly drafted, and wastefully financed,\" and attacked many other New Deal programs. Four years of New Deal programs, however, had forged a new political coali- tion for the Democrats.

Black voters abandoned an allegiance to the Republican party that dated back to Reconstruction to support the parry ot Roosevelt. FDR's New Deal had not ofifered special programs for African Americans, but it had not tried to exclude them either. Black workers, who often were the first fired when hard times hit, owed much to New Deal relief programs, and they showed their gratitude at the polls. On Election Day, Roosevelt won in a landslide, and Democrats elected huge majorities to the House and Senate. The New Deal and the Supreme Court Before he could continue the New Deal in his second term, Roosevelt believed he had to eliminate opposition on the Supreme Court. During 1935 and 1936 the Court struck down New Deal pro- grams, including the NIRA and AAA. Never before had the Court declared so much legislation unconstitutional. Roo- sevelt and his supporters believed that \"9 old men\" on the Court, 7 of whom had been appointed by Republican Presidents, were interfering with the New Deal's attempts at recovery. Laws that helped millions of people, passed by large majori- ties in Congress, were being rejected by the Court, often by margins of 5 to 4. Roosevelt considered his landslide reelection to be a mandate to curb the Supreme Court. In February 1937 the President presented legislation allowing him to appoint an additional justice to the Supreme Court for each justice over 70 years of age. Although the Court's size would increase from 9 to 15, Roosevelt argued that it needed \"an infusion of younger blood. \" Ihc \"court-packing\" bill caused a furor even in the President's own party. Many Americans were alarmed by the threat it posed to the system of checks and balances. Fnough Democrats joined the Republicans in Clongress to deleai Roosevelt's proposal.

Later New Deal Measures By 1937 the economy had recovered nearly to 1929 levels, although widespread unemployment still remained. Roosevelt's financial advisers urged a cut- back in spending and a balanced federal budget. So Federal Reserve banks tight- ened credit, and the WPA cut the number of its employees in half The economy quickly slumped into a recession, a mild downturn in the business cycle, that crit- ics called a \"Roosevelt Depression.\" Huge crop surpluses collapsed agricultural prices, and industrial production dropped by a one-third, almost to 1932 levels. The President blamed the slump on businesses that, he claimed, failed to reinvest profits in production and on monopolies that kept prices artificially high. To meet the economic crisis, the President again expanded the work-relief programs of the WPA and stepped up military spending. People went back to work and prices rose. But the recession proved that hard times were not \\'et over.

A Fair Labor Standards Act abol- ished child labor and placed a ceiling on hours and a floor under wages, at least for workers in businesses classified as \"inter- state commerce.\" A new Farm Security Administration promoted the well-being of impoverished farmers. A new AAA attempted to cope with surpluses by paying farmers not only to produce less but also to improve the soil and to control erosion. In addition, a food-stamp plan helped to dis- tribute farm surplus among those on relief These were some of the last New Deal programs. In the fall of 1937, when Roo- sevelt called a special session of Congress not one of his proposals was enacted. Both in 1937 and in 1938 Congress rejected the President's request to reorganize the execu- tive branch. These defeats were largely the result of a coalition of Republicans and conservative southern Democrats who increasingly opposed the President in Congress. Roosevelt tried to weaken this coalition by supporting liberal Democrats against incumbents in the 1938 primary. Montana senator James Murray spoke lor many Democrats in Congress: There was a time when I would have bled and died for him, but in view of the way he has been acting I dont want to have any more dealings with him. . . Roosevelt's attempted \"purge\" ol his own party ended in defeat. In most cases, the conservative Democrats won. In the November election the Republicans staged a modest comeback, picking up seats in both houses of Congress. The coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats was growing powerful and could block further extension of the New Deal. Roosevelt accepted the judgment ol the voters in the 1938 election. In January 1939 he announced that he would pro- pose no further New Deal programs. Instead, he turned his attention to the growing threat of war in Europe. ^gT^ Section Three Review flflllllllllllllllll Summary Faced with mounting criticism, Roo- sevelt abandoned business support, moved away from conservative policies, and searched for long-term economic solu- tions. Social security provided benefits tor the poor and the elderly, and the National Labor Relations Act increased labor unions' power. Political support from farm and labor groups gave Roosevelt a solid base within the Democratic parry.

From relief for the poor to wages and working conditions, along with regulation of the nation's economy and financial markets, programs affected society at every level. The New Deal involved the lederal government in American Hfe to an extent unprecedented in the nation's history. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify changes that the New Deal caused in American society. • Evaluate the effects of the New Deal on life today. Sociologists Robert and Helen Lynd in l')2'^ published a study of val- ues, behaviors, and everyday lite in the 1920s in a t)'pical American city that they called \"Middletown.\" (It really was Muiicie, Indiana.) In 193'> ihcv returned lo \"MidilleU)wn \" (or a follow-up study and found that the Depression and the New Deal had profoundly affected the families living in that community. The New Deal and Society During the Depression, both births and divorces decreased as people could not afford either event. Older people moved in with working relatives. Many families rented rooms to boarders or moved to smaller and less expensive homes. House- wives took in laundry and sewing to help support their families. Sales of prepared food declined, and many people canned foods at home. Competition among adults for jobs resulted in stronger child labor laws, and the number of working children declined during the 1930s. Consequently, the number of high school and college stu- dents rose. The number of elementary school students, however, declined because of the lower birth rate. In Middletown, the Lynds noted that the community traditionally had expect- ed a husband to support his family. But when a man lost his job and could not find another, family roles often were reversed, \"with the woman taking a job for whatever money she could earn and the man caring for the household and children. \" There were, however, strong social pressures against working women. They were accused of taking jobs from men, and businesses often refused to hire married women. Most women who worked outside the home, with the exception of farm and domestic workers, benefited from die New Deal. Women's wages rose and work- ing conditions improved. The greatest direct assistance to women came from the Women's Division of the WI'A. It employed between 300,000 and 400,000 women, some in traditionally female white-collar jobs such as teacher, nurse, and librarian. But most worked on can- ning and sewing projects. Their pay was low, but it often made the difference between food and famine, as in this share- cropper's family: CiiAi'ii R 28 Ti II Ni w 1)1 Ai 849"},{"pageNumber":888,"pageContent":"Last year my wife. . .got herself a job with the government and she's making 21 dollars a month, working at the sewing room.

The New Deal and Minorities As the poorest of the poor, blacks often fell through the cracks of broad legislation such as the AAA and the Social Securit}' Act. For example, although the AAA gave money to rural landowners, in the South 80 percent of all black farmers owned no land. In addition, Roosevelt offered no civil rights program and did little to challenge the segregation that continued to exist throughout the nation, and he tol- erated job discrimination. Even some government agencies refused to hire African Americans. Those that did, such as the CCC and armed forces, segregated blacks and whites. In addition, African Americans received lower wages than white workers and were not assigned to certain jobs. Nevertheless, Roosevelt appointed more African Americans to government posts than any President before him. Although most black officials filled secondary posts, they influenced the President as an unoffi- cial \"black cabinet.\" Heading the black cabinet was Mary McLeod Bethune, director of the Negro Affairs Division of the National Youth Administration. A personal friend of Eleanor Roosevelt, she often expressed the black cabinet's con- cerns to the First Lady, who then carried them to FDR. Examining Photographs Most blacks did not directly benefit from the New Deal. Although) Afncan Americans in the North contributed heavily to Roosevelt's election victories, he did not protest the poll taxes in the South that prevented poor blacks and whites from voting. What explanations are there for his stand? 850 Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1932-1960"},{"pageNumber":889,"pageContent":"One concern of blacks in and out of government during the Depression was an increase in lynching and other acts ot mob violence against African Americans. One piece of civil rights legislation that Roo- sevelt did support was a 1934 federal antilynching bill that held local sheriffs accountable for the frequent lynchings of blacks in the South. But he never made the bill a legislative priority, so it never reached the House floor and it finally died in the Senate in 1938. One reason New Deal programs for African Americans were so limited was the opposition of powerful congressional committee heads who were from the South. So Roosevelt accepted NRA codes, for example, that permitted a lower mini- mum wage in the South than in the rest of the nation. FDR felt that it he pushed these southern legislators too strongly, he would lose their support. In general, the federal government responded more favorably to white ethnic groups.

It also indicated the Democrats' awareness of the political power that ethnic groups could exercise it they were organized. Immigrants and their children made up 40 percent ot the white population at that time. They tended to vote in groups and could swing elections, especially in large urban areas. Americans of Irish, Italian, and Polish descent became major partners in the New Deal coalition. Because of the Depression, however, immigration declined in the 1930s. In fact, more peo- ple emigrated from the United States dur- ing the 1930s than immigrated to it.

But there was also much escapism in popular culture, as people turned to entertainment when things became grim. The best-selling book of the decade was Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind.

As \"talkies\" — films with sound — became common during the 1930s, about 85 million people escaped the realities of the Depression for a few hours each week at the movie theater. There they watched movies that were often about the lives of happy and successful people. In many popular movies, the poor girl married the millionaire's son or a wealthy woman fell in love with a struggling young man. Continued improvements in sound tech- nology ushered in the era of musicals, and audiences delighted at the dance routines of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Car- toon characters, such as Mickey Mouse, made audiences laugh, and as color-film technology spread, full-length animated features like Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Divarfs, provided more fan- tasy and escape. At home families could listen to net- work radio programs broadcast coast-to- coast. \"Amos \"n Andy\" became the first popular national radio show. Although white actors portrayed black characters and employed racial stereotypes, their weekly stories about surviving hard times attracted huge audiences. Daytime radio offered \"soap operas,\" where characters suffered through daily crises. At night comedy, adventure, and musical variety programs dominated the airwaves. And the performances of Arturo Toscanini conducting the NBC Symphony of the Air brought classical music for the first time to millions of radio listeners. Just as books, movies, and the radio pro- vided Americans with an emotional outlet from the realities of the Depression, the automobile made them teel that they could physically escape their problems. Ameri- cans' love affair with cars, which began during the prosperity of the 1920s, contin- ued throughout the poverty-stricken 1930s. The number of automobiles increased from 26 million in 1933 to 32 million by 1940. During the depths of the Depression, almost half the families in the United States owned a car, even though many could not afford to buy gasoline. Yet despite the expense, many Ameri- cans continued to drive their cars during 852 Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1 932- 1 960"},{"pageNumber":891,"pageContent":"the 1930s. By late in the decade, thanks to government work projects, a maze of paved highways crisscrossed the nation. Large numbers of people took off down these two-lane roads, some searching for employment and others pioneering what became an American institution — the family vacation by car. In the arts, as in so many other areas of society, the New Deal played a role. The WPA helped unemployed actors, artists, writers, and musicians. The Federal The- atre Project sponsored performances of Shakespeare as well as children's plays. Some 6,500 writers put together state and regional guidebooks and recorded life stories of former slaves, immigrants, and American Indians. The Federal Arts Project had artists paint murals and sculp- tors create statues, many of which still can be viewed today. Photographers like Dorothea Lange and artists like Ben Shahn documented people's lives during the Depression. Arts projects were among the most controversial New Deal pro- grams, however. Critics called them socialistic. In 1939 Congress cut off funds for the theater project, and the other arts programs were discontinued as employ- ment rose during World War II. To many people who lived through it, the New Deal seemed to have changed American society. Yet it was not the revo- lutionary assault on capitalism that some of its critics charged. The New Deal changed the lives of farmers through crop subsidies and rural electrification. It changed the lives of industrial workers by strengthening labor unions and expanding collective bargaining. It provided social security and welfare programs for the aged, the unemployed, and dependent children. In so doing, it turned a govern- ment that previously had responded more to business groups into a government open to labor, farmers, and other interests. Yet the New Deal did not adopt nation- al planning of the economy, as some of Roosevelt's advisers had expected. Rather than government owning industry, the New Deal emphasized federal regulation of private enterprise. Rather than over- uirning capitalism, New Dealers believed that they had helped to save it. WXSKS III mmM^a^M^ Section Four Review fllllllllTTB Summary To many who lived through it, the New Deal seemed to bring radical change. But as time has passed, Americans can see that basic values remained intact in the 1930s: people were still committed to the work ethic, free enterprise, and the capitalist system. The New Deal had made govern- ment more responsive to the needs of ordinary citizens. Roosevelt's programs also fed Americans' cultural appetites by supporting arts and theater projects.

He attempted to restore purchasing power with programs financed by deficit spending, offering relief and work to the poor and jobless. He attempted to bring more order and plan- ning to the economy through increasing government intervention in banking, business, labor, and agricul- ture. Lasting gains were made in conservation, condi- tions of labor, and assistance programs such as Social Security. In implementing reform, Roosevelt worked within the capitalist system to restore hope and digni- ty, and to improve the quality of life for Americans.

As a member of Congress devoted to economic reform, write an argument proposing and supporting deficit spending to stimulate the economy and to finance expanded government assistance programs. Think about what reasons an economist might have to favor such programs. Also think carefully about the reasons why some of your constituents would favor such policies and why others would oppose them. * Cooperative Learning Working in a group of three, assume roles of gov- ernment officials during Roosevelt's term. One mem- ber should assume the role of a Roosevelt supporter in Congress and present an argument to Congress for enlarging the Supreme Court. The second member should assume the role of an anti-Roosevelt senator and address Congress, refuting the need to enlarge the court. The third member will listen to both arguments and decide which is the more effective. All group members should then be prepared to argue either posi- tion before the class if called upon by the teacher. * Mastering Skills Determining the Strength of an Argument Perhaps you have listened to others as they try to persuade you to their point of view. Whether or not they are successful often depends on how strong an argument they are able to present. You also have at times tried to convince others to come around to your way of thinking. The most suc- cessful way lo do this is to present an argument, or series of reasons, that support your views. Again, your success may depend on how strong an argument vou make. Asking questions such as the following will help you determine the strength of an argument: • Has the main poini oi llunie of the .ugumenl been clearly slated.' • Do each of the reasons given in the argument truly relate to the issue under discussion? • Are the reasons that form the basis of the argument presented in a logical order? • Is any evidence given that supports the information offered in the argument? Example The following statement presents an argu- ment against the Social Security Act of 1935. Read the statement entirely before attempting to determine the strength of the argument it makes. The Social Security Act of 1935 is seriously flaived. For example, it excludes some of the people who most need it, namely farm workers and domestic help. It also endorses racism, as 65 percent of all black workers fall into these categories. The act also does not do nearly enough to alleviate the problems faced by the unemployable people it cov- ers. It is, as Father Coughlin and Huey Long have stat- ed, merely \"crumbs from the rich man's table. \"As such, this act meant to provide security for its citizens is in fact a disgrace to the nation. A more respectable and wide-reaching act is needed. Read the statement again, this time seeking an answer to each of the four guideline questions noted earlier. (The main point of the argument is clearly pre- sented in the statement's opening sentence. The reasons that follow all relate to the issue. They are presented in a logical order Each sentence between the first and last sen- tences presents the reasons for the point or factual infor- mation that supports it, or both.) The answer to all four guideline questions is \"yes. \" The statement presents a strong argument. Practice Keeping in mind that in a strong argument the main point or theme must be clearly stated, the reasons given must relate to the issue and be presented in a logical order, and evidence must be provided as support, evaluate the following argument that supports the Social Security Act of 193S. Ihe Social Security Act of 1935 has created one of the most vital social programs of the New Deal. The act establishes that government will protect old, young, and disabled Americans who are unable to provide for themselves. Nearly one oj every four American workers remains unemployed.

Roosevelt Speech in Chicago, lUinois, October 1937 Section Focus Like President Woodrow Wilson, for whom he had worked during World War I, Franklin Roosevelt was greatly interest- ed in world affairs. But when he entered the White House in 1933, recovery from the Depression kept most of his energy and attention focused on the United States. As Europe again moved toward war, however, the President experienced growing concern with events overseas. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss how the Depression influenced American foreign policy. • Explain the reasons for Japan's aggres- sion in Asia. Sharing his cousin Theodore's view- point, Franklin Roosevelt believed that the United States should play a leadership role in the world. For most of his first two terms, however, the President focused on domestic affairs. Events in Europe and Asia seemed distant when compared to the crisis of the Depression. In addition, the President recognized that Americans, pressed by hard times at home, cared little about the world at large. So although Roosevelt believed that German expansion posed a threat to the United States, he was cau- tious in his efforts to alert the nation to this danger. Only when dealing with affairs in the Western Hemisphere did Roosevelt act with his typical bold politi- cal style. New Deal Foreign Policy At his first inaugural in 1933, President Roosevelt pledged that the United States would be a \"good neighbor\" in the family of nations. The President and Secretary of State Cordell Hull worked to improve relations with the United States' southern neighbors. Later that year, at a Pan-Amer- ican Conference at Montevideo, Uruguay, the United States agreed to a resolution that \"no state has the right to intervene in the internal affairs of another.\" Roosevelt demonstrated his commitment to the Good Neighbor Policy by recalling Amer- ican troops from Haiti and Nicaragua, where they had been protecting American property since the 1920s. When Cuba erupted in revolution in 1933, Roosevelt used diplomacy, not troops, to help restore order. When Mexico seized Ameri- can-owned oil companies in 1938, Roo- sevelt resisted demands for military action and sought a peacefiil settlement. During Roosevelt's first years in office, the United States seemed less inclined to cooperate with Europe. The New Deal adopted a policy of economic isolation, and its recovery programs were attempts to solve agricultural and industrial pro- duction problems without considering the rest of the world. In 1933 delegates from more than 60 nations met in London to bring about cooperation in confronting world depression. Roosevelt wrecked the conference by rejecting proposals to peg the value of the dollar to any other currency. He feared that such a move would hurt his efforts to raise American farm prices. Only when the United States had achieved some recovery from the Depres- sion was the President willing to consider economic cooperation with other nations. Secretary of State Hull believed world 858 Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1932-1960"},{"pageNumber":897,"pageContent":"prosperity and goodwill could be gained by reducing tariffs. At Hull's urging, Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act oi 1934, allowing the State Department to make treaties with other countries to mutually lower import duties. Within 6 years, the United States had reached such agreements with more than a dozen nations, covering more than 60 percent of American trade. Another change in foreign policy took place when the United States recognized the government of the Soviet Union. Since the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, the United States had refused to recognize the communist government. After their revolu- tion, the Soviets tried to encourage com- munism throughout the world. By 1933, however, the USSR was beset by serious economic problems at home and seemed less of a threat. Much more threatening was the rising power of Japan, Russia's rival in Asia. The President hoped that a strong Soviet Union could slow Japanese expan- sion. In addition, Roosevelt saw the Sovi- ets\" need for food and industrial equipment as a market for American farmers and man- ufacturers. \"The United States would prob- ably recognize the Devil,\" Will Rogers joked, \"if it could sell him pitchforks.\" Recognition of the Soviet Union helped improve relations but did little to increase trade or to check Japanese militarism. Aggression and Appeasement Between 1872 and 1925, Japan's pop- ulation nearly doubled, causing severe problems for that small island nation.

The U.S. had twice been drawn into European wars, once in 1812 and again in 1917. The scenarios had been eerily similar in both cases: warring nations had forcibly interfered with neutral U.S. ships. Fearing that history would repeat itself. Congress passed the Neutrality Acts, forbidding any American action that could lead the United States into war. provide more jobs, Japan rapidly industri- alized. But to sustain this growth Japan needed larger markets for its products and more raw materials lor its factories. To meet these needs and to ease overcrowd- ing in the home islands, Japan pursued a policy of expansion in the Pacific. During World War I, Japan supported the Allies, but used the war to violate the Open Door policy by increasing its influ- ence in China. After the war Japan was bitter toward the West. The Washington Conference of 1921 cost Japan most ot its gains in China and limited Japans naval power. When the United States joined other western nations in 1924 in banning immigrants from Japan, its leaders looked to military solutions for their nations problems. In September 1931, Japanese troops invaded and occupied mineral-rich Manchuria in northeastern China. When the League of Nations demanded that Manchuria be returned to China, Japan ignored the order. On March 5, 1933, the day after Roo- sevelt took office, the German parliament voted Adolt Hitler, the National Socialist (Nazi) leader, the power he needed to begin a program of conquest in central and eastern Europe. In Italy, dictator Benito Mussolini made similar plans to control the Mediterranean and to expand Italy's empire in Africa. Mussolini and Hitler followed a new political doctrine known as fascism (FASH IHZ uhm), a form of government in which a dictator and supporters coop- erate to seek more power for their nation at the expense of human rights. Each ruler established a totalitarian state — a nation that totally controls the life of its people. Like the Communists in Russia, the Fascists in Italy and the Nazis in Ger- many set up all-powerful official parties. Both whipped up support with huge patriotic rallies, parades, music, and appeals to national pride and racial hatred, and both used force to silence all opposition.

Mussolini accused Italy's Communists of causing strikes and social unrest. The Nazis blamed Germany's eco- nomic chaos on its Jewish population. They expelled Jews from the government and the universities, boycotted Jewish- owned stores, and destroyed synagogues. Both Hitler and Mussolini hinted that another war might be necessary to right the wrongs they felt had been done to their countries by the Treaty of Versailles. The glorification of war by Italy, Ger- many, and Japan was not idle talk. In 1935 Mussolini attacked and took con- trol of Ethiopia in Africa. In 1937 Japanese armies poured into the rest of China. In March 1938 Hitler marched into Austria. In 1936 General Francisco Franco rebelled against the republican government of Spain, and German and Italian tanks, bombers, and troops helped Franco win a bitter civil war that lasted until 1939. The response of Great Britain and France was appeasement, a policy of giv- ing aggressor nations what they wanted to avoid war. Like the Americans, the British and French were disillusioned by World War I and wanted peace. Appease- ment reached its peak at the Munich Conference of September 1938 when British and French leaders allowed Hitler to annex part of Czechoslovakia in return for his promise to make no further terri- torial demands. British prime minister Neville Chamberlain returned from Ger- many to tell a jittery world that the Munich Pact meant \"peace for our time. \" Winston Churchill, however, who soon would replace (Chamberlain as prime minister, observed that \"Britain and France had to choose between war and dishonor.

Isolationists opposed any American involvement in European affairs and wanted the United States to act indepen- dently in the world. On the other side of the debate, internationalists believed that America's own security was linked to the success of Europe's struggle against Hitler. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss Germany's conquest of Europe. • List the steps by which Roosevelt in- creased support to the Allies. The most outspoken isolationists in Congress were progressive Republicans from the Midwest and West, who received sup- port from many newspapers, most notably those in the William Randolph Hearst chain. On the radio, Roosevelt's New Deal critic, Father Charles Cough- lin, also lined up with the isolationists. An America First Committee sponsored ral- lies around the country against the war. A frequent speaker was the popular pilot Charles Lindbergh who warned that \"the only way our American life and ideals can be preserved is by staying out of this war.\" The internationalists were strongest in the Democratic party and generally represent- ed states in the South and Northeast. They looked to President Roosevelt for leadership. Europe at War Again As Churchill had predicted, the Munich agreement failed to appease Hitler, who in March 1939 swallowed up the rest of Czechoslovakia and demanded territory in Poland. Britain and France pledged to defend Poland from Hitler, and they asked the Soviet Union to join in an alliance to contain Germany. But in August 1939, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin signed a nonaggression pact with Ger- many. By removing the threat of war on rwo fronts, the pact cleared the way lor Hitler to invade Poland. But Hitler still doubted that Britain and France would resist him. Before dawn on September 1, 1939, German forces crossed into Poland in an attack so last and brutal that a new word was coined — blitzkrieg, meaning \"light- ning war.\" Fhis time Britain and France decided to fight, and on September 3 they declared war on Germanv.

The largest retreat in military history was accomplished by the British navy and private boats ranging from yachts to tug- boats, all protected by the Royal Air Force. Huge amounts of equipment were left behind, but Britain's army was saved from total destruction. What effect did the fall of France have on American foreign policy? firsr time they met resistance from British and French troops. In May 1940, German forces defeated the Alhed army and drove it to the sea at the French town of Dunkirk on the Belgian border. Cut off from retreat by land, the army was saved when 300,000 British and French troops were evacuated across the English Chan- nel in a heroic nine-day rescue effort aided by 600 private boats. In June 1940, Italy suddenly invaded France and declared war on Great Britain. Declaring that \"the hand that held the dag- ger has struck it into the back of its neigh- bor,\" Roosevelt announced that, although the United States would not enter the war, it would extend as much aid as possible to the democracies. But on June 22 France surrendered, and Britain faced Hitler alone. As the German air torce bombed British airfields, factories, and cities to prepare the way for German armies to cross the English Channel, Britain found leadership in its new prime minister, Winston Churchill. Offering only \"blood, toil, tears, and sweat,\" he pledged: . . . we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the landing grounds. We shall fiight on the fiields and in the streets. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and liberation of the Old. America Abandons Neutrality Prime Minister Churchill asked the United States for a loan of 50 destroyers to protect British shipping from German sub- marines. Recognizing that the isolationists in Congress would block approval of the loan, Roosevelt decided to act on his own. In September 1940, by executive order, he 864 Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1932-1960"},{"pageNumber":903,"pageContent":"transferred 50 old World War I destroyers to Britain in return for the use of bases in Newfoundland and the Caribbean. Meanwhile, for months London suf- fered bombing day and night by hundreds of German planes. The fighter pilots of the Royal Air Force, however, kept the Germans from gaining control of the skies over Britain and forced Hitler to abandon his invasion plans. \"Never in the field of human conflict,\" said Churchill, \"was so much owed by so many to so fow.\" The fall of France and the threat to Britain shook many Americans out of their belief that events outside the West- ern Hemisphere were none ol their busi- ness. The possibility that Hitler and Mussolini might add the British and French fleets to their own made the Atlantic Ocean suddenly seem narrower, and Congress began to heed Roosevelt's warnings. It appropriated billions ot dol- lars for defense and passed a Selective Ser- vice Act in September 1940, the first peacetime draft in American history, adding 800,000 men to the armed forces. In the presidential election of 1940, the debate between internationalists and isola- tionists was carried on in both major parties. The Republicans nominated a newcomer to politics — Wendell Willkie, a Wall Street lawyer and utility company executive, best known for his criticism of the New Deal. For Democrats the ques- tion was whether Roosevelt would seek a third term, breaking the precedent set by George Washington. With the United States lacing war in Europe and Asia, Roosevelt folt his experience was needed. He kept silent until the Democratic con- vention, then announced that he would accept the nomination. At first, both candidates agreed on for- eign-policy issues. Willkie attacked Roo- sevelt for breaking the two-term tradition, and he blamed the New Deal for failing to end unemployment. But when he began to slip in the polls, Willkie warned that Roosevelt's reelection would mean war.

With the world in crisis, most American voters did not want to gamble on a change in leadership. Roosevelt's reelection encouraged him to find new ways to aid Britain. The British government was running out of money to pay for weapons, so the President pro- posed that the United States abandon its \"cash and carry\" policy. But not wanting to revive the old war-debts controversy, Roosevelt suggested that the United States merely lend goods to Britain, which the British could return or replace after the war. \"Lend-lease\" again stirred debate, but public opinion was shifting in Roosevelt's favor. A poll in January 1 94 1 showed that 60 percent of Americans believed that it was more important to help Britain than to keep out of war. In March 1941, large majorities in both houses of Congress passed lend-lease, authorizing the Presi- dent to send American supplies and weapons to other nations on any terms he thought would protect the sectiriry of the United States. It was one thing to enact lend-lease, however, and another to get supplies across the Atlantic in time to help. When Hitler attacked Yugoslavia and Greece in the spring ot 1941, the Nazis overran those countries before lend-lease aid could reach them. When Hitler's bombers failed to knock out Britain, he ordered his sub- marine fleet to starve that nation into sub- mission. In trying to make sure that lend-lease supplies reached their destina- tion, the United States was drawn step- by-step into the critical battle of the Atlantic. As German U-boats sank British and American supply ships almost daily, Roosevelt ordered the United States Navy to protect merchant shipping. By the fall of 1941, American and German warships were exchanging fire, and in October a German U-boat sank an American destroyer, killing more than 90 of its crew. Congress responded by revising the Neu- trality Acts to allow merchant ships to be armed. While German-American tensions were escalating in the Atlantic, in June 1941 Hitler, wanting Russia's vast wheat and oil supplies, suddenly attacked the Soviet Union. As German armies quickly advanced into the USSR, Stalin signed an alliance with Great Britain, and the Unit- ed States offered lend-lease aid.

By the end of November 1 94 1 , very few Americans were preaching isolation. Most agreed with Roosevelt that the United States must be an \"arsenal of democracy\" to supply Great Britain and the Soviet Union against Hitler. In fact, about 15,000 Americans were already at war, most in British or Canadian uniforms. Aggression in the Pacific While the American public's attention was fixed on the Atlantic and Europe, events were taking place in the Pacific and Asia that would eventually plunge the United States into war. Already in China, Japan took advantage of the war in Europe to move against European colonies in Southeast Asia. This vast region contained the rice, rubber, tin, zinc, and oil needed for Japan's expanding industries. With France defeated, Britain on its knees, and the Soviets retreating in tront of German armies, the United States was the only remaining obstacle to Japanese ambitions in the Pacific. In September 1940, Japan allied with the Axis powers, Germany and Italy, and the United States responded by cutting off exports of scrap metal to Japan. As Japan continued its aggression in Asia, Roosevelt extended the embargo to include other products with possible military uses.

By late November, as the United States continued to insist that Japan honor the Open Door, Japanese leaders decided that it the dispute did not quickly come to a favorable conclusion, they would attack. As negotiations deadlocked, Roosevelt realized that war was inevitable. The only uncertainty was where Japan's attack would come. On December 6, the Presi- dent appealed for peace directly to Japan's Emperor Hirohito.

The American people were now united in their determination to win the war. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss the course of the war in Europe and in Asia. • Describe the Atlantic Charter and the agreements the Allies reached at the Yalta Conference. On DcccnibLi- 6, 1941, Ameri- can ollicials intercepted .i coded message from Japan to its embassy in Washington, D.C;., indicating that Japan was about to break relations wiili ihe United States. American authorities sent warnings to military commanders throughout the Pacific. But by the time the message reached Pearl Harbor, Japanese bombers were already attacking the American fleet there. Shortly after noon on Sunday, December 7, President Roosevelt received an urgent telephone call from the secre- tary of the navy. The secretary had just received a wire from Hawaii: \"Air Raid on Pearl Harbor. This is no Drill.\" In 2 hours, Japanese planes sank many vessels, including 5 battleships and 3 destroyers, and heavily damaged many others. The attack also destroyed about 250 airplanes and about 4,500 people were killed or wounded. Only the fleet's aircraft carriers, out of the harbor on maneuvers, escaped the devastation. The World at War However determined the American peo- ple were to defeat the Axis powers — Ger- many, Italy, and Japan — the immediate outlook was bleak. The destruction of the American fleet removed Japan's only obstacle in the Pacific. For six months the Japanese won victory after victory, captur- ing American bases at Guam and Wake Island, conquering Britain's colonies at Hong Kong and Singapore, and occupy- ing the independent kingdom of Thai- land. In April 1942, American forces that had been holding out on the peninsula ol Bataan in the Philippines finally surren- dered. Meanwhile, the Japanese con- quered Burma and the East Indies. The situation was equally bad in the West. Axis forces occupied nearly all of Europe, and Britain was besieged. In North Africa German General Frwin Rommel, \"the Desert Fox, \" led an Italian- German force toward the Suez Canal, pushing the British back to the borders of Egypt. By summer 1942 the (iermans had pushed deep into the Soviet Union, cap- turing the rich farmland of the Ukraine and threatening the cities of Stalingrad, Leningrad, and Moscow.

Success or failure of the war in Europe depended on whether the Soviet Union could hold out until the United States and Britain could launch an offen- sive on the western front. Even before Japan attacked Pearl Har- bor, American strategists had decided that in the event of war, the United States would concentrate on defeating Hitler before dealing with Japan. Not only did the United States have closer ties with the countries occupied by Germany, but Ger- many seemed a greater threat to the West- ern Hemisphere, where Nazi sympathies were strong in several Latin American nations. Chtirchill agreed with this plan, observing that: . . . [T]he defeat of Germany. . . will leave Japan exposed to an overwhelming force, whereas the defeat of Japan would by no means bring the World War to an end. Meanwhile, German troops survived the Russian winter of 1941 to 1942 and launched a second attack on the Soviets. In the spring they moved toward the oil fields near the Caspian Sea, and by mid- summer they were more than halfway to their goal. Stalin pleaded with Roosevelt and Churchill for an invasion of western Europe that would take some pressure off the Soviet Union. But Churchill told him that such a second front in Europe was a year away. Although thousands ol British tanks and American trucks and hundreds of thousands of tons of American supplies were reaching the USSR, Soviet troops were left to face the Germans alone. In September 1942, the Red Army made a desperate and heroic stand at Stalingrad. For four months, Soviet and German troops battled house-to-house for control of the city. Although the German invasion was halted, Stalingrad was reduced to rubble and the Soviets suffered more casualties de- fending it than the United States did in the entire war. Stalin never forgave Roosevelt and Churchill for allowing this to happen. 870 Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1932-1960"},{"pageNumber":909,"pageContent":"In November the Soviet army counter- attacked.

Eisenhower, a million Allied forces were in France within a month after D-Day. In August American and British troops broke out of Normandy and struck rapidly eastward, entering Paris on August 25, 1944. In September they crossed the western border of Germany. At the same time, the Soviets closed in from the east. In January 1944, the Red Army freed Leningrad from an 890-day German siege, during which 800,000 resi- dents died. By spring Soviet troops had freed the Ukraine, and in July they entered Poland. In August Romania and Bulgaria surrendered, opening the Balkans to the Soviets. In December they entered Hungary-. By the end of 1944, most of eastern Europe was in Soviet hands. The Nazis fought to the end. In June 1944, they launched an air attack on Bri- tain with jet-propelled and rocket-propelled bomber aircraft. In December 1944, Hider ordered a counterattack in Belgium.

Meanwhile, the Soviets pushed from the east, taking Berlin in April 1945. In April, Hitler committed suicide in his underground shelter in Berlin, and on May 7, 1945, German leaders agreed to an unconditional surrender. Franklin Roo- sevelt, who led the nation through the Depression and the war, however, did not witness this event. Only days before Hitler's suicide, the President died of a massive cerebral hemorrhage. As they entered Germany, Allied armies discovered evidence of one of the most terrible acts of the war — the Nazi holo- caust, or deliberate extermination of 6 million European Jews. As early as 1942, the United States government received reports that Hitler had ordered the mur- der of all Jews in German-occupied terri- tories. At first officials would not believe that such stories were true. In 1944 Roo- sevelt responded to criticism within his own administration that the United States was passively accepting the murder of Jews. He created a War Refugee Board, but for 6 out ot 10 Jews in Europe, action came too late. Not until Allied troops reached the Nazi death camps — at Auschwitz, Dachau, Buchenwald, and elsewhere — and found survivors and the gas chambers in which so many had died was the horrible truth fully realized. War in the Pacific Although Allied strategy was to first concentrate on defeating Hitler, the Japanese were not able to consolidate their gains in the Pacific before the tide ol war began to turn. In May 1942, American warships defeated a Japanese fleet in the Battle of the Coral Sea. A month later a Japanese flotilla was turned back with heavy losses in the three-day Battle of Midway. Despite these defeats, Japan still held many heavily fortified Pacific islands. So the Allies adopted a military strategy called \"island hopping\" — to cut Japanese supply lines by capturing key islands and to use them as bases to attack other [apaii- ese strongholds, especially the Philippines and eventually Japan itself. In August 1942, Americans took the first step in the long and bloody road to Tokyo when marines landed on Guadal- canal in the Solomon Islands. The strug- gle for Guadalcanal was fought on the ground, at sea, and in the air, lasting si.\\ months. Not until 1943 did Japan's resis- tance there come to an end. In attacking the United States, Japan had failed to realize the industrial power of America and its ability to mobilize that power rapidly.

In one raid alone in March 1945, more than 83,000 lokyo civilians were incinerat- ed by American napalm bombs. But despite such heavy casualties, Japan's militaiy lead- ers rejected calls h)r unconditional surren- der. American commanders worried that an invasion of japan would meet heavy resis- tance and might cost a million lives.

Since early in the war, American scientists had secretly been developing an atomic bomb, first tested in New Mexico in July 1945, it gave Harry Irimian, who became Presitleiu after Roosevelt's death, .inoilier choice, and Soviet leader Stalin inld Irunuin to \"make good use of it.\" After the Japanese government rejected Truman's final warning to surrender or risk \"utter destruction, \" on August 6 an atomic bomb destroyed 60 percent of Hiroshima, a major Japanese industrial city.

The two attacks took about 150,000 Japanese Hves. When reports of the death and devasta- tion reached Tokyo, the stunned emperor, teUing his people that \"the unendurable must be endured,\" asked for peace. The final surrender took place on September 2, 1945, on the battleship Missouri anchored in Tokyo Bay. Wartime Diplomacy The first planning for peace took place in August 1941 when Roosevelt and Churchill met on a ship off the coast of Newfoundland. At that meeting they issued the Atlantic Charter, a statement of principles on which depended \"hopes for a better future for the world.\" Much like Wilson's Fourteen Points, the Atlantic Charter looked forward to a world where people would have the right to choose their form of government and where resources would be shared to provide a better life for all. Also like the Fourteen Points, it suggested a new world organiza- tion to keep the peace. After Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt turned his attention to forming an alliance among the nations fighting against Hitler. On January 1, 1942, representatives of the 26 countries at war with the Axis met in Washington, D.C., and signed the Decla- ration of the United Nations. Members of this new group agreed to support the principles of the Atlantic Charter. They promised full economic and military sup- port in the war, and they agreed not to make a separate peace. In holding the great alliance together, Roosevelt and Churchill kept constantly in touch. Although they often did not agree on strategy, neither wavered in admiration for the other. Working closely with the other major TUlies was more dif- ficult. Japanese troops had pushed China's government deep into the interior, and Chinese leaders were unhappy that the war in Europe was the top priority. Gen- eral Charles de Gaulle (di GOHL), leader of the French government in exile, disap- proved of the United States' recognizing a government in south France that was friendly to the Nazis. But Roosevelt and Churchill did not make De Gaulle a full partner in their meetings because they were not sure whether he really represent- ed France. Cooperation with the Soviet Union proved the most difficult problem. Stalin had almost never been outside of his country and was suspicious of capitalist nations. Even so, the alliance between the United States and Great Britain and Sovi- et Union lasted until the end of the war. Germany could not be defeated without Soviet aid, and the Soviets depended on supplies from Britain and the United States. Planning for War and Peace Cooperation in plans for war and peace was worked out in a series of international conferences. At Casablanca, Morocco, in January 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to demand \"unconditional surren- der\" from the Axis powers, assuring the Soviet Union that its western allies would not sign a separate peace treat)' with Ger- many. At Quebec, Canada, in August 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill agreed on peace terms for Italy, while their military advis- ers developed plans for the invasion of western Europe. At Cairo, Eg\\'pt, in November 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill met Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek (jyahng ky SHEHK) and agreed that Japan should be stripped of its Pacific empire and Korea given independence. From Cairo Roosevelt and Churchill flew to Teheran, capital of Iran, to meet with Stalin. There they promised that the D- Day invasion of France would be launched the next year. In return Stalin agreed to begin a new offensive against Germany at the same time from the east. The three leaders also discussed the possi- bility of the Soviet Union declaring war on Japan. In February 1945, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met for the last time at Yalta, in the Soviet Union. They agreed publicly that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, along with France, should 876 Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1932-1960"},{"pageNumber":915,"pageContent":"Examining Photographs Looking tired and drawn.

Even more important, the United States want- ed Soviet support in the war against Japan. Before the atomic bomb was suc- cessfully tested, American military experts expected that defeating Japan would take another 18 months. Ameri- can diplomats also suspected that Stalin's agreement to tree elections in Eastern Europe was not sincere. But with Soviet troops already in those nations, Roo- sevelt felt that this loose agreement was the best he could do. He had faith in the future world organization and in his personal relationship with Stalin to solve any problems that might arise. When he reported to Congress on his Yalta trip, Roosevelt looked tired and pale. He sat down to deliver his address rather than standing. Two months later, on April 12, 1945, the President died suddenly at Warm Springs, Georgia. The nation he led tor more than 12 years was shocked, and newspapers that printed daily lists of soldiers and sailors who had died in action added the name: \"Roosevelt, Franklin D., Commander in Chief\" Two weeks after Roosevelt's death, rep- resentatives of 50 nations met at San Francisco to make plans for a new world organization. But the talks at San Francis- co were made more difficult by rising sus- picions among the Allies. The Soviet Union was keeping a firm hand on Poland and seemed to be breaking its Yalta promises. Still, the meeting at San Fran- cisco produced a charter for a United Nations (UN). The preamble of the UN Charter pledged all the countries signing it to \"faith in fundamental human rights,\" to \"justice and respect\" for the terms of peace treaties, and to the goal of living together. In July 1945, when the Senate ratified the Charter by a vote of 89 to 2, the Unit- ed States became the first nation to join the UN. The first use of the atomic bomb 9 days later reinforced the belief of many Americans that war must not happen again. Trusting the new United Nations, in which they expected to take a full part, and not yet aware of its weaknesses, Americans hoped to return forever to the path of peace. Section Three Review Summary After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the United States entered a war that con- sumed it from 1941 to 1945. As Japan conquered Southeast Asia and strategic islands in the South Pacific, the Allies first concentrated on victory in Europe. While the Soviets made a heroic stand at Stalingrad, British and American forces were victorious in North Africa and Italy. When Allied forces invaded France and pushed east, the Soviets pushed west, and Germany was defeated. In the Pacific, an island-hopping campaign and two atomic bombs defeated Japan. Allied leaders met during the war to plan for peace, but dis- trust emerged between the Soviets and the other Allies. Checking for Understanding 1.

By 1944 more than 1 1 million men and women were in uniform. As the number ol industrial workers also rose to new heights, the war accomplished what the New Deal had never been able to — it ended the Depres- sion's unemployment. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss efforts to mobilize the econo- my for war production. • Explain the war's impact on women, blacks, and Japanese Americans. Americans were amazed at the speed with which industry turned to making war materi- als. When in May 1940 Presi- dent Roosevelt talked ot producing 50,000 airplanes a year, some thought he was asking the impossible. Yet, by 1944 the niunber ol planes produced annuallv had risen to about 100, 000. Mass produc- tion was so effective in the ship iiulustry The Production Battle As in World War I, tederal agencies took on the direction ol private compa- nies doing war work. After a Senate investigation revealed corruption and mismanagement among companies in- volved in war production, in January 1942 Roosevelt gave a War Production Board strong regulatory power. Its head, Donald Nelson, could seize vital materi- als, order industrial plants to convert to war production, and prohibit manufac- ture of products he considered unessen- tial to the war effort. Within weeks of Pearl Harbor, produc- tion of bicycles, beer cans, refrigerators, toothpaste tubes and more than 300 other items was cut back or banned. Automobile manuhtcturers were ordered to convert production to tanks and other war supplies. Entire new industries were created. Synthetic rubber, for example, became important when Japan's conquest of Southeast Asia cut oil America's supply ol natural rubber. By the end of 1942, nearly ^^ percent ot American produc- tion went to war materials, and by 1944 nearly 50 percent. Production of all goods nearly doubled, and America's pro- duction ot war materials matched the total output of Cermany. Italy, and Japan combined. In May 1941, Roo.sevelt set up the (Iffice of Scientific Research and Devel- opment to mobilize science and technolo- gy for the war effort. Among the many inventions that came trom this agency were: DD 1 which controlled insects and made jungle fighting more tolerable; the bazooka, a weapon that enabled an infantry soldier to destroy a tank; and radar, which determined the pt>sition .uid speed ot airplanes and ships.

In 1942 the government extended the income tax for the first time to include middle- and lower- income people. To make collection easi- er, the government in 1943 began to require that employers deduct taxes from workers' paychecks before they received them. The war increased employment, and workers' earnings rose as war production brought longer work weeks and overtime. As people had more money to spend, and as the shift to war materials made con- sumer goods scarce, prices rose. To com- bat inflation, in 1942 Congress created the Office of Price Administration, which set price ceilings on consumer products Life of the Times The Home Front Social trends during the war years reflected women's involvement on the home front. A Califi)rnia sportswear house launched a line called \"Victory Volun- teers, \" which featured tailored overalls — called \"Victoralls\" — specially designed for women. A school of aviation urged women to support the war effort through a career or wartime job. Fan magazines reflected the changing role of women dur- ing the war. Magazines such as Modern Scree?! and Photoplay- Movie-Mirror used the lives ot the stars to encourage patriotism, dis- courage extrav- agance, and sell products designed with the working woman in mind. In the 1920s and 1930s, fan maga- zines had emphasized movie stars' extrava- gant lifesr)'les, often depicting the stars as carefree, excessive consumers who felt little responsibilit)' for the rest of society. Now Photoplay told readers that actress Ann Sheri- dan used her grocery money to buy Victor)' Bonds. An advertisement in the same maga- zine portrayed the use of lipstick as a woman's patriotic duty. Lipstick, the adver- tisement said, raised wartime morale, enhanced self-confidence, and proved that women could do \"mens \" work without sacri- ficinET their femininit\\'. and began to ration goods that were in short supply. By war's end 20 items — including sugar, meat, butter, coffee, gaso- line, fuel oil, and shoes — required government-issued tationing coupons to be presented at the time of purchase. Despite attempts to hold down prices, however, the cost of living rose 29 percent during the war, leading to demands for higher wages. To help prevent strikes, a National War Labor Board was established to settle labor disputes by mediation. Although this task was made easier by the no-strike pledges that both the AFL and the CIO made after Pearl Harbor, there were many small wildcat strikes — work stoppages without union approval — and a short national strike by 500,000 coal miners. Even though most labor unions kept their no-strike pledge, a 1943 act outlawed strikes against war industries. The War and Social Change The need for defense workers altered traditional patterns of society. As millions of men joined the armed services, more women than ever before entered the labor force. \"If you can drive a car, you can run a machine,\" industries advertised. The government, newspapers, radio, and newsreels encouraged women to take fac- tory jobs as a patriotic duty, and 5 million American women entered the work force during the war. \"Rosie the Riveter,\" who first appeared in overalls in a Lockheed Aircraft poster, became a national symbol of the vital contribution women were making to the war effort. More than evet before, women filled jobs that were not traditional for females. They worked on production lines, in steel mills, on the docks, and in other jobs that required heavy manual labor. Outside war industties, women also took over such traditionally male jobs as driv- ing buses and trucks and working as train conductors, lumberjacks, and bar- bers. Most of these new workers were married and had children. Yet women still encountered resistance from male 880 Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1932-1960"},{"pageNumber":919,"pageContent":"WOMEN IN THE LABOR FORCE, 1900-1950 ^ 17 (/J I ^^ E .g 13 o Q.

The number of women whio worked jumped from 27 percent to 37 percent. Although women's wages rose, they still averaged 60 percent less than men's wages. What happened to women's jobs when the war ended? in government ofifices and in companies that had war contracts. But while it opposed discrimination, the commission did not reject segregation. Even the miH- tary remained segregated, and although hundreds of thousands of African Ameri- cans served in uniform, in every capacity from cooks to fighter pilots, most served in all-black units. The most significant racial discrimina- tion of the war involved the removal of Japanese Americans trom the West Coast. About 90 percent of all Japanese Ameri- cans, outside Hawaii, lived in California and the Pacific Northwest. Because ot immigration restrictions after 1924, two- thirds had been born in the United States and were citizens by birth. Yet govern- ment officials were suspicious of their loyalty. When war broke out, residents of California, Oregon, and Washington feared that with the Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor severely damaged, they were vul- nerable to invasion at any time. Califor- nians, in particular, were concerned that their neighbors of Japanese descent might engage in sabotage. Army General John DeWitt investigated and reported that: The Japanese race is an enemy race and u'h'ile many second and third generation Japanese born on United States soil have become \"Americanized, \" the racial strains are undiluted. ...It, therefore, follows that along the vital Pacific Coast over 1 12,000 potential enemies of Japanese extraction are at large today. Based on such reports, beginning in February 1942, the government moved 1 10,000 Japanese Americans to detention centers surrounded by barbed wire and patrolled by soldiers and confined them there for the duration of the war. The order to evacuate Japanese Ameri- cans from the West Coast came quickly. Detainees had as little as 48 hours to make arrangements for their homes, busi- nesses, and farms. Many had to sell their property at a loss or abandon it. Bargain hunters descended on them, taking advantage of their plight. 882 Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1932-1960"},{"pageNumber":921,"pageContent":"Examining Photographs Black soldiers were assigned greater com- bat roles than they were given during World War I.

Section Four Revie'w iii?Tiiiiiiiiiiiiia Summary Although the cost was suffering, brutal devastation, and tragic loss of life abroad, World War II accomplished on the home front what the New Deal failed to achieve — an end to the Depression. Demand for war goods created new industries and stimulated existing busi- ness. Under orders from the War Produc- tion Board, many industrial plants converted to war production. The govern- ment responded to inflation with price ceilings, and to scarcity with rationing of specific consumer goods. Wartime pro- ductivity increased employment, wages, and opportunity for all workers, including African Americans and women.

The territorial ambitions of the German- Italian Axis included the Mediterranean and all of Europe. Meanwhile, Japan expanded its holdings in Asia and the Pacific. European appeasement, Ameri- can isolationism, and a Soviet-German nonaggression pact allowed the Axis to overrun Europe and North Africa. As Britain was left to struggle alone and Hitler turned on the Soviet Union, the United States sup- plied military equipment, but did not enter the war until Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. The tide turned against Germany when Russian defenses held at Stal- ingrad. An Allied invasion beginning in 1944 forced Hitler to fight a two-front war. As Allied and Soviet troops converged on Berlin, Germany surrendered. Allied troops then focused on the Pacific, where they retook strategic islands. Atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki finally ended the war. At home, war production ended the Depression and enhanced employment opportunities for all workers, including women and African Americans. Japanese- Americans, however, spent the war in detention camps. * Using Vocabulary Use each of the following words in a statement about the aggressor nations in World War II, the kind of warfare they conducted, and world response. fascism totalitarian appeasement holocaust * Reviewing Facts l.List reasons for isolationist polices in the United States and appeasement in Europe. 2.

This leads them to judge the behavior and attitudes of oth- ers on the basis ol their own values and standards. Such people believe that if something is right lor them, it is also right for everyone else, even though others' values, standards, and culture might be completely different from their own. This attitude is known as ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism may be found to some degree in almost every racial, ethnic, or cultural group. Adolf Hitler carried ethnocentrism to a horrifying extreme. He believed that Aryans, or Germanic peo- ples, were a master race. Hitler based these beliefs, in part, on ancient German mythology that had abso- lutely no basis in facts. In his opinion, the Slavs, Latin peoples, and especially the Jews, were all inferior to Aryans. Hitler felt that if inferior ethnic groups were enslaved or exterminated, the Aryan race could rise to greatness. Although ethnocentrism is not always as blatant as 1 litlcr's, it is important to be able to detect ethnoccn- iiK si.itenients when evahiatini; inlorni.iiion .ibout global issues or events. To recognize ethnocentric statements in written or spoken material, ask these questions: • What is the writer's or speaker's own cultural, eth- nic, or racial group, and about what group is he or she making statements? • Are there words or phrases in the statements that appear to reflect the writer's or speaker's cultural val- ues, behaviors, or beliefs? Such words or phrases often indicate ethnocentrism. • Does the writer or speaker feel superior to another group? Statements that judge another group can be ethnocentric. • Can the information in the statements be proved or verified? If not, the statements may very well be eth- nocentric. • By whose standards are the judgments being made? If they are by the standards of the speaker or writer, chances are that the statements are ethnocentric. Example Read the following excerpt from Mein Ka>npf and ask the questions that will help you recog- nize ethnocentric statements. \"[N]ature does not desire the mating of weaker with stronger individuals, even less does she desire that a superior race should mingle their blood with that of an inferior race.... [E] very mingling of Aryan blood with that of inferior peoples resulted in the downfall of the cultured people. \" (Hitler was German and was making statements about other racial groups. Phrases like downfall of a cultured people show that Hitler judged other cultures on the basis of his own. Words //^t\" weaker/stronger rfwij' superi- or/inferior evaluate without any proof or verification. Hitler's judgement clearly was based on his belief in the superiority of German culture.) Practice Read the following report by General John DeWitt after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and apply the guidelines to recognize ethnocentrism. \" The Japanese race is an enemy race, and while many second and third generation Japanese born on United States soil have become Americanized,' the racial strains arc undiluted. To conclude otherwise is to expect that children born of white parents on Japanese soil... become loyal Japanese subjects, ready to fight and, if necessary, to die for Japan in a war against the ii.ition of their parents.\" CiiAi'i IR 29 WoKi I) War 887"},{"pageNumber":926,"pageContent":"HSSH Chapter 30 The Cold War ^NG THE SCE Truman's Policy of Containment The Cold War Begins in Europe 3 The Cold War in Asia 4 Cold War America Historical Focus Within months after the end of World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union entered into a period of intense confrontation and rivalry.

I have had hardly a day in office that has not been dominated by this all-embracing struggle. — Harry S Truman President of the United States, 1945-1953 Section Focus With the end of World War II, the Allies' goal of defeating Germany and Japan had been attained; its goal of estab- lishing democratic governments through- out Europe, however, proved to be illusive. To Churchill and Truman, democracy meant political and economic systems like those in Great Britain and the United States. Western democracy was unacceptable to Stalin, who began to establish Soviet-style communism in Eastern Europe. The clash of intentions and ideals led to the division of Europe and much of the rest of the world. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe the changes in Eastern Europe after World War II. • List factors that made communism strong during the postwar period. Late in the afternoon of April 12, 1945, Vice President Harry S Truman was called to the White House. There Eleanor Roosevelt met him and said, \"Harry, the President is dead.\" For a moment Truman could not speak. Then he said, \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" Mrs. Roosevelt replied, \"Is there anything we can do for you? For you are the one in trouble now.\" On the next day the new President told reporters that he felt as though the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on him. He asked them to pray for him. Harry S Truman seemed ill-prepared for the presidency. After working as a machine politician in Missouri, he had served two terms in the Senate. As Vice President he had met with President Roo- sevelt only three times since their inaugu- ration in January. Roosevelt had not briefed Truman on major matters of for- eign policy or on military strategy. President Truman's policies from the beginning of his administration showed his determination and the high degree to which he was personally involved in handling both domestic and international affairs. On his desk he kept a sign: \"The buck stops here.\" In times of great crisis, Truman showed an extraordinary capacity for quick, effective, yet restrained action. East- West Suspicions In 1945, during the first months of his administration, President Truman con- centrated his attention on winning the war against Germany and Japan. Like Roosevelt, he supported the creation of the United Nations as a world peace-keep- ing organization. But Truman was much more suspicious than Roosevelt had been of the Soviet Union and its dictator, Joseph Stalin. When the war ended, the alliance benveen the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union unraveled. While there was a common enemy. Western democracies and Soviet leaders had over- looked their political, economic, and so- cial differences. After the war, suspicions returned. Soviet expansion into Eastern Europe heightened American fears of communism, a system in which society as a whole, represented by the Communist party, owns and controls property and the means of production. As fighting ended, Soviet troops occu- pied much of Eastern Europe.

In Hungary, where free elections were held in November 1945, communist can- didates received only 17 percent of the vote. Unwilling to lose control, Stalin later suppressed elections in Hungary and in the other nations of Eastern Europe. Then, under elections supervised by Sovi- et troops, voters gave 90 percent of the vote to communist candidates in Poland. This pattern was repeated in all Soviet-oc- cupied areas, helping to establish commu- nist governments throughout Eastern Europe. Nations that were held under Soviet domination came to be called satel- lite nations. To restore the devastated Soviet econo- my, the Soviets removed whole factories, transportation equipment, and machinery Irom the satellite nations. Stalin also or- dered purges, or forced removals, of lead- ers oi satellite nations who were deemed disloyal. Only Marshall Josip Tito (TEE toh) of Yugoslavia, whose troops drove the Germans out during World War II, was able to steer a neutral course between the Soviets and the western democracies. The leaders of Western Europe and the United States watched with grave concern as the Soviet Union crushed all opposition in the nations of Eastern Europe alter 1945. Former prime minister Winston Churchill identified the new threat in a speech in March 1946 at Fulton, Mis- souri. With President Truman on the plat- form, Churchill warned: . . .

Truman and his advisers agreed that a \"get tough\" policy was their only choice. Republicans in both houses of Congress, who opposed Truman on domestic mea- sures, supported his foreign policy to op- pose expansion of the Soviet Union. As a result, foreign policy became bipartisan, that is, supported by both parties. The Strength of Communism Following World War II, the United States began to withdraw troops from Europe, leaving the Soviet army as the most powerful military force in Europe. As a result of the invasion by Germany, the Soviet Union had lost 20 million peo- ple and suffered vast devastation of land, property, and industry. Feeling threatened by western powers, the Soviet Union wanted to create a bufTer, or safety zone, on its western border. Soviet troops sta- tioned there ensured that the nations of Eastern Europe would remain its allies. The Communists promised to abolish poverty, privilege, and private ptoperty. They guaranteed productive work, shelter, education, health care, and a classless soci- ety in the new \"people's democracies\" of war-torn Eastern Europe.

In that year, the Soviet program of glas- nost flowered, and many Soviet satel- lites declared their independence from Moscow. The most dramatic of these declarations came when East Germans opened the Berlin Wall, the famous visible symbol of the Iron Curtain. In 1990 they removed the wall, leaving only three small sec- tions standing for \"historic interest.\" The Communists saw the world as divided between forces of progress and forces of oppression. Soviet rhetoric incited revolts in other impoverished nations, as people living in poverty lis- tened eagerly to the Communists' plans. Communists began to organize resistance to governments they considered to be reactionary and imperialist. Sometimes they organized groups of guerrilla forces — armed bands that were not a part of a regular military unit — to foment civil war. After 1945, nationalists or antigovernment forces in poorer nations often turned to the Communist party for leadership. Truman responded with a policy of containment — preventing the further spread of communism. This policy, first proposed by George Kennan, the State Department's leading specialist on the Soviet Union, was based on the belief that foreign policy goals of Soviet leaders included conquering other nations — not simply the securing of their own borders. Containment, however, did not win uni- versal support. Indeed, it often caused bit- ter debate both in Congress and among American citizens. Some who opposed the policy believed that it was too soft. Angry with the advance of communism, they called for a quick and decisive victory over the Soviet Union. Another view was ex- pressed by Walter Lippmann, a newspa- per columnist. Lippmann argued that Soviet troops remained in Eastern Europe to protect the Soviets' western border. He warned that the United States could not contain the Soviet Union everywhere. Such a policy, he said, would require the United States to defend all anti- communist governments — no matter how repressive, or unpopular they might be. Lippmann published his newspaper columns on containment in a book called The Cold War. The title, a term coined by Lippmann to refer to a state of war that did not involve actual bloodshed, came to be used by everyone, including the Presi- dent, to describe the icy rivalry that exist- ed between the United States and the Soviet Union. ilMlMl Section One Review WIlIIIIIIWIIIIIIl Summary The armed conflict that ended with the establishment of peace in 1945 was replaced by a different kind of warfare — the cold war. As Soviet troops established and protected communist governments in Baltic and Balkan states, Stalin dropped an \"iron curtain\" over Eastern Europe to exclude influences of capitalism and democracy. Truman responded with a containment policy that became a source of debate in the United States. Checking for Understanding 1. Identify cold war, George Kennan 2.

A hypothesis offers a possible answer to a problem, or an explanation for why a situation or condition exists.

In so doing, the United States shouldered a heavy eco- nomic and military commitment. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Outline the foreign policy goals of the Truman administration. • Explain how the United States became a world power after World War II. The cold war was like no other struggle that had ever engaged the United States. It required a constant state of military pre- paredness; it called for military support for countries believed to be in danger of a communist takeover. It had other eco- nomic costs, as both the United States and the Soviet Union tried to \"buy\" allies with gifts ranging from food to steel mills. Aid to Europe The policy of containment began in Europe. Great Britain, in financial trouble, was forced to notify United States officials early in 1947 that it would withdraw its soldiers from Greece and end aid to Turkey. United States diplomats in Greece warned that this could lead to a commu- nist takeover. Already, they said, Soviet- supported guerrillas were controlling much of the country. It was feared that if Greece fell to the Communists, Turkey would be next. President Truman decided that the United States must act. In March 1947 he told Congress that if the United States was not willing to give aid to Greece and Turkey to contain communism, demo- cratic governments everywhere would be threatened. Truman's warning that the na- tion faced a crisis was clear: / believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or outside pressures — If we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world — and we shall surely endanger the welfare of our own nation. 894 Truman's policy, which became known as the Truman Doctrine, proposed that the United States provide military and economic support to Greece and Turkey.

Soon after the Truman Doctrine went into effect, the administration proposed a plan for economic aid to Europe. The situ- ation in Europe was desperate in 1947. There were shortages of food, fuel, and raw materials, and European nations needed money to rebuild industries and trans- portation systems. The Truman adminis- tration realized that economic deprivation in France, Italy, anci other Western Euro- pean countries might lead to the election of communist governments. The nation's leaders were also concerned that Europe's faltering economy would affect United States markets and trigger a recession, at ht)me. In June 1 947, Secretary of State George C. Marshall went beyond the Truman Doctrine to propose a massive recovery plan for European nations. Under the Marshall Plan, American aid in the form of money, supplies, and machinery would help to end Europe's \"hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos.\" The United States offered the Marshall Plan to all nations in Europe — including the Soviet Union. Believing that the plan would pro- mote the interests of United States capi- talism, the Soviets and Eastern European communist nations turned it down. The nations of Western Europe, on the other hand, welcomed the offer. Drawing up detailed plans for restoring production and controlling inflation, they also agreed to change trade laws — tariffs and quotas that blocked the flow of commerce. 1 he Marshall Plan was an enormous success.

With Senate approval, Truman immediately began talks to create a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which formed in April 1949. NATO linked into a military alliance the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Belgium, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Iceland, Denmark, Norway, and Portugal. Shortly aherwards, Greece, Turkey, and West Germany also joined. NATO was based on the principle ol col- lective security, an agreement by which \"an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against all of them.\" All the members of NATO agreed to increase their military strength. The Unit- ed States provided most of the money, weapons, and troops, and was given the right to appoint the commander of NATO's forces. Truman appointed Gen- eral Dwight D. Eisenhower, who exercised sole authority over the atomic weapons that the United States committcci to the defense of NATO. The West relied on the atomic threat, since NATO had only 12 military divisions in Europe compared to 25 well-armed Soviet divisions. In the midst of the Senate debate on how much military aid to supply NAFO, Tru- man made an announcement that shocked and frightened the nation: In September 1949, the Soviet Union had exploded its first atomic bomb. Much sooner than military experts had expected, the United States had lost its nuclear monopoly. Faced with this new threat. Congress quickly passed the NATO appropriations bill. In 1955, the Soviet Union and the .satellite countries of Eastern Europe coun- tered NATO by establishing their own mil- itary alliance — the Warsaw Pact. I he arms race had begun.

The Truman Doc- trine showed that Americans had no incli- nation to return to their traditional peacetime isolation. The United States initiated and provided the means to implement the Marshall Plan for Euro- pean economic recovery; supported NATO, a military alliance to check com- munism in Western Europe; and staged the Berlin airlift to provide food, clothing, and medical supplies when the Soviets blockaded that divided city. The Soviet Union and its satellites in Eastern Europe countered with the Warsaw Pact. In addi- tion, after 1949 the Soviet Union had the capability to produce and use atomic weapons.

Under United States occupation, the Japanese renounced militarism, dis- banded their army, democratized their society, and embarked on a program of economic development that brought them unprecedented prosperity. In con- trast, the rest of Asia was caught up in the cold war. As tensions grew, the cold war escalated into a hot war with bloodshed and the dislocation of people.

At the close of World War II, the aims of the United States in Asia were to restore peace, help Asian peoples to resist foreign rule, and restore Asian trade with the world. The United States felt it had a special commitment to the Philippines, Japan, and China. In the first two coun- tries, American policies were largely suc- cessful. In the last, they suffered a severe defeat. On July 4, 1946, the United States car- ried out its promise of independence for the Philippines. In return for special busi- ness rights and the lease of military bases, the United States gave the Philippine nation tariff concessions in American markets and $600 million to repair war damage. Later, when communist-led guer- rilla groups revolted against the govern- ment, the United States sent money and weapons to put down the rebellion. De- spite difficult economic and political problems, the Philippines made the tran- sition from a colony to an independent democratic nation.

American troops would occu- py Japan until these aims were accom- plished. To carry out this Potsdam Declaration, General Douglas MacArthur was named Supreme Commander oi the 7\\llied Powers. Under MacArthur's leadership, Japan's military was dismantled. A few militarists were tried and convicted of war crimes and hanged. Under American direction, a new constitution provided for elected represen- tative government and women's suffrage. Most other aspects ot Japanese culture remained intact. The emperor remained as a symbol of Japan's unity, but he was no longer to be looked upon as a god. MacArthur encouraged economic op- portunity and trade unionism, and he attempted to redistribute large rural tracts to landless Japanese. A reorganized school system taught democratic values. At first, the Allies had planned to make Japan pay reparations for war damages, but MacArthur realized that the Japanese lacked the resources to pay such compen- sation. Instead, Japan received nearly $2 billion in aid from the United States. The Japanese people accepted the new re- forms.

President Roosevelt had insisted to Churchill and Stalin that China be treated as a great power. As a result, China gained a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Since the early 1930s, a civil war between the nationalist government and the Communists had ravaged China. During World War II, both sides stopped fighting one another and fought the Japanese. In the war against Japan, Mao's Communists grew to be a strong guerrilla force. Through his promise of land reform, as well as military and political pressure, Mao's forces were able to extend their control over much of mainland China. The civil war of the 1930s had greatly weakened the Nationalists, and the Japanese controlled most of the cities that had been centers of nationalist support. After Japan surrendered, the conflict between the Communists and the Nation- alists again flared. To prevent the exten- sion of communist power, Truman sent General George C. Marshall to China. Marshall was unsuccessful. As the Com- munists gained strength, Chiang asked Friiman to send military aid.

Douglas MacArthur 1880-1964 Douglas MacArthur was born into a military family. His father won the Congressional Medal of Honor during the Civil War and later became the Army's top general. Following in his t father's footsteps, MacArthur saw acdon during World War I and was twice wounded. By 1918 he had risen to the |< rank of general. When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, MacArthur was stationed in the Philippines, where he led its defense. Ordered to retreat in 1942, he pledged: \"I shall return.\" He kept his promise in 1944 by leading the libera- tion of the islands. After the war, as commander of occupation forces in Japan, he wrote its constitution. From July 1950 until Truman fired him in April 1951, MacArthur commanded UN forces in Korea. Some Republicans urged MacArthur to run for President, but he declined and retired. Having already given Chiang's forces $2 billion in aid, the State Department judged that further help would not save the Nationalists from their own internal weaknesses. By the end of 1949 Mao Zedong's forces had forced Chiang's army off the mainland to Taiwan and a few other small islands. Truman's China policy came under bit- ter political attack. American supporters of the Nationalists accused Truman of \"writing off\" Chiang and losing China to the Communists. Truman believed, how- ever, that most Atnericans would not sup- port the massive military intervention needed to save Chiang's government. The United States recognized the na- tionalist government in Taiwan as the government of all of China and blocked attempts by Mao's government to gain a seat in the United Nations. To protest the exclusion of the Chinese communist gov- ernment, the Soviet Union walked out of the United Nations Security Council and boycotted its proceedings. This action was to have a major impact on events in Korea. War in Korea The allied powers had promised Korea \"freedom and independence\" at the Cairo conference in 1943. When the Japanese surrendered, Soviet troops, who had only recently entered the war in the Pacific, occupied Korea north of the 38th paral- lel. Aided by Korean Communists, they set up a communist government. As with other Soviet satellite states. North Korea sealed itself from the outside world. A 1948 UN fact-finding commission was not allowed to travel north of the 38th parallel. In the South the United States support- ed the government of Syngman Rhee (SING mehn REE) who was chosen in United Nations supervised elections. In 1948 the UN recognized the South Kore- an Republic as the lawful government of all Korea.

By November, UN troops were as far north as the Yalu River Valley, bordering communist China, when 200,000 Chinese troops crossed the border to aid the North Koreans. MacArthur's troops were once again pushed back. A major disagreement developed bet- ween General MacArthur and President Truman over the conduct of the war. MacArthur wanted the United States to bomb China and to help Chiang Kai-shek invade China from Taiwan. Truman, how- ever, did not want to risk war with China. MacArthur publicly criticized Truman for hmiting the war effort. In April 1951, Joseph Martin, Republican leader of the House of Representatives, released a letter he had received in which MacArthur criti- cized the President's reluctance to use Chiang Kai-shek's army in Korea and to bomb supply lines in China. In order to maintain authorit)' as commander in chief Truman removed MacArthur from command of the United States forces. He explained, \"I could do nothing else and still be President of the United States.\" The Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committee opened hearings to de- termine the circumstances of MacArthur's dismissal. Two months of interrogations dispelled much of the controversy. Truman's decision emerged as acceptable to the country. The debate produced a more determined opposition to communist China, and American ships were sent to defend Taiwan. The United States continued to oppose communist China's admission to the United Nations. Years of fighting had produced a stale- mate in Korea. Presidential candidate Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 pledged to \"go to Korea,\" to settle hostilities. The war continued until 1953, when a cease- fire was declared. Korea was left a divid- ed country, much as it had been before the war began. The Korean struggle was costly for the United States, which lost more than 54,000 troops. But as a result, many neutral nations drew closer to the United States, and noncommunist ones began to arm for their own defense. mgm Section Three Review i«yuyHNHHM mim Summary In East Asia, successful U.S. reconstruc- tion policies in Japan and the Philippines were overshadowed by defeats in China. Truman decided it was more important to save Western Europe from Stalin than to continue support for Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt Nationalist government. Mao Zedong drove Chiang from the mainland and established a communist government. Chiang's government on the island of Tai- wan continued to represent China in the United Nations, however. Following the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea, North Korean Communists invaded the South in an attempt to annex it.

Blacks and women sought to keep the gains they had made during the war, and many Ameri- cans struggled to maintain their standard of living in the face ol postwar inflation. For some, security meant exposing the subversives they suspected were operating in society and at high levels of their gov- ernment. In the face of mounting opposi- tion, Truman attempted to pursue policies that addressed these concerns. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain changes in the American labor force after the war. • Describe the condition of African Americans during the 1940s. • Evaluate the Truman presidency. Wtirlil W'.ir II brought great changes to the nation's economy. War industries solved tlu- inu-m[il()\\nu-nt problem ot the depression. In tact, with 16 million in the United States armed services, there was actually a shortage of workers in industry. The number of black workers in defense industries more than tripled. Six million women joined the labor force, a rise of nearly 60 percent. When the war ended in 1945, people were fearful ot depression. In the past, when government spending for war mate- rials stopped and soldiers returned home to look for jobs, unemployment spread. Even il the factories kept running, some newly hired black and women workers now feared that they would be replaced by returning soldiers. Prosperity Continues Fears of a depression proved groundless. After a slight drop in business activity, the number of Americans with jobs actually increased. Several factors contributed to the continuing prosperity. As the United States kept feeding not only its own peo- ple but millions of people overseas, farm income remained high. During the war, Americans, due to rationing and scarcity of consumer goods, had saved $30 billion. Now they spent their savings for post- poned purchases. In addition. Congress stimulated postwar business by cutting wartime taxes nearly $6 billion. Instead of depression, consumer demand stimulated a sharp rise in prices, or inflation. Defense spending, which had dropped to $15 bil- lion by 1949, escalated to $50 billion by 1953, pouring even more money into the economy. In addition, the Marshall Plan restored markets in Europe for American goods. In some ways, the cold war economy of the 1950s resembled the wartime econo- my of the I94()s. The governments mili- tary spending continued to stimulate industrial production, while a portion of the labor force continued in military ser- vice. Immediately following World Wir II, soldiers returning from service took the |\")laces of many women who were employed in factories. In the automobile plants the proportion of women on assembly lines dropped from 25 percent in 1944 to 7.5 percent in 1946. The he.id of the Women's Bureau, a federal agency CiiAi'i I R 30 Till C\\M I) War 903"},{"pageNumber":942,"pageContent":"set up to protect women's interests, stated that \"women ought to be delighted to give up any job and return to their proper sphere in the kitchen.\" Federal and state aid to child-care centers in factories was stopped. Yet, women did not entirely disappear from the work force. Continued prosperi- ty created new job opportunities. By 1952 more than two million more women were employed than were employed in 1946. The kinds of work available to women were changing. This change was dramati- cally reflected in the experience of black women. Between 1940 and 1950 the per- centage of black women employed as domestic servants dropped from 72 to 48 percent. The number of those working as Life of the Times Veterans Return After World War II, thousands of military personnel came home. They poured off the troop ships and into the arms of families, wives, and girlfriends . When the celebrating was over, however, these for- mer soldiers faced the task of rebuilding their lives and returning to their jobs or education. fiB&^ife.. ¥ As the nation adjusted to a peacetime economy, there was turmoil in the job market. Thousands of veterans hunt- ed for jobs while wartime industries changed to r^ peacetime pro- duction. Many veterans decided to take advantage of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944. More popularly known as the G.I. Bill of Rights, this legislation assisted veterans in finding employment, education, and medical care. Many who went to col- lege on G.I. Bill assistance were married men with young families. At most colleges and univetsities, housing was not sufTicient for this increased enrollment. For some veterans the answer was a small mobile home or house trailer. During the late 1 940s and early 1950s, many campuses included large trailer parks where \"GIs \" and their families lived. Lasting relationships developed from the strong sense of community in these parks, helping veterans adjust to civilian life. farm laborers fell from 20 to 7 percent. At the same time, the percentage hired by factories rose from 7 to 1 8 percent. The rise in female employment did not mean that women had gained economic equality, however Women in industries earned less than two-thirds as much as men. They were limited in job assign- ments. During the 1940s the number of women in well-paid supervisory and pro- fessional positions actually declined. Only a very few women were accepted into pro- fessional schools where they could study law or medicine. Gains for Blacks As a group, African Americans benefit- ed from the postwar economic boom. Many made the transition ftom farming to manufacturing, from rural areas to cities, from the South to other regions of the country. The number of black workers in white-collar, skilled, and supervisory jobs nearly tripled, increasing from about 300,000 to nearly 900,000. As opportuni- ties for black Americans opened up fields such as law, nursing, and professional sports, average income of blacks — even adjusted tot inflation — almost doubled. Changing social attitudes of both whites and blacks helped these advances. The war against Germany and the cold war both played a part. The horrifying racism of the Nazis helped to make some Ameri- cans more sensitive to racism in their own country. They began to realize that not only African Americans, but also Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans had been treated unfairly and denied opportu- nity. During this period, black Americans worked hard to gain civil rights. During the war, the membetship of the National Association for the Advancement of Col- ored People (NAACP) rose from 100,000 to 351,000. The NAACP hired teams of able lawyers to bring a series of lawsuits to the federal courts to end violations of the constitutional rights of black citizens. Like women, however, black Americans fell short of gaining full equality in the 1940s. In the North blacks often lived in crowded inner-city areas.

AND Geography A family moi'ing north in tLte 1940s and povert}' they were accustomed to in the South. Much ot the black migration took place during the two world wars. During World War I, industrial agents traveled the South promising jobs with high wages and free transportation north. Soon the black population of cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, and Detroit swelled. Detroit alone saw an increase of over 600 percent. In the 1940s rural southern blacks streamed into northern and western cities for two main reasons. First, around 1940 cotton farming became mechanized, far fewer workers were needed, and many blacks became jobless. Second, many saw great opportunity in wartime industries. Although blacks' social and economic gains in the cities were limited by racial prejudice, they acquired a political voice. Their migration forever changed the face of American politics and society. » ¥i¥i¥i¥il Making The Geography Connection 1. Where did blacks migrate to from 1910 to 1950? 2.

IIIIITT uxi wages averaged about 60 percent of those paid to white workers. Black workers were still likely to be \"last hired, first fired.\" In the South old patterns of segregation and racism remained. Black southerners re- sented that their children had to attend separate schools that were often ill- equipped and understaffed. They object- ed to Jim Crow laws that forced them to use segregated facilities. Even worse, most black southerners were denied the vote, either by custom or by law. Almost none held political office. Inflation in the Postwar Years Government spending on wartime mili- tary programs and lor posrwar domestic programs brought prosperity and infla- tion. During periods of inflation the amount of money in circulation increases and prices rise sharply as the demand for goods exceeds the supply. Because increased taxes were not suffi- cient to pay the costs of war, the federal government ran a large deficit during World War II. The national debt rose from $50 million to nearly $270 billion. The government borrowed much of this money from Federal Reserve Banks. Using the federal bonds that the government gave as security, the banks issued new money. As a result, there was four times as much money in circulation in 1945 as there was in 19.38. As inflation drove prices up, the pur- chasing power of paychecks decreased. When consumers could not buy as much, factories slowed production returning to a 40-hour week and employers stopped paying overtime. Workers, losing purchas- ing power, demanded pay rai.ses and often went on strike. In 1946 there were nearly 5,000 strikes, in which nearly 4.6 million workers took part — a record that is im- likely to be surpassed.

The Taft-Hartley Act Union activities were a major issue in the congressional elections of 1946. The anxiety caused by the strikes in basic in- dustries helped conservative anti-labor candidates. The Republicans showed new vigor as they ran on the slogan, \"Had enough?\" For the first time in 18 years, they gained control of both the Senate and the House. An immediate result of this swing toward conservatism was the Taft-Hartley Act, passed over President Truman's veto in 1947. Intended to keep unions from abusing their power, the act outlawed practices such as the closed shop, which forced business owners to hire onlv union members; jurisdictional strikes, which forced businesses to recognize one union instead of another; featherbedding, which limited workers' output in order to create more jobs; and high tees charged to workers tor joining a union.

Setting out on a \"whistle stop\" tour of the country by train, Truman covered 30,000 miles, giving some 350 speeches along the way. Right up to Election Day, the pollsters predicted a Republican victory. But Tru- man won 2 million more votes than Dewey and piled up a 303 to 1 89 margin in the Electoral College. Truman had held together the New Deal coalition. He won labor support tor his veto ot the Taft- Hartley Act. He won support from black voters for his civil-rights proposals. He won the farmers' vote tor his support ot high-tarm price supports. Not only did Truman defeat Dewey, but the Democrats regained their majority in Congress. In his inaugural address in January 1949, Truman called for a Fair Deal, a return to and expansion ot New Deal policies. The President asked for slum clearance, federal subsidies for public schools, government-backed medical in- surance, aid to farmers, and higher mini- mum wages. Although the Democrats held a majority, the new Congress was still influenced by an alliance of Republicans and conservative southern Democrats. To- gether they blocked most of Truman's proposals. In 1949 postwar prosperity slipped into a recession. Unemployment reached 7 percent of the labor force. But the reces- sion lasted only a few months. A tax cut, passed in 1948, took effect making more money available. The New Deal's built-in stabilizers such as farm price supports and social security benefits helped to lessen the effect of the downturn. Beginning in 1950, the Korean W;ir changed the eco- nomic picture sharply. Rearmament now competed with the demand tor consumer goods. The war also tueled anticommu- nist sentiment at home. Fear of Communists rlie colli war ,iikI the Korean War heightened tear ol communism in the Dniied States. A communist spy ring, which had been seiuliiig atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, was uncovered in (Canada. To Americans, this explained the Soviets' success in developing an atomic bomb so early. Americans began to sus- pect that there might be other communist sympathizers and spies in the government, universities, press, and the arts — all work- ing to undermine American democracy. In a period of international tensions, national insecurity led to a search tor scapegoats. The question arose: Should the rights ot Communists be protected by the Con- stitution? In 1949, II members ot the Communist parry in the United States were convicted ot conspiracy. The courts held that since the Communist party was organized to overthrow the United States government by torce, its members were not entitled to protection by the tree speech rights of the First Amendment. Although there were relatively very tew Communist parry members in the United States, the suspected communist conspir- acy led to extensive precautions. Many people were torced to take loyalty oaths betore being hired tor jobs. Ciovernment otficials were subjected to security checks. During the postwar period, a tendency grew among many Americans to mis- take criticism ot American institutions with disloyalty.

Instead, allowing abuses of rights to go unchecked makes it weak- er. In several rulings during this period, however, the Supreme Court found state loyalty oaths to be constitutional. The Court noted that the states had a consti- tutional right to assurance that an employee was not engaged in subversive activity. The \"loss\" of China to the Communists and the stalemated Korean War helped to create this mood in the United States that was much like the \"red scare\" in the years following World War I. Critics of Truman accused the President of having lost China, alleging that his close advisers were Communists or communist tools. Senator Robert A. Taft, Republican leader in the Senate, claimed that the State Depart- ment was \"riddled\" with subversives, or individuals attempting to overthrow the government. Taft said that State Depart- ment officials had: . ..surrendered to every demand of the Soviet Union and promoted, at every opportunity, the communist cause in China. In 1948 the House Committee on Un- American Activities heard testimony from Whittaker Chambers, a magazine editor. Chambers admitted that he had been a communist spy in the 1930s and said that he had received secret documents from Alger Hiss, then a high-ranking State Department official. At first, tew people believed Chambers's story. However, Richard M. Nixon, a young representative from Calilornia, pressed the case forward. Finally, Chambers produced several rolls of microfilm of secret documents he claimed to have received Irom Hiss. Hiss denied these charges. Though not con- victed of spying, Hiss was found guilty of lying under oath. Increased fears of communist subversion fertil were fertile groun dfor xkl more reckless voic- es. At a Lincoln's Day speech in February 1950, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin accused the Democratic party of \"twent)' years of treason.\" McCarthy charged that Roosevelt had deliberately sacrificed the nav\\' at Pearl Harbor and had \"sold out\" to the Soviet Union at Yalta. In addition, McCarthy claimed to have a list of \"card-carrying Communists\" in the State Department.

Years later a Senate committee deter- mined that McCarthy's accusations and investigations had been groundless. The use of indiscriminate, unfounded political accusations to destroy or assassinate the character of one's opponent came, in time, to be known as McCarthyism. Truman's Legacy In 1952 President Truman, despite his remarkable victory ol 1948, announced that he would not run for reelection. By the time Truman left office, he had become unpopular. The successful Soviet atomic bomb explosion, the defeat of the Nationalists in China, and the problems with carrying out the war in Korea, all contributed to charges that Truman was \"soft on communism. \" Other Americans thought his loyalty program had hurt innocent people. Instances ol corruption in high places were also discovered — some of the Presi- dent's closest aides had received valuable gifts in return tor political favors. Although Truman was not personally involved, the \"Truman scandals\" gave the Republicans a ready-made issue tor the 1952 elections. The problems Truman and his advisers faced were new and complex. Congress was often suspicious or hostile, yet Truman got many of his programs enacted. Americans were tired of foreign involvements, yet he managed to keep the nation trom retreat- ing into isolationism. Truman's reputation as leader rose after he left the White House. Most of the Fair Deal measures he called for eventually became law. His policy of \"containment \" was continued by other Presidents. He set the United States a course of world responsibilin' that included aid for those in need and an imwavering defen.se of dcmocrac\\' ever\\'where. WW Section Four Review !« Summary Truman led America through the post- war years. Continued government spend- ing brought inflation, but high employment as well. Women and African Americans remained in the labor force and enjoyed expanded, but not equal, opportunity. A shift in the national mood led to anti-labor legislation and a fear of communism. Political opportunists fanned the fear into a witch hunt that destroyed the lives and careers of innocent people. Truman's policies faced opposition from both the left and the right, and he ended his presidency under heavy public criticism. Checking for Understanding 1.

Explain what the differences indicate about funda- mental changes in foreign policy between 1823 and 1947. * Learning Cooperatively In 1947 George Kennan, a member ot the United States foreign service with expertise in Soviet affairs, explained the need for a firm American policy toward communism. Writing anonymously in Foreign Ajfairs, Kennan said that Soviet communism was like a \"fluid stream which moves constantly, wherever it is permit- ted to move, toward a given goal.\" President Truman's policy of containment was based on this perception. In 1967 Walter LaFeber wrote an alternate view in America, Russia, and the Cold War, 1945-1966. LaFeber saw the Soviet policy of creating a buffer of satellite states in Eastern Europe as primarily defen- sive — a result of their great losses of soldiers, civilians, and equipment in World War II. He explained that the United States was trying to \"open the Soviet empire\" by its cold war policies. Working in groups of three, conduct a debate about the possible alternatives ot United States foreign policy in Europe after World War II. One member should propose and support pulling troops out of Europe to lessen the Soviets' perceived need for a buffer of satel- lites. Another should support George Kennan's con- tention that the Soviets wanted to conquer other nations as well as secure their own borders, and only a heavy military presence in Europe would contain them. The third member should decide which posi- tion was best supported and write an opinion that examines the best points of each argument. All mem- bers should be prepared to argue either position in front of the class if called on by the teacher. * Mastering Skills Determining Factual Accuracy If you compared a Soviet history textbook with an American history textbook, you would find iluu iheir accounts of the cold war would differ substantially. It is important to be aware that everything you read or hear is not necessarily accurate — correct or without error. It is also important to understand that every- thing presented as factual is not necessarily fact — something known lor certain or th.u cm be proven. Asking the following questions will help you deter- mine factual accuracy in written material: • Does the source have reason to distort the truth? • What evidence does the source give to support the \"facts\" presented? • Do other sources agree or disagree with the infor- mation you are questioning? • If sources disagree, which source is the most cur- rent? Which has the best reputation? Example These questions can used to determine the factual accuracy of the following passage: Despite efforts to end discrinii/iation in the South, African Americans did not gain fiill equalit\\i in the 1940s. Black children continued to attend separate, sub- standard schools. Blacks were required to sit in the back of buses and to use separate entrances and separate facili- ties in public buildings. Laws prevented southern blacks from voting. Although the first sentence sounds like an opinion, it is factually accurate. The rest of the passage gives facts to support it. Other sources including state laws and newspapers from the 1940s, and this book, would confirm the factual accuracy of the passage. Practice Use the guidelines above to determine fac- tual accuracy in the following statement about post- war American foreign policy. Consult your textbook and research other sources as needed. China and Eastern Europe were lost to the Commu- nists because President Truman was soft on communism. Truman refused to act when Stalin's troops invaded East- ern Europe after World War II to protect the comtnunist governments that had previously seized power. Truman's refusal to offer the Marshall Plan to Eastern Europe allowed the communists to ronaiti in control. If any elec- tions ever had been held in those nations, the prosperous citizens would have thrown the Communists out. In China, the proud and prosperous masses frlly sup- ported the Natioihilists. If Iruman had ever given any aid to the Nationalist forces, their honest and capable leaders would have quickly overwhelmed the Chinese Communists, who were weak and disorganized afier World War II. The heroic Senator Joseph McCarthy was right. The peoples of the world were sold out by the Communists in the American government who set foreign policy after World War II.

Eisenhower President of the United States, taken from Firsthand Report of the Eisenhower Administration by Sherman Adams, 1 96 1 Section Focus As the Truman presidency came to an end, the t^ear of communism preoccupied the nation. In Asia the United States was engaged in a long and frustrating war with the Communists. In other parts of the world, a dangerous cold war between communism and American interests grew increasingly heated. The nation was ready for new leadership to guide it through these troubling and uncertain times. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe President Eisenhower's style of leadership. • Explain how Senator Joseph McCarthy's influence came to an end. After 7 years of the Truman administration and 20 years ot Democratic leadership, the Republicans hoped that 1952 would be their year. They knew Ameri- cans were worried about the continuing war in Korea and the tense cold war in the rest of the world. Americans were also concerned with the frequent charges of communist infiltration in the govern- ment. President Truman's reputation was damaged by news reports that some of his officials had accepted bribes. These issues gave the Republicans their rallying cry for the election. They ran against \"Korea, communism, and corruption.\" As their candidate, the Republicans picked one of the nation's most popular war heroes, Dwight D. Eisenhower — the five-star army general who led the Allied invasion of Europe during World War II. \"I Like Ike\" When asked to run for President in 1948, Eisenhower flatly refused. He believed that professional soldiers should stay out of politics. By 1952, however, Eisenhower became concerned that isola- tionists might regain the White House and agreed to run. He won the Republi- can nomination after a hotly contested race with Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio. As his running mate, Eisenhower chose Richard M. Nixon, a 39-year-old senator from California who had made his repu- tation pursuing alleged communists in government. The Democrats nominated Adlai Stevenson, the popular governor of Illi- nois, to run against Eisenhower. Steven- son was a thoughtful and eloquent liberal, but his campaign was burdened by the need to defend the actions of the Truman administration. The Republicans adopted the slogan: \"It's time for a change!\" The warm and friendly Eisenhower, known as \"Ike,\" promised to end the war in Korea and took a hard line against the corruption in government. \"I like Ike\" became the Republican rallying cry. 914 Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1932-1960"},{"pageNumber":953,"pageContent":"Examining Photographs The 1952 Republican campaign slogan \"I Like Ike\" swept the nation.

After the campaign was underway, charges were disclosed that Richard Nixon had received gifts from California businesspeopie total- ing $18,000 while he was a senator. For a while, it looked as though Nixon might be dropped from the ticket. But in a nationwide speech broadcast on radio and television, he insisted the funds had been used for legitimate political purposes. He did admit that his family had kept one gift, a cocker spaniel puppy named \"Checkers,\" and he added: [YJou know, the kids love the dog. And I just want to say this right now that regardless about what they say about it, we're going to keep it. The \"Checkers speech\" saved Nixon, who remained on the Republican ticket. h is doubthil that Stevenson ever had a chance to win against the popular Eisen- hower. If he did, he lost it rwo weeks helore IJection Day, when Eisenhower promised to make a trip to Korea if elect- ed. When the votes were counted, the election was a landslide for Eisenhower. He won in excess of 6 million popular votes more than Stevenson and carried the electoral college by 442 to 89 votes. The Republicans also gained an 8-seat majori- ty in the House. The Senate was evenly divided between Democrats and Republi- cans. Clearly, the Republican parry was not as popular as its leader. A New Style of Leadership Although Eisenhower was a career sol- dier, he did not run the White House like an officer commanding an army. Instead, he acted as the chief administrator or lead- er of the White House team. His cabinet assumed new importance and acted as a genuine advisory board. For the first time in history, the cabinet had a full-time secre- tary, an agenda, and regularly kept min- utes. Eisenhower made Sherman Adams, former governor of New Hampshire, his chief of staff. Adams wielded great power by controlling access to the President. The advantages of Eisenhower's kind of administration were clear.

Harrison suffered from pneimionia for a month before his death in 1841. In 1881 James Garfield lingered for two months before he died from an assassin's bullet. In 1919 Woodrow Wilson suffered a paralyz- ing stroke that destroyed his part in upcoming treaty negotiations. reason, the President was unable to lead, the government would not come to a standstill. Cabinet members could easily take over day-to-day operations. Indeed, Eisenhower suffered serious illnesses three times during his presidency, and each time the White House staff carried on with little difficulty. Critics of Eisenhow- er's style of leadership, however, claimed that the President was abdicating his responsibilities. At crucial times he seemed unaware of decisions made by his aides. Historians later described Eisen- hower's management style as a \"hidden- hand presidency. \" Eisenhower hoped to establish good working relations with Congress, but members of his own party sometimes made this difficult. Still angry over the secret agreements that President Roo- sevelt had made with Stalin and Churchill at Yalta, Republican Senator John Bricker of Ohio introduced a law to limit presidential power. This law, known as the Bricker Amendment, required Senate ratification of all agreements made by the President with other nations. It also prohibited the President from making a treaty that conflicted with the laws of any state. President Eisenhower believed that the Bricker Amendment would limit the President's power to deal effectively with other nations. It would also allow any state to disrupt United States foreign policy. Although a majority ol Republi- cans in Congress supported the Bricker Amendment, the Eisenhower administra- tion fought hard against it. In February 1954, the law was defeated by a single vote. Wearily, President Eisenhower commented: If it is true that when you die the things that bothered you most are engraved on your skull, I am sure I'll have there the mud and dirt of France during the invasion and the name of Senator Bricker. McCarthy's Influence Ends Some Americans believed that the elec- tion of a Republican President would put an end to Senator Joseph McCarthy's charges that the government was filled with Communists. But McCarthy contin- ued his crusade and subjected many gov- ernment officials to a series of humiliating investigations. For a time McCarthy succeeded in giv- ing the impression that he was saving the country from communism. A public opinion poll taken in 1954 reported that 50 percent of the people favored him and 29 percent opposed him. Senators wary of McCarthy's influence with the voters were reluctant to oppose him. Although the President privately disap- proved of McCarthy and his methods, Eisenhower refiised to \"get down in the gutter\" with McCarthy by attacking him publicly. The President believed that if he fought McCarthy, he would only give him more publicity. This tactic, however, deprived McCarthy's opponents in Congress of Eisenhower's leadership. McCarthy's underhanded tactics were finally exposed to the public in 1954. In a series of televised hearings regarding possi- ble communist subversion in the army, Americans had a chance to observe first- hand McCarthy's callous disregard of law and fairness. After the hearings ended, the Senate passed a resolution condemning McCarthy for his conduct. McCarthy's witch-hunt was over. Presidential Disability In September 1955, President Eisenhow- er suffered a heart attack. Although the President recovered rapidly, the nation's confidence was shaken. The stock market dropped more sharply than it had since 1929. Then, within the next two years, Eisenhower suffered two major illnesses. The President's health focused attention on the question of presidential succession. It was true Eisenhower had kept the gov- ernment running smoothly during his ill- nesses. But Americans wondered what 916 Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1932-1960"},{"pageNumber":955,"pageContent":"would happen if the President remained ill. The Constitution provides that the Vice President should become President in the event that the President is unable to handle the duties of office. However, the Constitu- tion does not say who is to decide whether the President is, or is not, able to serve. The matter, not resolved tor more than a decade, was fmally addressed in 1967 after the states ratified the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which outlines procedures for times when the President is disabled. Moreover, it deals with the difficult situa- tion when a President feels capable of continuing in office but is thought by others to be incapable. The Election of 1956 In 1956 the Republicans renominated Eisenhower for the presidency. The Republicans claimed that the Eisenhower administration had brought peace and prosperity to the nation. Eisenhower had ended the war in Korea and avoided other world conflicts. \"Everything is booming again except guns,\" they boasted. The Democrats, nominating Adiai Stevenson for a second time, capitalized on fear about the President's health. They played upon the public's concern that Vice Presi- dent Nixon might become President. On Election Day 1956, Eisenhower won by an even greater margin than he did in 1952. But again the Presidents popularity did not rub off on his party. Democrats won control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. In his second term, Eisenhower was more independent of his party than any other President in the twentieth century. Many conservative Republicans regarded Eisenhower as too liberal in domestic affairs and too interventionist in foreign affairs. However, \"modern Republicans\" supported the President. Eisenhower also found allies among the r')cmocrats. His policies won support from the two Democratic leaders in (Congress, House Speaker Sam Rayburn and Senate Major- ity Leader Lyndon Johnson.

Eisenhower's leadership style and his willingness to work with moderate Democrats in Congress allowed imple- mentation of his foreign and domestic programs despite conservative opposi- tion. Concerns over presidential disabili- ty lingered and led to passage of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967.

This accomplishment had a powerful impact on people all over the world. One reason this event had such an impact was that people saw his walking on the moon as a symbol — and attached extra meaning to it. Who or what could be affected by this activity? What consequences could there be for those who are affected? What statement could be made that would demonstrate the symbolism, or meaning, of this event? Explanation A symbol is something used to represent or stand for something else, often an abstract idea, concept, or feeling. Symbols are all around us, even though we often do not recognize them as such. All words, for example, are symbols for objects or ideas. A familiar symbol is the American flag, which stands for the United States and patriotic pride. Other familiar symbols are the color purple that stands for royalty, lions that stand for courage, and the skull and crossbones that symbolize death. Armstrong's moon walk symbolizes human progress, the power of modern technology, and our neverending curiosity about the universe. The lollowing guidelines will help you discover symbolism in history: • Think about the event or condition being studied. What is the main activity in it? • What overall condition led to this main activity? 1 950 political cartoon by Al Hirschfeld i£) Al Hirschfeld.

Those affected — hun- dreds of government offi- cials, teachers, union leaders, actors, and even clergy who were labeled Communists, some without proof 4. The consequences: inno- cent people were charged with treason, spying, and unpatriotic beliefs. 5. Possible statements of the symbolism in McCarthyism: a. McCarthyism symbolized a callous disregard for law and fairness. b. McCarthyism symbolized cold-war mistrust between two superpowers. c. McCarth)ism symbolized a pervasive fear of commu- nism. d. McCarthyism symbolized America's desire to safe- guard its values and ideologies, e. McCarthyism symbolized fana- ticism.

For the previous 20 years. Democratic adminis- trations leaned toward the interests of labor. When Eisenhower accepted the presidential nomination, he promised that in economic matters he would \"trav- el the straight road down the middle.\" As a result, the nation enjoyed an unprece- dented period of prosperity and witnessed the rapid development of big business and agribusiness. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain Eisenhower's economic policies. • Discuss the plight ol the small farmer in the 1950s. Throughout both of his adminis- trations, Eisenhower steered a course between conservaiisni .ukI liberalism. Ike's middle course [ileased most Americans. At the beginning of his administration it looked as though he might try to undo the New Deal. Like Hoover, Eisenhower believed that the role of government should be limited. Eisenhower advocated cutting the budget, reducing taxes, and ending gov- ernment regulation of business. He con- demned the Tennessee Valley Authority as \"creeping socialism\" and tried unsuccess- fully to arrange for private industry to build new power plants in Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky. Despite this conservative agenda, Eisenhower recognized that New Deal programs were strongly supported by most Americans. He wrote in a private letter: Should any political part)' attempt to abolish Social Security, unemployment insumncc, and elimiriate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. The debate during Eisenhower's presi- dency was not over ending such New Deal programs as Social Security or the minimum wage, but over how much larg- er to allow them to become. With Presi- dent Eisenhower's encouragement. Con- gress extended Social Security to 7 million more people and increased benefits.

Business and Labor Big business also had an ally in the White House. During the 1956s, 3,000 companies merged with the 500 largest corporations without any antitrust chal- lenges by the government. The nation's 100 largest companies controlled more than 30 percent of all industrial produc- tion. Some corporations, such as General Motors and American Telephone and Telegraph, had annual budgets that were larger than those of many countries. The American labor movement grew more slowly than big business, but it con- tinued to gain strength. In 1955 the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) merged, forming the AFL-CIO. The merger increased the strength of organized labor and made it easier for workers to form local unions. Organized labor tried hard to win pay increases for its members. During the 1950s, take-home pay and buying power rose sharply. Workers also enjoyed longer paid vacations. United Auto Workers president Walter Reuther observed that the labor movement was developing a \"whole new middle class.\" Organized labor was not very successful in its efforts to organize the lowest-paid factory workers and office workers. Often, these workers were women or minorities. The growth in AFL-CIO membership actually slowed by 1957. Union growth was also adversely affected by congressional Betty Friedan 1921- Betry Friedan (tree DAN) was one of the first to analyze the lives of women. When she began her analysis, most women were homemakers or worked in low-paying jobs. In 1957 she began a year-long study ot her Smith College classmates. She discovered that many of these well- educated women were leading unhap- py lives. With additional research it became clear to Friedan that American women were failing to find fulfillment in life. Instead, they were succumbing to \"the feminine mystique\" — a belief that they were supposed to ignore their talents and interests and live only lor the achievements of her family. In 1963 Friedan published The Fem- inine Mystique, a book that sparked the modern women's liberation movement.

The investigations revealed that strong-arm tactics were used by some unions to force employers into accepting the unions.

Farm Problems Despite the prosperity of the 1950s, it was a difficult time for many of the nation's farmers. Between 1948 and 1956, the farmers' share ol the national income dropped from 9 to 4 percent. While the average American enjoyed a per capita income of $1,629, the farm population averaged $632 a year. Eisenhower was reluctant to have the government continue to guarantee farm- ers set prices for their products. The heart of the issue, according to the administra- tion, was: [Wjhether our farms are to continue to be operated by freemen. Or. . . to offset some very real and obvious problems that farmers now face, will government go in the opposite direction and subsidize agriculture in such a manner that it also takes control?

Many small farm families gave up and sold out to large farmowners who raised only a single crop and used the latest machinery and agricultural methods. Because of their efficiency, the large farm- owners could cut their costs and still make a profit. More small farmers were unable to compete with the agribusinesses, or modern large-scale farms that covered 1,000 acres or more. By 1959 half of the nation's farmland belonged to 4 percent of the farmers. There were other problems associated with America's changing agricultural pat- terns. Large farmowners hired seasonal workers to cultivate and harvest their crops. Many of the workers were Mexican Americans from California and the South- west, but as many as 400,000 workers were Mexicans allowed into the United States on short-term visas. Unprotected by the National Labor Relations Act or feder- al minimum wage laws, these migrant workers labored long hours for little pay and endured terrible living conditions. Their children grew up with little, if any, education. Prosperity and Recession Much of the economic growth of the 1950s was due to a tremendous increase in consumer credit. Effective advertising enticed Americans to borrow more and more money to buy houses, cars, and con- sumer goods. This growing demand, in turn, encouraged industries to produce more goods and hire more people. President Eisenhower worried that this rapid growth of the economy would lead to inflation, or rapidly rising prices. Because of this, he tried to hold down government spending, both for domestic and military projects. But in 1957 and 1958, his attempts to balance the budget set off a recession. Sales dropped and manufacturers laid off workers. Unem- ployment rose to 7.6 percent of the work force. Eisenhower resisted congressional pressure for a tax cut to stimulate the economy. Finally, late in 1958, boom times returned again. **••*•••**•* Section Two Review gamins *•******* Summary During his administration, President Eisenhower steered a middle course between conservatism and liberalism. Although Eisenhower favored lower taxes, reduced government spending, and mini- mal government regulation. New Deal assistance programs continued to serve people in need. Businesses continued to prosper and hundreds of large business mergers went unchallenged. Production and profits increased, and workers bene- fited as labor unions gained in size and influence. Many of the nation's farmers, however, were left out of the economic upswing because of overproduction, which in turn brought lower prices.

In the past, Galbraith said, all societies were based on an \"economy of scarcity, \" that is, the productivity of the economy was lim- ited by a lack of resources and overpopu- lation. But in the 1950s, the United States and a few other highly industrialized nations were experiencing what Galbraith called an \"economy of abundance. \" Up- to-date technology enabled these nations to produce an endless variety and amount of goods and services for their people. The citizens of these countries were enjoying a standard of living never before thought possible. Poverty was disappearing, except within such groups as the unskilled, uned- ucated, and new immigrant population. Some critics accused Galbraith of over- stating the situation, but the facts and fig- ures seemed to support it. Americans produced more than they could use, and this new wealth was being distributed throughout the population. During the 1 920s the wealthiest 5 percent of the pop- ulation received 35 percent of the coun- try's income, but by 1960 this group received only 18 percent. Life for most Americans was easier than ever before. Thev earned more money than they needed for such necessities as food and housing. With their surplus income, they purchased automobiles, household appliances, and other luxury items. 1 he number of Americans owning their own homes went up from 40 to 60 percent between 1940 and 1960. Ameri- catis also had more free time as working hoius were reduced and they were given holidays with pay. CJIAI'IIR.^I St.AKC II IC)K SIAHII IIV 923"},{"pageNumber":963,"pageContent":"o c Q. O Q.

Teens pre- ferred the heavily accented beats and repe- titious lyrics of rock and roll. Rock and roll developed in the mid- 1950s. It was a derivation of the rhythm Elvis Presley, rock and roll star of the 1950s and blues that black musicians had created for black audiences years before. It also often had some elements of country music. In rock and roll, the tempo was quicker, the accented beats were moved, and electrically amplified instruments — mostly guitars — were used. Because rock and roll was such a depar- ture from the sentimental love songs of the past, it shocked and dis- mayed many parents. Teenagers, however, were sold. One ol the first rock hits, recorded in 1955, was Bill Haley and the Comets' Rock Around the Clock, which sold 17 million copies. In 1956 Elvis Presley came on the rock scene. In his performances, he moved to the beat of the music. Presley set the musical style for a decade. The lyrics of most rock- and-roll music, however, remained about love.

What conflicts exist in rock and roll today? *'™\"\"* this conformity led to discrimination or ostracization of those who seemed \"differ- ent.\" For example, in many suburbs racial and religious minorities were unable to buy homes. To some extent, the high cost of homes in the suburbs was responsible, but prejudice was an even more important factor. Often suburban residents refused to sell homes to minority families. And if minority families did move to the suburbs, others in the community made them feel unwelcome. Many writers criticized the trend toward conformity in American life in the 1950s. Nonfiction works, such as David Reisman's The Lonely Croiud (1950), William H. Whyte's The Organi- zation Man (1956), and Sloan Wilson's novel. The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1956), tried to explain the pressure to conform. Sometimes, as represented in The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, these pressures were so subtly pervasive as to make people feel they had little control over their own lives.

This often meant being loyal to the corporation and being \"one of the team.\" Outside work it meant having the \"right\" type of family life and belonging to the \"right\" clubs and religious groups. Social critics complained that Americans were in danger of losing their individualities. Changes in Family Life During the 1950s there were renewed social pressures on women to remain at home. Women's magazines ran articles such as \"Should I Stop Work When We Marry?\" and \"The Business oi Running a Home.\" The immensely popular Pocket Book of Baby and Child Care by Dr. Ben- jamin Spock said that raising children was more important and rewarding than the extra money or satisfaction that a woman might get from a job. Many women who had gone to college or had careers traded their aspirations and jobs for marriage and motherhood. The number of women who worked continued to rise, but women lost ground in the workplace. They were still paid less than men for doing the same work. They were also shut out of better jobs with higher salaries. After World War II, more women dropped out of school and married at an early age. The nation's birthrate increased so rapidly that people refer to the period between 1945 and 1961 as the \"baby boom.\" During the baby boom, more than 65 million children were born in the United States. Parents in the prosperous 1950s wanted their children to have all the things that they had not been able to have during the Depression and war years. They gave their children an increasing amount of material goods and emphasized the benefits of liv- ing the \"good life.\" Parents also allowed their children greater freedom than they themselves had known as youngsters. Critics pointed to this new \"permissive- ness\" as the major cause of the rise in juvenile delinquency. The Impact of Television One of the symbols of the prosperity of the 1950s was the television set. In 1945 fewer than 1 in every 20,000 people had a television. But within a few years, televi- sions were everywhere, and they were almost as common as telephones. Beginning with the election of 1952, television brought national politics into American living rooms. There were tele- vised broadcasts of political party conven- tions, in which not only the public speeches but the goings-on in committee meetings were recorded. During the cam- paign, both parties spent millions on television advertising and broadcasts. Although television stirred greater interest in voting, it also posed disturbing ques- tions.

Why were some people worried about the effect of watching television? Some critics also worried that television would have a negative effect on American culture.

Supported by advertisers trying to reach the widest possible audience, television programs often appealed to the lowest common denominator of public taste. In order to avoid offending potential cus- tomers, advertisers would not buy time on programs that dealt with controversial issues. As a result, television furnished entertainment that was intended \"to fix the attention but not engage the mind.\" Yet the 1950s has been called the \"Gold- en Age of Television.\" Many of the coun- try's best writers, comedians, musicians, and actors flocked to the new medium. There they could reach an audience of millions. «« Section Three Review TTIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIM Summary In the new \"economy of abundance,\" economic growth resulted in increased employment and higher wages throughout the 1950s.

President luscnhowcr's foreign policy was greatly influenced by his secretary of state, John Foster Dulles (DUHL uhs). After serving in the U.S. Senate in the late 1940s, Dulles had years of experience in high-level diplomacy, particularly with Asian nations. Secretary Dulles favored a vigorous foreign policy, denouncing Tru- man's \"containment \" policy as inadequate. Instead, he advocated \"liberation\" of East- ern European nations that were under Soviet domination: If our policy is to stay where we are, we will be driven back. It is only by keeping alive the hope of liberation, by taking advantage of that wherever opportunity arises, that we will end this terrible peril which dominates the world. . . Dulles threatened \"massive retaliation\" against communist aggression. \"It \\ou are scared to go to the brink [of nuclear war], you are lost,\" he said. Accordinglv, the Department of Defense reduced the size of the regular army and increased its nuclear arsenal. Eisenhower tempered Dulles's tough stance and took a more cautious approach.

They declared their intention to remain independent of both the \"First World\" — the West — and the \"Second World\" — the Soviet Union. The policy of neutralism was hotly debated in the United States. Some observers compared neutralism to isola- tionism and defended it as necessary for new and comparatively weak nations. Others attacked neutralism. Secretary Dulles took the position that no nation had the right to remain neutral in a con- flict between \"tyranny and freedom.\" Middle East Powder Keg During the 1950s the United States became drawn into the affairs of the Mid- dle East. Before World War II, American businesses had begun to exploit the area's rich oil supplies. After the war, the United States became increasingly dependent on Mideast oil. Americans were anxious to protect this oil supply. Also many Ameri- cans were deeply interested in the survival of Israel, which was established in 1948 as a Jewish homeland. The Middle East was considered by many to be a \"powder keg ready to explode.\" Arab nations believed that Israel had been established on land belonging to the Palestinians. They threatened to destroy Israel. Moreover, deep divisions existed among the Arab nations. Poverty and discontent were widespread in the region. Finally, Soviet expansion posed a threat to Western oil supplies. The first explosion came in 1956 in Egypt. Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser was anxious to gain military supe- riority over the Jewish state. To get weapons, Egypt signed a commercial treaty with the Soviet Union, exchanging cotton — Egypt's major cash crop — for tanks and guns. The United States had tried to forge friendly relations with Egypt by offering to loan the nation money to build a giant dam across the Nile River.

Acting independently ot the United States, the three nations invaded Egypt in October 1956. The world seemed on the verge of another major war. During a heated debate in the United Nations, the United States voted with the Soviet Union to condemn the actions of Israel, Great Britain, and France. This pressure forced the three nations to agree to withdraw from Egypt. The Suez crisis greatly embarrassed the United States. Three of its strongest allies had acted alone.

Eisenhower First Inaugural Address, 1953 Section Focus The Eisenhower years saw the spread of the cold war throughout the world. Fully aware of the dire consequences of nuclear war, Eisenhower attempted to manage international conflict through a series of cooperative alliances. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe how the fear of nuclear war affected the cold war. • Explain what Eisenhower meant by the \"military-industrial complex.\" • Discuss why American relations with Latin America were poor in the 1950s. President Eisenhower and Secretary Dulles expanded the nation's net- work of alliances in order to con- tain communism. In Western Europe, the United States took a leading role in NATO. In Southeast Asia, the United States helped to create the South- east Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO). In the Middle East, the United States counted on the cooperation of the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), and in Latin America, the United States promot- ed the Organization of American States 934 (OAS). However, these alliances were not always equal partnerships. Weaker mem- bers tended to be client states of the stronger members. The alliances also could do nothing to prevent internal revo- lutions from taking place. The NATO Alliance After President Eisenhower took office in 1953, he attempted to strengthen NATO under a unified command. But France was fearful of German resurgence and strongly opposed the plan. Western defenses were strengthened, however, when West Germany was allowed to rearm and join NATO. In addition to the problem of coordi- nating military power, the NATO alliance faced other difficulties. Europeans had mixed feelings about the United States. European Socialists and Communists regarded the United States as a materialis- tic nation where workers were exploited in order to increase the profits of a few great trusts. Conservatives believed Europe was in danger of being Americanized. In Britain and France, many people blamed the United States for their nations loss of power in the world. Despite these com- plaints, Soviet aggression persuaded West- ern Europe and the United States to maintain a common front. Political uprisings in two of its satellites prompted the Soviet Union to reassert its control over Eastern Europe. In October 1956, anti-Soviet riots broke out in a number of Polish cities. The Soviet Union ultimately agreed to Polish demands for more freedoms. In Hungary, however, what began as peacefiil protests ended with open fighting. When communist leaders attempted to put down the unrest, the Hungarian people turned against them.

On October 30, 1956, after less than a week of fighting, Budapest radio told the Hungarians: \"You have won!\" For five days jubilant Hungarians tasted freedom. Then suddenly, on November 4, Soviet tanks and troops rolled through Budapest and over- whelmed its defenders. In the United States there was much sympathv for the Hungarians, but little Eisenhower could do to help without risking war. Trouble in Latin America While the United States worried aboui communist gains in pAirope, Asia, antl Africa, it largely ignored the political situ- ation in Latin America. There, the great poverty of the majority ol the people .ind the concentr.iiion of land and power in the hamls ol a lew created a breeding grouiul lot poliiic.il instability. Latin Americans had good cause to believe they were \"forgotten neighbors.\" I hey saw the United States pouring bil- lions of dollars into remaking Europe's economy and strengthening weak govern- ments in Asia. Yet Latin America received little United States foreign aid. In 1958 Vice President Nixon made a goodwill visit to Latin America. In some of the countries he visited, Nixon faced hostile demonstrations. In Peru and Venezuela, mobs threw stones and beat sticks against Nixon's car. This shocking attack on the Vice President brought home to people of the United States tiieir neglect ol Latin America's problems. Events in Cuba further somed United States-Latin American relations.

President Eisenhower sharply cut the quota ot sugar the United States imported from Cuba and eventually broke off relations with the Castro government. Thaws in the Cold War During the Eisenhower administration, the cold war spread to all continents. Yet there were signs that a \"thaw\" was possi- ble. After Stalin's death in 1953, the Sovi- et people were allowed a little more freedom. The new premier, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced Stalin as a brtual tyrant. The Soviets now talked of peaceful coexistence and said that war in the atom- ic age would be so horrible that \"the living will envy the dead.\" In July 1955, Eisenhower met with the leaders of the Soviet Union, France, and Great Britain in Geneva, Switzerland. He made a strong plea for nuclear disar- mament, saying that it would: . . . ease the fears of war in the anxious hearts of people everywhere It ivould make [it] possible for every nation, great and small, developed and less developed, to advance the standards of living of its people The Geneva summit, however, settled nothing. In 1958 tensions between the super- powers escalated once more, this time over the divided city of Berlin. The Sovi- ets again threatened to cut off Western access to Berlin unless the West recog- nized the East German government. War seemed perilously close. When the crisis cooled down, both sides made new efforts to reduce world tensions. In 1959 Vice President Nixon and Premier Khrushchev exchanged visits. Khrushchev met with President Eisenhower at Camp David, where they made plans for a second sum- mit meeting. The new thaw was short-lived. Two weeks before the second summit meeting was to be held, in May 1960, an Ameri- can U-2 surveillance plane was shot down over the Soviet Union.

Eisenhower's Farewell Address The U-2 incident and the failure of East- West negotiations brought Eisen- hower's years in office to a frustrating close. After the death of Secretary Dulles in 1959, Eisenhower took over more of the direction of foreign policy himself He traveled widely in Europe, Asia, the Mid- dle East, and Latin America to promote \"peace and goodwill\" and a \"better under- standing of America.\" But Eisenhower was unable to lessen the tensions of the cold war and the threat of nuclear con- frontation. Still, Eisenhower remained a popular President, as near to a \"father figure\" as any President since George Washington. Like Washington, Eisenhower gave a farewell address. In it he warned against the overpowering influence of the mili- tary-industrial complex: UbH Section Five Review !»»» We must never let the weight of this combination [of the military and industry] endanger our liberties or democratic processes. . . .

The administration was unable to contain communism in Europe or Asia. Although the accession of Nikita Khrushchev in the Soviet Union raised hopes that there would be a thaw in the cold war, these hopes were soon dashed. In Eastern Europe restrictions tightened against the Hungarians following their 1956 uprising. Closer to home, Latin American countries became critical of the United States for neglecting their needs.

Americans entered an age ot affluence and found their lifestyles forever changed by television and the automobile. Many moved to the suburbs and imposed upon their neighbors a strong pressure to conform. Women left the work force to keep house and raise children. The end of the Korean War in 1953 diminished the threat of communism. Television exposure of McCarthys brutal tactics brought an end to McCarthyism.

Divide the research assignments so that difterent members are responsible for finding information about news events, movies, television shows, popular music, theater, art achievements, literary publications, advances in science and technology, sports events, and fashion trends tor those years. Have members record their findings. Combine the reports to form a history of the Eisenhower years. * Mastering Skills Finalizing a Re.search Report The last step when preparing a research paper is to check over your rough draft to make sure you have not made any errors or omissions. Ask yourself ques- tions such as these: • Will the reader understand it? • Are more or better tacts needed to sujipon the the- sis statement and main ideas? • Do the main headings relate to the thesis statement? Does each subheading relate to the main heading? • Does each paragraph have a main idea? • Arc there strong supporting siatemeius lor each main idea? • Is the informaiion piesciiieil in a logic.ii order? • Ale ihe p.iragiaphs iiuknled; correct ca[>i(ali/,ili<)n, grammar, and [ninLiiiaiion use; ,iiul .ill words spelled correctly? • Are all direct references and quotes cited in foot- notes or endnotes correctly? Example Read the following rough draft of a short report on migrant workers, and note the errors that were made: Migrant workers [indent paragraph] are farm laborers who move into a region temporarly [incorrect spelling] to help harvest fruits and vegetables that must be picked by hand. Migrants usually work in several dif- ferent areas during the year, although some become permanent residents and landowners, [incorrect facts] Because they move so frequently, the children of migrants seldom receive more than a few years of ele- mentary education [missing period] Mexican-American workers earn low wages but receive other benefits such as Social Security and dis- ability insurance. [Transition missing — are all mig-ants Mexican Americans? Other minorities? Also, check facts on pay and benefits]. They typically live in substandard housing, lack sufficient food, and does not [subject- verb agrement] have access to satisfactory Health Care, [capitalization] After the errors are found and corrected, the report should read like this: Migrant workers are farm laborers who move into a region temporarily to help harvest fruits and vegeta- bles bv hand. Migrants usually work in several areas during the year, and they do not become permanent residents. Because they move so frequentlv, the chil- dren of migrants seldom receive more than a few years of elementary education. Many migrant workers are Mexican Americans. Others may be native Americans, African Americans, or Mexicans who have temporary work visas. Migrant workers receive low wages, $7,000 to $10,000 per year. Because their work is considered temporary they are not eligible for Social Security, food stamps, or other benefits. Migraiu laborers typicalls' live in sub- standard housing, lack suftlcieiu food, and do not have access to satisfactor\\- lie.ilth care.

Out of the war came a new prosperity and a new sense of global responsibility. Suddenly the United States found itself a superpower protecting west- ern democracy. Chapter 28 The New Deal Franklin Roosevelt came to office in 1932 ready to act immediately to ease the Depression. His New Deal program was a two-part program of emergency measures and long-range planning with three spe- cific aims — recovery from the Depression, relief for victims of the Depression, and reform of the nations economic system. During Roosevelt's first 100 days in office, he drew up and Congress enacted an unprecedented number of new pro- grams. These programs kept the economy from collapsing, provided relief for the unemployed, and helped the nation toward financial recovery. In response to critics such as Huey E. Long, the second phase of the New Deal emphasized social reform rather than short-term emerg-encv measures. The ben- eficiaries were farmers, workers, the poor, the unemployed, and the unemployable. Out of these efforts came large-scale pub- lic works programs and a social security system for the elderly. For labor, the pas- sage of the Wagner Act guaranteed unions the right to collective bargaining. Roosevelt won reelection in 1936 by a landslide, largely because of his popularity with organized labor, immigrants, and minorities. Labor unions in particular made great gains. The CIO emerged and successfully negotiated contracts with the steel and automobile industries. In 1935 and 1936 the Supreme Court ruled that many key programs of the early New Deal were unconstitutional. Roosevelt responded by attempting to increase, or \"pack,\" the number of justices on the court. His effort failed and other setbacks in Congress slowed the pace of the New Deal. But by then its programs already had altered the role of government in American life. Aid to the needy and managing the economy were now govern- ment concerns. Chapter 29 World War II During Roosevelt's first and second administrations, the United States worked to improve relations with Europe and Latin America. The Good Neighbor Poli- cy committed the United States to nonin- tervention in Latin America. In Europe, Roosevelt recognized the Soviet Union and sought to maintain neutrality with other nations. Aggressive, totalitarian gov- ernments, however, came to power in Germany and Italy. In the Pacific, Japan moved against China. When war in Europe broke out in 1939, the United States again declared its neutrality. German victories, however, gradually prompted the United States to aid the allied powers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. With the world in a state of crisis, Roosevelt was reelected for an unprecedented third term in 1940. The following year, after Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor, the United States declared war on Japan and Germany. For the second time in 25 years, the American economy converted to war pro- duction and transformed the nation's way of life. Women left home to serve in the armed forces and to work in offices and defense plants. African Americans also joined the armed forces and increasing numbers of blacks found work in facto- ries. Japanese Americans, however, were placed in detention camps because the government questioned their loyalty. By 1944 when an ailing Roosevelt was reelected to a fourth term, Germany and 940 Unit 9 Times of Crjsis: 1932-1960"},{"pageNumber":979,"pageContent":"Japan had suffered major defeats on all fronts. With Allied armies on the out- skirts of Berlin and much ot the nation in ruins, Germany surrendered in May 1945. Japan surrendered a few months later, but only after American planes had dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Before the war ended, the Unit- ed States and 50 other countries formed the United Nations in hopes of maintain- ing international peace and cooperation. Chapter 30 The Cold War After World War II, the United States found itself the leader of the western democracies. The war-time alliance came apart when the Soviet Union drew an \"iron curtain\" between Eastern European nations they controlled and the rest ot Europe. An intense cold war of words, rivalry, and confrontation soon developed between the West and the Soviet Union. Western fear that communism would spread led to a policy of containment, or sending American aid or troops to help check Soviet aggression. The Marshall Plan also gave massive economic aid to war-torn Western Europe. A Soviet block- ade of Berlin prompted the Berlin airlift, which provided tons of supplies to belea- guered residents. To guard against further Soviet aggression, the United States, Canada, and nations of Western Europe established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a peacetime alliance. European communist countries responded with the Warsaw Pact. Meanwhile, the cold war spread to Asia. In 1949 Mao Zedong succeeded in estab- lishing a communist government in China, despite American efforts to pre- vent it. Ill Korea, the country was divided between the noncommunist South and the communist North. Americans under the United Nations flag fought a \"hot war\" to stop n commimist takeover ot the peninsula. At home the rnmi.m administration pushed lor economic and social reform. Inflation was rising and labor resorted to strikes to increase wages. The 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, however, prevented unions from abusing their power by out- lawing the closed shop. Also, fear generat- ed by the cold war led to a search by Senator Joseph McCarthy for Commu- nists in the federal government. In the early 1950s the country began a long period of economic prosperity. The growing economy created millions of new jobs. Two million more women had jobs in 1952 than in 1946. After World War II, the number of black supervisors and professionals tripled from what it was before the war. Encouraged by their role in the war and by their new economic strength, blacks began to lobby for their civil rights. Chapter 3 1 Search for StabiHty In 1953 anxiety about the cold war, concern about corruption, and frustration with the Korean War brought Dwight Eisenhower and a new style of leadership to the White House. Although friendly to corporations, Eisenhower also expanded New Deal programs such as social securi- ty, and raised the minimum wage. Despite inflation and a brief recession, businesses and working men and women prospered. Farmers, however, did not fare well. Even though New Deal price supports contin- ued, small family farms could not com- pete with agribusinesses. For many Americans, affluence came with economic growth. Prosperity, com- bined with technological and medical advances inspired a new confidence in the future. Automation, computers, and tele- vision changed work and leisure. A new way of life evolved for many Americans as they moved from the cities to the suburbs and commuted to work. Meanwhile, communism and national- ism were on the rise in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. Under F.isenhowcr, America's cold-war contain- ment policy contintied through diploma- cy, military and economic aid, and covert operations. His efforts to lessen tensions and reduce the Soviet nuclear threat, how- ever, failed. Synthesizing Unit Themes Relating Ideas 1.

Evaluating Performance In November 1990, after failed attempts to reach a peaceful settlement and months of economic sanctions, the United Nations passed a resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq had not ended its occupation of Kuwait by Jan- uary 15, 1991. In the final days before the deadline, the United Nations Secretary General met personal- ly with Saddam Hussein to persuade him to with- draw and avoid war.

On other occasions I waited appre- hensively while my mother read onion- paper letters airmailed from Mexico with news of a relative's illness or death. For both my parents, however, reading was something done out of necessity and as quickly as possible. Never did I see either of them read an entire book. Nor did I see them read for pleasure.

You must learn to treat them with great care and respect.\" OPEN THE DOOR OF YOUR MIND WITH BOOKS, read the red and white poster over the nun's desk in early September. It soon was apparent to me that reading was the classroom's central activity. Each course had its own book. And the information gathered from a book was unquestioned. READ TO LEARN, the sign on the wall advised in December. I privately wondered: What was the connection between reading and learning? Did one learn something only b\\' reading it? Was an idea only an idea it it could be written down? In June, CON- SIDER BOOKS YOUR BEST FRIENDS. Friends? Reading was, at best, only a chore.

To console myself for the loneli- ness I'd feel when I read, I tried reading in a very soft voice. Until: \"Who is doing all that talking to his neighbor?\" Shortly after, remedial reading classes were arranged for me with a very old nun. At the end of each school day, for nearly six months, I would meet with her in the tiny room that served as the school's library but was actually only a storeroom for used textbooks and a vast collection of National Geograph ic. Everything about our sessions pleased me: the smallness ot the room; the noise of the janitor's broom hitting the edge of the long hallway out- side the door; the green of the sun, lighting the wall; and the old woman's face blurred white with a beard. Most of the time we took turns. I began with my elementary text. Sentences ot astonishing simplicity seemed to me lifeless and drab: \"The boys ran from the rain She wanted to sing The kite rose in the blue. \" Then the old nun would read from her favorite books, usu- ally biographies of early American presi- dents. Playfully she ran through complex sentences, calling the words alive with her voice, making it seem that the author somehow was speaking directly to me. I smiled just to listen to her. I sat there and sensed for the very first time some possi- bility of fellowship between a reader and a writer, a communication, never ifitifnarc like that I heard spoken words at home convey, but one nonetheless personal. One day the nun concluded a session asking me why I was so reluctant to read by mvsell. I tried to explain; saitl some- thing about the way written words made me feel all alone — almost, I wanted to add but didn't, as when I spoke to myself in a room just emptied of furniture. She stud- ied my face as I spoke; she seemed to be watching more than listening. In an uneventful voice she replied that I had nothing to fear. Didn't I realize that reading would open up whole new worlds? A book could open doors lor me. It could introduce me to people and show me places I never imag- ined existed. She ges- tured toward the bookshelves. (African women danced, and the shiny hubcaps of automobiles on the back covers of the Geographic gleamed in my mind.) I listened with respect. But her words were not very infltiential. I was thinking then of another consequence of iteracv, one I was too shy to admit but nonetheless trusted. Books were going to make me \"educated. \" That confi- dence enabled me, several months later, to overcome my fear of the silence. In fourth grade I embarked upon a grandiose reading program. \"Give me the names of important books,\" I would say to startled teachers. They soon found out that I had in mind \"adult books.\" I ignored their suggestion of anything I sus- pected was written for children. (Not until I was in college, as a result, did I leail Huckleberry Finn or Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.) Instead, I read The Scarlet Letter and franklin's Autobiography. And whatever I read I read for extra credit. F.acli time I Hnished a book, 1 reported the achievement to a teacher and basked in the praise my effort earned.

It that core essence could be mined and memorized, I would become learned like my teachers. I decided to record in a notebook the themes of the \\ The Library by Jacob Lawrence, 1960 when I checked out the maximum ten books at a time started saving books they thought I might like. Teachers would say to the rest ot the class, 'T only wish the rest of you took reading as seriously as Richard obviously does.\" But at home I would hear my mother wondering, \"What do you see in books?\" (Was reading a hobby like her knitting? Was so much reading even healthy tor a boy? Was it the sign of \"brains\"? Or was it just a convenient excuse for not helping books I read.

I came to enjoy the lonely good company of books. Early on weekday mornings, I'd read in my bed. I'd feel a mysterious comfort then, reading in the dawn quiet — the blue-gray silence interrupted by the occasional churning of the refrigerator motor a few rooms away or the more distant sounds of a city bus beginning its run. On weekends I'd go to the public library to read, surrounded by old men and women. Or, if the weather was fine, I would take my books to the park and read in the shade of a tree. A warm summer evening was my favorite reading time. Neighbors would leave tor vacation and I would water their lawns. I would sit through the twilight on the front porches or in backyards, reading to the cool, whirling sounds of the sprinklers. I also had favorite writers. But often those writers I enjoyed most I was least able to value. When I read William Saroyan's The Human Comedy, I was immediately pleased by the narrator's warmth and the charm ot his story. But as quickly I became suspicious. A book so enjoyable to read couldn't be very \"important.\" Another summer I deter- mined to read all the novels of Dickens. Reading his lat novels, I loved the feeling 1 got — after the first hundred pages — oi being at home in a fictional world where I knew the names of characters and cared about what was going to happen to them. And it bothered me that I was forced away at the conclusion, when the fiction closed tight, like a fortuneteller's fist — the futures of all the major characters neatly resolved. I never knew how to rake such feelings seriously, however. Nor did I sus- pect that these experiences could be part of a novel's meaning. Still, there were pleasures to sustain me alter I'd finish my books. Carrying a volume back to the library, I would be pleased by its weight. I'd run my fingers along the edge ot the pages and marvel at the breadth ot my achievement. Around my room, growing stacks ot paperback books rcentorced my assurance. 1 entered high school having read hun- dreds of books. My habit of reading made me a contident speaker and writer of English. Reading also enabled me to sense something ot the shape, the major con- cerns, ot Western thought In these vari- ous ways books brought me academic suc- cess as I hoped that they would. But I was not a good reader. Merely bookish, I lacked a point of view when I read. Rather, I read in order to acquire a point of view. I vacu- umed books for epigrams, scraps of infor- mation, ideas, themes — anything to fill the hollow within me and make me feel edu- cated. When one of my teachers suggested to his drowsy tenth-grade English class that a person could not have a \"complicated idea\" until he had read at least two thou- sand books, I heard the remark without detecting either its irony or its very compli- cated truth. I merely determined to com- pile a list ot all ot the books I had ever read. Harsh with myselt, I included only once a title I might have read several times. (How, after all, could one read a book more than once?) And I included only those books over a hundred pages in length. (Could anything shorter be a book?) There was yet another high-school list I compiled. One day I came across a news- paper article about the retirement of an English protessor at a nearby state college. The article was accompanied by a list of the \"hundred most important books of Western Civilization.\" \"More than any- thing else in my life,\" the professor told the reporter with tlnality, \"These books have made me all that I am.\" That was the kind of remark I couldn't ignore. I clipped out the list and kept it tor the sev- eral months it took me to read all of the titles. Most books, of course, 1 barely imderstood. While reading Plato's Repub- lic; for instance, 1 needed to keep looking at the book's jacket comments to remind niyselt what the text was about. Neverthe- less... I looked at every word ot the text. And by the time 1 reached the last word, relieved, I convinced mvselt that I had read The Republic. In a ccremon\\' ot pride, I solemnly crossed Plato off my list. INTERPRETING LITERATURE 1.

The settlement of differences over school attendance, public transporta- tion and other public facilities must be made within these laws which reflect our way of life. — Grand Jury, on the Montgomery Boycott, 1956 Section Focus Almost a century after passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments, African Americans were still victims of discrimination and segregation. In the South these attitudes were entrenched not only in custom but also in law. The battle to obtain equal rights for blacks would have to be fought in the courts, in the news media, and in the consciences of the American people. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss the effects of the Broivn v. Board of Education decision. • Describe major events in the early civil rights movement. Support for the civil rights move- ment spread rapidly during the 1950s and early 1960s. African Americans would no longer accept second-class citizenship nor the humiliating practice of forced segregation. They fought for equal opportunities in jobs, housing, and education. They fought against segre- gated schools, buses, and trains; they fought against separate facilities in restau- rants, hotels, libraries, and hospitals. They won an important ally when the Supreme Court issued several decisions against racial discrimination. But the main force behind the civil rights move- ment came from citizens — black and white — who banded together in an effec- tive protest movement. Brown v. Board of Education One of the Supreme Court's most significant rulings of the 1950s came in May 1954. Three years earlier, Linda Brown's parents had sued the school board of Topeka, Kansas, for not allowing their daughter to attend an all-white school, miles closer to their home than the segre- gated elementary school she was assigned to attend. The Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, that it was unconstitutional to separate schoolchildren by race. In the decision Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote: Does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other \"tangible\" factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority gvup of equal educational opportunities? We believe it does. The Brown decision reversed the Court's decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, an 1896 ruling that had upheld the constitu- tionality of \"separate but equal\" public accommodations. Plessy had become the basis for Jim Crow laws and legal segrega- tion in many states. In the Brown case, the Court did not set a deadline for ending 954 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":993,"pageContent":"segregation, bur in 1955 ordered schools to desegregate with \"all deliberate speed.\" The Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education called for major changes in many states, especially those in the South. Some border states integrated their schools, but the South remained segregated. The governor of Virginia threatened to close the state's pubhc schools and send white children to private schools. A group ot 101 southern members of Congress signed a \"Southern Manifesto,\" which called the Court's ruhng \"a clear abuse of judicial power\" and pledged use of \"all lawful means to bring about a reversal of this decision.\" Boycotts and Demonstrations The decisions of the Warren Court gave legal support to blacks' struggle for civil rights. But most civil rights battles, particularly in the South, were fought by brave men and women who broke down the barriers of segregation one by one. One of these was Rosa Parks, a black seamstress from Montgomery, Alabama. One day in December 1955, Examining Photographs Rosa Parks quietly took a seat in the front of tiie bus against law and custom. Why do you think she refused to give up her seat? Parks boarded a segregated bus in which all the seats allotted for blacks were filled; she took a seat in the front, which was reserved for white riders. Because she was too tired to stand, Parks refused to give up her seat. She was arrested and ordered to stand trial for disobeying the state's segregation laws.

Many of its leaders believed that now was the time to challenge Alabama's segregation laws. At a meeting held at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, a boycott of the city's buses was called. The 26-year-old minister of the church. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was asked to lead the boycott. On the day of Rosa Parks's trial, almost all of the black riders who usually took the buses boycotted them. Because a majority of the regular bus riders were black, the bus company lost much of its business. The boycott continued for almost a year. Rosa Parks was convicted and fined $10. Dr. King and other black leaders were arrested for sponsoring an \"illegal Life of the Times School Desegregation Melba Pattillo Beak was one of the African- American teenagers who integrated Little Rock's Central High School in the fall of 1957.

That is the greatest les- son I learned.\" boycott.\" But in November 1956, the Supreme Court ruled that segregation in public transportation was illegal. The bus company ended its policy of segrega- tion. The black citizens of Montgomery, assured of equal treatment, resumed rid- ing the buses. The Montgomery bus boy- cott galvanized the civil rights movement, and in Martin Luther King, Jr., that movement found an inspiring leaden Black churches and their ministers took the lead in organizing the civil rights movement. Dr. King, a Baptist minister, drew from his own faith and also from the nonviolent techniques of the great Indian leader Mohandas Gandhi. King told the people he led that they should disobey unjust laws, but at the same time he asked them to love their oppressors and never to use violence. He explained that public opinion not violence would force authorities to change unjust laws: We who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. . . . Injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured. In 1957, to carry on this nonviolent struggle against discrimination in public places all over the South, King and other black Southern leaders from 10 states founded the Southern Christian Leader- ship Conterence (SCLC). The civil rights movement represented the work of many groups. Among them were such long-established black organiza- tions as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which fought discrimination in many court cases, including Brown v. Board of Education; the National Urban League, which established community programs in cities to promote education 956 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":995,"pageContent":"and political power for minorities; and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), which worked for economic and political opportunities for African Americans. Dr. King remained at the forefront of the movement as it continued to grow in the 1960s. In 1964 he received the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent leadership. Eisenhower and Civil Rights In May 1955, the Supreme Court had called for the implementation of integra- tion \"with all deliberate speed.\" The ruling needed the active support ol President Eisenhower, but the President believed that the federal government should remain neutral concerning controversial issues that affected state and local govern- ments. He remarked, \"I don't believe you can change the hearts of men with laws and decisions.\" In 1957 Congress passed the first civil rights law since Reconstruction. The act created a civil rights division within the Department of Justice and gave the government the power to seek court injunctions against those who denied any citizen's constitutional rights. A 1960 law empowered the Justice Department to go to court on behalf of citizens whose civil rights were violated.

The sharecropping sys- tem and \"Jim Crow\" segregation laws worked to deny them their rights as citizens. Black leaders began to work toward restoring their full civil rights in the early decades of the twentieth century, but the movement did not come into full flower until the 1950s. Backed by the federal gov- ernment, Dr. Mar- tin Luther King, Jr., and others then declared, \"We shall overcome! I\" rights. A federal court had ordered that nine black students be admitted to the all-white Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. The state's governor, Orval Faubus, defied federal authority and sent National Guard troops to prevent the students from attending. President Eisenhower invited Governor Faubus to Newport, Rhode Island, to persuade him to obey the court order. The governor withdrew the troops, but without their protection the black stu- dents were exposed to an angry mob that threatened them with physical harm. Forced to act to maintain order, Eisen- hower sent in 1 ,000 paratroopers and fed- eralized 10,000 members of the Arkansas National Guard to surround the school so that the students could enter safely. As Daisy Bates, then the president of the Arkansas NAACP, later remembered: . ..the nine negro pupils marched solemnly through the doors of Central High School, surrounded by twenty-two soldiers. An Army helicopter circled overhead. Around the massive brick schoolhouse 350 paratroopers stood grimly at attention. . . . Within minutes a world that had been holding its breath learned that the nine pupils. . . had finally entered the \"never-never-land. \" Troops remained in Little Rock for the rest of the year, however, and Central High School was closed for the 1958- 1959 academic year. As the Eisenhower administration drew to a close, the nation remained racially divided. Custom and years of intimida- tion kept many African Americans from voting. Between 1957 and 1960, the Jus- tice Department brought only 10 suits to secure voting rights for blacks. Only 25 percent of adult blacks voted in states of the deep South, and only 5 percent in Mississippi. The movement for civil rights was just beginning. iXXKXSXXS ab Section One Review Summary In the 1950s black Americans used their growing voice and power to fight for an end to discrimination. Their efforts were aided by the Supreme Court's decision in Browti i>. Board of Education that stated separation by race was inherently unequal.

Kennedy U.S. Senator, 1959 Section Focus By the late 1950s, many people in the United States felt it was time to attack the nation's problems with new vigor. Despite the prosperity of the postwar years, pover- ty and racism were still prevalent. Eisen- hower, the first President to be legally limited to two terms, would soon be leav- ing office. The people looked to his still- unchosen successor to provide strong, active leadership. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe important legislation Kennedy proposed during his term of office. • Describe advances made in civil rights during the Kennedy administration. Washington, D.C., glittered during the Kennedy years. As never before, millions became familiar wiih the occupants of the White House: a young, energetic President, the cultiuvd .iiul glamorous I'irst I.aily, and the inuisu.il sight ol ilu' Kemictly children playing under their father's desk. The public's enchantment with Kennedy was not shared by Congress, however. Many of Kennedy's most important legislative efforts would have to wait until after his death to become law. The Election of 1960 In the 1960 presidential campaign, the Republicans chose Vice President Richard M. Nixon; and the Democrats chose Sen- ator John F. Kennedy. The backgrounds of the two men presented striking contrasts. Kennedy was a Catholic from Massachusetts, the second-oldest son of a wealthy family. Nixon, born in California, was from a family in which his father was not financially successful, and his Quaker mother had struggled to keep the family together. Both candidates were young: Nixon was 47 years old, and Kennedy was ^1). As his vice-presidential running mate Nixon chose U.N. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge. To win southern support, Kennedy chose the Texas Senator Lyndon B. Johnson as his running mate. Nixon and Kennedy were experienced legislators, both having served in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. Nixon had also served eight years as Eisenhower's Vice President. The political differences between the candidates were small. Both were consid- ered \"Cold Warriors\" who believed that communism (the Soviet Union, in partic- ular), was the chief threat to the way of life in the United States. Senator Kennedy hoped to take advatitage of Republican weaknesses and challenged Nixon ti) a series of televised debates. Nixon was the more skilled debator, and the majority of those people who listened to the debates on radio declared Nixon the winner. Yet, the millions more who watched on televi- sion thought a well-prepared, poised, aiul youthful Senator Kennedy woti the debates. The debates were one ol the earliest examples of the impact of televi- sion on Uniteti States politics. Political observers wondered whether Kennedy's religion would he an obstacle to his election. No Catholic had ever been elected President, and some believed that Ci lAi' 1 i.R M Ni.w Fron riiiRS 959"},{"pageNumber":998,"pageContent":"THE ELECTION OF 1960 200 KILOMETERS Candidate"},{"pageNumber":999,"pageContent":"both to join forces against the common enemies of \"tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself\" In ringing tones, he declared: My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country. My fellow citizens of the world: Ask not what America can do for you. but what together we can do for the freedom of man. The Kennedy administration became known as the \"New Frontier.\" For the first time, the future of the United States lay in the hands of those born in the twentieth century. The President and his closest advisors were inteUigent and tough-minded. They were sure of their abihty to make the country and the world better places to live in. In public the new President mixed idealism with realism and informality with dignity. Above all, Kennedy seemed to have the gift of leadership that inspired trust and devotion. Kennedy's qualities of leadership seemed to appeal not only to those in the United States but to people all over the world. Kennedy's Economic Program Essentially, Kennedy's New Frontier was a continuation of Roosevelt's New Deal and Truman's Fair Deal. Kennedy promised to stimulate the economy with tax cuts and increased federal spending. When Kennedy became President, the nation's rate of economic growth was only 3 percent a year. Kennedy looked for ways to increase growth and create more jobs. In stimulating the economy, he chose noi to rely on federal spending, which tends to cause inflation. Instead he sought to increase business production and efficien- cy. His administration also asked business- es to hold down prices and labor leaders to hold down rec]uests for pay increases. Prodded by Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg, labor unions in the steel indus- try agreed to reduce their demands for higher wages. Despite this agreement, several steel companies raised prices sharply in 1962. Kennedy denounced the steel company executives and threatened to have the Department of Defense buy cheaper steel from foreign companies. He also instructed the Justice Department to investigate whether the steel industry was guilty of price-fixing. The steel com- panies backed down and cut their prices. To achieve this victory, however, Kennedy had strained his relations with the nation's business leaders. .t* PO, 7 Rachel Carson 1907-1964 From her earliest days, Rachel Carson had rwo great loves: nature and books. At first, she planned to be a writer, but she switched majors from English to biology during her junior year of college. She combined her twin loves by becoming a science author. An aquatic biologist by training, Rachel Carson wrote about the sea with great insight. But Silent Spring, her most important book, dealt with the environ- ment.

Physicist Edward Teller called the launch a Soviet victory in \"a Edwin E. AUriji, Jr., lunar >noduIe pilot battle more important and greater than Pearl Harbor.\" President Eisenhower told the panicked nation that only its pride, not its security, was damaged. Americans, however, were threatened by what they considered Soviet technical superiority. In response. Congress passed the National Defense Education Act, which financed science and foreign-lan- guage programs in schools. In addition, the National Science foimdation's curricu- lum-development budget was dramatical- ly increased. Congress also created the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis- tration (NASA) in 1958. Huge sums of money were allocated to develop space technolog)' and compete with the Soviets in space. In 1961, the same year the Soviets put a cosmonaut into orbit, President Kennedy pledged America to landing a man on the moon by 1970. In July 1969, this goal was achieved.

But there were areas of poverty, notably in the Appala- chian Mountain region, in much of the South, and in the nations inner cities. Kennedy supported the Area Redevelop- ment Act, designed to encourage indus- tries to move into economically depressed areas. His Housing Act of 1961 called for $5 billion to be spent improving rundown homes and slum neighborhoods in the inner cities. And he achieved his aim of raising the national economic growth rate, which doubled during his administration. Although the Democratic party enjoyed large majorities in both houses of Congress, Kennedy was unable to get Congress to pass much of his domestic program into law. Congress, dominated by a conservative coalition of Southern Democrats, rejected many New Frontier measures, just as they had done with Truman's Fair Deal. When Kennedy proposed that the government recognize the problems ol cities by creating a new Cabinet depart- ment for urban affairs, Congress voted down the proposal. Kennedy also asked for a national health insurance program. Medicare, to help older citizens pay their medical bills. The Senate defeated this bill, which was opposed by many doctors. The President called the Senate's action a \"serious defeat for every American family. \" Despite the power of the conservative coalition in Congress, Kennedy was able to win some legislative victories in his domestic program, including a bill for federal aid to public schools. Perhaps his most significant victory was increased funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Kennedy challenged the nation and NASA with the goal of putting an astronaut on the moon by 1970.

He believed the United States must capture the lead that the Soviets had taken in space exploration when, in 1957, they had launched Sputnik I, the first space satellite to orbit the earth. Kennedy and Civil Rights In contrast to Eisenhower's cautious stand on civil rights. President Kennedy had promised vigorous support ot the movement. Kennedy was aware of the support he needed from black voters to win the 1960 election. During the campaign he boldly declared that segrega- tion in federal housing could be ended with \"a stroke ot the pen. \" But once in office, he moved slowly on civil rights. His slim victory over Nixon, coupled with the fear ol losing southern Democratic support in Congress, made him act less forcefully than the words of his campaign had seemed to promise. Kennedy's cautious attitude disappoint- ed white liberals and black leaders. He wailed imtil 1962 to sign an executive order ending segregation in government- owned housing. And although Kennedy appointed African Americans to his administration as well as to federal judicial positions, he also appointed some judges who supported segregation. Events in the South, however, soon forced Kennedy to take a more active role in civil rights. In the spring of 1961, civil rights activists volunteered as \"Freedom Riders\" to ride chartered buses into segregated bus terminals throughout the South. In May bus loads of the Freedom Riders were attacked by mobs in the Alabama cities of Anniston and Birmingham; a bus was fire-bombed and riders were beaten and clubbed. As more and more Freedom Rid- ers poured into southern cities, local police were unable or unwilling to protect them from angry racists. The President was forced to use federal marshals to restore order. The Justice Department also pressured the Interstate Commerce Com- mission to bring lawsuits against those terminals that refused to comply with regulations on desegregation. Under Kennedy, from 1961 to 196.3, the Department of Justice brought 6 times as many lawsuits to protect black voting rights as it did under Eisenhower, from 1958 to 1960. As a result, by 1964, the percentage of black citizens registered to vote in the deep South had risen from 25 to 40 percent, largely as a result of the work of the Freedom Riders. In April 1963, during a demonstration led by Dr. King in Birmingham, Alabama, national television carried vivid pictures of police using fire hoses, clubs, and police dogs on demonstrators — among them women and children. Viewers were shocked by these outrageous actions, and Kennedy sent 3,000 troops to restore peace in the city. Fhen, in June he pro- posed a new civil rights bill that would outlaw segregation throughout the nation. During Kennedy's administration, the Department of Justice brought numerous suits lor desegregation ol schools.

We will never surrender to the evil and illegal forces of tyranny.\" Kennedy immediately sent in marshals to enable Meredith to enter the university safely. When mobs at the university grew larger and uglier, President Kennedy sent in the Mississippi National Guard. Meredith was able to attend classes, but only after two people had been killed in a mob action. In 1963 Alabama Governor George Wallace tried to stop a black student from entering the Universit}' ot Alabama. Once again the President sent marshals and the Alabama National Guard to the university campus. The violence of such confrontations convinced Kennedy that federal legisla- tion against segregation and discrimina- tion was needed. He quickly proposed laws that would forbid segregation in stores, restaurants, hotels, and theaters and that would prohibit discrimination in employment. But progress on school desegregation was slow. Most black school children in the south continued to attend all-black schools. The March on Washington For the 100th anniversary of the Eman- cipation Proclamation, black leaders planned a \"March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\" The march would press for passage of President Kennedy's proposed civil rights bill, which was then being debated in Congress. In August 1963, more than 200,000 demonstrators, both black and white, converged on the nation's capital. Led by priests, rabbis, ministers, and civic leaders, they sang hymns and spirituals as they gathered near the Lincoln Memorial. As one 1 5-year-old black girl described it: There ivas this sense of hope for the fiiture — the belief that this march was the big step in the right direction. It could be heard in the voices of the people singing and seen in the way they walked. It poured out into smiles. 964 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1003,"pageContent":"At the Lincoln Memorial the marchers heard eloquent speeches, especially from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who, in a famous address, described his dream of freedom and equality for all people: / have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal' . . .And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all God's children. . .

' The leaders of the march then left to meet with Kennedy at the White House. It had been the largest and most peaceftil protest in the nation's history. The March on Washington was a great victory for the civil rights movement. It not only awakened millions to the plight of blacks living in the South but also confirmed for Congress the widespread support for Kennedy's civil rights bill. Ironically, the bill, which did not pass until afi:er Kennedy's death, was by then much stronger than the one he submitted to Congress. But progress was slow. In l')63, 9 years after the Brown decision, only one-half of one percent ot black public school children in the 1 1 former Confederate states were attending desegregated schools. Some southern communities desegregated public facilities only iifter boycotts and sit-ins. Others reftised, however, and some even used violence to intimidate nonviolent protestors. As black homes and churches were bombed, and as some demonstrators were beaten and arrested, some African Americans began to abandon the nonviolent iechnii|iKs o( Dr. King.

President Kennedy put his energy, ideas, and charisma to work. Despite his popularity, many of Kennedy's programs, such as Medicare, were blocked by Congress. In civil rights, Kennedy was ini- tially timid about alienating white south- ern Democrats, but events soon forced his hand. The President used federal courts and troops to enforce desegregation in the South. The efforts of the civil rights movement culminated in the March on Washington where 200,000 Americans gathered to demonstrate peacefully for racial harmony and justice. Checking for Understanding 1.

Total war makes no sense in our age when great powers maintain large nuclear forces It makes no sense in an age when a single nuclear weapon contains almost 10 times the explosive force delivered by all the Allied air forces in the Second World War. — John F. Kennedy Address at American University, Washington, D.C., June 10, 1963 Section Focus Kennedy entered office with Uttle first- hand experience in international affairs. Yet he had to meet such challenges as the buildup of nuclear arms, anti-United States feeling in Latin America, and insta- bility in economically developing nations in Africa and Asia. He achieved some triumphs; in other cases his inexperience led him into avoidable mistakes. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss Kennedy's responses to Soviet and international communism. • Explain the purposes of the Alliance for Progress and the Peace Corps. President Kennedy's basic aims in foreign policy were similar to those of Truman and Eisenhower. His major concern was the threat of communism, and he declared that he would not relax efforts to contain it. Yet he was more willing than his predecessors had been to reduce tensions if that could be done without sacrificing U.S. interests. He showed greater tolerance for national- ism in the developing nations and more interest in helping those nations deal with economic and social problems. Dealings with Latin America In 1959 Fidel Castro had led a move- ment to overthrow Fulgencio Batista — the corrupt dictator then ruling Cuba — and had set up a new government. Castro soon established ties with the Soviet Union and began to adopt such Marxist- influenced policies as drastic land reforms and the seizing of foreign-owned business- es. As a result of such actions, the Eisen- hower administration began to view Cuba as a threat to democracy in the Western Hemisphere. Eisenhower authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to train and arm Cuban exiles secretly for the over- throw of Castro. The CIA believed that an invasion of Cuba by these exiles would touch off a popular uprising against Castro. Kennedy's military advisers approved the project. In office less than three months, trusting the experts, Kennedy agreed that the invasion should proceed. On April 17, 1961, a force of 1,400 Cuban exiles came ashore at the Bay of Pigs on the south coast of Cuba. From the start the invasion went poorly. There was no popular uprising by the Cuban people. Within hours Castro's forces had the invaders surrounded. The failed invasion hurt the prestige of the new Kennedy administration and strengthened Castro's position in the world. It also allowed Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to pose as the defender of Latin America against United States impe- rialism. Kennedy took the blame for the disaster himself and never again trusted military experts. Curiously, his rating in American public opinion polls went up. \"The worse I do, the more popular I get,\" Kennedy observed wryly. The Castro movement, known as \"Fidelismo,\" threatened to spread to other countries in Latin America.

Kennedy announced a new economic program for Latin America — called the Alliance for Progress — that emphasized social reform and political freedom. Its purpose was to develop long-term economic growth among 19 Latin American nations, and thus make it less likely that poverty would drive these people to support communist- inspired revolutions. Over a 10-year period, the United States pledged $20 billion to help Latin American countries provide better schools, housing, and health care, as well as introduce fairer methods of taxation and redistribution of large landholdings to small farmers. Even though United States aid to Latin Ameri- ca quadrupled, the results were uneven. Communists regarded the Alliance as a front for U.S. imperialism, while wealthy Latin Americans saw it as a force for revo- lution and a threat to their property. In some countries — notably Chile, Colom- bia, Venezuela, and the Central American republics — the Alliance succeeded in promoting reform. In others, however, much of the money was diverted for the benefit of the military and the wealthy. On October 22, 1962, President Kennedy went on television and made a chilling announcement. U-2 planes from the United States had taken photographs proving that the Soviet Union had placed long-range missiles on Cuba. These mis- siles, carrying nuclear weapons, posed a direct threat to the United States. Kennedy ordered a naval blockade to keep the Soviets from delivering any more mis- siles, and he demanded that the Soviets dismantle all their missile sites in Cuba. As Soviet ships approached, war seemed imminent. Secretly, the Soviet Union offered to remove the missiles if the United States wotild promise never to invade Cuba. As the negotiations continued, Khrushchev added another demand: that the United States remove its own missiles from the Soviet border of Turkey. President Kennedy rejected this demand because it would weaken the NATO alliance. The President's brother.

After five agonizing days, when the world appeared on the brink of nuclear disaster, the Soviet ships turned back from the blockade. Soviet missiles were with- drawn from Cuba.

The Peace Corps Another program to help developing nations fight poverty and disease was the Peace Corps. When he established the Peace Corps in 1961, Kennedy declared: Our own freedom, and the future of freedom around the world, depend. . . on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can lii>e in dignity, liberated from the bonds of hunger, ignorance, and poverty. The Corps was made up of volunteers from the United States who wanted to help people in developing nations. After a period of rigorous training.

A high proportion of volunteers taught Enghsh and practical skills. In return they received only a living wage and a small vacation allowance. By late 1963 there were 11,000 Peace Corps volunteers serving in 40 countries. Peace Corps volunteers in economi- cally developing nations of Africa, Asia, and Latin America witnessed firsthand the problems and potential of newly indepen- dent nations that often lacked the neces- sary institutions to make the transition from colonial status to political and eco- nomic independence. By 1961, 27 newly independent nations had been formed from European colonies in Africa. When boundary lines of the colonies were established by Europeans in the 1800s and early 1900s, ethnic and cultural organizations were not taken into account. Even decades later, it was difficult obtaining loyalty to the new nation-state. In 1961 ethnic rivalries in the Congo, later renamed Zaire, broke out into civil war. When the mineral-rich province ol Katanga attempted to secede because of tribal and regional differences, two Con- golese leaders called for Soviet military aid. The United States, however, backed the efforts of the United Nations to arrange for a cease-fire. In 1963, after intervention by U.N. troops, the Congo was reunited. Other attempts at super- power intervention were generally rebut- ted as most Alrican nations developed a policy of nonalignment. Challenges from the Soviet Union Although holding to the containment policy, Kennedy sought means of relieving the tensions ot the cold war. In his inau- gural address he had said, \"Let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate.\" In June 1961, he met with Khrushchev in the Austrian capital, Vien- na. The two men treated each other with wary politeness, but they could find no area of agreement. Khrushchev may have thought that he could intimidate Kennedy who had recently been embar- rassed by the Bay of Pigs disaster. The Russian leader handed Kennedy a near- ultimatum on East Germany and Berlin. He insisted that the Western powers rec- ognize the German puppet state and that the tour-power occupation of Berlin, which was completely surrounded by East Germany, come to an end. When the President refused, the Communist answer was to build a wall through Berlin, block- ing free movement between their section ol Berlin and the rest ol the city. This weakened the economy of West Berlin, Linking Across Time Containment With minor alterations. Presi- dents since 1947 have followed a similar policy toward the Soviet Union — contain- ment. This policy was suggested by George Kennan, an American diplomat and Soviet authority. He proposed that the United States aggressively block Soviet expansion, but strive to avoid a third world war, until the Soviet system mellowed or was altered. The demise of communism in Eastern Europe in 1988 and 1989 has proven the wisdom of this policy.

The wall also prevented the flight of refugees seeking to escape the oppression of East Germany. Those attempting to escape were shot down by East German police. In June 1963, Kennedy visited West Berlin. A vast, cheering crowd gathered to hear him at the city hall. The President told them: Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect, but we have never had to put up a wall to keep our people in All free men, ivhere- ever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and therefore, as a free man I take pride in the words, \"Ich bin ein [I am a] Berliner.\" The Berlin Wall stood for nearly 30 years as a menacing symbol of the cold war division between East and West. In 1961 the Soviet Union broke a three- year moratorium on testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. The Soviets exploded more than 40 bombs, one with 3,000 times the power of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Kennedy attempted Examining Photographs While visiting Germany in 1963. President Kennedy told Berliners that all free people were citizens of their city What did the Berlin Wall symbolize? to persuade the Soviets to ban above- ground testing, because nuclear fallout pollutes the atmosphere of the whole world. But the Soviets would not agree to a method of inspection satisfactory to Americans. Not wanting the Soviet Union to gain nuclear superiority, the United States also resumed testing. In 1963, after the Cuban missile crisis, both sides agreed that they must do some- thing to reduce the risk of war. President Kennedy called on the Soviet Union to work with him toward world peace. It was not necessary for each side to \"love his neighbor,\" Kennedy said, only that they tolerate each other and live together peacefiiUy. The inspection issue became less impor- tant as other means were found to moni- tor nuclear explosions from outside the Soviet Union. Consequently the United States gave up its demands for on-site inspection. In August 1963, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain signed a test-ban treaty that pro- hibited atomic tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and underwater. The treaty, however, did not ban underground testing or reduce the total number of nuclear weapons. In September 1963, the Senate ratified the treaty by a vote of 80 to 19. Trouble in Southeast Asia During the Kennedy years, the Soviet Union lent its support to \"wars of nation- al liberation\" in many economically deve- loping nations. Truman and Eisenhower had countered by providing military aid and training troops for the established governments. When Kennedy took office in 1961, the Southeast Asian nation of Laos was in danger of falling to commu- nist guerrilla forces. The CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff pressed for a strong delense of Laos, even the use of nuclear weapons. Kennedy, on the other hand, believed a diplomatic solution could be found. In the end Kennedy avoided war by striking a compromise with Khrushchev — first by agreeing to a cease- fire and then by establishing a neutral government.

Laos, was signed in Geneva in 1962. The Geneva agreement, however, did not resolve the situation and fighting between the Laos government and the guerriHa forces soon resumed. Kennedy also inherited the problem ot Vietnam, a former French colony in Southeast Asia, from previous administra- tions. In 1954 the country had been divid- ed into North Vietnam, controlled by the communist government ot Ho Chi Minh, and South Vietnam, controlled by a non- communist government supported first by France and then by the United States. In the late 1950s the Vietcong — communist- trained guerrillas — began fighting to over- throw the U.S. backed government of Ngo Dinh Diem and to reunite South Vietnam with the Nonh. Both Eisenhower and Kennedy responded by sending military aid and advisers to South Vietnam. By late 1963 Kennedy had increased the mmiber of advisers to 16,000. Kennedy's Vietnam policy was compli- cated because Diem was a corrupt and unpopular dictator, a French-edticated, upper-middle class (Catholic who ruled a l.irgelv Btidilhist coimtry. Middle- .iinl lower-class Buddhists distrusted both Diem and the West. In his efforts to remain in power, Diem took increasingly harsh and undemocratic measures. Bud- dhists began to organize, putting out English-language newspapers and gaining television coverage of the Diem regime's abuses. Some Buddhist monks took the extreme step of setting themselves on fire, becoming martyrs as they dramatically expressed their protests. President Kennedy warned Diem that he was losing control of the country. But Diem made no attempts at reform and finally, in November 1963, possibly with the knowledge of Kennedy officials. Diem was murdered by his own military staff. By the end of 1963, 160 American advi- sors had died in Vietnam. Tragedy in Dallas John F. Kennedy's years in office came to a sudden end on November 22, 1963, when he was assassinated while visiting Dallas, Texas. The sense of tragedy and grief that many felt was caught by a conversation between the newspaper columnist Mary McGrory and Daniel Moynihan, a member of Kennedy's staff In response to McGrory's remark that \"we'll never laugh again,\" Moynihan replied, \"Heavens, Mary, we'll laugh again. It's just that we'll never be voung again. \" It was this feeling of youth snuffed otit, of promise unfulfilled, that made Kennedy's death seem peculiarly tragic to many. I he country and the world were deeply shocked and saddened at this loss. Ameri- cans everwhere grieved over the Presi- dent's death. In Italy, people brought flowers to the gates of the American embassy in Rome. In India, crowds wept in the street of New Delhi.

None of those theories have gained wide accep- tance, however. Kennedy was succeeded in office by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson took the oath of office on the plane that carried Kennedy's body from Dallas back to Washington, D.C. From Kennedy, Johnson inherited both unsolved problems and unfulfilled promises. A major foreign policy challenge was Vietnam. Kennedy's inten- tions for further involvement there were unclear; Johnson, in any case, had to make his own decisions about that trou- bled area. In domestic policy, Kennedy's New Frontier program was stalled in Congress. Yet, only two years after his death, most of these programs became law. The public reaction to the young president's tragic death, combined with the political skills of Lyndon Johnson, made possible sweeping social reform. » Section Three Revie-w « Summary In foreign policy Kennedy hoped to reduce cold-war tensions while helping developing nations. In Cuba the Bay of Pigs invasion and the missile crisis kept relationships tense. Elsewhere in Latin America, the Alliance for Progress had mixed results. The Peace Corps, a self- help development program, sent volun- teers around the world. Meanwhile, relations with the Soviet Union were strained over Berlin. When Kennedy refused to negotiate on Soviet demands, the Communists built a wall dividing the city. Kennedy and Khrushchev did agree however, to a nuclear test-ban treaty.

Robert Rauschenberg mastered the technique of collage, a two-dimensional art form using a variety ot images. Rauschenberg came into prominence in the mid-1950s when he began to incorporate pieces of discarded cloth, wood, crumpled printed materials, and other manufactured objects, such as tin cans or bottles onto his can- vases. He referred to these works as \"combine paintings.\" The bold drips and splatters of Rauschcnbergs brushwork, as well as his use ot geometric shapes and colors, reflect his debt to abstract expressionism, an artistic move- ment that came into vogue after World War II. Yet his works also point to the emergence of pop art in the 1960s, an artistic style that used commonplace subject matter Irom popular culture.

From the Montgomery boycott emerged a leader of the civil rights movement, Martin Luther King, Jr., who advocated nonviolent resistance to unjust laws. President Eisenhower sent federal troops to Litde Rock, Arkansas, to protect black students. In 1960 President Kennedy's vitality and charisma captivated Americans. In civil rights, events in the South forced him to send federal marshals to protect Freedom Riders and demonstrators. The March on Washington in 1963 demonstrated the growing and continuing power of this movement. Kennedy also made his mark on foreign policy. The Peace Corps sent American volunteers around the world to help the peoples of developing nations. But the cold war continued. After evidence surfaced that the Soviets were building missile sites in Cuba, Kennedy blockaded Cuba and negotiated with the Soviets to have the sites dismantled. In Berlin, the Communists built a wall dividing the city after Kennedy refused to withdraw.

Sharing the same goals as Kennedy, Johnson carried into legislation the former President's war on poverty and based his foreign policy on cold-war containment. As a tormer Senate leader, Johnson conceived and skillfully guided through Congress more significant domestic legislation than had been passed since the New Deal. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain how Johnson's belief in consensus helped him win the 1964 election. • Discuss Johnson's efforts to fight poverty. Aided by the Kennedy cabinet and relying on his long experi- ence in government, Lyndon Johnson quickly made the transition hom Vice President to Presi- dent. Five days after John F. Kennedy's assassination, on November 27, 1963, Johnson appeared before a joint session of Congress. His words assured the nation's representatives that he intended to carry out Kennedy's programs: ...the ideas and ideals which [Kennedy] so nobly represented must and will be translated into effective action. John Kennedys death commands what his life conveyed — that America must move forward. Elected to the House of Representatives in 1937 and the Senate in 1948, Johnson was at home in Congress. During the 1950s he was the powerful Democratic Majority Leader of the Senate. Although a southerner, Johnson had taken a moderate position on most issues and had been a leader in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1957. As President, Johnson continued his effective policy of working through con- sensus, or general agreement. With skilled bargaining, compromising, and even verbal arm-twisting, Johnson reinforced his favorite Biblical quotation, \"Come let us reason together.\" He took over the responsi- bilities of the chief executive with firmness and strength, determined to pursue the Democratic party's goals of social justice. Civil Rights National remorse over the assassination of President Kennedy assured passage of a civil rights bill. Johnson appealed for speedy action: No memorial. . . could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long. 978 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1017,"pageContent":"Connections H STORY Black Churches and the Civil Rights Movement African Americans in the South had long heard the message ot the Christian scriptures that God is on the side of the oppressed.

A number of leaders of the civil rights movement and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference were ministers. Some of them were arrested for taking part in demonstrations. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., himself was arrested repeatedly for demonstrating in Birming- ham. When a group of Birmingham ministers criticized King for being an \"outside agitator\" he wrote from jail: \"...just as the apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco- Roman worlti, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own hometown.\" Making The Religion Connection 1 .

The strongest civil rights act since Reconstruction stated that all citizens should have equal access to such public facilities as parks and libraries and to such private businesses serving the pub- lic, as restaurants and theaters. It forbade discrimination in education and strengthened the right to vote. It also outlawed job discrimination because of race, sex, religion, or national origin. A few months after the act was signed into law, the Justice Department reported that southern states were generally com- plying with its terms.

Known as \"the Great Society, \" Johnson's domestic program was an effort to expand upon Kennedy's ideas as well as to make a contribution of his own.

He then led a strike against grape growers. The strike drew national attention as Chavez bor- rowed tactics from the civil rights movement — marches and a 25-day fast. Yet the growers would not settle. The tide began to turn in 1968 when Chavez asked Americans to boycott grapes. Growers' profits tumbled as consumers sided with the workers. The strike lasted until 1 970, when the growers finally agreed to settle. ran a determined, uncompromising cam- paign. His opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 turned away black voters. His coolness to Social Security made older people fearful. His support of the open shop hurt him with organized labor. Above all, Goldwater's suggestion that military commanders should be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not to use nuclear weapons made many people nervous. As predicted, Johnson's wide appeal won him more than 60 percent of the popular vote. Goldwater carried only his home state of Arizona and 5 southern states, where former \"Dixiecrats\" switched to the Republican parry. The Great Societ\\' had won an overwhelming mandate. War on Poverty In the mid-1960s the United States had the highest standard of living in the world. But behind the Great Society pro- gram was a new awareness that many Americans did not share in the general prosperity. Contributing to this awareness was a book by Michael Harrington enti- tled The Other America, published in 1962. In response to economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who wrote in The Affluent Society that only \"pockets\" of poverty remained, Harrington claimed that as many as 40 million Americans — one-fourth of the population — were poor. He charged: The United States contains an underdeveloped nation, a culture poverty. Its inhabitants do not suffer the extreme poverty of the peasants of Asia. . .yet the mechanism of the misery is siniiLzr. They are beyond history, beyond progress, sunk in a paralyzing, maiming routine. The public knew little of the great mass of human miserv', said Harrington.

Automation had done away with the jobs ol many workers, and small farmers could no longer com- pete with agribusiness. Further, pensions and Social Security did not adequately cover medical expenses for older citizens. Johnson annoimced his strategy in his first State of the Union Address on Jan- uary 8, 1964: \"This administration... ileclares unconditional war on poverty in America.\" A new Office of Economic Opportunity (OI'.O) aimed its billion- dollar budgei at illueracy, luiemploymeiu, and disease.

Ihe Great Society's War on Poverty extended federal influence into areas that had traditionally been handled by local governments, private enterprise, or religious groups. In some cases GEO was granted power to overrule local governments. The emphasis was not simply on relief but on helping poor people help them- selves. For example, community action programs taught people to organize protests and put pressure on landlords, employers, and even govermnent agencies to effect change. After nearly 20 years of opposition by those who believed th.it the government should stay out of health care. Congress passed the Medicare Act.

To many thousands of immigrants, the United States already represented a \"great society \" — a land of opportunit)' and free- dom. The doors of this great society had opened wide to immigrants from north- western Europe and nearly closed to oth- ers, because of a quota system established in 1924. Out of 157,000 immigrants admitted each year. Great Britain and Ire- land were allotted 83,000; India, with a population of 450 million, and Andorra, with a population ol 6,400, each were allotted 100. Presidents Truman, Eisen- hower, and Kennedy had been unable to persuade Congress to change this system. Standing beneath the Statue of Liberty, which welcomed immigrants to the coim- try, Johnson signed the Immigration Act of 1965. The law replaced national quotas with global quotas and favored those with special skills. As a result, immigration to the United States from Asia and Latin America increased sharply.

It set aside a New York, state law reqtiiring voters to be able to read English, enabling such groups as Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans to vote. Under Johnsons leadership Congress passed a great number ol other important laws in a few months. \"We did reach con- sensus,\" he concluded. \"I think we did con- vince the vast majority ol Americans that the time tor procrastinating had passed.\" His programs were well-received in part because people saw benefits tor them- selves. Some businesspeople, for example, benefited from the War on Poverty because of the increased purchasing power of poor people. Johnson's program also included subsidies to farmers. Great Society programs required large sums of money. Federal spending for social purposes rose from $54 billion in 1964 to $98 billion in 1968. By 1967 American involvement in the Vietnam war was costing more than $20 billion a year. Federal budget problems and nation- al inflation made Great Society spending an issue for debate. At first, Johnson tried to finance the war with taxes, explaining that the nation could afford both guns and butter. New social programs and rising war costs made the federal deficits climb lo $28 billion by 1968. The President realized that without .ukliiional taxes, either social or military programs woiiltl h.ive to be cut. He asked ('ongiess for a tax increase.

[ ISK Section One Review Summary After the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Americans found President Johnson's strong leadership reassuring. Johnson used his political skills to form a consensus and to continue the domestic programs begun by Kennedy. Johnson's first achievement was passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. After his election in 1964, Johnson set to work implementing his concept of the Great Societ)' — a blueprint for the elimination of poverty and discrimination in America. Great Society programs offered training and opportunities to advance in American society. To end discrimination, Johnson backed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Checking for Understanding 1.

The balance of power is still on the side of freedom. We are still the keystone in the arch of freedom, and I think we will continue to do as we have done in our past, our duty. — John F. Kennedy In a speech to the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, 1963 Section Focus In his deahngs with other countries, President Johnson relied on the advice of Kennedy's foreign poHcy advisers. He continued to honor the commitments of Eisenhower and Kennedy to South Viet- nam, but the lack of success in a limited war in Vietnam soon divided the nation. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain how the Gulf of Tonkin inci- dent led to the escalation of the war in Vietnam. • List reasons for opposition to the war. During the 1964 campaign Johnson ran as the candidate of peace and restraint. \"We seek no wider war,\" he repeat- edly promised. \"We don't want our Amer- ican boys to do the fighting for Asian boys. \" At the same time, he did not want to appear weak or to allow a communist victory in Vietnam. As the military situation in Vietnam con- tinued to deteriorate, the war dominated the foreign policy of the administration. When Johnson entered the White House, South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem had just been assassinated. Within three months, another revolution took place in South Vietnam. This was followed by a series of governments, as one military faction after another gained power in South Vietnam. The President faced disagreeable choices. He could admit defeat and pull out. If the \"domino theory\" was correct, the rest of Southeast Asia would fall to the Commu- nists. He could continue limited support of South Vietnam's government, but the instability of that government would probably mean eventual defeat. Finally, he could actively enter the war and attack North Vietnam. This would mean the loss of lives and vast expense and also the possibility of war with The People's Republic of China. By the summer of 1964 Johnson began to move cautiously toward the third alternative. In secrecy the United States began limited bombing of positions held by the Vietcong, or South Vietnamese communist guerrillas, and supported limited commando raids on North Viet- nam's coast. Escalation Johnson reported that North Viet- namese torpedo boats fired on two Ameri- can destroyers in the Gull ol Tonkin on August 2 and 4, 1964. Calling these attacks unprovoked, he asked Congress for authorization to bomb North Viet- nam. On August 7 the Senate and House quickly passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolu- tion, authorizing the President to \"take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force\" to prevent further aggres- sion. In effect. Congress, with only two dissenting votes, handed its war powers over to the President. But Johnson had kept important infor- mation from Congress. The two Ameri- can destroyers had been assisting the South Vietnamese military in conducting electronic spying on North Vietnam. It was unclear whether both ships had been attacked. Furthermore, Johnson did not 984 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1023,"pageContent":"reveal that a draft of the resolution had been prepared three months before the attack, in case such an event occurred. President Johnson regarded the Gulf oi Tonkin Resolution as a blanket approval of the war effort from Congress. At the suggestion ot his military advisers, he ordered the bombing of bases in North Vietnam. Until August 1964, the fighting in South Vietnam had been between South Vietnamese government troops and the Vietcong. After the Gulf of Tonkin incident, however, North Vietnam began sending its own troops to fight in the South. As the United States expanded its role, the civil war grew into a major conflict between American and commu- nist forces. In February 1965, after the Vietcong attacked an American base in South Vietnam, Johnson ordered an escalation, or military expansion, of the war. He ordered American planes to begin bomb- ing targets in North Vietnam, and in April 1965, made the fateful decision that American ground forces should engage in combat. In the Vietnam War the United States faced a far more difficult situation than it had in Korea. In Korea the United States fought as an agent of the United Nations, with widespread support from noncom- munist countries. Now the United States stood almost alone in its military support of South Vietnam's government, and much of world opinion was hostile to American policy in Vietnam. The South Vietnamese Communists had strong support in rural areas and military aid from North Vietnam. Most noncommu- nist South Vietnamese were indifferent or opposed to their government, no matter what group happened to be in power. Military operations turned into a \"dirty, ruthless, wandering war\" without a baiile- hont. The Vietcong guerrillas used hit-and-run tactics. Not as well equipped as the Americans, the Vietcong and North Vietnamese used ambushes, boobytraps, and small-scale attacks. They moved swiftly by night and by day hid in the jun- gles or in friendly villages. Using terrorism against civilians, the Vietcong controlled much of the countryside. To counter such tactics, American troops adopted a \"search- and-destroy\" strategy. American forces tried to search out enemy troops, bomb their positions, destroy their supply lines, and force them out into the open for combat. By 1966 American planes had dropped nearly the same tonnage of bombs in Viet- nam as had been dropped in the Pacific in World War II. Napalm, a jellied gasoline that explodes and splatters, clinging to whatever it touches, was sprayed from planes. In order to improve visibility, Amer- ican planes sprayed chemical defoliants — Agent Orange for example — that stripped leaves from trees and shrubs, turning farm- land and forest into wasteland. American troops burned villages believed to be hiding communist supporters. Examining Maps Throughout the war United States troops and the government of South Vietnam con- trolled the major cities.

By how much did American casualties In Vietnam increase between 1966 and 1968? Resistance to Peace Johnson's military advisers greatly underestimated the will and ability of the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese to keep fighting. The United States poured increasing numbers of troops into Viet- nam. At the height of the war, more than 500,000 American soldiers were in Viet- nam. The number of American dead rose from 5,008 for 1966 to 9,377 for 1967 and 14,589 for 1968. Once the United States had escalated the fighting, there seemed to be no way of leaving without damaging its international prestige. North Vietnam's leader. Ho Chi Minh, kept his forces in battle despite the massive bombing of his country, believing that North Vietnam could simply outlast the United States in the war. With neither side willing to compro- mise, all peace attempts failed. In April 1965, Johnson offered to hold \"uncondi- tional discussions\" with North Vietnam. He also promised a billion-dollar program to help rebuild South Vietnam. The American plan did not provide for Viet- cong participation in the South Viet- namese government. North Vietnam put forward its own plan that was unsatisfac- tory to the United States. Between 1965 and 1967, American officials estimated that some 2,000 attempts were made to open direct negotiations, all unsuccessful. Other nations, including Great Britain, Poland, and the Soviet Union, offered plans to negotiate between the two sides. None succeeded. Dominican Intervention While Vietnam dominated Johnsons international concerns, in April 1965 the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean captured his attention. Rebels were trying to overthrow the rightist military govern- ment that controlled the island country. Fearing that the rebels were controlled by Communists, Johnson ordered 20,000 marines to the Dominican Republic. This was the first time the United States had openly sent troops to the Caribbean since 1926.' Many Latin Americans criticized this military action. They charged that fear of a communist takeover, similar to that of Cuba by Fidel Castro, was leading the United States to support reactionary gov- ernments whose oppressive policies drove people to revolt. Johnson answered these critics by describing the Dominican revo- lution as a violent action in which \"some 1,500 innocent people were murdered and shot. . . .\" Senator J. William Fulbright, head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, concluded that the President had overre- acted in sending troops.

Black Revolution Stokely Carmichael, head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) who later changed his name to Kwame Ture, introduced the slogan \"black power.\" He and Charles Hamilton described the concept in the book Black Power: the Politics of Liberation in America: It is a call for black people in this country to unite, to recognize their heritage, to build [a] sense of community. It is a call for black people to define their own goals, to lead their own organizations. It is a call to reject the racist institutions and values of this society. Black power expressed itself in political action, but the deeper meaning of black power had to do with pride and leadership. Many members and leaders of the civil rights movement had been white liberals. Now groups like SNCC and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) moved whites out of leadership positions. African Ameri- cans began to reexamine their African her- itage. Some took African names or wore \"Afro\" haircuts and African-style clothing. They demanded that schools adopt pro- grams in African-American studies. While some black leaders were leaning toward separatist!!. Dr. King and other civil rights leaders argued that to succeed, the black minority must continue to work with the white n!aiority. But I^r.

Where were most of the riots of 1967? Northern bhick populations tended to be concentrated in the inner cities, where poverty was widespread and discontent was high. Frustration over conditions led to a series of riots in many cities. Often occur- ring in the heat of summer, these riots were sometimes triggered by an incident between police and black citizens. When riots erupted, looting and burning some- times broke out. The first major riot took place in the Harlem section of New York City in July 1964. Other riots broke out that year in Philadelphia and Chicago. In August 1965, a riot in the black neighborhood ol Watts in Los Angeles left 34 people dead, more than 3,000 arrested, and $20 mil- lion in property damaged. The summer ol 1966 brought new disruptions in New York, Atlanta, Cleveland, Detroit, Chica- go, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Fed- eral troops and National Guardsmen entered Detroit in July 1967, after much of the city was in flames. WTien the riot was over, 40 people had been killed and hundreds more were injured. Thousands were left homeless, and many businesses were in ashes. Most ol the riots took place outside the South, in parts ol the country where African Americans supposedly enjoyed equal rights. Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., a black member of Congress from New York City, offered an explanation. In the South, he said, what blacks wanted was relatively easy for whites to give: the right to sit at a drugstore counter or in the front of a bus. In the North blacks had long been able to sit where they pleased. Now they wanted \"a bigger piece of the pie\" — better jobs, more money, better places to live. Some white jobholders and property owners felt threatened. The President appointed a National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (the Kerner Commission) to look into the problem. The Kerner Commission laid responsibility for the ghettoes at the feet of white society: White racism is essentially responsible for the explosive mixture which has been accumulating in our cities since the end of World War II.... white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions maintained it, and white society condones it. Although African Americans suffered greater loss of lite and property, the riots tended to harden white prejudices. The urgently requested commission report was quietly received and produced little change. Student Protests Much of the antiwar protests focused on the draft. While in 1966 alone 1.8 million students received deferments, reports showed unfair practices. A person with a limited education from a low- income family was far more likely to be sent to fight in Vietnam than someone with a good education Irom an upper- income family, and black soldiers made up a disproportionately large number of American soldiers fighting overseas. As the war escalated, draft calls were sharply increased. With the increase in draft calls, more high school students 990 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1029,"pageContent":"Examining Photographs Young people often led war protests, because their lives were most likely to be affected by tfie war How did some demonstrate their defi- ance of government? began to worry about their futures. Many of those facing the drah were uncertain why the war was being tought at all. They were deeply concerned by nightly televi- sion reports of the war's brutaliry and the growing list of American casualties. In addition to student deferments, there were 171,000 conscientious objectors, or those who refused to fight or carry arms in battle for moral or religious reasons. An estimated 500,000 young men openly avoided the draft. Most of them simply did not report when called for induction. Others fled to Canada, Sweden, and other countries. About 3,000 young men went to prison rather than fight in a war they opposed. Some antiwar protesters used tactics of civil disobedience and mass demonstra- tions that they had learned from the civil rights movement. Outside the White House, protesters chanted, \"Hey! Hey! I.BJ! How many kids did you kill today?\" Some burned their drah cards to demon- strate their defiance of government poli- cies. Many college students proiested against military recruitment and training on campuses. They objected to the uni- versities' cooperation in research projects with and stock ownership in corporations involved in military ilelense.

Young people's lifestyles ran the gamut from the conventional to the bizarre. The weddings of the time mirrored this diversity. Many young people regarded the counter- culture of the hippies with disdain and mod- eled their celebrations afier their parents' tastes — complete with morning coats, frdl- length gowns, and pic- tures of the couple in the society section of the local newspaper. Hip- pies, on the other hand, might wear Nehru jackets and jea>is to their ceremonies in the park.

At the University of California at Berkeley, students demonstrated against the vast, impersonal, bureaucratic nature of the modern university. Many alienated youths rebelled against social pressures for personal achievement, material gain, and conformity. Instead they searched tor meaning in various philosophies and religions. Some experimented with hallu- cinogenic drugs — those that induce hallucinations — attempting to achieve expanded awareness. They proclaimed their freedom of expression and individu- ality by long hair and unconventional clothing. A popular slogan taken from ever-present computer cards summed up their determination not to be caught up in the lockstep of society: \"I am a Human Being; do not fold, spindle or mutilate.\" In their rejection of their parents' val- ues, the \"hippies,\" or \"flower children\" as they were frequently called, were said to have established a counterculture — with values and practices that conflicted with established society. For many, their partic- ipation in the counterculture was reflected primarily in their choice of clothing and music; others left family and comfortable homes to live in communes — communi- ties in which living quarters, food, and work were shared. The counterculture was symbolized in an outdoor rock concert, the Woodstock festival, held in August 1969. More than 400,000 people attended what Time Magazine called \"history's biggest hap- pening.\" Time went on to say \"it may well rank as one of the significant politi- cal and sociological events of the age. \" Examining Photographs A three-day rock music festival at Woodstoci<.

A growing number of Americans had also become angry over demonstrations, riots, soaring crime rates, welfare costs, inflation, and a war that seemed to be going nowhere. The sight of long-haired draft protesters outraged many Americans who did not hesitate to support their government in time of war. Many working-class Americans were offended by the actions of students they considered privileged. The deep anger these Americans felt soon developed into a backlash against the Great Society and the civil rights and antiwar movements. Some white Americans believed that the civil rights movement had gone \"too far.\" A number of homeowners feared that integration in their neighborhoods would decrease property values and lead to black domination there. Middle-income fami- lies often resented paying higher taxes to support antipoverry programs. Many fam- ilies opposed the busing of their children away from neighborhood schools in order to achieve court-ordered racial balance in the classroom. The political leader who gained most from the conservative backlash was Governor George Wallace of Alabama. Wallace had boosted his political career defending racial segregation. In the late 1960s Wallace built a national following on a program dedicated to ending school busing and restoring \"law and order.\" Using these themes Wallace launched an independent presidential campaign in the election of 1968. The impressive popular support for Wallace was another sign that President Johnson's national consensus had fallen apart. liWiWiWiWiWiWil ?»!

Increasingly, black leaders stressed a more militant stance that emphasized black pride, leadership, and African heritage. Tensions erupted in a series of riots throughout large American cities. Protests also broke out on college campuses, mainly over the war in Viet- nam. A counterculture sprang up that encouraged alternative lifestyles.

Western Europeans demonstrated against America's actions in Vietnam. When the North Koreans seized an American naval vessel, the Pueblo, in January 1968, it marked the beginning of a year of disasters. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • List four major disasters of 1968. • Explain why the Tet offensive was the turning point in the Vietnam War. Israel won an impressive victory over three Arab nations in 1967. The fact that the United States provided Israel with continued support added signif- icantly to cold-war differences with the Soviet Union. The speed of Israel's victory prevented a clash between the major pow- ers. Nevertheless the Soviets continued to back and to arm Arab nations. Later in 1967 President Johnson met with Soviet Premier Aleksei Kosygin at Glassboro, New Jersey. They discussed their nations' views, but no end to the cold war seemed in sight. In January 1968, North Korea captured the American naval vessel Pueblo and forced its captain to confess that his ship had been spying on North Korea. The United States seemed helpless to win release of the ship's crew. This event was just the first in a series of disasters that plagued the United States in 1968. Tet and Retreat At the end of 1967, General William Westmoreland, American commander in Vietnam, had assured the country that the end of that war was in sight. Vastly enlarged American forces expanded the \"search-and-destroy\" missions. American bombers destroyed North Vietnamese factories, roads, bridges, and cities. Secre- tary of State Dean Rusk said the enemy \"was hurting verv' badly.\" January 30, 1968, marked a turning point in the war. The supposedly exhausted communist guerrillas abruptly launched major offensive strikes. Early that morning a handful of Vietcong sol- diers attacked the United States embassy compound in Saigon — the very center of the American presence in South Vietnam. Together, the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese then launched massive attacks on all American bases in South Vietnam and on most of South Vietnam's major cities and provincial capitals. Taken by surprise by the assault during the celebration of Tet, the Vietnamese lunar New Year, Americans and South Vietnamese sustained heavy losses. After fierce fighting, they finally drove back the communist offensive. Militarily, the communists were defeated. Politically, however, they scored a victory. The American people were shocked that 994 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1033,"pageContent":"the enemy that was supposedly on the verge ot defeat could launch such a large- scale attack. Television coverage of the attack and the destruction that followed shook the nation's confidence. When General Westmoreland requested an addi- tional 209,000 troops tor Vietnam — in addition to the 500,000 already there — it seemed like another admission that the United States could not win the war. After Tec, one oi the nation's most trust- ed television news broadcasters, Walter Cronkite, reported: We have too often been disappointed by the optimism of the American leaders to have faith any longer in the silver linings To say that we are closer to victory today is to believe, in the face of evidence, the optimists who have been wrong in the past. To suggest we are on the edge of defeat is to yield to unreasonable pessimism. To say that we are mired in stalemate seems the only realistic, yet unsatisfactory conclusion. Hearing Cronkites broadcast. President Johnson turned to his aides and said, \"Its all over.\" He recognized that he had lost the battle for public opinion. Indeed, public opinion polls now showed that the majority of Americans had turned against the President's han- dling of the war. Johnson had become so unpopular that he seldom appeared in public, tor fear ot hostile crowds. Political- ly, the nation became even further divided between \"hawks\" and \"doves. \" The war had driven a wedge between the President and Congress, and it also had divided the Democratic party- In November 1967, a little-known lili- eral senator from Minnesota, Eugene McCarthy, became the first \"dove' to announce his candidacy against Johnson for the election in 1968. Initially, few peo- ple gave McC'arthy much of a chance. Rut soon thousands of student vohmieers went to work for his campaign. In the New Hampshire primary election in March 1968, with the slogan \"Clean for Gene, \" students shaved their beards, cut their hair, wore conservative clothing, and campaigned door-to-door. McCarthy \"shook every corner of the political land- scape\" by a near victory, winning more than 40 percent of the votes in this prim- ary, which Johnson narrowly won. Four days later Senator Robert Kennedy, who also opposed the war, entered the presi- dential race. At first Johnson had seemed ready to run for reelection. He called on the peo- ple to join him in a \"total national effort to win the war, to win the peace, and to complete the job that must be done here at home.\" Polls, however, showed that many Americans no longer trusted his leadership. On March 31, 1968, two weeks after Senator Kennedy announced his candida- cy, a tired-looking Lyndon Johnson appeared on television and announced that he would halt nearly all bombing of North Vietnam. He offered to send spe- cial negotiators to hold peace talks with the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong. Then Johnson stunned the nation by announcing: \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party lor another term as your President.\" A few days later, on April 3, North Vietnam accepted Johnson's offer to begin peace negotiations. It would be five long years of continued bitter struggle, howev- er, before the United States left the war in Vietnam behind.

King was planning a National Poor Peo- ple's Campaign to promote economic gains for African Americans and all poor people. There had been many threats against King's life in the past, but he had always dismissed them. King told a church meeting that night: . ..I've been to the mountain top, and I don't mind. . . . I've looked over and I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that ive as a people will get to the Promised Land. The next day, April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr., was killed by a sniper. Ironically, the murder of the great preach- er of nonviolence set off a week of rioting, arson, and looting in 125 American cities. It was as if King's death swept away the last bit of faith in a peaceful solution. \"America,\" announced Stokely Carmichael, \"must be burned down in order for us to survive.\" Rioting took place in Washington, D.C., just blocks from the White House. President Johnson ordered troops to enforce a curfew and protect government buildings. Close on the heels of this assassination came another — that of Senator Robert Kennedy in June 1968. With Johnson withdrawn from the presidential race, it appeared that Kennedy was pulling out in front of candidates Senator Eugene McCarthy and Vice President Hubert Humphrey. Kennedy's program and popularity seemed broad enough to rebuild the Democratic coalition shattered by Viet- nam. Then on June 5, 1968, just after winning victory in the Democratic prima- ry in California, Kennedy was assassinated by an Arab nationalist, angry at Kennedy for his support of Israel. Some blamed the availability of hand- guns and rifles for the violence that seemed to be tearing the United States apart and killing some of its finest leaders.

They also opposed Columbia's weapons-research programs for the government and the presence of the student military organiza- tion, Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC).

Reacting to the previous student uprisings and black riots in the cities, Chicago Mayor Daley, him- self a Democrat, advised his police to \"shoot to kill arsonists and shoot to maim looters.\" Senator Humphrey lost some support when he defended the mayor's efforts to control the riots. Inside the convention, parry members were torn by the Vietnam War issue. Finally the convention nominated Hubert Htmiphrey for President and Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine for Vice Presi- dent. But from the start Humphrey's cam- paign was undermined by the violence in the streets. The sense of chaos in the American process deepened. The Demo- cratic party itself underwent a change in leadership. The splintering of the Democratic party made the Republican candidate, Richard M. Nixon, the front-runner in the elec- tion of 1968.

With General Curtis Lemay as his running mate, Wallace attacked \"pointy headed\" intellectuals and appealed to the blue collar workers. His stands against federally enforced equal rights attracted support in the South. Leaders of orga- nized labor, however, campaigned hard for Humphrey and moved much ol the blue collar vote back to the Democrats.

In his campaign, Nixon promised to unify the nation, return dignity' to the presidency, stabilize American foreign policy, and lead a war against crime in the streets.

He also addressed the needs of people still living in poverty through government programs aimed at illiteracy, unemployment, and disease. Johnson's domestic polices were played out against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, which increas- ingly took up resources and energy. Unable to end the war quickly, the United States found itself increasingly drawn into the conflict. As more soldiers died and the war dragged on, Americans began to question the wisdom of United States interven- tion. Demonstrations against the war took place across the country. Conservatives, who believed it was the duty of Americans to support their govern- ment, reacted to these events with anger and resentment. Other unrest exploded in major cities as African Americans rioted against economic and social condi- tions. Growing opposition to the war led Johnson to abandon the race for the presidency. But Johnson's pledge to end the war was not enough to help Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic candidate, and Richard Nixon was elected in 1 968. * Using Vocabulary Each of the terms below has significance for the presidency of Lyndon Johnson.

Where would you obtain the information you need to begin writing? One basic ingredient needed to prepare an accurate report is sup- porting evidence from reliable source} — books, docu- ments, or other records that supply dependable information. Because not all sources are reliable, when you research a topic you must determine the worth of your sources. The following guidelines will help you to determine the reliability of your source: • Evaluate the writers of the source by considering whether their background qualifies them to write on the topic. • Consider the reputation of the publication or pub- lisher of the source. Is the magazine, newspaper, or periodical generally reliable? • Consult more than one source, comparing and con- trasting the information presented in each. • Ask yourself questions such as the following: Is this a primary source or a secondar)' source? Is the information supported by evidence? Is the information mostly facts (statements that can be verified) or opinions (something that someone believes or thinks is true)? Is the material objective in viewpoint? Practice Usin\" these guidelines and what vou have read in the chapter, answer the hillowing questions. l.In writing a report on a subject that is still contro- versial, such as the Vietnam War, why is it especially important to use a variet)' of sources? 2.

Vestiges of the old Richard Nixon were seen in his attempts to change the direction of the Supreme Court. Neither Nixon's new policies nor his old, however, could curb the problems of inflation and high unem- ployment. Obj ectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain President Richard Nixon's southern strategy. • Describe how Nixon tried to deal with the economic problems of the early 1970s. To Americans and foreigners alike, the United States in the late 1960s had lost its direc- tion. Not only was it losing the war in Vietnam, but its industries were losing their competitive edge. A sense of defeat and decay became apparent. Deep social, political, and racial divisions were threatening to tear society apart. Richard Nixon claimed that he had a \"plan to end the war in Vietnam\" and \"bring Ameri- cans together. ' His promise of peace in Vietnam and tranquility at home appealed to many in the United States. By a very narrow margin, Nixon was elected the thirty-seventh President of the United States. Nixon's Political Career Richard M. Nixon was the first Presi- dent in modern times to be elected after having lost a previous bid for the presi- dency. After losing the 1962 California gubernatorial race, his political career seemed over. In the 1968 campaign, how- ever, he changed his public image. The old Nixon had been intensely partisan and ruthless. When he had run for Congress from California in 1946, for example, he charged that his opponent had strong ties to communist organizations. The new Nixon, however, impressed observers as calm, broad-minded, and statesmanlike. He promised that his administration would be \"open to new ideas, open to men and women of both parties, open to the critics as well as those who support us.\" \"We want to bring America togeth- er,\" Nixon said. Bringing the nation together proved dif- ficult. With the Democrats in control of Congress, Nixon saw many ol his domes- tic proposals rejected. The administra- tion's failure in the domestic arena, however, was not a source of frustration lor the President because his major inter- est was foreign policy. One of Nixon's domestic successes was the new federalism, a partnership between the federal government and the state governments. The hallmark of the new federalism, Nixon declared, was that states and municipalities would assume greater responsibility for their own well- being. In a message to Congress, the Pres- ident declared: 1006 Unii' 10 Redefining America's RoLE: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1045,"pageContent":"/ reject the patronizing idea that government in Washington, D.C., is inevitably more wise and more efficient than government at the local or state level. . . . The idea that a bureaucratic elite in Washington knows what is best for people. . . is really a contention that people cannot govern themselves. Following the President's lead, Congress passed a series of revenue-sharing bills that granted federal funds to local agen- cies to use as they saw fit. Another domestic concern that Nixon addressed during the 1968 campaign was the permissive attitude toward the rights ot those accused ot crimes. Nixon criti- cized the record of the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren. He denounced Supreme Court decisions that curtailed the powers of the police in the interrogation of suspects and that forbade the use ot electronic \"bugging\" equipment for gathering evidence. Such decisions, Nixon maintained, violated \"the first civil right of every American to be free of domestic violence.\" He promised to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court with judges who would not \"weaken the peace forces as against the criminal forces.\" Nixon eventually succeeded in his cam- paign to change the liberal thrust of the Court. When Chief Justice Warren resigned shortly after Nixon took office, the President nominated Warren Burger, a respected conservative judge, to take his place. He also placed three other conserva- tive justices on the Court, inclucJing one from the South. The Burger Court, known as the Nixon Court by its critics, did not take away more rights of criminal suspects, but it did diminish the rights that had been affirmed by the Warren Court. Nixon's appointment of a southern jus- tice to the Supreme Court was only one part of a general \"southern strategy,\" to lure southern voters away from the Examining Photographs The Supreme Court favored the use of busing as a constitutional way to desegregate the nation's schools, although many Americans disagreed.

Another major part of that strategy was to reverse a Johnson adminis- tration poUcy that cut off federal funds from racially segregated school systems. Although this policy was affirmed in 1968 by the Supreme Court in Greene v. County School Board, Nixon ignored the Court's ruling and instructed the Justice Depart- ment to support school boards that were seeking to delay desegregation. Contrary to Nixon's hopes, his appoint- ments to the Supreme Court did not reverse the Green decision. Instead, the Court affirmed integration by means of busing — transporting oi children to a school outside their residential area to achieve racial balance in that school. White Americans in the South and most Life of the Times Shopping Malls A 1973 report on New Jerseys Cherry Hill Mall observed that the shopping mall had become to the suburb what main street once was to the small town — the focus of community life. The period between 1971 and 1975 was a heyday of mall con- struction. Cities and suburbs across the United States became home to enclosed mails featuring, under one roof a fairly pre- dictable airay of small specialty stores for books, gifts, and shoes. Large mails typically included major department stores as dependable \"anchors' for sales and cus- tomers, as well as several pop- ular restau- rants. Some malls also had portable bou- tique stands that sold every- thing from perfume to wicker. Mall managers were enormously successful in not only attracting shoppers, but also walkers, joggers, and vast crowds of teenagers just \"hanging out.\" Malls became such popular gathering places in the early 1970s that a high school in Bethesda, Mary- land, held its senior prom at one. Despite the carefully controlled environ- ment that malls maintain through regulated climate, piped-in music, security personnel, and squeaky cleanness, they did not escape the social upheaval of the 1970s. Several large malls became sites fot Vietnam War protests. other regions of the nation resisted bus- ing, and Nixon denounced it, saying: . . .

The Nixon administration's open opposi- tion to busing for desegregation intensi- fied public controversy over the issue not only in the South but throughout the nation. Nixon's Economic Policies The Nixon administration inherited difficult economic problems. The com- bined costs of President Johnson's War on Poverty and the Vietnam War had produced a large federal budget deficit and mounting inflation. Between 1964 and 1969, the dollar lost one-fifth of its pufchasing power. After his inauguration, Nixon announced an economic plan that was based on reducing federal spending and curtailing the supply of money. By the end of 1970, however, it was apparent that the plan was not working. Restrict- ing the supply of money drove interest rates up, and higher interest rates dis- couraged investment. Unemployment increased, and the stock market declined. The slowdown in business activity reduced federal revenues, and inflation accelerated. Meanwhile the costs of the Vietnam war mounted. The weaknesses of the economy were reflected in a growing balance of pay- ments deficit. The balance of payments is the difference between what a nation receives from foreign countties and what 1008 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1047,"pageContent":"Connections H STORY The Metric System \"...[T]he dinosaurs did not go away overnight,\" read an article in National Geographic, \"nor will the older standards.

The Metric Act of 1975 committed the United States to a transition from the U.S. Customary system of measurement to Systeme International (SI) — the metric system. The metric system is based on units often and one hundred. Thus, 100 centimeters equal 1 meter. Although many Americans believe met- ric conversion has failed, most major U.S. industries have switched, wholly or par- tially, to metrics. Companies that compete on the international market were forced to change because nearly every other industrial nation uses metrics. Domestic consimier products have been slower to adopt SI. None of the laws authorizing use of SI have provided Rmds lor public education.

Between 1970 and 1971, the nation's balance ot payments deficit jumped Irom $4 billion to $22 billion. Ihe deficit was evidence that the Unit- ed States had lost its dominance in world markets. Between 1950 and 1970, for example, the United States share of world automobile production dropped from 76 to 31 percent, and the same phenomenon was occurring in the tex- tile, shoe, and electrical equipment industries. A serious effect of the balance of pay- ments deficit was that it weakened inter- national (aith in the value of the dollar.

Ihus, (he Nixon adininisir.iiion found itself coiilronted with a recession, a dollar crisis, an expensive war in Southeast Asia and a huge trade deficit, iti which the value of imports was greater than exports. Nixon acted decisively. To cotnbat infla- tion, in August 1971, he announced a 90-day freeze on prices and wages. To discourage imports, he placed an addi- tional duty of 10 percent on all goods purchased from abroad. He also allowed the dollar to decline in value in relation to foreign currencies making it more expensive for Americans to buy goods from other countries. Therefore, goods made in the United States became cheap- er than foreign-made goods, and that promoted exports. Although Nixon's policies brought some relief, inflation, chronic unemployment, and the loss of foreign markets remained a problem throughout his presidency. The measures also caused ill will in nations that depended on American markets for their products. Another problem concerned energ)'.

The purpose of the embargo was to force the United States to stop sup- porting Israel in its struggle with the Arab states. Support for Israel did not change, but the embargo produced an energy cri- sis in 7\\merica — and near panic. In some areas the price of petroleum shot up near- ly 400 percent, and there were shortages of gasoline for cars and heating oil for homes, schools, and businesses. Although the United States had about one-sixteenth of the worlds population, Americans consumed about one-third of the world's energy. Most of this energy came from such nonrenewable resources as oil, gas, and coal. Coal reserves were abundant in America but supplied less than 20 percent of the nation's energy needs. By 1973, the United States was importing about 6 million barrels of oil each day, or about 36 percent of the oil needed to heat homes and to keep facto- ries and automobiles running. President Nixon announced a plan to make the country self-sufficient in energy by 1980. He called for higher taxes on imported oil and encouraged Americans to take conservation measures, such as lowering their thermostats. Congress passed a law requiring states to lower the speed limit on highways to 55 miles per hour to save gasoline and approved the construction of a pipeline in Alaska for the shipment of newly discovered oil to refineries. Congress provided some tax incentives to encourage energy research and put the nation on daylight saving time for two years. After the Arab nations lifted the oil embargo in March 1974, most Americans forgot about the energy crisis. However fuel prices began a steep rise as the oil shortage continued. In the 1960s the major oil-exporting nations had formed the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countrks (OPEC). By 1970 OPEC had begun to raise prices, and over the next decade the cost of oil increased from less than $2 a barrel to more than $30 a bar- rel. The increases in the price of oil by the OPEC countries contributed to the problems that plagued the American economy throughout the 1 970s. XVSS9SSSS m ittH m Section One Review iiiiiiiifimma Summary President Nixon came to the White House with the hope of bringing America together. A cornerstone of his domestic policy was a greater emphasis on local decision making and revenue sharing. To fulfill his promise of law and order, Nixon appointed conservative judges to the Supreme Court and replaced retiring Chief Justice Warren with Warren Burger. In the economy, Nixon faced tough chal- lenges to balance the federal budget and control inflation.

Explanation Vice President Spiro Agiiew addresses the media A point of view is a person's opinion; it is affected by their role, their experiences, relationships, and beliefs. Students of history should learn to identify the points of view of historical figures and groups. Interpreting points of view helps students understand why people make certain decisions or behave in certain ways. To interpret a person's point ol view ask ihc following questions; • What opinion is being expressed? • Wiiat factors may have iiidii- eiKcd the person or group to ad(>|M this opinion? Example Read the following quotation from a speech by Vice President Spiro Agnew, given in Des Moines, Iowa, in 19f,9: ...For HI ill ions of A)itcriciiiis, the network:^ arc the sole source of iiiitioiitd and world news. ...A raised eyebrow, an inflection of the voice, a caustic remark dropped in the middle of a broadcast can raise doubts in a million minds about the ueracity of a public official ...One Federal i'.oinmiDiications Commissioner considers the powers of the networks equal to that of local, state, and Federal Governments all combined. Certainly it represents a concentration of power over American public opinion unknown in history Of the men who produce and direct the net- work news, the natioji knows practically nothing The views of this fraternity do not... rep resent the vieu's of America. Applying the four questions above to this quotation, you can interpret Agnew's point of view: a) His opinion is that the networks have too much power. b)He is influenced because the networks do not show sympathy with his positions. c) He supports his view b)' citing a member of the Commission who compares the influence of the networks to the power of government. d) An alternative viewpoiiu is that the networks believe thev have a duty to express views other than official government policy.

As President he opened a dialogue with the communist leaders of China and entered into a series of agreements with the Soviet Union. Nixon even recognized the legiti- macy ot the communist regimes of Eastern Europe. Nixon's Foreign Policy Like Woodrow Wilson, President Nixon took almost sole charge of foreign policy. To help him handle foreign policy matters, Nixon appointed Henry A. Kissinger, a brilliant political scientist, as his national security adviser. Kissinger's job was to pre- sent the President with policy options in which the probable consequences of each policy were outlined. Kissinger also under- took secret missions abroad. In 1973 Nixon appointed Kissinger secretary of state. Nixon, like Wilson, wanted to be remembered as a peacemaker. In his inau- gural address he proclaimed: Afier a period of confrontation, we are entering an era of negotiation. Let all nations know that during this administration our lines of communication will be open. We seek an open world — open to ideas, open to the exchange of goods and people For Nixon, lines of communication were meant to reach friend and foe alike. To the communist leader of Romania, Nixon declared: \"We seek normal rela- tions with all countries, regardless of their domestic policies.\" Nixon proclaimed a policy ol detente, or relaxation of tensions between the United States and the com- munist bloc. He maintained that it would be a \"safer world and a better world il we have a strong, healthy United States, Europe, China, Russia, and Japan, each balancing the other.\" To achieve this balance Nixon proposed a meeting between the United States and the Soviet Union to discuss strategic arms limitations.

Since the early 1960s, a rift had devel- oped in the relationship between the com- munist governments of the Soviet Union and China, and troops of the two nations occasionally clashed along their border. Mao realized that detente with the United States could deter Soviet aggression, and Nixon believed that detente with China would encourage Brezhnev to be more accommodating. The Soviet leader would not want the United States to forge an alliance with China. War in Vietnam and the Middle East During the 1968 presidential campaign, Nixon declared that he had a plan for ending the Vietnam War. After his inau- guration he resumed peace negotiations with the North Vietnamese in Paris, but they produced no results. The President was faced with a dilem- ma: if he continued U.S. involvement in the war, public opposition would increase. If he withdrew U.S. troops without a peace agreement, he would be the first President of the United States to have ever \"lost a war.\" Like Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon did not seek that dubious distinction. To make matters worse, in June 1971, The New York Times published a secret Department of Defense study of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The Pentagon Papers, as they were called, documented that for two decades, four Presidents of the United States had escalated the nation's involvement in Indochina. Fur- thermore, despite America's increased involvement, the situation in Southeast Asia was not any closer to a resolution. The Pentagon Papers were evidence of the growing power of the executive branch. They contained details of the decisions that were made by Presidents 1014 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1053,"pageContent":"and their advisers without the consent of Congress.

President Nixon was outraged over the \"leaking\" of the secret documents. He ordered the Justice Department to go to court to stop further publication of the papers. Nixon hoped the court would affirm the government's right to restrain publication in matters of national security, but the Supreme Court decided that the Pentagon Papers were not vital to national security. The federal government then brought charges against Daniel Ellsberg, one of the authors of the Pentagon Papers, for leaking the documents to the press. Presi- dent Nixon also authorized a group of people who were called \"the Plumbers\" to break into the office of Ellsberg's psychia- trist to collect information about him. When their activities came to light, the charges against Daniel Ellsberg were dropped. President Nixon's response to the pub- lication of the Pentagon Papers was a fur- ther sign that the credibility of his administration was eroding. Nixon him- self, it was revealed, had ordered the secret bombing of North Vietnamese sanctuaries in Cambodia in 1969. In April 1970, Nixon, without consulting Congress, ordered an invasion of Cam- bodia to drive the North Vietnamese out of the country. Protests against the war now intensified. lo quiet opposition to the war, Nixon announced a policy of \"Vietnamization.\" Vietnamization consisted of two steps: the phased withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam; and their replacement by con- scripts from Vietnam. Nixon hoped that Vietnamization, combined with the satu- ration bombing of North Vietnam, would allow the United States to withdraw from the war \"with honor.\" But the New York Times called his bombing policy \"diplo- macy ihrough terror,\" and the Boston Globe commented: 1965 1966 1967 1968 THE UNITED STATES IN VIETNAM, 1950-1975 1950 May 8 President Truman sends U.S. aid and advisers to French forces in Indochina 1954 May 7 French defeated by Communists at Dien Bien Phu July 20-21 Geneva Conference provides cease-fire and divides Vietnam 1957 Vietcong begin attacl<s in South Vietnam 1960 Dec. 20 Vietcong form National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam 1961 Nov. 16 President Kennedy increases number of U.S. advisers in Vietnam 1963 Nov. 1 Ngo Dinh Diem assassinated 1964 July 24 U.S. rejects French President de Gaulle's plan to neutralize all of Indochina Aug. 2-4 Gulf of Tonkin-N.

Wfiy was it difficult to reacti a settlement? By the end of the war, the total tonnage of bombs dropped by the United States on Vietnam was more than twice that dropped by the United States on all tar- gets in both World War 11 and the Kore- an War. Finally, on January 23, 1973, represen- tatives of the United States, South Viet- nam, North Vietnam, and the Vietcong signed a cease-fire agreement, ending the military presence of the United States in Vietnam. The war, however, did not end for the people of Vietnam. Under the agreement, U.S. troops withdrew from South Vietnam, but North Vietnamese troops did not. As the Vietnam War wound down, another war erupted, this time in the Middle East. On October 6, 1973, the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, Egyptian and Syrian troops launched surprise attacks against Israeli forces. Their objec- tive was to recapture the territory Egypt and Syria had lost to Israel during the Six- Day War of 1967. Caught by surprise, the Israeli troops were initially pushed back, but they quickly regrouped and launched their own attack, pushing into Syria and across the Suez Canal into Egypt. Israel appealed to the United States for help, and President Nixon responded with a massive airlift of $2 billion in military supplies. At the same time, the Soviet Union continued to supply Egypt and Syria. American aid to Israel angered the Arab countries, and quickly they retaliat- ed by placing an embargo on the ship- ment of oil to the United States and other countries that supported Israel. The Arabs hoped to force Israel's friends into supporting a settlement that would require Israel to return the lands it had taken in 1967. Hardest hit by the embar- go was Western Europe, which received 72 percent of its oil from the Middle East. Although the United States received only about 1 1 percent of its oil supply from the region, the embargo created an energy cri- sis during which the price of fuel for auto- mobiles and home heating soared. Even as the United States and the Soviet Union gave aid to the opposing sides, they worked through the United Nations Secu- rity Council to arrange a cease-fire.

Secretary of State Henry Kissinger worked with Israel and Egypt to reduce tensions in the Middle East. For the next two years, Kissinger engaged in shuttle diplomacy, flying back and forth between the capitals of the two nations in an effort to produce a lasting peace. Kissinger's efforts yielded two important results. Early in 1974 Golda Meir, the prime minister of Israel, and Anwar el-Sadat, the president of Egypt, agreed to reestablish diplomatic relations between their two countries. Then in September 1975, Israel and Egypt agreed to withdraw their forces from the cease-fire line and pledged not to attack each other. Although signifi- cant problems remained, a measure of peace had been achieved in the Middle East. For the United States, the war in the Middle I^ast brought home the fact that Americans, who had become dejieii- dent on oil from the Middle East, risked being held hostage to the demands ol the oil-producing nations. Section Two Review ««»» Summary President Nixon relished the chal- lenges of foreign policy. Though once a fervent anticommunist, one of his chief foreign policy goals was to improve communications with communist nations through detente. At the Moscow summit, the SALT agreement reduced nuclear weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union. Nixon and Kissinger also set to work renewing relations with China. Nixon increased military involvement in Indochina while setting into motion a withdrawal of American troops and the negotiation of a cease-fire. In 1973 war in the Middle East led to an Arab oil embargo. This conflict was defused by Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy. Checking for Understanding 1.

Protest has an ever-decreasing half-life. — Samuel P. Huntington Political scientist, American Politics, 1981 Section Focus The Vietnam War led many people in the United States to question the wisdom of the nations foreign policy and, with the close of the war, to take a closer look at issues of domestic concern. Discrimi- nation against women, native Americans, and Spanish-speaking Americans became their next target for change. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe the gains made by women and minorities. • Explain why the Equal Rights Amend- ment was not ratified. The 1960s and 1970s were times when young Americans became leaders in promoting social jus- tice. They were determined to close up the gap between the realities of American life — discrimination, poverty, and other social inequities — and the nation's ideal of \"liberty and justice for all.\" Because for the first time in United States history youth was in the majority, their voices could not be ignored. These young people were dedicated to \"self-real- ization\" and social reform, and their orga- nized protests exhibited their commitment to these goals. It was the Vietnam War that turned such impassioned protests into near rebellion. Antiwar and Women's Rights Movements The war in Vietnam generated heated and vocal opposition. At first the antiwar movement was centered on college cam- puses across the country, which was the source previously for many activists in the civil rights movement. Each escalation of the war prompted sit-ins, teach-ins, and demonstrations. And each escalation increased the number of protestors. By 1970 war protest had moved off campus to involve people Irom all walks of lite in the antiwar movement. While most antiwar protests were peaceful, a few had tragic outcomes. When President Nixon announced the invasion of Cambodia in May 1970, protests erupted on scores of campuses. At Kent State University in Ohio, rioting reached such an intensity that the Nation- al Guard was sent in. On May 4 a contin- gent of guardsmen, harassed by students, fired into the crowd, killing 4 students and wounding 10. On May 14, at Jackson State University in Mississippi, student protest was suppressed by the state police who fired randomly into a dormitory. Two students were killed, and 9 were wounded. These events precipitated a nationwide student strike. Hundreds of colleges and universities suspended classes or closed down completely. Even though women constituted more than 50 percent of the population in the United States in the 1970s, their political, economic, legal, and social status resem- bled that of a disadvantaged minority. In 1977, for example, women held less than 5 percent of the elective offices in the United States. There were no women sen- ators. Supreme Court justices, or mayors of major cities. Of the 435 members of the House of Representatives, only 18 were women.

In 1976 the U.S. Department of Labor reported that full-time working men aver- aged 75 percent more pay than lull-time working women. Such inequities, coupled with the success of blacks in the civil rights movement, contributed to the rebirth of the women's rights movement of the 1960s. The publication ol The Feminine Mystique, by Betty Friedan, in 1963, inspired demands for change. Friedan rejected the notion that the des- tiny of women was only to be wives and mothers. She described how the media had created an image of women that was designed to imprison them in their house- holds and bar serious consideration of them as competitors in the labor market.

Following intense lobbying by women's groups, in 1972 Congress voted to submit the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the states for ratification. This amend- ment stated that \"equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex.\" Not all women supported ERA, howev- er. Phyllis Schlafly, founder of STOP ERA, dismissed the women's rights move- ment as \"a series of sharp-tongued, high- pitched, whining complaints by unmarried women. \" STOP ERA support- ers contended that the ERA would force women to give up their traditional roles as wives and mothers, and that they would lose certain legal protections in the family and in the workplace. As a result of a vigorous campaign by STOP ERA and other groups, the Equal Rights Amendment failed to obtain the votes needed for ratification. Changes for Minorities By the 1970s Hispanic Americans had become the largest minority in the United States next to African Americans. Spanish- speaking people made up almost 8 per- cent of the population and were the largest minority group in several states. New York City alone contained about 2 million Spanish-speaking people. Part of Miami, Florida, became known as Little Havana because it was the home of hun- dreds of thousands of Cuban immigrants. Mexican Americans made up the largest group of Hispanics. For years, many Mexican Americans labored as migrant farm workers, moving from place to place to harvest seasonal crops. They were not protected by federal minimum- wage laws, unemployment insurance, or social security. In 1965 Cesar Chavez organized a nationwide coalition that asked Americans to boycott California grapes picked by nonunion labor. After enduring five years of such persistent protest, most California grape growers relented and agreed to sign a contract with Chavez's union. During the 1970s, inspired by the suc- cess of blacks in obtaining civil rights, Hispanic Americans began to organize.

As their political strength grew, Hispanic Americans were elected to local and state offices as well as to Congress. Native Americans also organized dur- ing the 1960s and 1970s. Their plight captured national attention when a 1966 study revealed that native Americans suf- fered from so much malnutrition and disease that their life expectancy was only 46 years. They had less formal education than any other minority group, and their family income was less than one-hall the national average. During the 1960s native Americans displayed a new militancy. In the state of Washington, men Irom more than 50 native American groups led a \"fish-in.\" They deliberately broke game laws and risked imprisonment to protest the loss of their former fishing and hunting grounds. Proclaiming \"red power,\" the National Congress of American Indians demanded the end to federal control of native American affairs. \"We simply want to run our lives our own way,\" said a young leader of the congress. \"Our own way\" meant the revitalization of their tradi- tional cultures. In 1973 a more militant group, the American Indian Movement (AIM), seized the reservation at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. They demanded that lands taken from native Americans in violation of federal treaties be returned. They also demanded that development programs on reservations be managed by Indian tribal government and not the federal Bineau ot Indian Afiairs. Although ilic seizure ended and native American support was low, federal poli- cies toward native Americans began to change. The Pueblo of Taos, New Mexi- co, regained Blue Lake, a place sacred to their religious life.

It also led Congress and the Supreme Court to reassert their constitu- tional powers. Although confidence in the government was shaken by Watergate, the bicentennial, or the 200th anniver- sary, of the American Revolution was cause for celebration. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • List the ways in which Congress sought to reassert its constitutional powers. • Explain how the constitutional process solved the Watergate crisis. In 1 974 it was discovered that Richard Nixon, who had been reelected in a landslide in 1972, had not only exceeded the powers of the presiden- cy but had also abused the powers of his office and had betrayed his public trust. When he could no longer cover up his actions, the President was forced to resign from office. Two hundred years after the founding of the American Republic, the people of the United States could celebrate that the constitutional system of govern- ment worked. The Watergate Scandal Not surprisingly, the Republican party nominated President Nixon as its candi- date in the election of 1972. Nixon ran against Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, who won the Democratic nomination with the support of a coalition of activists — young people, blacks, and women. Almost from the beginning, how- ever, the McGovern campaign derailed itself McGoverns running mate, Senator Thomas Eagleton, was forced to withdraw when it was disclosed that he had been hospitalized for depression. In addition. Democratic parrv' regulars and labor union leaders were cool, if not hostile, toward the liberal McGoverns candidacy. In contrast, President Nixon conducted a perfect campaign. The almost-complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam defused the war issue, and the summits in Beijing and Moscow signaled an easing of cold-war tensions. Moreover, the Presi- dent solidified his support among \"middle Americans\" by calling for law and order, by opposing busing, and by making con- tinuous appeals to patriotism. On Election Day the President received 61 percent of the popular vote and won every electoral vote except those of Mas- sachusetts and the District ol Columbia. It was later learned, however, that this tremendous victory was not entirely won fairly. During the campaign the President and his political advisers organized the Committee to Reelect the President (CREEP), and collected more than $50 million for Nixon's reelection campaign, some of which was illegally received.

For example, a group ot CREEP employees were caught \"bugging\" the offices of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate building in Washington, D.C. Although tiie Presi- dent's press secretary dismissed the break- in as a \"third-rate burglary,\" this seemingly insignificant incident had seri- ous consequences for the President. Rumors began to circulate that the Pres- ident himself had ordered the Watergate break-in. Stories were published in the Wiis/iiiiinon Post and other newspapers that linked key members ol the White House stalf and C^REEP to the break-in. It was reported that key Nixon advisers had paid the Watergate burglars almost $1 million in \"hush money\" to plead guilty and say nothing else at their trials. I'o quiet the rumors, the President ordered his aiiorney general to .ippoint a special prosecuior, I larva id law professor Archibald Cox, to investigate the case. At the same time, a special Senate com- mittee began to lH)ld televised hearings on the break-in and other abuses alleged to have been committetl iltiring the cam- paign of 1972. Starting in May 197.^, mil- lions of Americans watched in fascination as a parade of witnesses testified about illegal activities carried out by the WTiite House staff and by CREEP. Perhaps the most startling was the discovery that the President tape-recorded most of the con- versations he had in the Oval Office. Following these revelations, federal grand juries indicted members of the Nixon administration for their illegal activities, including the unauthorized wiretapping, burglaries, illegal campaign contributions, and the bribing of witness- es. Eventually 25 people connected with the administration — including former Attorney Cieneral John Mitchell and two of Nixon's closest White House aides, H.R. Haldeman and John D.

When the special prosecutor insisted on having the tapes, Nixon ordered the attorney general to remove Cox. Both the attorney general and his top assistant resigned rather than carry out the President's order. Finally Nixon found a Justice Department official who was willing to fire Cox. The dismissal ot the special prosecutor became known as the \"Saturday Night Massacre,\" and it provoked a wave of public protest as well as the first serious calls for Nixon's impeachment.

A grand jury found that Agnew, when governor of Maryland, had taken bribes from contractors who did business with the state. It was further revealed that Agnew continued to receive such pay- ments while he was Vice President. Nixon nominated Gerald Ford, the Republican leader of the House of Repre- sentatives, as the new Vice President. In an effort to quiet public outrage over the Saturday Night Massacre, Nixon appointed another special prosecutor in November 1973, and in April 1974, the President released written transcripts of 47 tape-recorded conversations. Even though the transcripts had been heavily edited, they seemed to indicate that the President had been involved in covering up the Watergate scandal. Nevertheless, the President still continued to proclaim his innocence: If read with an open and fair mind and read together with the record of actions I took, these transcripts will show that what I have stated since the beginning to be the truth. . . my actions were directed toward finding the facts and seeing that justice was done, fiirly and according to the law. In July, the Supreme Court ruled that the President had to turn over the tapes themselves, not just their transcripts. A month later Nixon complied and handed over the tapes. One tape provided direct evidence that on June 23, 1972, only six days after the Watergate break-in, the President had ordered a cover-up. With this news, even the President's strongest supporters conceded that there was suffi- cient evidence to support impeachment. They advised Nixon that it seemed cer- tain the House would impeach him and that the Senate would find him guilty.

President Ford inspired public confidence. He assured a joint session of Congress that his administration would be free of \"illegal tappings, eavesdropping, buggings, or break-ins.\" The new Presi- dent seemed to be a decent, candid, and trustworthy man. A month after entering office, however, Ford damaged his public image by grant- ing Richard Nixon an unconditional par- don for all crimes he committed or may have committed while in office. Ford insisted that he was acting not out of sympathy for Nixon, but in the public interest. He wanted to avoid the publicity and national division that a trial would create. Nevertheless, the pardon aroused fierce and widespread criticism of the new President. Congress Reasserts Its Authority When he took office, Gerald Ford promised to adopt a policy of \"communi- cation, conciliation, compromise, and cooperation\" with Congress. He expected good relations with Congress, since he had served for 25 years as a representative and almost a decade as House Republican leader. Nevertheless, Ford was a conserva- tive, and liberal Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. In addition, the new President confronted a Congress that was determined to reassert its authority over what some critics called the \"imperial presidency. \" Many members of Congress felt that the office of the President was becoming too powerful.

This law required that the President report to Congress within 48 hours after sending combat troops abroad or after engaging in any military action.

In reviewing his difficult relationship with Congress, President Ford observed: As a member of Congress for twenty-five years, I clearly understand the powers and obligations of the Senate and House under our Constitution. But as President for eighteen months, I also understand that Congress is trying to go too far in some areas. One of the biggest problems facing the President and Congress was the economic recession. To Ford, inflation and the nations dependence on foreign oil were the greatest threats to recovery. The Democratic Congress was more alarmed by the highest rates of unemployment and the lowest levels of productivity since the Great Depression ok the 1930s. Like Nixon, President Ford wanted to cut spending on social welfare programs and adopt an energy program. But Congress did not cooperate. Ford, in turn, prevented the enactment of liberal Demo- cratic legislation by the use of the veto power. In foreign policy Gerald Ford continued to pursue detente with the Soviets and the Chinese.

Under the terms of the accords, the par- ties recognized the borders of the coun- tries of Eastern Europe and committed themselves to respect and protect the human rights of their citizens. In foreign policy, as in domestic affairs, Ford came into conflict with the Demo- cratic-controlled Congress. In 1975 Congress refused President Ford's request for additional funds to aid South Vietnam and Cambodia in their continuing civil wars. As a result, the Cambodian govern- ment surrendered to the repressive Khmer Rouge forces on April 17. Twelve days later the North Vietnamese and the Viet- cong overran Saigon and forced the gov- ernment of South Vietnam to surrender. Communist regimes were now in control everywhere in Indochina, except Thai- land, which remained an ally. The Bicentennial The nation's bicentennial began on a somber note with Cambodia and South Vietnam falling to the Communists. But President Ford headed for Boston to par- ticipate in the opening ceremonies of the celebration. There, the nation commemo- rated Paul Reveres famous ride and the historic battles at nearby Lexington and Concord. As July 4, 1976, approached, most peo- ple in the United States caught the bicen- tennial spirit. Cities, towns, and villages held parades and concerts and displayed fireworks. A procession of Conestoga wagons traveled from the West to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, and tall ships majes- tically sailed into New York Harbor on the Fourth of July. As the bicentennial ended, the nation felt a new sense of hopefulness. It knew that the constitutional system of checks and balances had curbed the abuses of the imperial presidency. The people of the United States were proud of achievements such as the space program, and they began to regain tiuir sense of confidence in thcnvselves and in iheir country.

Some of his cam- paign's tactics were illegal, however, including a break in of the Democratic party headquarters. Throughout Nixon's second term, evidence surfaced linking high officials in his administration to a campaign of illegal \"dirty tricks.\" Finally, transcripts of secret White House tapes proved that Nixon had attempted a cover- up. Faced with impeachment, the Presi- dent resigned and was succeeded by Gerald Ford. Congress reasserted its authority and stymied many of Ford's domestic policies.

Because your budget is lim- ited, you can only send the products to the areas where you feci you will have ilie most success. What information would be helpful for you to make your decision? You probably would need demographic informa- tion. Demographics is the data used to show the char- acteristics ol human population lor such things as size, growth, density, distribution, and vital statistics. The information can be presented a number of ways: in pie charts, bar graphs, and line graphs. One application of demographic data in the study of history or political science is to understand the relative voting strength of different ethnic groups. Candidates for political office need demographic information about their region in order to identify and target voter groups and to devise strategies that will attract those voters.

However, these feelings could not erase the painful mem- ory of two of the most disillusioning events in United States history — the Viet- nam War and the Watergate scandal. Americans were ready for new leadership to bolster the national mood and solve the difficult problems that loomed ahead. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • State reasons for the American public's crisis of confidence. • Explain President Carters call for a moral war on energy consumption. • Describe President Carter's foreign policy. As the 1976 elections approached, the United States was faced with the grim prospect of diminish- ing natural resources. The nation was no longer self-sufficient in its production of energy. At that time the United States imported more than half of its oil. Competition from Japan, Ger- many, and other countries threatened America's giant automobile and steel industries. With rising inflation and unemployment, the lifestyles of many Americans were severely affected. As the economy continued to shrink, the chances for women, African Americans, and other minority groups to achieve social and eco- nomic equalit)' were jeopardized. There were equally serious problems in foreign affairs. Political turmoil in eco- nomically developing nations upset the stability of world order. The Soviet Union pursued an increasingly aggressive foreign policy as the nuclear arms race continued. Was the United States government capa- ble of meeting these challenges? Could a President with a fresh perspective renew the confidence of Americans in them- selves and in their government? The Election of 1976 Soon after Gerald Ford became Presi- dent in 1974, he began to campaign for his election in 1976. The public regarded Ford as a warm, easy-going man of high integrity, but had doubts about his intel- lectual capabilities and competence as a leader. Ford was, as he himself admitted, \"a Ford, not a Lincoln.\" From within the Republican party came a challenge from the conservatives, who rallied behind Ronald Reagan, former governor of Cali- fornia. Ford survived the challenge and won the Republican nomination, but only by a few votes. The Democratic presidential primaries were relatively crowded with candidates, including a number of prominent sena- tors and representatives. One of the candi- dates, however, James Earl Carter, Jr., or \"Jimmy\" Carter as he liked to be called, was something of a political outsider. A former governor of Georgia, Jimmy Carter had no previous experience in national government but nonetheless con- ducted a remarkable campaign. Starting two years before the election. Carter toured the nation meeting voters face to face. His informal, down-home style appealed to Americans tired of the \"impe- rial presidency.\" Jimmy Carter made a virtue of his inex- perience in national affairs. He said: 1036 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1075,"pageContent":"The people of this country want a fresh face, not one associated with a long series of mistakes at the White House and Capitol Hill. To almost everyone's surprise. Carter won many ot the primaries and secured the Democratic nomination tor President. During the presidential campaign, Jimmy Carter vowed to restore people's faith in the federal government by making it more open and efficient. He promised major new programs for energy develop- ment, tax reform, welfare reform, and national medical care. Carter had wide public appeal. Conservatives liked him because he promised to balance the bud- get. Liberals supported him because he insisted that he would not let unemploy- ment rise as a means ot lowering inflation. Carter won a narrow victory over Ford, taking 51 percent of the popular vote and 297 electoral votes. Ford won 48 percent of the popular vote and 241 electoral votes. Carter won by combining the sup- port of the old Democratic coalition of the industrial Northeast and the solid South (except for Virginia). For the first time since 1848, a candidate from the deep South had been elected President. And that candidate owed his margin of victory to black southern voters. At his inauguration, Carter demonstrat- ed his \"plain folks\" view of the presidency by walking from the Capitol to the White House rather than riding in a limousine. During his first months in office, he gave fireside chats, held phone conversations with ordinary citizens, and visited town meetings. Energy and Economic Shocks President Carter felt that the nation's increasing dependence on oil as an energy source was the country's most serious domestic problem.

Wtiat solution did President Carter propose that Congress rejected? support for the rest of his program. The President asked Americans to make person- al sacrifices to reduce their energy con- sumption. However, because he asked only for voluntary action, the public was con- fused about the seriousness of the crisis. When Carter later proposed stronger methods of restricting consumption, such as a 10 percent tax on all imported oil and emergency authority to impose gasoline rationing, Congress rejected them. Carter did, however, convince Congress to lift controls on domestic oil production and to impose a \"windfall profits\" tax on the oil companies' huge earnings. When another fuel shortage occurred in the sum- mer of 1979, Americans learned the value of smaller, more energy-efficient cars. Homeowners installed extra insulation to cut their heating and air-conditioning bills. Sharp rises in the price of gasoline and oil contributed to double-digit inflation, rate increases of 10 percent or more. In 1979 the inflation rate reached an unprecedented 18 percent. By 1980 it cost more than $200 to purchase the same goods that $100 would have bought only 10 years earlier. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates to all-time highs as a means of discourag- ing borrowing and bringing the economy under control. These policies helped reduce inflation but caused a severe busi- ness recession. Governmental Disunity The hope for change that had spurred Carter's election faded fast. Even though the Democrats held a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, President Carter had a poor working rela- tionship with Congress because he refused to play old-style politics. For example, in 1977, he announced that he would veto appropriations for a series of costly dams, canals, and other water projects. Such pork-barrel legislation, legislation that 1038 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1077,"pageContent":"would benefit only a small part of the country, was common practice in Congress. Carter's move saved the nation millions of dollars, but it cost him valu- able support from Congress. Congress, for example, rejected key parts ot his energy program and blocked his proposals for tax and welfare reforms. Nonetheless, he was able to gain important legislative victories on such issues as civil service reform and airline deregulation. Carter's inabiliry to sell his political position on important issues puzzled many people. Unlike previous Democratic presidents who developed social programs such as the New Deal, the Fair Deal, the New Frontier, and the Great Society, Carter had no unifying theme that identified his administration. Instead, he followed a cautious middle course, promising to reduce government spending while endorsing expensive social programs. The President would not \"choose up sides,\" as newspaper columnist James Reston observed. \"Confronted with a series of ambiguous questions, he simply refused to give simple answers.\" As a result, the public was confused about Carter's goals. By 1979 his popular support had fallen dramatically. Public opinion polls showed that Carter's popularity had dropped lower than President Nixon's during the Watergate scandal. The growing dissatisfaction Americans felt with the federal government soon included local and state governments. In California voters passed \"Proposition 13, a measure that cut property taxes in half, resulting in cutbacks on funds to support schools, libraries, and other important ser- vices. This tax revolt soon spread to other states. There were, however, contradictions in this \"antisovernment ' mood. Polls showed that many Americans thought the government was spending too much money and should reduce t;ixes and b.il- ance the budget. Yet polls also showed that Americans believed the government was not doing enough to support health .ind educational programs and other pressing problems. Siiecial-interest groups formed to promoie their own particular needs .md to compete against each other for ever smaller shares of govenuiieiu spending. Morality in Foreign Policy In contrast to his weak leadership at home. President Carter's foreign policy was bold and clearly defined. Carter had denounced past American foreign policy as \"lacking moral principle.\" A man of strong religious beliefs. Carter argued that instead of relying on military and economic might, the United States must try to be \"right and honest and truthful and decent\" in its dealings with other nations. In 1978 President Carter won Senate ratification of the Panama Canal treaties. Since 1903 the United States had con- trolled the Panama Canal. The treaties transferred control of the canal from the United States to Panama by the end of the century. The treaties removed a major symbol of United States interventionist policy and signaled a new approach to Latin American relations. In his dealings with other nations. Carter expressed a \"clear-cut preference for those societies which share with us an abiding respect for human rights. \" Accordingly his administration cut off military and economic support to several Latin American governments considered dictatorial and repressive. Most dramati- cally. Carter singled out the Soviet LInion as a violator of human rights. He strong- ly condemned the Soviet practice of imprisoning people who protested against the government. He also pressed the Soviet Union to allow more of its lewish citizens to emigrate. Soviet leaders claimed these actions violated the spirit of detente and constituted direct inter- vention by the LJnited States in Soviet domestic affairs. Relations between the United States and the Soviet Union suffered a turtliei setback when Soviet troops invaded the Asian nation t)f Alghanistan late iti 1979.

The Troubled Mideast Carter's greatest foreign policy triumph and his greatest failure involved the Mid- dle East. Since its early history, the region had been inflamed by deep political and religious conflicts. In recent years, the United States had shied away from becoming involved in the area. As Carter himself acknowledged: [The Middle East] had long been a textbook for pessimism, a demonstration that diplomatic ingenuity was no match for intractable human conflicts. Despite this, President Carter made a bold move to negotiate a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, two nations that had been bitter enemies for 30 years. In 1978 Carter brought Egypt's President Anwar el-Sadat and Israel's Prime Minister Menachem Begin together at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. The two leaders talked for 14 days. More than once the discussions broke down, but Carter persisted until the leaders reached an agreement on September 17, 1978. In front of a joint session of Congress, with Sadat and Begin in the gallery, Carter announced that: This is the first time that an Arab and an Israeli leader have signed a comprehensive framework for peace. It contains the seeds of a time when the Middle East, with all its vast potential, may be a land of human richness and fidfillment, rather than a land of bitterness and continued conflict.

Also the issue of the Israeli-occupied territories inhabited by Palestinians was yet to be solved. Still, an important first step toward peace in the Middle East had been taken. Carter's success in negotiating peace between Egypt and Israel, however, could not make up for his failure to resolve the crisis with Iran in 1979. The United States had long supported the Shah ot Iran. There were a number of practical considerations for U.S. support: Iran served as a major supplier of oil and as a reliable buffer against Soviet expansion in the Middle East. Iranians, however, had grown unhappy with the Shah's rule. The Shah had brought Western technology and reforms to his people with huge rev- enues from oil, but these changes only helped to widen the gap between the wealthy and the extremely poor in the nation.

The militants threatened to kill the hostages or try them as spies. The Carter administration tried to negotiate for the freedom of the hostages, but was not successful. As pressure mounted to secure their release. Carter felt he had no other choice but to order a military rescue. One morning in late April 1980, Americans awoke to the shocking news that a mission to rescue the hostages had been attempted and failed. Eight members of the rescue team had died in the attempt. Despite this setback. Carter persisted in his efforts to free the hostages. Negotiations with Iran continued right up to President Carter's last day in office. Ironically, on January 20, 1981, the day of Ronald Reagan's inauguration, Iran released the Americans, ending their 444 days in captivity. Section One Revie'w IIIIHlIIlUJLBJJLiiJ Summary American voters wanted a change in 1976 after Watergate and Vietnam. Their choice for President was Jimmy Carter, a new face in national politics. Carter put energy at the top of his priority list. To conserve oil and promote alternative ener- gy sources, the President proposed a national energy program, created a Department of Energy, and placed a tax on oil profits. The price of oil, however, continued to rise and caused rapid infla- tion. In foreign policy. Carter emphasized respect for human rights. His greatest for- eign policy achievement was negotiating the peace between Israel and Egypt. His greatest failure was his inability to free American hostages in Iran. Checking for Understanding 1.

Southern planters, meanwhile, depended on England to buy their tobacco, rice, and indigo and pro- vide cloth, furniture, and other necessities.

In the 1 930s American interests in the East Asia conflicted with Japan's desire to control the natural resources of that region, following World War 11, the United States waged a propaganda war with communist bloc nations over the merits of free enterprise. Communist propaganda labeled the United States an imperi- alist nation and criticized American power and influence in developing countries. The United States responded by warning the world that communism sought to control people through repressive government. Both sides used econom- ic and military aid to win support from developing countries. By 1990 many communist countries realized their need to allow some free enterprise as they sought to respond to demands for change. The Soviets invited some American businesses to initiate ventures inside their country. The American free enterprise system appeared to have overcome one of its major foreign policy obstacles.

Economic condi- tions, the energy crisis, and President Carters inability to free the hostages angered and frustrated many Americans. People once again seemed ready to make a dramatic change in their leadership. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the \"conservative revolution\" of 1980. • Describe President Reagans supply-side economic recovery plan. • Compare President Carter's foreign pol- icy with that of President Reagan. As the 1980 presidential cam- paign got underway, the hostage crisis became a key issue in Carter's bid for reelec- tion. For a while, Americans rallied behind their leader. During the Demo- cratic parry's primary elections, Carter continued to work for the captives' release instead of actively campaigning. This strategy helped Carter defeat a challenge to his renomination from Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. But Ameri- cans grew increasingly impatient with the situation. President Carter's failure to obtain the release of the hostages worked against him in the November election. The Election of 1980 Republicans chose former California governor Ronald Reagan as their presi- dential candidate. Ironically, Reagan had been a New Deal Democrat when he was a young man. But during the 1950s, Rea- gan turned conservative in his thinking and began to serve the Republican party tirelessly. Reagan's chiel opponents in the pri- maries were two moderate Republicans: former United Nations Ambassador George Bush and Illinois Representative John Anderson. After his nomination, Reagan picked Bush as his running mate. Anderson decided to run for President as an independent candidate, hoping to appeal to voters who were unhappy with Reagan and Carter. The Republicans adopted a conservative platform calling for reductions in taxes and government spending in order to restore the nation's economic prosperity. The party did endorse, however, higher defense spending to strengthen the role of the United States in world affairs. Throughout the campaign, Reagan hammered at Carter's lack of leadership and the nation's weak economy. He promised voters economic growth and development instead of the economic sac- rifices and restraints that Carter advocat- ed. Carter responded by picturing Reagan as unsympathetic to the needs of the poor and minority groups. He also argued that Reagan's defense policies were a threat to world peace. On Election Day Ronald Reagan claimed victory with 51 percent of the popular vote. Carter won 41 percent, while Anderson and other candidates of minor parties split the rest of the vote. After 4 years in office, Jimmy Carter bore the burden of the public's widespread dis- appointment with government. Little more than one-halt of those registered to vote exercised their right, a statistic that clearly reflected the nation's apathy toward government. 1044 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1083,"pageContent":"Connections History Televangelism \"It's not listed in the Bible,\" said Jim Bakker in 1979, \"but my. .. specific calling from God is to be a television talk-show Televangelist Jim my Swaggart AND R E L G I O N host.\" Bakker became one of the most successftil ministers of the electronic church — a term coined by mainstream clergy to describe television evangelism.

The coalition that elected Reagan included former liberals, blue-collar workers, southerners, the elderly, and others who had become dis- enchanted with Democratic leadership. It also included fundamentalist Christian groups that opposed abortion and favored school prayer, and anti-feminists who placed more emphasis on women's roles as wives and mothers than on the issue of equal rights. The 1980 election was proof of a signif- icant shift among Americans in their political convictions. I'A'idence enough was the tact that Reagan was one of the more conservative Presidents in decades. The conservative tide that elected Reagan also carried many other Republican candi- dates into office, for the first time in 28 years. Republicans took control of the Senate.

Similarly, cuts in corpo- rate taxes would spur business to expand production and hire more workers. Reagan's beliefs were based on an econom- ic theory called supply-side economics, which claims that the economy can best be stimulated by increasing the supply of goods rather than the demand. Reagan's economic views, which came to be called \"Reaganomics,\" included, in addition to cutting taxes, a reduction in government spending. Reagan proposed cutbacks that would end federal job- training programs and reduce spending on programs such as Medicare, food stamps, and education. Critics of the Pres- ident's program predicted that it would cause great suffering for the poor. Reagan denied this, claiming that there would always be a \"safety net\" of government aid for truly needy Americans. Although the President faced opposi- tion to his proposals, he had personal qualities that helped to promote his posi- tion: a great ability to communicate with his audience and a sense of humor. In March 1981, when he was shot and seri- ously wounded by a deranged young man, his aides visited the President in the hos- pital. They assured him that the business of government was continuing as usual. \"What makes you think I'd be happy about that?\" Reagan quipped. Together with his shrewd handling of Congress, Reagan's popularity enabled him to win major legislative victories in his first year in office. The Republican Senate adopted his tax and spending programs, which included $39 billion in tax cuts and a 25 percent cut in income taxes over a 3-year period. In the House, Reagan appe;iled to a group of conservative Democrats, mostly from the South, known as \"boll weevils.\" They voted for the Presi- dent's programs, giving him a narrow but complete victory. Recession and Recovery The economy revived more slowly than Reagan hoped, however. Spending cuts, together with high interest rates, brought 1046 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1085,"pageContent":"inflation down, but the cure was not painless. A severe economic downturn occurred in 1982. Business bankruptcies, factory closings, and farm foreclosures increased at alarming rates. Unemploy- ment swelled, and by the end of 1982 more than 1 1 million Americans — more than 10 percent of the workforce — were jobless. Blaming President Reagan's eco- nomic programs lor the recession, Democrats won back many seats in the congressional elections. By 1983 the economy began to turn around. The Federal Reserve Board low- ered interest rates, making it easier for businesses and individuals to borrow money. And the inflation rate dropped just as a 25-percent cut in income taxes was putting more money in the hands of consumers. Feeling new confidence in the economy, Americans made purchases they had put off during the recession. Sales of every type of goods and services shot upward, and industries hired back work- ers who had been laid olf during the recession. During 1983 unemployment declined but did not disappear. Levels of unemployment were still high by postwar standards. By 1988, however, at the end of Reagan's second term, unemployment dropped to a 1 4-year low of 5.5 percent. President Reagan went before Congress in January 1984 to hail the recovery: . . .America is back — standing tall, looking to the 80s with courage, confidence, and hope. . ..Send away the hand-wringers and doubting Thomases. But he warned that government need- ed to bring down its mounting deficits. Reagan's policy was to cut taxes while increasing defense spending. Congress, however, controlled by Democrats, refused to make the deeper cuts in the social programs Reagan requested. The result was the most imbalnnccd budget in American history. By 1984 the federal deficit, the difference between the amount of money the government took in and what it spent, was nearing $200 billion a year. Critics argued that the deficit would undermine much of the social legislation begun under the Roosevelt, Truman, and Johnson admin- istrations. Although huge federal deficits have no immediate impact on the economy, their long-range effects are devastating. When government spends more money than it collects, it has to borrow money to make up the difference. The more it borrows, the more interest it owes on its debts. In 1984 the interest alone on the federal debt amounted to $153.8 billion, an increase of more than $55 billion from Reagan's first year in office. Reagan's Foreign Policy Reagan believed that the Soviet Union and its allies were a serious threat to the United States. He was determined that the United States be viewed as a strong power capable of countering Soviet influ- ence everywhere. The President was particularly con- cerned about the spread of communism in Central America. The proximity of this region to the United States made it strate- gically important. Half of America's for- eign trade and two-thirds of its oil shipments went through the Panama Canal and the Caribbean. American banks and businesses had millions of dol- lars invested in the region. Reagan saw Soviet influence in Nicaragua. He also believed that the Soviets were supporting guerrilla move- ments in El Salvador. He blamed Carter's human-rights policies for undermining the established government in Nicaragua, led by Anastasio Somoza who had been deposed by left-wing revokitionaries. Reagan reversed Carter's policy by restor- ing military aid to the government in Y:\\ Salvador and by supporting the contras, guerrillas who fought against the pro- communist government in Nicaragua.

Con- cerned about the fate of 800 American medical students during a coup in the small island nation of Grenada, he dis- patched troops to rescue the Americans and establish an anticommunist govern- ment. Reagan's action won widespread approval at home, despite international protests. President Reagan was less successful with his Middle East initiatives. In 1982 when he sent a force of marines to help keep the peace in the war-torn nation of Lebanon, the United States found itself caught in the middle of a complicated and bloody civil war. Lebanese groups sup- ported by Syria believed that the United States had taken sides and was not a neu- tral peacekeeper. Early one morning in October 1983, a truck loaded with explo- sives was driven straight at the marine barracks. The barracks were demolished, and 241 marines were killed. Recognizing that the United States could neither retali- ate effectively nor keep the peace. Presi- dent Reagan withdrew all American armed forces from Lebanon.

The nation was at peace, and the econo- my had made a healthy recovery from the recession of 1982. These factors, combined with the President's image as a strong leader, made Ronald Reagan and Vice President Bush a formidable team. The Democrats nominated a traditional liberal, former Vice President Walter Mondale. Mondale broke precedent by choosing the first woman candidate of a major party to run for Vice President, Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York.

Reagan continued to insist that economic expansion and deeper gov- ernment spending cuts wotild reduce the deficit. While Mondale tried to convince voters that the very policies Reagan want- ed to continue were responsible for the deficit, the President ran on his record. \"America is presented with the clearest political choice of half a century,\" he said, between \"their government ot pessimism, fear, and limits, or ours ol hope, confi- dence and growth.\" In November Americans gave President Reagan an overwhelming vote of confi- dence.

Reagan quickly set to work lowering taxes and cutting govern- ment spending. After a period of unem- ployment and recession, the economy started to revive. Lower interest rates and taxes gave Americans more to spend and unemployment fell. In foreign policy, Reagan fought communism vigorously, especially in Latin America where he ral- lied support for Contra rebels in Nicaragua.

There's neiv ground to be broken and new actio?! to be taken. — George Bush Inaugural Address, January 1989 Section Focus Since the reelection of President Ronald Reagan in 1984, Americans have seen new reasons for confidence in the nation's future, together with new chal- lenges for democracy to meet. These challenges faced Americans at home and abroad. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain the impact of the defense bud- get on the national deficit. • Define glasnost and explain its impor- tance in easing relations with the Soviet Union. • Describe challenges facing the nation in the 1980s. Ronald Reagan enjoyed immense popularity as he began his sec- ond term in office. Political and financial scandals, however, soon began to plague Reagan's administra- tion. Americans were forced to recognize the enormity of the national deficit and its effects on the nation's future generations. And, although relations with the Soviet Union had greatly improved and the threat of nuclear war diminished, the pre- vious world order was upset. Conflict erupted in the Middle East, and the Unit- ed States became directly involved. A Strong Defense Reagan strongly supported America's space program, both as a means of restor- ing the nation's self-confidence and as a means of strengthening its defenses. Americans took pride in their successes in space exploration, and the launch of reusable space shuttles marked a new era in the space program. Astronauts, scien- tists, and even two members of Congress orbited the Earth in the shuttles, carrying out scientific studies and launching com- munications, weather, and military- surveillance satellites. Reagan had a special interest in the mil- itary aspects of the space program. In 1983 he had announced a new research project to create a shield to intercept and destroy nuclear ballistic missiles — the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), or \"Star Wars\" as it was popularly known. Oppo- nents of the program believed that SDI's uncertain technology could never provide a leak-proof umbrella to stop missile attacks. They feared that SDI might stim- ulate new nuclear competition between the superpowers. Reagan and other sup- porters of the program, however, believed it would improve chances of nuclear disar- mament. At the same time that he was promoting Star Wars, Reagan was spending huge sums of money for the military. More than $1 trillion was spent lor new bombers, submarines, and missiles and to improve the training of ground troops. Many aspects of his program, including placing new nuclear missiles in Europe, basing intercontinental missiles in western states, and developing expensive new B-2 \"stealth\" bombers, caused a great deal of controversy. The spread of nuclear weapons raised new fears of war. In response, a large antinuclear movement grew in Europe and the United States. The movement supported proposals for a nuclear freeze, an agreement that would require the 1050 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1089,"pageContent":"Examining Photographs On January 28. 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded, killing all seven Ameri- can astronauts aboard.

Examining Cartoons This is how some saw the arms race. What was \"Star Wars\"? But the Reagan administration continued to oppose a nuclear freeze, arguing that a freeze would only perpetuate the Soviet's nuclear superiority. The United States put forward its own proposals for mutual reductions, but Soviet leaders rejected these proposals. Relations with the Soviet Union Relations between the United States and the Soviet Union began to improve after March 1985 when Mikhail Gor- bachev became Soviet Premier. Gorbachev faced grave domestic crises, fiis country's economy was in shambles and various ethnic groups within the Soviet Union were demanding independence. Gor- bachev responded by Introducing a new openness, or glasnost, in Soviet society, and a political and economic restructur- ing, called perestroika. In an effort to relax international ten- sions and to protect his domestic reforms, C Gorbachev made dramatic offers to reduce nuclear missiles and weapons. He even offered a proposal whereby they could be completely eliminated.

This was the first agreement that eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. Changes within the Soviet Union affect- ed all aspects of international relations. Admitting that their intervention in Afghanistan had been \"morally wrong,\" the Soviets withdrew their troops. The Soviet Union released political prisoners, allowed freer emigration of Soviet Jews, and held elections in which challengers often defeated Communist party candi- dates. The Soviets also sought more trade with the United States. The spirit of glasnost and perestroika spread to Soviet bloc countries in Eastern Europe. The world witnessed a dramatic shift toward democratic reform in Poland and Hungary. At last the cold war seemed to be ending. Hands-Off Presidency The Reagan administration credited its strong defense program with convincing the Soviets to agree to reduce their nuclear arsenal. But the costly defense buildup had produced a huge rise in federal deficits. As deficits increased, a greater share of the tax revenues went to pay the interest on the national debt. This left less money available for new programs in edu- cation, environment, and public housing. Congress responded in December 1985 by passing the Gramm-Rudman Act, which put greater pressure on Congress and the President to reach budget agree- ments. If they were unable to reduce the annual deficit to certain limits, the act set automatic across-the-board federal spend- ing cuts.

In an impassioned speech to the nation, Reagan explained: The first American Revolution was sparked by an unshakable conviction: Taxation without representation is tyranny. Tivo centuries later a second American Revolution. . . is gathering force. . . born of popular resentment against a tax system that is unwise, unwanted arid unfair. Reagan's economic goals were helped by the great drop in oil prices that occurred in 1986. Fear of inflation lessened as interest rates dropped. Nonetheless, the deficit reached $2.3 trillion by 1988. Many crincs charged that Reagan was passing the prob- lem on to fiiture generations rather than dealing with hard choices. President Reagan's strong conservative beliefs shaped the programs of his admin- istration. His skills as a speaker enabled him to explain his policies and goals to the public effectively. Within his admin- istrative methods, however, he adopted a \"hands-off\" attitude toward the day-to- day operations of the presidency. Cabinet secretaries received little direction fiom Reagan on how to proceed or what poli- cies to promote. Reagan delegated far greater responsibility to his stafi than any other recent President had. This detach- ment allowed his subordinates to func- tion on their own. Some, unfortunately, acted for personal gain. As a result, a number of financial scandals broke out within the Reagan administration. Offi- cials were convicted of using their influ- ence with the government in exchange for money or other rewards. C'ongress investigated irregularities in programs ranging from military purchasing to fed- eral housing subsidies. In 1986 the Iran-contra scandal shook I he Reagan administration. Several of the President's national security aides, includ- ing |ohn Poindexier, Robert McParlane, .iiul Lieutenant C'olonel Oliver North, li.ul schemed to sell arms to the Iranians to win the release of American hostages in the Middle East. Furthermore, they had diverted the profits from these arms sales to the antigovernment contra forces in Nicaragua, a violation of a Congressional ban on such financing. Critics charged that an undercover foreign policy was being carried out without Congress's con- sent. Defenders maintained that the exec- utive branch was forced to take these measures because of congressional inter- ference with the Presidents authority to conduct foreign policy. A special commission was set up to study the Iran-contra case. Although the commission cleared the President of direct blame, it found fault with Reagan for allowing aides to make policy deci- sions without his knowledge. A number Life of the Times Physical Fitness Ronald Reagan was one of the oldest Presidents and one of the finest. He kept trim by riding horses and chopping wood. Thanks in part to Reagan's example, the late 1970s health craze continued into the 1980s. This trend generated social situa- tions for which no rules had been prescribed. In Miss Manners' Guide- book to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior, syn- dicated columnist Judith Martin, a.k.a. \"Miss Manners, \" applied traditional principles of gracious liring to quandaries thai might arise on the jogging track.

The Iran-contra scandal helped Demo- crats win back a Senate majority in 1986. The effect of the voters' decision at the polls was to produce a divided government — with the presidency held by one party and control of Congress held by another — as a way of keeping power in check. Democratic majorities in Congress acted as a brake on the Reagan administration. In 1987 Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, a moderate who often held the deciding vote in such controversial cases as abortion and minority rights, retired. Rea- gan was quick to nominate a conservative judge to fill the vacancy, but he met with much resistance from the Democratic Sen- ate. After long and controversial hearings, the Senate rejected the nomination. Eight months later, Reagan's nomination of Anthony M. Kennedy, a conservative with more moderate views, was approved. Dur- ing his presidency, Reagan had appointed two other conservatives to the Supreme Court — ^Justices Sandra Day O'Connor in 1981 and Antonin Scalia in 1986 — each one young enough to have influence long into the future.

The Reagan Legacy The oldest person ever to be elected to the presidency, Ronald Reagan was a Pres- ident with enormous popular appeal. The 525 electoral votes he received in 1984 were the most ever received by a candi- date. Reagan, however, left a contradicto- ry legacy. Although he had campaigned to limit government, he left behind enor- mous federal deficits that would restrict future government actions. Reagan's con- servative revolution stopped the expansion ot liberal social welfare programs that had gone on since the New Deal, but actually ended few of them. Reagan — working together with both Democratic and Republican members of Congress — helped preserve and strengthen a number of social programs. Social security was strengthened, and Medicare for the elder- ly was expanded to protect them against \"catastrophic ' illness. Reagan was not as reactionary as people thought. Comparing himself to Franklin D. Roosevelt, he said, \"Like F.D.R., may I say I'm not trying to destroy what's best in our system of humane, free government. I'm doing everything I can to save it.\" Like Roosevelt, Reagan had a contagious optimism that helped to restore the confi- dence of many Americans in themselves, their economy, and their government. Spurred on by low unemployment and a strong economy, Reagan received some of the highest popularity ratings any Presi- dent has ever enjoyed. 1054 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1093,"pageContent":"Election of 1988 The Twenty-second Amendment barred Ronald Reagan from seeking a third term as President.

Then Bush's campaign unleashed a string of negative television advertisements that portrayed Dukakis as unpatriotic and sympathetic to criminals. Dukakis responded weakly to these ads and lost his lead. The candidates attacked each other. Bush identified Dukakis as a \"card-carrying liberal,\" while Dukakis labeled Bush as a poor leader. Saying \"read my lips,\" Bush pledged not to raise taxes and promised the nation that he would follow Reagan's economic policies. Bush also urged Americans to follow a new spirit ot public service and volunteerism. In the election Bush won a resounding victory, taking 40 of the 50 states.

Domestically, Carter focused on solving the energy crisis, but double-digit inflation, pjor relations with Congress, and a perception oi indecisiveness cut away his support. In foreign policy, Carter emphasized human rights. He relinquished United States control of the Panama Canal and imposed a grain embargo on the Soviet Union for its invasion oi Afghanistan. In the Middle East, Carter negotiated an accord between Israel and Egypt, but was unable to free American hostages from Iran. President Reagan, in what was termed by some a \"conservative revolution,\" enjoyed broad-based sup- port, a reflection of discontent with Democratic lead- ership. He cut taxes and reduced federal spending. After a plunge that created high unemployment, the economy rebounded, although the federal deficit con- tinued to grow. Reagan sent military aid to El Sal- vador and supported anticommunist rebels in Nicaragua. The death of 241 marines in Lebanon forced the President to withdraw the troops. After an overwhelming victory in the 1984 elec- tions, Reagan continued to build up the military. This buildup, however, was a drain on the federal budget. Mikhail Gorbachev ushered in a new era in Soviet relations in 1985. A crumbling economy and ethnic strife paved the way for a more open Soviet societ)'. Reagan and Gorbachev held talks that reduced ten- sions. The Iran-Contra scandal tainted Reagan's final years in office. Vowing to follow Reagan's economic policies, George Bush won the 1988 presidential elec- tion. Bush overcame an initial image as a weak leader and acted decisively in foreign affairs in Panama and the Middle East. Domestically, however, problems with the economy and drugs continued to plague American society. * Using Vocabulary Write three headings: Carter, Reagan, and Bush.

Your teacher will give you more specific instructions on the essay's length and the assignment's due date. Write an essay on the changing relations between the United States and the Soviet Union during the administrations of Carter, Reagan, and Bush. Before you begin writing, divide your information into two classifications: 1) events, policies, and actions that eased tensions between the United States and the Sovi- et Union, and 2) events, policies, and actions that kept the two nations apart. Weave this information throughout your essay to explain the changing rela- tionship between the two countries. Conclude your writing with predictions on future relations between these two nations. * Cooperative Learning Activity Since the 1930s the United States has had deficit, or unbalanced, federal budgets most of the time. This policy of deficit spending led to increasingly large budgets and a growing national debt. The United States entered World War II with a national debt ot about $40 billion. The government emerged from the war owing nearly $259 billion. By 1992 the national debt reached nearly $4 trillion. Organize into four groups to research and analyze the two ways to reduce the federal deficit. Two groups will research and present arguments for and against raising taxes. The two other groups will research and present arguments for and against reduced govern- ment spending. You will have one class period to pre- pare your arguments. Select a rcpre.scntative from your group to report your arguments to the class. The mem- bers of the class should evaluate the arguments ami decide which merhotl would be best. * Mastering Skills Identifying Trends Trends can be identified by studying historical statistics or by examining past events to see if they show a pattern or direction. When they are interpreted correctly, graphs that chart trends over a period of time lend useful informa- tion. There are several questions that help to under- stand the material on such graphs. • What definite patterns or directions can be seen on the graph? • Does the information extend over a significant peri- od of time so that trends can be clearly determined? • What could be some underlying causes of the trends shown on the graph? • What additional information would make the graph more helpful in identifying trends?

Baker Secretary of State December 12, 1991 Section Focus The Soviet Union's rigid central control had stifled the economy and a gigantic miUtary buildup had impoverished the nation. Realizing that change was neces- sary. President Mikhail Gorbachev tried to save the Soviet system through reform and decontrol. His efforts to hold the union together failed. As the old Soviet empire crumbled, the ethnically diverse republics moved toward independence. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • list the events that led to the end of the Soviet Union. • discuss the moves toward democracy throughout Eastern Europe. Throughout the cold war decades, Americans and Soviets had lived under the threat of nuclear war, as each side built nuclear arsenals that included long-range missiles capable of massive destruction. After the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when war between the United States and the Soviet Union seemed imminent, tensions slowly diminished. The United States worked toward detente with the USSR and recognized the People's Republic of China. Still, both sides maintained mighty military arsenals and viewed almost all disputes around the world in terms of the East- West struggle. Then with surprising suddenness, dem- ocratic movements erupted throughout the Soviet Union's Eastern European satel- lites. Popular demands for political, social, and economic reform toppled one com- munist government after another throughout Eastern Europe, until even the Soviet Union split into independent republics. Without a Soviet adversary, the United States faced the challenge of build- ing what President George Bush called \"a new world order. \" A Tidal Wave of Change George Bush came to the presidency with ample experience in foreign policy. He had been Ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador to China, Director of the CIA, and Vice President. This training served Bush well, for he was immediately confronted with a tidal wave of change around the world. Much of this change resulted from the rapid democrati- zation of the Soviet bloc. The disintegra- tion of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet bloc, saw a rise of nationalism, and the outbreak of civil war throughout the Balkans and the Caucasus. In both regions, old ethnic rivalries that commu- nist regimes had long suppressed now reignited into bloody conflict. In the Soviet Union, the economy had grown stagnant and even declined after years of centralized political and economic control by the Soviet Communist party. After Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, he set forth proposals to loosen economic controls. Following Gorbachev's lead, the Communist party changed the structure of the Soviet sys- tem, including a shift of some power to local organizations and limited terms for elected government and part\\' officials. 1060 Unit 10 Redefining Americas Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1099,"pageContent":"These tentative steps toward democracy made the Soviet people demand even greater freedom. The Soviet Union's new liberal policies also incited demands for change in East- ern Europe. In 1989 the people of the satellite nations of Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania overthrew their communist rulers. Polish citizens led the way by voting to remove the Communist party from power, and people from other Eastern European nations forced their governments to allow democratic elections. Most dramatic of all was the tearing down oi the Berlin Wall that divided Germany and that had sym- bolized the \"Iron Curtain\" that divided Europe. As the wall came down, the Sovi- et Union agreed to the reunification of East and West Germany. Then the 74-year-old Soviet experiment itself was swept away. Just as the Soviet republics were about to sign a new union agreement in August 1991, a group of hard-line Communists and other conser- vative forces proclaimed a new govern- ment in the old communist tradition. The plotters detained Gorbachev at his vaca- tion resort in Crimea. They tailed, howev- er, to take into account Boris Yeltsin, the recently elected president oi the Russian Republic. Appearing before crowds gath- ered in front of the Russian parliament building, President Yeltsin called for non- violent resistance and urged military offi- cials not to carry out the coup leaders' orders. In response to Yeltsin's appeal, Moscow citizens barricaded the parlia- ment building. Tens of thousands of unarmed protestors defied the coup- ordered curfew and stood guard in the rain to protect Yeltsin and his aides in the parliament building. Inside, Yeltsin sup- porters frantically used fax machines and photocopiers to print makeshift newspa- pers for distribution. The coup had faltered horn the begin- ning and collapsed within days. When Gorbachev returned to Moscow, every- thing had changed. Yeltsin, not Gor- bachev, was now in charge. Three days later, Gorbachev resigned as head ol the Communist party and urged that the party be abolished. Even this dramatic act Cl lAI' ri-R 36 T( AXAKI ) A Ntw Chni tJRY could not stem the tide of change. First, the three Baltic republics of Latvia, Esto- nia, and Lithuania won their freedom, and then the remaining 12 republics demanded independence. By year's end, 1 1 had joined in a Commonwealth ol Independent States (CIS). On December 25, 1991, Gorbachev resigned, saying: \"We are living in a new world.\" His resig- nation marked the end of what was left of the Soviet Union. The communist red flag with its hammer and sickle no longer flew over the Kremlin; in its place flew the tri-color Russian flag. The United States quickly recognized Russia and other for- mer Soviet republics. For the United States, the greatest remaining worry was what would become of the former Soviet Union's large stock- pile of nuclear weapons — some 27,000 missiles. About 70 percent of these were in Russia, but the rest had been deployed in LIkraine and other republics. Then, in 1992 the republics agreed to transfer strategic nuclear forces to Russia. The CIS pledged to carry out nuclear disarmament treaties that the Soviet Union had signed. Economic reform proved lar more problematic than disarmament, largely because the new CIS republics laced a severe economic crisis as they converted to a free-market economy.

Russia sought financial aid from the West to help it through this crisis. Although the United States offered agricultural credits and humanitarian aid, rising federal deficits and an economic recession hindered the United States' abil- ity to help its old adversary. Nationalism Reawakened Having long called for the freedom of \"captive nations,\" the United States felt a moral duty to support the transformation from dictatorship to democracy in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and to protect the stability of the new govern- ments. At the same time, the United States and Western Europe sought to avoid being drawn into the ethnic rivalries and renewed nationalism that emerged. 1 he Warsaw Pact, which linked Eastern Europe in a military alliance with the Soviet Union, was terminated in July 1991 and Soviet troops began withdraw- ing Irom Eastern Europe. The West debated the future role of NATO because the biggest remaining challenges were eco- nomic rather than military. In 1989 the United States Congress passed the Support for Eastern European Democracy Act (SEED), authorizing $1 billion in aid to the new democracies and encouraging greater trade and private investments there. Congress also estab- lished a \"Gift for Democracy\" that pro- vided advisers, computer equipment, and other assistance to democratic parliaments in Poland and other Eastern European nations. As symbols of the new relation- ship, presidents Lech Walesa of Poland, Vaclav Havel oi Czechoslovakia, and Boris Yeltsin of Russia addressed joint sessions of Congress to report on the progress of their democratic revolutions. Eastern Europe had great need for help. Their attempts to shift from state-con- trolled economies to market-based economies caused many hardships. Like the Soviet Union, the new governments of Eastern Europe began lifting state controls at a time when their economies were already in sharp decline. Industrial pro- duction fell, prices rose, and unemploy- ment spread. Hardships caused discontent to rise and old ethnic rivalries to flare. Many in the West feared for the survival of Eastern Europe's new freedom. A strong national- ist movement in the province of Slovakia threatened to divide Czechoslovakia. Con- flicts rose between Russian-speaking and Romanian-speaking people in Moldova. Romanians clashed with Hungarian minorities. In the Caucasus, old teuds emerged between Armenia and Azerbai- jan. \"The world was supposed to be a bet- ter place after the Cold War,\" lamented David Anderson, the former U.S. Ambas- sador to Yugoslavia.

As the conflict escalated, and reports ot concentration camps surfaced, pressure increased for the United States and European nations to intervene. President Bush felt reluctant, however, to send American troops. While Eastern Europe fragmented. Western Europe debated unification. In 1991 representatives from the 12 nations of the European Community met in Maastricht, in the Netherlands, and took the first crucial steps toward economic and political union. They approved 2 treaties that would move Western Europe toward a common currency, end trade barriers between their nations, and pave the way for common defense, foreign, and economic policies. In addition, the new Eastern European governments sought entry into the European Community. The desire to create a unified region capable of competing in the global markets tueled this drive for union. Are We Friends?

Indeed, for the innocents caught in this conflict, I pray for their safety. — President George Bush January 16, 1991 Section Focus In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. Many nations joined the United States and President Bush in denouncing the invasion. Iraq's President Saddam Hus- sein refused to withdraw his forces despite several efforts to negotiate with him and economic sanctions against his country. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • list the events that led to conflict between Iraq and coalition forces. • discuss the results of the conflict. The end of the cold war caused Americans to contemplate reap- ing a \"peace dividend\" — funds from reduced military spending could be used to confront domestic prob- lems. But world events quickly dimin- ished such optimism. Americans realized that they could not shrink from their responsibilities as the most powerful mili- tary power in the world. Faced with a series of foreign-policy challenges, Presi- dent Bush acted decisively. When a Unit- ed States grand jury indicted Panama's dictator Manuel Noriega for drug traffick- ing. Bush took steps to remove him from power. At first the United States support- ed Panamanians who wanted to over- throw Noriega. When their attempt failed, the President ordered an invasion of Panama. Noriega surrendered to Amer- ican troops on January 3, 1990, and was taken to the United States where he stood trial and was later convicted. Soon after, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, President Bush had an opportunity to demonstrate what he intended for America's role in the post-cold war world. Crisis in the Middle East The world was stunned on August 2, 1990, when Iraq invaded its oil-rich neighbor Kuwait. Calling the Iraqi move \"naked agression,\" President Bush acted quickly. He imposed economic sanctions, froze $20 billion of Iraqi money in Ameri- can banks, and banned imports of Iraqi oil. Only hours after the invasion, the United Nations passed a resolution con- demning Iraq and demanding that it withdraw its forces. The United Nations also called for all nations to halt trade with Iraq immediately. Many leaders feared, however, that these actions were not enough to force Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, to withdraw his troops from Kuwait or prevent an invasion of Saudi Arabia. Bush obtained assistance from more than 25 countries around the world, including Middle Eastern and European nations, and assembled a huge array of power against Iraq in a military coalition called \"Operation Desert Shield.\" The President also gained support for these actions from the United Nations, which authorized military action to restore Kuwait's independence. For almost 6 months, coalition troops, planes, and ships took no action. The world hoped that sanctions and diplomacy as well as the threat of force would be enough to prevent the fifth major conflict in the region in less than 25 years. 1064 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1103,"pageContent":"George Bush was by no means the first American President to encounter the complex issues that plagued the Middle East. The areas vast oil reserves had long made its stability vital to the United States and to other industrial nations. In part, the crisis in Kuwait was another consequence of the long-standing ethnic and religious conflicts in the region. More directly, the conflict resulted from policies by the United States and other oil-depen- dent nations to keep any Middle Eastern nation or leader from becoming too strong. The United States, for example, had long supported Israel against Arab nations who wanted to return Israeli land to Palestinian control. Yet a balance of power in the region was crucial. So the United States also developed ties with Israel's moderate Arab neighbors, Egypt and Jordan, and pressed Israel to solve the Palestinian issue. Ironically, it was this same desire to maintain the balance of power that led the United States and its allies to arm the dic- tator they now opposed in Kuwait. Con- cerned about growing Iranian power, the United States aided Hussein when he went to war against Iran in 1980. To finance his 8-year war with Iran, Hussein borrowed billions of dollars from his rich neighbors, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Along with these leaders, Hussein feared the spread of Iran's Islamic fundamental- ism and military power. After the war ended in 1988, the Saudis and Kuwaitis wanted repayment from Iraq. Hussein charged that during the war Kuwait had drilled Iraqi oil and that its oil policies were wrecking Iraq's economy. In addition to a change in Kuwaiti oil policies, Hus- sein demanded $27 billion in reparations. When negotiations broke down, 100,000 soldiers that Hussein had amassed on Iraq's southern border poured into Kuwait. In just 12 hours, the tiny nation fell, giving Hussein control of 20 percent of the world's oil reserves. Exactly 24 weeks later, after repeated warnings, negotiation attempts, and a naval blockade failed to resolve the crisis.

After obtaining con- gressional approval, on the evening of Jan- uary 16, 1991, Bush ordered massive air strikes against Iraq. The President announced that Operation Desert Shield had become Operation Desert Storm. He rejected calls for further delay: The world could wait no longer. . . . While the world waited, Saddam Hussein met every overture of peace with open contempt. While the world prayed for peace, Saddam Hussein prepared for war. In the following weeks. United States air and sea forces, aided by coalition allies, unleashed the high-tech weapons of Presi- dent Reagan's 1980s arms buildup. Aided by hundreds of sea-launched missiles, coalition pilots flew more than 2,000 bombing missions a day against military centers, airfields, and bridges in Iraq and Kuwait. Overwhelmed by the power of the weapons arrayed against it, Iraq's response to the coalition's air assault was surprisingly ineffective. Attempting to weaken Arab support for the coalition by drawing Israel into the war, Hussein launched unsuccessful missile attacks on Israel. Partly in response to pleas from the United States, the Israelis did not retaliate. As the bombing continued, so did diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. Soviet diplomats reached an agreement on Iraqi withdrawal, but Iraq attached condi- tions that were not acceptable to the coali- tion. Concerned that a negotiated settlement might allow Iraq's military to remain intact, Bush set a deadline for Hussein's forces to unconditionally with- draw trom Kuwait. On February 23 at 8 P.M., only hours after the deadline passed, a lightning-swift coalition ground assault began. Under the command of General Norman Schwarz- kopf the high-tech armored invasion of Kuwait and Iraq devastated Iraqi forces, softened by 4 weeks of pounding by air. Just 100 hours after the ground offensive began. Allied forces had freed the Kuwaiti people and crushed the Iraqi army. \"Kuwait is liberated,\" Bush told the American people as he announced the end of offensive operations. 'America and the world have kept their word. \" President Bush called off the offensive short of occupying Iraq. Bush wanted Saddam Hussein removed from power, but not at the price of splintering Iraq and leaving it at the mercy of Iran, Syria, and Turkey. Nor did he want to expose Ameri- can troops to the dangers of invading and subduing Iraq. The United States and the United Nations sought instead to disman- tle Iraq's capability to make nuclear and chemical weapons. In the aftermath of the war, the United States helped rebuild Kuwait. It took 9 months to extinguish the 732 oil well fires set by fleeing Iraqi troops. Fire fighters from the United States, Britain, Hungary, China, and the Soviet Union battled the blazes so that Kuwait could once again begin pumping and exporting oil. Mean- while the United States waited to see if Kuwait's ruler would keep his pledge to restore the parliament and allow for more democratic participation in the Kuwaiti government. Although the war reduced the Iraqi threat to Middle East security, questions remained about the prospects for long- term stability in the region. In the wake of the war, the United States pressed hard for a settlement of the larger Arab-Israeli con- flict. Secretary of State James Baker urged Israel to halt settlement of its occupied territories, and pressed Syria, Jordan, and 1066 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1105,"pageContent":"other nations to negotiate with Israel to achieve some form of Palestinian self-rule. Rethinking America's Military Role The Persian Gulf War raised questions about America's military role in the world. Should the United States police the world or should it rely more on collective securi- ty arrangements through the United Nations? How large a military force could it afford? The collapse of the Soviet Union left the United States as the last military superpower. The emergence of Germany and Japan as new economic superpowers suggested, however, that financial power might replace military might in the new world order. In the decades since World War II, the United States carried an overwhelming share of the Free World's military burden. As the federal deficits grew to enormous amounts in the 1980s and 1990s, the United States planned cuts in defense spending. The Pentagon planned a \"draw- down\" that would bring troops home from overseas bases in Europe and Asia. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney called for a \"decade of development, more than of production.\" Although President Bush called for cuts in defense spending. Congress demanded even greater reduc- tions. Military cutbacks and base closings, however, hurt many American cities and towns, from San Diego, California, to Caribou, Maine. Reduction in defense spending also caused job layoffs in mili- tary weapons production. Some experts warned that the LInited States should not let its guard down too quickly. They pointed out that Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, and the People's Republic of C^hina remained communist nations. Although China had instituted some free-market programs, its Cx)mmu- nist party leadership opposed calls for democracy. 1 he party leadership usetl military force to massacre pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.

Within days of the invasion, the United States announced it would send land, air, and naval forces to Saudi Arabia. Coali- tion forces set up a blockade that prevent- ed Iraq from exporting oil and importing arms. The United Nations set a deadline of January 15, 1991, for Iraq to withdraw its troops. When Saddain Hussein refused to ineet the deadline. United States-led air units launched a devastating series of attacks on Iraqi defenses. The coalition's massive ground attacks that followed forced Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait. Chfckinc lOR Understanding 1.

Kiplinger and Knight A. Kiplinger Section Focus While the general standard of living in America remained high in the early 1990s, poverty and homelessness spread. Americans continued to buy more than they sold in world markets, resulting in trade deficits. Despite its economic prob- lems, the United States remained a land of opportunity that attracted new immi- grants from all regions of the globe. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain changes in the United States' balance ot trade. • Identify three major problems facing the United States and the world. The United States had long based its economic prosperity on sell- ing its industrial and agricultur- al goods abroad. Beginning in the 1970s, however, Americans experi- enced annual trade deficits, as they pur- chased far more from foreign nations than they sold in foreign markets. The trade deficit reached a new high of almost $152 billion in 1987. Foreign investors used their excess dollars to buy American com- panies. This investment moved the Unit- ed States from a creditor nation, or lending nation, to a debtor nation, or borrowing one. An increasing number of Americans were employed by foreign- owned companies. From hotels along Waikiki Beach in Hawaii to Rockefeller Center in New York City, foreign-owned buildings dotted the American skyline. By the 1990s, favorable exchange rates and improved productivity and competitive- ness helped American exports rise again. The United States achieved trading sur- pluses with most countries, with the notable exception of Japan. The International Economy While foreign investment in the United States grew, so did American investment in other countries. American investment overseas grew at a rate even faster than its two largest competitors — Japan and Great Britain. American multinational corpo- rations — companies that expand into other countries — often built factories in developing nations where they paid work- ers less than workers in the United States earned. While imports from multination- als added to what was counted as the trade deficit, these same foreign branches of American corporations sold hundreds of billions of dollars of goods overseas. A major global difficulty of the 1980s and 1990s was debt. Developing nations, especially in Latin America and Africa, borrowed more than they could repay. The resulting debt crisis cost the United States and other trading countries billions of dollars in lost exports. To make themselves more competitive in the global economy, American manu- facturers \"downsized.\" They closed some plants and modernized others. Many manufacturers replaced workers with 1068 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1107,"pageContent":"computer-operated machinery. In the automobile industry, for example, com- puterized robots took the place of some assembly-line workers. Displaced workers sought retraining, or took lower-paying jobs. Job opportunities shifted from blue- collar industries to white-collar high-tech- nology companies and service work that required more education and training. In American businesses, the number of pro- fessionals, managers, technicians, and clerical and sales personnel all increased at a greater rate than industrial labor. One of the most striking changes in the new service-industry jobs was the large increase in working women. Women took the largest share of the 12 million new service-industry jobs created during the 1980s. By the early 1990s, women work- ers held about 45 percent of all jobs, a substantial increase in the number of women working outside the home. Women also made inroads into manageri- al positions and the professions, in educa- tion, law, and medicine. Yet for the most part, women's salaries remained below men's, leading to calls for equal pay. Work- ing women also asked employers to pro- vide day-care centers tor their children. Some companies responded to these per- sonal needs, providing flexible hours, coun- seling, and family-related personal leave. On the international front, the eco- nomic and political collapse of the Soviet Union removed the United States' largest military rival. Increasingly, however, the United States faced economic competition from Japan and the European Communi- ty. In 1992 the United States, Canada, and Mexico negotiated the North Ameri- can Free Trade Agreement, making North America the world's largest h'cc trade area. The agreement offered American manu- facturers an opportunity to open factories in Mexico, where wages were lower. At the same time Mexican and (Canadian mar- kets would be open to more American products and services. President Bush promised ih.il the agrcenicm woiikl cre.iic jobs and economic growth in all three counties. Labor unions protested, claim- ing thai lowering tratle b.irriers might mean the loss ol American manufacturing jobs to Mexico. I'Jivironmenialisis point- ed out that Mexican industry operated under much less stringent regulations against pollution. Immigration World economic and political troubles brought a new tide of immigration to the United States. New immigration laws in 1965 had abolished the national quota system, leading to shifts in the pattern of immigration. Immigration from Europe declined, while immigration from Latin America and Asia increased dramatically.

In some school districts in the Southwest, Florida, and New York, a majority of students spoke Spanish. Schools struggled to create a balance between teaching students basic subjects in languages they understood and teach- ing them English. Many of the new immigrants were refu- gees. Some were fleeing political persecu- tion in such nations as Vietnam and Cuba. Others had come to escape the hard- ships of war-torn El Salvador and Nicara- gua. Still others fled for a combination of these reasons, as did thousands of Hait- ians, who left both the political repression Examining Photographs A Haitian woman carries her infant child from a United States Coast Guard vessel at Guantanamao Bay Naval Base.

The total of legal and illegal immigrants to the United States during the 1980s probably reached more than 1 million a year — the greatest number since the early 1 900s. Many of the newcomers took low- paying jobs that most Americans would not perform. The United States sought to stem the tide of illegal immigration without shut- ting the doors that had been open for generations. In 1986 Congress passed an alien amnesty act to enable immigrants who had entered the country illegally to become naturalized citizens. Those who applied and qualified were entitled to gov- ernment benefits and protection. As for- mer President Reagan pointed out in a speech in Japan: We get new energy every year from the waves of immigrants who seek to make their lives and fortunes in our country. . . . Try co)2vincing them that America's best days are behind her. Global Issues Threats to the environment and public health caused controversy in the 1980s and 1990s. A debate arose between those who advocated environmental protection and those who favored greater develop- ment of natural resources. Environmen- talists worried about such problems as acid rain, caused by gases emitted in the burning of fossil fuels. They saw acid rain kill fish, damage crops, and strip forests. On the other side, developers warned that strict laws against acid rain meant higher costs and loss of jobs. In the early 1980s, James Watt, the Rea- gan administration's first Secretary of the Interior, proposed to increase offshore oil drilling and to open wilderness areas to oil and gas exploration. Watt believed these programs would help fill the nations ener- gy needs and reduce dependence on for- eign suppliers, but environmentalists were outraged. Eventually, Watts controversial stands and steadily escalating criticism forced his resignation.

Ozone depletion may cause an increase in skin cancer. Another concern is global warming caused by high levels of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat from the sun in the atmosphere and cause a greenhouse effect. The destruction of rain forests, which absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, compoimds the problem. Many scientists believe that global warming could cause polar ice caps to melt, raising ocean levels and flooding coastal cities. Disposal of wastes, especially toxic and nuclear materials, will also be a continuing issue. The United States alone produces 40 million tons of toxic wastes annually.

All sides seemed to recognize that human survival depended upon the fate of the earth's environment. Speaking for those who believed that more drastic actions were necessary, Douglas Olcsen, president of an Ohio research institute, said: So far we've focused. . . on eliminating waste only to the very end of the production line. . . . To cut waste at its source, maybe we'll have to change the way we make products. Maybe we'll even have to change the products themselves. In 1990 Congress and President Bush reached agreement on tougher standards for automobile exhaust and other clean air hazards. But as the United States slipped into economic recession. Presi- dent Bush chose to emphasize jobs over environmental protection. Vice President Quayle chaired a \"Council on Competi- tiveness\" that eliminated many regula- tions on business, even those that set environmental standards. Over the objec- tions of the Environmental Protection Agency, President Bush sided with the Council and relaxed federal air pollution regulations. In 1992 the United States stood alone at the world environmental conference in Brazil, by refusing to sign a treaty to reduce global warming. The President feared implementing the treaty could hurt the American economy. Public health was also a global issue as many nations faced epidemics of AIDS and drug abuse.

Rather than a time of parades and com- memorations, the anniversary pro- vided a moment for many groups to reflect on what these events meant to them. Some insisted that the United States accept the multi- cultural character of a nation made up of many people from many cul- tures and tradi- tions. Appropriately, it was a time for everyone to discov- er something about themselves and their nation. tions for the mid-to-late 1990s, there will be about 6 million new cases of AIDS and 15-20 million HIV-infected adults. Its spread in the United States, primarily among homosexual men and drug-users, led to 20,000 deaths a year during the early 1990s, including infants to which the disease was passed from their pregnant mothers. Led by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, the federal government launched a program to educate Americans on the dangers of AIDS. It encouraged voluntary behavioral changes that would reduce the spread of the disease. The government also launched a war against the sale and use of illegal drugs. Troubled over the smuggling of cocaine from South America and the crime wave connected with drug selling, the Bush administration established an Office of National Drug Control Policy. The gov- ernment attacked the supply of drugs by trying to halt drug smuggling and to pros- ecute drug sellers. It also attacked the demand by putting greater legal and social pressure on drug users. The rising cost of medical care made health a political issue in the 1990s. An estimated 34 million Americans — most of them children and young adults — had no health insurance. Millions of others were inadequately insured. This raised two im- portant questions: should people be able to get adequate health care regardless of their ability to pay for it? And should the federal government support some form of national health insurance? Although the recession and federal deficits made the financing of such a plan difficult, both President Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress proposed national health pro- grams. Democrats favored a \"play or pay\" plan that would require employers to pro- vide medical insurance to their employees or pay a tax to finance a government insurance program. Bush opposed nation- al health insurance and instead proposed tax credits to help poor people pay their medical insurance premiums. He also pro- posed that the government help the chronically ill find insurance coverage. Political differences between the President and Congress stalled adoption of either plan. *•***•*•••*******.

Obj ectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • discuss the reasons for discord between the legislative and executive branches. • identify the economic problems facing the nation during the early 1990s. Unhkc foreign affairs, where i'resident Bush acted decisively to meet the challenges of the new world order, he was accused of wavering leadership in domes- tic affairs. Ikish look office promising to work towards a \"kinder and gentler\" nation. As President he first adopted an easygoing approach to the Democratic majorities in Congress in the hope that the two arms of government could work more closely together. This approach did not work. The legislative agendas of Congress and the White House were so different that compromise was difficult. President Bush complained that he extended his hand to the congressional leaders \" — and they bit it.\" Divided Government When George Bush was elected Presi- dent, he faced large opposition party majorities in both houses of Congress. Neither Bush nor the Democratic leaders showed much willingness to give in to the other. Congress ignored or drastically changed many of the President's propos- als. The President, in turn, vetoed many bills, knowing that the Democrats lacked the two-thirds vote needed to override his vetoes. The executive and legislative branches of the government became grid- locked over such issues as reducing the federal deficit, reforming campaign financing, improving public education, and reinvigorating the economy. Each side blamed the other for the gridlock, and public approval ratings for both the President and Congress fell sharply. High federal deficits forced President Bush to break his campaign pledge of \"no new taxes.\" When budget deficits rose to record levels of more than $300 billion. Bush conceded that some revenue increas- es would be necessary to cut the deficit. In 1990, after weeks of tense negotiations with congressional leaders, the Bush ad- ministration emerged with an agreement to make deep cuts in Medicare and mili- tary spending, while raising gasoline, tobacco, and other user taxes. Strong opposition to the plan emerged from the public and from conservative Republicans in Congress, causing the first budget com- promise to be defeated. After further wrangling, a new tax bill was enacted. Criticism of this accord from conserva- tives later caused the President to admit that he had made a mistake. The budget crisis strengthened the per- ception that the President's domestic pro- grams lacked direction.

Over what issues did the Presi- dent and Congress dis- agree? Bush declared a \"War on Drugs,\" the administration's programs could not stem the rising tide of drug-related crimes. Bush had also pledged to be the \"Educa- tion President\" and improve the environ- ment. Yet the deficits left little fianding available for new programs. The recession forced states to make deep cuts in educa- tional spending, and the Bush administra- tion increasingly opposed environmental protection regulations that might cut jobs. A Persistent Recession The Reagan era had promised national economic growth and celebrated the accu- mulation of personal wealth. At the end of the 1980s, such popular books as Tom Wolfe's novel. The Bonfire of the Vanities, and Kevin Phillips' study, The Politics of Rich and Poor, prompted Americans to reconsider their preoccupation with money and luxury. Tax cuts and deregula- tion ot business had spurred economic activity, but much of it proved to be non- productive. Instead of creating savings, it produced debt. Instead of healthy invest- ments and industrial productivity, much of the new wealth went into everything from yachts and expensive imported cars to real estate and the construction of end- less office complexes and shopping mails. During the early 1990s the national economy grew more slowly than at any time since the end of World War II. Among other factors, sharply rising oil prices following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait threw the American economy into a reces- sion that spread to every region of the country. State governments, already hard hit by cutbacks in federal aid to the states, faced a dilemma: raise taxes or cut ser- vices. Unable to decide on either unpopu- lar course, California reached a budget deadlock that forced it to issue \"lOUs\" to its creditors. Voters expressed their anger at governors who raised taxes. At the same time, however, citizens did not want their basic services, such as state education and health programs, cut. The recession persisted longer than expected, partly because of consumer and corporate debts incurred during the 1980s. Deregulation had allowed banks and savings and loans to lend money more freely. Corporations funded mergers with \"junk bonds\" that placed high inter- est rates on the repayment of debt. Con- sumers ran up large debts on credit cards and home mortgages. In like manner, the federal government spent far more than it received in tax revenue. Eventually, these debts limited the ability of consumers, corporations, and the government to spend and invest. Rather than add to the economy through new purchases, con- sumers needed to pay off old debts. Com- panies that financed expansion through \"junk bonds\" had higher debts and fewer resources for investment. With business no longer expanding, vast new office space went vacant. Banks that had loaned money to construct the office buildings were not being repaid and had to cut back on new loans or close down altogether. Federal and state governments spent an ever-larger share of their tax revenues just on paying the interest on their debts. Banks and savings and loans failed at rates unseen since the Great Depression. Well-known airlines went out of business. Famous department stores filed for bankruptcy. Automobile manufacturers and other industries announced plant closings and major layoffs of workers. As consumer confidence sank.

He pointed out that stock prices were high, inflation was low, and that unemployment had been worse in previous recessions. Still, people felt insecure and leared that their standard of living could decline. Assuring the nation that recovery was just around the corner. President Bush asked Congress to cut the tax on capital gains — profits made on investments — to stimulate investment. Democrats charged that capital gains cuts benefited only the wealthy. Democrats urged instead that the government raise taxes on the wealthy to permit tax cuts for the middle class. Because neither side could move without the other, the continued gridlock between the President and Congress hampered efforts to deal with the recession. To deal with federal deficits, the Presi- dent favored constitutional amendments requiring a balanced budget and a line- item veto (permitting the President to veto a single portion of an appropriations bill without vetoing the entire bill). His opponents viewed a balanced budget amendment as too restrictive on govern- ment's ability to act, and the line-item veto as weakening Congress's \"power of the purse.\" Repeatedly, the amendments tailed to gain passage. By mid- 1992 almost 10 million Ameri- can workers were unemployed. Another 6 million workers were underemployed- holding part-time jobs while looking lor full-time work. As unemployment rose, many people migrated from one state to another in search of jobs, and some found themselves among the ranks of the home- less. Homeless people included battered women, runaway children, alcoholics, drug abusers, deinstitutionalized mental patients, and people lacking family sup- port. Homelessness reflected rising rents, lower wages for unskilled workers, and the urgent need for low-cost housing pro- grams. Estimates of the number of home- less people in American cities ranged as high as 3 million. The recession, poverty, and homeless- ness hit particularly hard at African Amer- icans living in inner cities.

Conservatives blamed the Los Angeles riots on welfare programs that weakened the family and individual initiative, while liberals blamed the government's general neglect of inner cities during the Reagan-Bush years. Election of 1992 After victory in the Persian Gulf War, President Bushs reelection seemed assured. Several leading Democrats declined to run against him. The lengthening recession, however, raised new doubts about Bush's leadership, causing new challengers to enter the race. At the same time, public opinion turned against all incumbents — those holding office — and Washington \"insiders.\" Voters blamed incumbents for the reces- sion, budget deficits, and government gridlock. Revelations that many members of the House of Representatives had repeatedly bounced checks at the House bank outraged many citizens. An unusu- ally large number of representatives decid- ed not to run for reelection or were defeated in primary elections. Further angered when members ol Congress voted to raise their own salaries, many political leaders and citizens took action. As a result, the states ratified a 202-year-old amendment to the Constitution in 1992. Originally proposed by James Madison, the Twenty-seventh Amendment forbids any congressional pay raise from taking effect until after the next election, giving the voters a chance to act. Many of the candidates seeking office in 1992 were women. Some of them ran in reaction to the furor surrounding one of President Bush's Supreme Court appoin- tees — Clarence Thomas. When Bush had nominated Thomas in 1991, one of the justice's former coworkers, law professor Anita Hill, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Thomas had sexually harassed her. Thomas adamantly denied the charge. Constituents flooded the capital with phone calls and telegrams expressing their opinion. The Senate nar- rowly confirmed Thomas to the Supreme Court, but many Americans were angry. Noting the absence of any women on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and that only 2 of the 100 senators were women, they argued that \"2 percent is not enough.\" Building on the rising 1076 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1115,"pageContent":"discontent, more women ran for the Sen- ate and other political office.

The staunchly conservative Buchanan attacked Bush for breaking his pledge of \"no new taxes. ' Although he garnered as much as 30 percent oi the vote in some primaries, Buchanan was never able to defeat Bush. Nevertheless, Buchanan's strong showing demonstrated the weakness of the President's support among conservatives. The leading Demo- cratic candidates included former Mas- sachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas, who advocated reducing the foderal deficit, for- mer California governor Jerry Brown, who called for sweeping reforms in cam- paign spending, and Arkansas governor Bill Clinton, who advocated relief for middle-class taxpayers. Early in the pri- maries, the press raised questions about Clinton's character and his failure to serve in the military during the Vietnam War. Yet after Clinton won impressive victories in the southern state primaries and in such pivotal industrial states as Illinois and New York, he emerged as the front- runner. A third-party challenge appeared when Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot promised to run as an independent if volunteers could collect enough petitions to get his name on all 50 state ballots. The outpour- ing of volunteers again showed the pub- lic's unhappiness with the 2 major parties and a widespread demand for change. After years of division, the Democrats united at their convention to nominate Governor C'linton for President and Ten- nessee Senator Albert Ciore, Jr., for Vice President.

Together they pledged a campaign that stressed Ameri- ca's need to be safe and strong both at home and abroad, integrating military and diplomatic strength with economic security. \"The key to America's growth, ex- pansion, and innovation, \" said Baker, \"has always been America's openness to trade, to investment, to ideas, and to people.\" Bill Clinton agreed with President Bush on many areas of foreign policy and had supported the Persian Gulf War. Clinton, however, charged that Bush lacked \"a vision of our role in this new era. \" In Clintons view. Bush too often had sided \"with familiar tyrants rather than those who would overthrow them — with the old geography of repression rather than a new map of freedom.\" Bushs supporters responded by stressing Bushs leadership during the end of the cold war, a time of \"historic changes that have made the world and country much safer.\" Linking foreign policy with domestic issues, Clinton painted the recession as the Presidents \"most glaring foreign poli- cy failure.\"' He pledged to revive the Examining Photographs The three major presiden- tial candidates, Bill Clinton, H.

At first the Americans, along with French, Canadian, and other international forces, encountered no opposition, but the threat of violence loomed. Despite the uncer- tainty of the mission. President-elect Clin- ton praised Bush for \"taking the lead in this important humanitarian effort.\" The Triumph of Democracy The collapse of the Soviet Union and emergence of democracies in Russia and Eastern Europe made it clear that the ide- als of the American Revolution remain valid. A worker participating in the gener- al strike that precipitated democracy in Czechoslovakia began his speech by quot- ing the Declaration of Independence. Nelson Mandela, long imprisoned in South Africa because ol his opposition to apartheid — or racial segregation — told a joint session of Congress, \"We could not have known of your Declaration ot Inde- pendence and not elected to join in the struggle to guarantee the people life, liber- ty and the pursuit of happiness.\" A Chinese sudent in Tiananmen Square invoked a goal expressed by Abraham Lin- coln more than a century earlier. When asked why she would wish to go out and \"argue with a tank,\" she said, \"Govern- ment of the people, by the people, and for the people.\" Americans continue to take hope today like Lincoln in 1863; I I'lhiil this ihilidii. uiiflcr (ioA. slkill hiivc d iicw hirlh offreivloiu: luul ihiit ^ovomncnl oj the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. k -k -k * * Section Four Review • *•*** • * ******** Summary President Bush's decisive actions in the Persian Gulf War drew enthusiastic sup- port. In sharp contrast, government was stymied in solving the economic woes plaguing the nation. Differences between the Bush administration and the Demo- cratic-controlled Congress grew so acute that both sides had trouble compromising on taxes, the deficit, and economic plan- ning.

Mikhail Gorbachev's restructuring of the Soviet Union's eco- nomic and political systems led to demands for even greater change. The Soviet reform movement was also embraced by other Eastern European nations. Finally, the Soviet Union itself crumbled. Some of the former Soviet republics entered the new Commonwealth of Independent States. The rapidly changing face of Eastern Europe created challenges and opportunities for American foreign policymakers. United States leaders faced another challenge, this time in the Middle East, when Iraq invaded and occu- pied Kuwait in August 1990. After nearly 6 months of negotiations and economic pressure, Iraqi leader Sad- dam Hussein showed no signs of removing his troops from Kuwait. Finally, in January 1991, forces from a coalition of more than 25 nations defeated Iraqi forces in the Persian Gulf War and liberated Kuwait. Beginning in the 1970s, the United States experi- enced a new problem — a trade deficit. The American people and government and business leaders pondered ways to deal with the deficit and other economic and social problems that troubled the nation. These included the job market, salaries, environmental con- cerns, AIDS, drug abuse, and medical care. Federal government attempts to address these prob- lems produced few long-lasting solutions. Partisan poli- tics played a role in the deadlock. The Bush admini- stration and the Democratic-controlled Congress often were at odds and found it difficult to compromise. * Using Vocabulary Assume that you are a magazine reporter covering the state of the economy today.

Explain your answer. * Writing About History Argumentation Refer to the description oi how to write an argu- mentation essay in the History Writer's Handbook in the Appendix of this book. Your teacher will give you more specific instructions on the essay's length and the assignment's due date. Write an argument that supports or an argument that opposes free trade between nations. State the con- troversy or problem clearly and give your position or your solution to the problem. Gather relevant facts and statistics that support your position and refute opposing positions. * Learning Cooperatively 'When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, Ameri- cans compared the actions of Iraqi leader Saddam Hus- sein to Hitler's aggression before World War II. Many Arabs, however, supported Hussein. Work with a part- ner and imagine that you each represent your nation in a debate before the United Nations General Assembly. First decide who will represent the United States and who will be the Iraqi delegate. Then prepare a state- ment that explains your nation's viewpoint and justifies its actions. Exchange statements with your partner and write a rebuttal to each other's point ot view. * Mastering Skills Developing a Global Point of View Americans who travel to other countries are sur- prised to find that people there often have points of view quite dilferent horn their own. This is because poincs ol view in every culture are attecieil li\\' the val- ues of that culture, which are the result of its religious beliefs, history, economic conditions, or even the pro- paganda of its leaders. Mass communications are mak- ing various points of view better known in the world, but that may not change long-established differences among peoples. In an interdependent world, it is vital to understand these different points of view — to develop a broad perspective, or a global point of view. This may not change one's personal values, but it helps each person to understand the values of persons in other cultures and the reasons for any differences in point of view. To develop a global point of view, follow these guidelines: • Become informed by talking with others, listening to news broadcasts, and by reading newspapers, magazines, and books. • In your listening and reading identify individuals or groups from other nations who express points of view different from those you hold. • Consider why each person or group may hold its point of view. Example Read the following statement made by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies in December 1990, after Iraq seized Kuwait, and see how the guide- lines have been followed. \"[W]e have no moral right to reconcile ourselves to aggression and the annexation of a small defenseless country charges are made that the Foreign Minis- ter plans to land troops in the Persian Gulf Nobody is going to send. ..even a single rep- resentative of the Soviet armed forces there. \" (As foreigu minister, Shevardnadze was stating his gov- ernments offieial point of view. The Soviet Union eoii- denined Iraq's aggression but did not commit troops against Iraq. Internal problems in the Soviet Union and a concern about its fiititre relations with Iraq affected the Soviet point of view. The United Nations supported the use of force agai>ist Iraq, but each nation acted in its own perceived interests. Some responded militarily. A few sup- ported Iraq's leader, Saddam Hussein.) Practice Select a news article from a recent foreign newspaper. Apply these guidelines to the point of view presented.

The nation made progress toward solving difficult social, economic, and political problems at home and abroad. Chapter 32 New Frontiers In the 1950s African Americans re- newed their fight for full equality and an end to segregation and discrimination. A quiet pioneer of the civil rights movement was Rosa Parks, who in 1956 refused to give her seat on a Montgomery bus to a white man. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., emerged as the leader of a nonviolent protest against unjust segregation laws. In 1961 the presidency passed from Dwight D. Eisenhower to John F. Kennedy. Kennedy wanted to stimulate the economy and to improve life for the poor but he moved cautiously on civil- rights legislation. Foreign policy, however, soon became Kennedy's major concern. Like his prede- cessors, he wanted to contain commu- nism. In Cuba Kennedy approved of a secret invasion attempt, which failed. When the Soviet Union then placed mis- siles in Cuba, Kennedy's resolve in avoid- ing nuclear war earned him respect worldwide. He also created the Peace Corps, a program that has sent thousands of volunteers to work in developing coun- tries. Berlin, Laos, and Vietnam also became trouble spots. In Berlin the Communists built a wall dividing the city when the United States and its allies refused to withdraw. Kennedy, however, was able to negotiate a test-ban treaty with the Sovi- ets. In Indochina, Kennedy increased the number of American military advisers to help counter the communist threat. Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald before many of his goals could be realized. Chapter 33 The Vietnam Era Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy's succes- sor, vowed to carry out Kennedy's ideals. He persuaded Congress to pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the strongest act of its kind since Reconstruction, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which did away with literacy tests to qualify voters. Johnson also waged a \"war on poverty\" that helped poor people help themselves. Johnson was less successful in foreign affairs. The 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolu- tion permitted the number of troops in Vietnam to escalate. As the war raged abroad, however, social unrest brewed at home. Many African Americans, dissatisfied with the slow progress of civil rights, proclaimed \"black power.\" Students, too, became more mili- tant in their antiwar protests. Many youth rebelled against the draft and pressures for social conformity. They dropped out, forming a \"counter culture. \" Social turmoil intensified during 1968. In Vietnam, the Tet offensive demonstrat- ed that the Americans were far from victo- ry. At home assassins murdered Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy — ^John Kennedy's brother and a presidential hopeful. Violence marred col- lege campuses and the Democratic con- vention. Republican candidate Richard Nixon, promising to \"bring the nation together, \" was elected President. Chapter 34 An Imperial Presidency Richard Nixon had great success in for- eign policy. He and Soviet leaders dis- cussed the Arab-Israeli conflict and strategic arms limitations. These negotia- tions culminated in the Moscow summit between Nixon and Soviet Premier Brezh- nev. Nixon also visited and established more open relations with China. 1082 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present"},{"pageNumber":1121,"pageContent":"The Vietnam War, however, eroded Nixon's credibihry at home. He expanded the war into neighboring Cambodia and Laos to stop enemy lines of supply. This effort failed while antiwar protests increased. Finally, Nixon opted for \"Viet- namization,\" the withdrawal of American troops and replacing them with Viet- namese soldiers. At home, the war was not the only issue on American minds. Although an equal rights amendment failed, many women began to examine their traditional roles as wives and mothers. Migrant farm work- ers, many of whom were Mexican Ameri- cans, organized for better wages and benefits. American hidians also displayed a new urgency in demanding their rights. Along with a new social awareness, the presidency was changed as well. When Nixon was reelected in 1972 with 61 per- cent of the vote, few suspected he would be forced out ot office. Soon, however, evidence surfaced of illegal tactics used by his reelection campaign and his personal involvement in a cover-up of the Water- gate break-in. Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment charges. Gerald Ford then assumed the presidency with a promise to restore integrity to the office. Chapter 35 A Search for New Solutions After Vietnam and Watergate, Ameri- cans wanted a change in leadership. Out- sider Jimmy Carter barely defeated Gerald Ford in the 1976 election. Carters domes- tic policy focused on the energy problem. Poor relations with Congress, however, caused his efforts to lalter. Carter's weak leadership ai home con- trasted sharply with his bold initiatives in foreign policy. He won Senate ratification of a new Panama C^anal treaty and took a tough stand against countries that violated human rights, f^is greatest triumph was negotiation of a peace treaty between Israel and Hgypt. Elsewhere, however, h.ui seized American hostages and Carter was unable to secure their release. Republican Ronald Reagan soundly defeated Carter in the 1980 election. Rea- gan's administration was very popular. He cut taxes and dramatically reduced gov- ernment spending on social programs. Americans blamed the President for a brief economic downturn but also credit- ed him with the recovery that followed. During Reagan's second term, he strengthened the space program, increased defense spending, and improved relations with the Soviet Union. His hands-off administrative style, however, led to finan- cial mismanagement and an arms-for- hostage scandal. George Bush succeeded Reagan as Presi- dent. His domestic policies differed only slightly from the Reagan years. In 1990, however, he sent American troops to the Middle East to liberate Kuwait, an oil-rich country taken over by Iraq. Chapter 36 Tow^ard a Ne-vv Century In an extremely short period of time during 1991, the Soviet Union was swept away by the unforeseen series of events. While the Soviet Union no longer existed, profound changes heralded an uncertain future in Eastern Europe. The world faced another crisis in the Middle East when Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990. The following January the United States and coalition forces launched an attack that reduced Iraq's military capabil- ities and liberated Kuwait. Global economic i.ssues included the debt crisis in developing nations and emerging market economies in countries long under communist control. The econ- omy was a major reason for increased immigration lo liie United States. Envi- ronmentalists snuggled with opponents who favored greater use of natural re- sources. Public health issues, such as the AIDS epidemic and drug abuse, continue to take (heir toll and also demand atten- tion.

Read the excerpt, and answer the questions from page 1011. ...Outside the U.S. there are very influential people who want America to stop exporting so many media and entertainment products. . . .A growing protectionist senti- ment threatens to add new restrictions to those already in place. . . . Last year, the European Economic Community decided that, starting in 1993, at least 51 percent of all television programming in member nations must be of European origin. ...The explanation that's given for this new and improved protectionism is almost always the same: Amer- ican ctdtural imperialism. For some it's become a kind of mantra, conjuring up images of a colossus busy imposing its culture on one people after another. ...it is precisely because of this insistent distortion of what is really occurring that we must be clear about a few fundamentals. First, American culture is not an imperialistic export being shoved down the throats oj unwilling colonists. ...We require no nation, province or individual to buy our magazines, watch our 71^ programs, attend our movies, or listen to our records. ...Yet those who perceive that the world's old ways are being overthrown aren't hallucinating Culturally and ecoiwmically, we are bei)ig drawn together as never before.

Later, it became a model for colonists who carried the Magna Carta's guarantees of legal a>id political rights to America. 1, That the English church shall be free, and shall have her rights entire, and her liberties inviolate;. . . 2. We also have granted to all the freemen of our kingdom, for us and for our heirs forever, all the underwritten liberties, to be had and holden by them and their heirs, of us and our heirs forever. . . . 39. No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or diseased, or outlawed, or banished, or in any way destroyed, nor will we pass upon him, nor will we send upon him, unless by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land. 40. We will sell to no man, we will not deny to any man, either justice or right. 41. All merchants shall have safe and secure conduct to go out of, and to come into, Eng- land, and to stay there and to pass as well by land as by water, for buying and selling by the ancient and allowed customs, without any unjust tolls, except in time of war, or when they are of any nation at war with us. . . . 42. It shall be lawful, for the time to come, for any one to go out of our kingdom and return safely and securely by land or by water, saving his allegiance to us (unless in time of war, by some short space, for the common ben- efit of the realm). 60.

George Washington spoke of the dangers facing the young nation. He warned against the dangers of political paities and sectionalism, and adrised the nation against permanent alliances with other nations. Citizens by birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you, in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discrim- inations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a common cause fought and triumphed together. . . . In contemplating the causes which may dis- turb our Union, it occurs as matter of serious concern that any ground should have been fur- nished for characterizing parties by geographi- cal discriminations: Northern and Southern; Atlantic and Western. . . . No alliances, however strict between the parts, can be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the infractions and inter- ruptions which all alliances in all times have experienced. . . . The basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their consti- tutions of government. But the constitution which at any time exists, till changed by an explicit and autiientic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. . . . The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is in extending our commercial relations to have with them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be ful- filled with perfect good faith. . . . Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by that fei-vent love toward it which is so natural to a man who views in it the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several generations, I anticipate with pleasing expectations that retreat in which I promise myself to realize, without alloy, the sweet enjoy- ment of partaking, in the midst of my fellow cit- izens, the benign influence of good laws under a free government, the ever favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutLial cares, labors, and dangers. The Star-spangled Banner During the British honihardnieni of Foil McHeniy during the War of 1812. a young Baltimore lawyer named Francis Scoll Key was inspired to write the words to \"We Star-Spangled Banner.\" Although it became popular inniiediately. it was not uiUil 19^1 that Congress officially declared \"The Star-Spa nglecJ Banner\" as our nalioiml anthern.

Tlie doctrine was designed to end European i>if!iience in the Western Hemi- sphere. In addition, it showed the world the American spirit of strength and unity, and became a cor- nerstone of United States foreign policy A precise knowledge of our relations with foreign powers as respects our negotiations and transactions with each is thought to be particu- larly necessary. . . . In the discussions to which this interest has given rise . . . the occasion has been judged proper for asserting, as a principle in which the rights and interests of the United States are involved, that the American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future coloniza- tion by any European powers. . . . The citizens of the United States cherish sen- timents the most friendly in favor of the liberty and happiness of their fellowmen on that side of the Atlantic. In the wars of the European powers in matters relating to themselves we have never taken any part, nor does it comport with our policy so to do. It is only when our rights are invaded or seriously menaced that we resent injuries or make preparation for our defense. With the movements in this hemisphere we are of necessity more immediately connected, and by causes which must be obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers. The politi- cal system of the allied powers is essentially dif- ferent in this respect from that of America. This difference proceeds from that which exists in their respective governments; and to the defense of our own, which has been achieved by the loss of so much blood and treasure, and matured by the wisdom of their most enlight- ened citizens, and under which we have enjoyed unexampled felicity, this whole nation is devoted. We owe it, therefore, to candor and to the amicable relations existing between the United States and those powers to declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemi- sphere as dangerous to our peace and safety. With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European pcjwer we have not interfered and shall not interfere. But with the govern- ments v,'ho have declared their independence and maintained it, and whose independence we have, on great consideration and on just princi- ples, acknowledged, we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any other manner their destiny, by any European power in any other light than as the manifestation of any unfriendly disposition toward the United States. In the war between those new governments and Spain we declared our neutrality at the time of their recognition, and to this we have adhered, and shall continue to adhere, provided no change shall occur which, in the judgment of the com- petent authorities of this government, shall make a corresponding change on the part of the United States indispensable to their security. Our policy in regard to Europe, which was adopted at an early stage of the wars which have so long agitated that quarter of the globe, nevertheless remains the same, which is not to interfere in the internal concerns of any of its powers; to consider the government de facto as the legitimate government for us; to cultivate friendly relations with it, and to preserve those relations by a frank, firm, and manly policy, meeting in all instances the just claims of every power, submitting to injuries from none. But in regard to those continents, circumstances are eminently and conspicuously different. It is impossible that the allied powers should extend their political system to any portion of either continent without endangering our peace and happiness; nor can anyone believe that our southern brethren, if left to themselves, would adopt it of their own accord. It is equally impossible, therefore, that we should behold such interposition in any form with indifference. If we look to the comparative strength and resources of Spain and those new governments, and their distance from each other, it must be obvious that she can never subdue them. It is still the true policy of the United States to leave the parties to themselves, in the hope that other powers will pursue the same course. 1114 Documents of America's Heritage"},{"pageNumber":1153,"pageContent":"The Seneca Falls Declaration One of the first clocumeuts to express the desire for equal rights for women is the Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions, issued in 1848 at the Seneca Falls Corwentiou i)i New York. Led by Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stantoti, the delegates adopted a set of resolutions that called for woman suffrage and opportunities in employment and education. When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among the people of the earth a position different from that which they have hitherto occupied, but one to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes that impel them to such a course. We hold the.se truths to be self-evident; that all men and women are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, lib- erty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from the consent of the gov- erned. Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of those who suffer from it to refuse allegiance to it, and \\.o insist upon the institution of a new government, laying its foundation on such prin- ciples, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes;. . . But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their duty to tlirow off such government and to prosidc new guards for their ftiture security. . . .

He has endeavored, in eveiy way that he could, to destroy her confidence in her own powers, to lessen her self-respect, and to make her willing to lead a dependent and abject life. Now, in view of the entire disfranchisement of one-half the people of this country, their social and religious degradation, in view of the unju.st laws above mentioned, and because women do feel themselves aggrieved, oppressed, and fraudulently deprived of their most sacred rights, we insist that they have immediate admission to all the rights and privi- leges which belong to them as citizens of the United States. . . . Resolved, that woman is man's etjual, was intended to be so by the Creator, and the high- est good of the race demands that she shotild be recognized as such.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is alto- gether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate — we can not consecrate — we can not hallow — this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it far beyond our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full mea- sure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people, shall not per- ish from the earth.

President Woodroiv Wilson went before Congress to offer a statement of aims called the Fourteen Points. Wilson s plan called for freedom of the seas in peace and war. an end to secret alliances, and equal trading rights for all countries. The excerpt that follows is taken from the President's message. It will be our wish and purpose that the pro- cesses of peace, when they are begun, shall be absolutely open and that they shall involve and permit henceforth no secret understandings of any kind. The day of conquest and aggrandize- ment is gone by, so is also the day of secret covenants entered into in the interest of particu- lar governments and likely at some unlooked- for moment to upset the peace of the world. It is this happy fact, now clear to the view of e\\'ery public man whose thoughts do not still linger in an age that is dead and gone, which makes it possible for every nation whose pur- poses are consistent with justice and the peace of the world to avow now or at any other time the objects it has in view. We entered this war because violations of right had occurred which touched us to the quick and made the life of our own people impossible unless they were corrected and the world secured once for all against their recurrence. What we demand in this war, therefore, is nothing peculiar to our- selves. It is that the world be made fit and safe to live in; and particularly that it be made safe for every peace-loving nation which, like our own, wishes to live its own life, determine its own institutions, be assured of justice and fair dealings by the other peoples of the world, as against force and selfish aggression. All the peo- ples of the world are in effect partners in this interest, and for our own part we see very clear- ly that unless justice be done to others it will not be done to us. The program of the world's peace, therefore, is our program, and that program, the only pos- sible program, as we see it, is this: I. Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be no private interna- tional understandings of any kind, but diploma- cy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view. II. Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside territorial waters, alike in peace and in war, except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of international covenants. III. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance. IV. Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will be reduced to the low- est point consistent with domestic safety. V. Free, open-minded, and absolutely impar- tial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the population concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the Government whose title is to be deter- mined. . . . XTV. A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the pur- pose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity^ to great and small states alike. In regard to these essential rectifications of wrong and assertions of right, we feel ourselves to be intimate partners of all the governments and peoples associated together against the imperialists. We cannot be separated in interest or divided in purpose. We stand together until the end. . . . We have spoken, now, surely, in terms too concrete to admit of any further doubt or ques- tion. An evident principle runs through the Y\\hole program I have outlined. It is the princi- ple of justice to all peoples and nationalities, and their right to live on equal terms of liberty and safety with one another, whether they be strong or weak. Unless the principle be made its foundation, no part of the structure of interna- tional justice can stand. The people of the Unit- ed States could act upon no other principle, and to the vindication of this principle they are ready to devote their lives, their honor, and everything that they possess. The moral climax of this, the culminating and final war for human liberty, has come, and they are ready to put their o'w.'n strength, their own highest purpose, their o'wn integrity and de\\^otion to the test. 1118 Documents of Americ^'.s Heritage"},{"pageNumber":1157,"pageContent":"Franklin Roosevelt's First Inaugural Address The New Deal was laiDiched March 4, 1933- the a time when the nation was in the depths of the Gr of leadership and encouraged the American people.

Board of Education that racial segrega- tion in public schools was u)iconstitutional. This decision provided the legal basis for court challenges to segregation in eveiy aspect of America): life. The plaintiffs contend that segregated public schools are not \"equal\" and cannot be made \"equal.\" and that hence they are deprived of the equal protection of the laws. Because of the obvious importance of the question presented, the Court took jurisdiction. . . . Our decision . . . cannot turn on merely a comparison of these tangible factors in the Negro and white schools involved in each of the cases. We must look instead to the effect of segregation itself on public education. In approaching this problem, we cannot turn the clock back to 1868 when the Amendment was adopted, or even to 1896 when Plessy v. Ferguson was written. We must consider public education in the light of its full development and its present place in American life through- out the nation. Only in this way can it be deter- mined if segregation in public schools deprives these plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws. Today, education is perhaps the most impor- tant function of state and local governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demon- strate our recognition of the importance of edu- cation to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizen- ship. Today it is a principal instrument in awak- ening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in help- ing him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be macie available to all on equal terms. We come then to the question presented: Does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other \"tangible\" factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority' group of equal educational opportuni- ties? We believe that it does. In Sweatt v. Painter. . . .in finding that a seg- regated law school for Negroes could not pro- vide them equal educational opportunities, this Court relied in large part on \"those qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for greatness in a law school.\" In McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, . . .the Court, in requiring that a Negro admitted to a white graduate school be treated like all other students, again resorted to intangible considera- tions: \" . . .his ability to study, to engage in dis- cussions and exchange views with other students, and, in general, to learn his profes- sion.\" Such considerations apply with added force to children in grade and high schools. To separate them from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race gener- ates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone. The effect of this separation on their educational opportunities was well stated by a finding in the Kansas case by a court which nevertheless felt compelled to rule against the Negro plaintiffs: \"Segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the poli- cy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group. A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn. Segregation with the sanction of law, therefore, has a tendency to retard the edu- cational and mental development of Negro chil- dren and to deprive them of some of the benefits they would receive in a racially inte- grated school system.\" . . . .We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.

In his address Kennedy stirred the nation hy calling for \"a gra)id and global alliance\" to fight tyran- ny, poverty, disease, and war We observe today not a victoiy of party but a celebration of freedom — symbolizing an end as well as a beginning — signifying renewal as well as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our fore- bears prescribed nearly a century and three- quarters ago. The world is veiy different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe — the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God. We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans i^orn in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bit- ter peace, proud of our ancient heritage — and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world. Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any iiardsiiip, support any friend, oppose any ibe to assure the survival and the success of liberty. This much we pledge^and more. To tlujse old allies whose cultural and spiritu- al origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United, there is little we cannot dcj in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided, there is little we can do . . . Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate. . . . Let both sides explore what [problems uniie us instead of bela- boring those problems w liii h divide us. ... Lei both sides seek to invoke iIr' wonders of sci- ence instead of its terrors. I'ogether let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce. All this will not be finished in the first 100 days. Nor will it be finished in the first 1,000 days, not in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin. In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty. . . . Now the tRimpet summons us again — not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need — not as a call to battle, though embattled we are — but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out. \"rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation\" — a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, po\\erty. disease, and war itself. In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum dan- ger. I do not shrink from this responsibility — I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the de\\(>tion which we bring to this endeavor will light our cijuntry and all who ser\\'e it — and the glow from that fire can truly light the world. And so, my fellow Americans — ask not what your countiy can do for you — ask what you can do for your country. My fellow citizens of the world — ask not what American will do for you but what togeth- er we can do for the freedom of man. Finally, whether you are citizens o{ America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with histoiy the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we lo\\e, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earili C'lod's work must trulv be our own.

Jr., led more than 200,000 people on a march on Washington. On the steps of the Lincoln Memorial he gave a stirring speech in which he eloquently spoke of his dreams for African Americans and for the United States. Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joy- ous daybreak to end the long night of captivity. But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segrega- tion and the chains of discrimination. One hun- dred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. . . . Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. . . Notv is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of God's children. . . . There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, \"when will you be satisfied?\" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. . . .We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi can- not vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. . . . I say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\" I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be trans- formed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the con- tent of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day the state of Alaba- ma, whose governor's lips are presently dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, will be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls and walk together as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, ever\\' hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glorv^ of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. This is our hope. This is the faith with which I return to the South. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work togeth- er, to pray together, to staiggle together, to go jail together, to stand up for freedom together, know- ing that we will be free one day. This will be the clay when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning. \"My coun- try 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.

They wanted to make us implacable enemies. That affected the destinies of the world in a most tragic way. The world was shaken by the storms of con- frontation. It was close to exploding, close to perishing beyond salvation. That evil scenario is becoming a thing of the past. Reason begins to triumph over madness. We have left behind the period when America and Russia looked at each other through gun- sights, ready to pull the trigger at any time .... The world can sigh in relief. The idol of com- munism, which spread eveiywhere social strife, animosity, and unparalleled baitality which instilled fear in humanity, has ct)llapsed. It has collapsed, never to rise again. I am here to assure you, we shall not let it rise again in our land. . . . There is no people on this Earth who could be harmed by the air of freedom. There are no exceptions to that rule. Liberty sets the mind free, fosters indepen- dence, and unorthodox thinking and ideas. But it does not offer instant prosperity or hajipiness and wealth to eveiyone. . . . The experience of the past decades has taught us, communism has no human face. Freedom and communism are incompatible.

Partnership and friendship of our two largest democracies in .strenghtening democracy is indeed a great goal. joining the world community, we wish to preserve our identity, our own image and histo- ly, promote culture, and strengthen moral stan- dards of our people. . . . At the same time, Russia does not aspire to change the world in its own image. It is the fun- damental principle of the new Russia to be gen- erous and to share experience, moral values, and emotional warmth, rather than to impo.se and coerce.

This process has tiiree phases: prewriting, writing, and revising. Each of these phases involves different activities. To use the writing process effectively, you must engage in the various activities of each phase without taking shortcuts. By going through the following process, you will write paragraphs that convey your ideas effectively, cohesively, and coherently. Phase 1: Prewriting • Identify your audience and puipose. Your basic aim in writing is to communicate ideas and information to an individual or a group of people. Therefore, when you write, you should always predetermine your specific audience. In history and other social studies classes, your audience will usually be your teacher and your classmates — persons whom you know and who share an interest in the sub- ject you are writing about and in what \\'oli have to say about it. Determining your purpose for writing is as important as determining your audience. A paragraph you write to a friend to explain how you won $100. for example, will he far different from a paragraph you write to persuade your neighbors to donate money in support of a new recycling program. Brief descriptions with examples of 8 purposes of writing follow on pages 1125-1129. This part of the History Writ- er's Handbook will assist you in choosing and executing the proper kind of writing for your specific purpose. For example, read the model paragraph in the box below. The writer's audience is his or her teacher and fellow students; the writer's purpose is to inform them of the effects that the coal strike's settlement had. Keep your audience and purpose firmly in mind as you organize and write your para- graph(s). You will find it helpful to jot this information down and remind yourself of it as you write. Decide o)i a topic and topic sentence. You are often given an assignment to write about a broad subject. You must decide on a topic, a narrow, limited aspect of the subject that will be specific enough to be covered in a single paragraph. For example, the writer of the paragraph below was asked to WTite about the 1902 coal strike. He or she narrowed this sub- ject to the topic of the effects of the coal-strike settlement. Topic Sentence Settlement of the coal strike was a partial succe.ss for ever)'one. Supporting Details Roose\\'elt was praised for settling the strike. Roosevelt didn't send in federal troops. Mineowners didn't have to recog- nize the mineworkers' union. Mineworkers won a 10-percent pay increase and a nine-hour work day. The public could stop worrying about lack of fuel in the coming cold winter Big business won because public resentment against business stopped growing. Everyone got a square deal. WRITING PARAGRAPHS First Draft Settlement of the coal strike was a partial success for eveiyone. Mineworkers won a 10-percent pay increase and a nine-hour work day. Mineowners also did not have to recognize a mineworker's union. Rooesevelt was praised for settling the strike without sending in troops. Big business won because public resentment against business stopped growing. The public could stop worrying about lack of fuel for the coming cold winter Everyone got a square deal. Revised Paragraph The coal-strike settlement could be described as a \"square deal for everyone.\" Mineworkers won a 10- percent pay increase and a nine- hour work day but not the recognition of their union. Mine- owners won because they were not forced to recognize the minework- ers' union. Big businesses also won because the settlement successfully stopped the rising tide of public resentment against them. In addi- tion. President Roosevelt earned praise for his part in settling the strike without sending in troops. Even the public benefited, because it could at last stop worrying about a possible fuel shortage. 1124 History Writer's Handbook"},{"pageNumber":1163,"pageContent":"Write a topic sentence that tells the main idea you want to convey about your topic. You may need to draft several versions of the topic sentence or change it during the drafting and revising process. Note the transformation of the topic sentence in the model below. • Develop your topic. Brainstorm, bringing to mind everything you know or can recall about your tc:)pic. List these related ideas and supporting details as each comes to mind. You may first list these as words or phrases, but when your list is com- plete, write a sentence for every item. Then review the sentences to decide whether they genuinely contribute to your purpose. You can then follow the development of ideas into sen- tences below. Phase 2: Writing • Organize your sentences. The purpose for your paragraph generally determines the best way to organize your ideas. Your purpose for writing social studies para- graphs can be to describe something, to tell what happened, to explain, inform, compare, persuade, or to provide definitions and/or examples. Recall your purpose, then arrange your sentences according to the writing pattern best suited to achieving that ]-)urpose. Refer to the rest of this History Writer's Handbook for help in deciding on a purpose and selecting the most appropriate pattern for that purpose. Notice that the pattern used in the model para- graph is classification. • Connect your sentences. Write your sentences in order adding transi- tions and cue words to show relationships between ideas. To see how cues can clarify a writer's purpose, examine the chart on cue words for historical reasoning in the skill le.sson on page 251. Phase 3: Revising and Editing • Rerisi)tg and Editing E.xpand and improve your sentences. var\\'- ing their structure and length, adding modifiers, and revising word choices. Cut sentences that do not contribute to the main idea or that dis- rupt the flow of your paragraph. Finally copyedit your paragraph. Remember that you want to convey your ideas effectively, and that poor punctuation, capitalization, and misspellings will hamper that purpose. Check to be sure that the proper words are capital- ized, that you have used commas and periods correctly, and that there are no misspellings in your paragraph. WRITING FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES The purpose for your writing largely deter- mines how and what you write. Y'our approach, your style, even your word choices are influenced by the purpose. In .social studies such purposes can be to relate a series of events, describe something, make comparisons, persuade, provide examples or definitions, or to explain a cause and its effects. Learning to write narration, descrip- tions, comparisons, persuasions, examjiles, defini- tions, and cause-and-eflect essays will help you to accomplish these goals. Narration 'I'o tell the story of an (.'vent or .i scrii.'s of events, you iise narratixi- wiiting. l'.llecti\\e narr.i- tive writing is carefully organized: events are usu- ally arranged in chronological order. To further clarify the relationships between events, transition- al words and phrases are used.

The writer related the events in chronological order, using temporal (time) words and phrases for additional clarity — as soon as, when, later, too late, three days after, a few hours, finally. Notice too that there are no unnecessary details. The writer included only those that are essential to explain the harshness of her particular pioneer experience. Description Use descriptive Viriting to con\\'ey an experience as concretely and vividly as possible. Descriptive writing incorporates sensory details and/or figures of speech. Sensory details are those that appeal to the senses, making an object or experience con- crete for the reader b)- describing how something looks, feels, tastes, smells, and sounds. Figures of speech, such as simile and metaphor, compare unfamiliar objects or events to those that are famil- iar so that the reader can visualize the object or event exactly. The key to effective descriptive writing is not how many sensory details and figures of speech yoLi use, but rather the kind you use. Effective sensor)- details employ specific adjectives and adverbs and strong, active verbs that command the reader to see what you have seen, hear what you have heard, smell, taste, and felt as you have. Effective similes and metaphors use events and objects so familiar that they not only create a \"vision\" for the reader but a distinct impression in the reader. The first paragraph that follows is a basic para- graph on a dust storm in the 1930s. The second paragraph shows how you can expand the basic paragraph's sentences to convey this experience more vividly and concretely. Think about all of the senses to which these words and phrases appeal. Also look for the similes and metaphors and notice how they help you to \"see\" and \"feel\" what it was like to be in this dust storm. Basic Paragraph On Sunday. April 14. 1935. people on the Great Plains of the United States experienced a dust storm. We blowing dust formed chuck that extended over 1,000 feet into the air and several miles wide. Birds flew to escape the choking dust. Motorists had to stop because they were unable to see through the dust. The dust piled up on railroad lines, where it stayed until snow ploivs cleared it away. Tloe removal of the dust from the railroad took the plows several days. Expanded Paragraph On Sunday. April 14. 1935. one of the biggest dust storms of this centuiy swept over the Great Plains of the L'lu'ted States. Huge black clouds of dust, more than 1.000 feet high, formed a wall miles wide. Birds flew frantically to escape suffo- cation in the turlmloit storm. Motorists were stranded for houis along the highway, totally blinded by the impenetrable cloud. Dust from the \"black blizzard\" piled up on railroad lines, and it took snow ploirs several days to clear off the tracks. The addition of half a dozen specific adjectives and adverbs — biggest, huge, black, frantically, tur- bulent, totally bliiuied. impenetrable — and two strong verbs — swept over, were stranded — produce an immediacy of experience that almost forces the reader into the storm. The final metaphor \"black blizzard\" compares the unfamiliar dust storm with the more familiar snowstorm, amplifying the phys- ical description of the storm into an experience that engages not only the senses but the emotions as well. Choice descriptive cietails can also recreate compelling positive experiences, as the following nineteenth-century love letter illustrates. We have had snow-storms for several days together, and at this moment a snow-plow is at work opening a path to the churches. The death- like stillness of night and winter extends over meadow and valley, only a few cows wander about, like ghosts, over the snowy tracts, to pluck a scanty meal from the twigs cf the trees that are not yet buried in the snow. Close thine eyes, slumber, my beloved one. while I watch over thee. TIjou shalt one day look upon night and winter and own that their power is not so fearful.

The verbs are strong and active as well: extends, wander, pluck, buried, slumber, melt, well up, glows. The final touch that creates the impres- sion is the vivid simile Love, that geyser of the soul. which compares an emotion to a physical object known for its heated force. Cotaparison Use the comparison writing pattern if your pur- pose is to explain how two things or events are alike or different. As long as you can find one likeness and one difference, a comparison can be made. So that your comparison will be as precise as possible, focus on items or events that are with- in the same kind or class. For example, you can compare Chryslers and Cadillacs because they share many common features — features that you can pinpoint. When you have determined the related items, brainstorm the specific points you want to com- pare. Then organize your material so that your explanation of the likenesses and/or differences is as clear as possible. The most common pattern for a comparison paragraph compares specific points from the least important significant point to the most important point. The following paragraphs compare the progres- sive reformers of the early twentieth centuiy with the Populist reformers of the late nineteenth cen- tuiy. like the Poliulists if the ISSOs ami ISVOs. progressives feared the concentration of power in the hands of the wealthy feir While hard- working immigrants could iiol cffonl to /iroride for their hungry and ill children, fincntciers like J.P.

'Wough fearing the power of large businesses. p?x)g?-essives often respected the methods busi- ness used to become ejfective. The first paragraph compares specific likeness- es of the Populists and progressives; the second and third paragraphs contrast specific differences between the two kinds of reformers. Reading these paragraphs, notice how the orderly. ver\\' specific comparison explains both the progressive and Populist reformers. There are two other comparison arrangements in atldition to the alternating (point by point) pat- tern shown. The block pattern explains all the characteristics of the first item or event, then explains all the characteristics of the .second item or event in a corresponding paragraph. The mixed comparison pattern explains likenesses and differences in the same paragraph. Likenesses can be explained first, then differences, or vice versa. Cause and Effect Cause-and-effect writing combines characteris- tics of narrative with comparison writing. Like nar- ration, cau,se-and-effect tells what happened. Like comparison writing, cause-and-effect explains why something happened or the results of what hap- pened. When you are relating the event (telling ul.ial happened), arrange your information chronologi- callw as you do for a narration. To explain ihc cau.^e (win ) oi- the effect (rL'suli ) of the e\\ent.

Argumentation Argumentation is a kind of formal writing you can use when your goal is to persuade, or con- vince, someone to accept your point of view on a controversial subject. Argumentation is logical, appealing to the reader's intellect. To best achieve this logical appeal in written argumentation, follow these steps: • State the controversy or problem clearly. • Give your position on the controversy or your solution to the problem. • Present the evidence (relevant facts and statis- tics) you have gathered to support your posi- tion. • Refute any opposing positions or solutions by presenting evidence that negates them. • Conclude your argumentation by summing up your positive evidence and restate your posi- tion. Note the elements of argumentation in these closing paragraphs to a book on United States-Mexico relations. ne argument of this book is that the tensions. conflicts, and misperceptions which have always characterized the United States-Mexican rela- tionship are rooted in history, asymnwtry, and changes in each of the countries and in the relationship. These, in turn, have led to policy mistakes and misconceptions. But the fact that the basic structure of the relationship changes so slowly does not mean that nothing can be done to improve it. These proposals will not transform the relationship, but perhaps the awareness that can emerge from our exchange will yield a syn- thesis that might permit some modest and posi- tive changes. A number of steps can be taken to improve the broader context of mutual understanding, beginning with improvements in both the amouiu and the quality of press coverage of the other country. . . . A second area would be improve the amount and quality of teaching and research. . . . As our children grow on both sides of the bor- der thev might relate as poorly as present and past geueratio)is have. But we hope they will understand each other better. We end this book without illusions but with hopes. Cooperation between the United States and Mexico will always be difficult but never impossible. The first three sentences state both the writer's position and the problem. The next three sen- tences refer to the relevant facts and statistics pre- sented as support in the body of the book, and propose solutions. The final paragraph presents a short summation and a restatement of the writer's position. Classification Classification is the writing method that orga- nizes information about a complex whole into smaller, more useful categories. Many social stud- ies texts and chapters are written in the classifica- tion mode. The chapter titles will identify the subject; for example, \"The Civil 'War.\" Information about the subject is then categorized and treated in small, understandable sections: We outbreak of War ne War on the Battlefield. Behind the Lines, Ending the War. Using classification writing in paragraphs often involves enumeration, or listing. All the items list- ed in any one category or classification should share a quality or characteristic. Determining cat- egories, of course, v.ill depend on your subject and topic. The follo'wing paragraph demonstrates how the classification approach can simplify a complex whole by categorizing. \\X1jo were the \"invisible poor \" of the mid- 1950s!'

Some irere Africa)! and Hispanic Americans, facing long- standing racial and ethnic prejudice and dis- criminatio?7. Tloe poor also included jobless Appalachian whites, who moved to the cities because of lack of opportunity in the hills, and native Americans, who lived both hi the cities and on reseivations. Were were the growing number of elderly Americans not covered by social security or receiving pensions. To better understand the complex group of mid-1950s poor people, the writer classifies, or categorizes, them into six subcategories. She then briefly enumerates the causes that force them to share a common characteristic — poverty. Definition In completing a writing assignment for historv' class, you may need to define terms you use in your essay. Define any terms that you think might be unfamiliar to your audience. Your definition can be a single synonym, several words or phrases, or several sentences. It is best, though, to keep the length as short as possible so as not to intrude on the flow and cohesion of the entire paragraph. Remember also to use words and terms appropri- ate and understandable to your audience. Note how both of the definitions in the follow- ing sentences clarify unfamiliar terms wiihout hampering the flow of thmight.

Most of these papers called for a gradual end to slavery, believing that the slow pace would bring enianci/xitio?! — free- dom — to African Americcnis.

His audience will then understand what he means by the term whenever they encounter it in the remainder of his argument. Examples Use examples in a paragraph to explain, illus- trate, or amplify your main idea. Brainstorm a number of possible examples, then select those that illustrate your idea most accurately. Also choose those that you think your audience will find convincing. One or more examples can t:)ften clarify a main point so well that no other kind of explanation is necessary. Notice how the examples in the following para- graphs illustrate and clarify the writer's topic sen- tence. It was .Madison . . . ivho tightened the consti- tutional language, substituting the imperative \".shall\" for the flaccid \"ought\" cnnl \"ought nots\" (f the state proposals, thus completing the pro- cess begun by f)hn Adams in the Ma.'isachusetts Dechn-ation of Rights. We can see Madison's contributiiin in this respect in the following sequence: BILL OF KKJHTS. 1689: \"nat excessive bail ought nnt III he ivc/uireil. nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inficted. \" VIRCIIMA DliCLMiATIOS OF RICIITS. 1776: \"'Ihat excessive bail ought not to he required, nor e.MXVsive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punislwiieiits inflicted. \" .AMFSDMFMPROPOSFD BY MADISON, JVNFS. 1789: \"Excessive bail .shall not be rec/uired. for excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments in/licted. \" .Madison's iimendments were based on the iindeistanding that . . . the situation called for flat connminds. . . .
