If there’s a disaster and you can’t get help, this information’ s for you—survival medicine for hurricanes, earthquake s, tornadoes, floods, social upheaval, or anytime you're isolated. I’ve been a family doctor for over thirty years. I’ve practiced in small and large towns, worked in emergency rooms and in clinics. I’ve come to realize that many smart people don’t know the basics about medicine. Now, I’m not putting that down. Put me near a leaky faucet, and my wife hides the tools. But if I have a flooded basement and can’t get a plumber , I know how to turn off the water supply . I’ve seen able people who don’t know to put pressure on a cut to stop it from bleeding. But even if you know how to do this, what if the wound is bad and you have no medical assistance? What if you can't get help for days? I think about this every time there’s a disaster like a hurricane or earthqu ake. I thought of it after the Japan nuclear disaster and after the London riots: What if those people can’t get out of their house and medical personnel can’t get to them—for hours, days? Worse, what if their phone lines are down? What if the ERs are packed, or damaged themselves? Please, please, I beg , don’t ever use this information instead of seeing qualified medical personnel .

"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Section 1 Pressure's On: Basic Care for Most Cuts The site of blood can best the strongest of us, especially if the blood is your own. I’ve had many a man or woman, both victims and onlookers, faint with the smallest of cuts. It’s an involuntary reflex. They just can’t help it. But you can prevent it. If you feel like you’re going to faint, sit down and put your head between your legs. Better yet, lie down and bend your knees. You’re no good to anyone lying there unconscious with a knot on the back of your head. Many times you can still stop the bleeding in that position anyway . With most cuts, treatment is really rather easy. (Yeah, easy for me to say.) But people see the blood and panic. You don’t know the number of times someone’ s come in with a gushing cut or with a wound wrapped lightly in a blood-soaked cloth when all they had to do was apply pressure. After all, you only have so much blood to spare. In this chapter , I've explained four basic steps to take when someone gets cut, in order of priority . You’ll notice actually treating the wound is last. If you’ll memorize steps 1 and 2 you’ll be way ahead of most people. After those steps you can stop, take your time, and read about the rest."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Step 1. Stop the Bleeding. This is the first and most important step, and it must be done whether you’re expecting to get medical help or not. Bleeding is the most immediate threat to life. Plus, the more bleeding there is, the harder it will be to check out the injury. And then there's the slipperiness. Even an ooze of blood will make taping or gluing the cut next to impossible. Note: Especially if you're treating someone else, put on clean plastic or latex gloves to protect both yourself and the other person. First, try direct pressure. That means pressure right on the wound. Most bleeding stops with this method in five to ten minutes. If you're treating a cut finger, squeeze around the wound with your other hand. For a larger area, push down with your palm. Use a clean rag if availab le. If there's a broken bone nearby or underneath, try to press carefully enough that you don't move the bone. Second, if it won't stop bleeding, consider the following: - A small artery could be cut, which makes the bleeding hard to stop. Apply pressure proximal to the wound (on the side closest to the heart). Hold it for up to fifteen minutes. - For big gashes with a lot of bleeding, try packing the wound with a bunch of clean cloth and applying pressure. If this doesn’t work you can use any commercial quick- clotting material. Wipe away excess blood before using, and follow the label's instructions. - If the cut is associated with a broken bone that's out of place, traction (steadily pulling on the bone without jerking) to get it better in place might stop the bleeding. - You may have to apply a tourniquet as a last resort. *** Watch It! Click here to watch a video about how to stop the bleeding (TheSurvivalDoctor .com/bleeding). *** FAQ: Why is this little cut bleeding so much?"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"As a rule, sharp cuts bleed more than dull, at least at first. (Dull cuts pull more on the blood vessels, causing them to spasm). This has nothing to do with the cut's severity . Face and finger wounds also tend to bleed more because there's a denser blood supply there. *** >> Back to “Quick Overview for Emergencies.”"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Step 2. Determine Whether the Wound Is Life-Threatening. With some cuts, not getting expert help can be life-threatening, even after you've stopped the bleeding. You need to use that extra effort to get to a doctor as quickly as humanly possible if: - You can’t stop the bleeding with pressure (because if you keep using that tourniquet , gangrene will set in). - The chest cavity or abdominal cavity has been punctured (because of the risk of unseen bleeding and extreme likelihood of serious infections). Start antibiotics if getting expert medical help is impossible. - A neck wound involves the airway . Apply ice packs for swelling. - A large artery is cut. (The blood usually spurts, and the tissue distal to the wound— on the side away from the heart—becomes cool and dark. Learn more in \"Arteries Versus Veins.\" ) If the artery is not surgically reconnected within hours, the tissue will die due to lack of blood supply. After that, the dead tissue needs a surgical amputation, or it’s sure to get an infection that will spread into the healthy flesh and the bloodstream. You can get very sick and even die. Until you can get to a doctor, start antibiotics , if available, after you stop the bleeding. This might give you some extra time. >> Back to “See What's Been Cut.” >> Back to “Quick Overview for Emergencies.”"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Step 3. Assess the Damage. Now that you've dealt with the immediate threats to life, you can stop for a moment and breathe. It's time to take stock of the situation—to assess what damage was done so you can decide what to do next. In this step, you'll be checking the cut's depth, damage and dullness. A. Check the depth. The deeper the wound, the more likely a large artery is involved, making the wound bleed more and cutting off important circulation. That makes it more essential to get medical help as soon as possible. If it's a puncture wound , approximate how deep it goes by checking the object that did the puncturing. >> Back to “Quick Overview for Emergencies.” B. See whether anything has been cut besides skin, fat and muscle. Ask yourself the following questions: - Is the area distal to the wound (the side away from the heart, toward the fingers or toes) becoming cold or discolored? If so, that's a sign that you may have cut an essential artery . Try applying a little less pressure to make sure you’re not losing circulation simply because you’re pressing too hard. If that doesn't fix the tissue, this may be a life-threatening situation . - Do you think you've broken a bone close to the cut? If so, the bone is at high risk for getting seriously infected. See \"Cuts Associated With Broken Bones.\" - Is the area distal to the wound (away from the heart) numb? You may have severed a nerve. In itself, this is not an immediate emergency . You usually have a few days to see a surgeon before it becomes irreparable. - Have you lost movement? You may have cut a tendon. Again, not an emergency , but it needs to be seen within a few days for repair . >> Back to “Quick Overview for Emergencies.”"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"C. Determine the type of cut. If it's a dull or jagged cut —say from a chainsaw—don’t get complacent just because it doesn’t bleed a lot. These types of cuts tend to pull and bruise the blood vessels more, making them spasm and get smaller . The cut may be pretty severe yet not bleed much at first. Later , it may bleed more. In turn, if it's a small cut from a sharp object, such as a knife, don’t panic if it bleeds more. The blood vessels don’t spasm as much with sharp cuts. *** Watch It! Click here to watch a video about how to assess a cut (TheSurvivalDoctor .com/assess). ***"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Step 4. Treat the Cut. Finally, it's time to get down to treatment. In a disaster situation, consider preventing infection to be a top priority , given that you may not be able to hop over to the doctor for antibiotics. So you'll start by cleaning the wound. Then, if your wound is like most bad cuts, you'll need to close it. No suture kit? Not to worry. Guess what silver, sticky substance substitutes swimm ingly. Lastly, you'll put on antibiotic ointment, cover the cut and go into maintenance mode. A. Clean the wound. The cleaner a cut, the less the chance for infection. If the wound is more of a scrape, pick out the debris, and wash the scrape. If the dirt is ground in, you may have to scrub a bit and then skip to phase C . Otherwise, run the cut under tap water, or use the cleanest water you have. If your tap's of f or you need to disinfect the water , see \"What to Do When W ater Is Scarce.\" If you have enough, use four ounces of water or more per inch of cut—twice as much if the cut is deep. If you suspect a fracture also , use ten to twenty ounces per inch. (There are eight ounces in a cup.) Caution: Take special care if you’re at high risk for infection. Clean the cut well, and consider taking an antibiotic —or at least use an antibiotic ointment or honey (not for babies)—if: - You have a chronic disease, such as diabetes (because you heal slower, and your wounds are more likely to get infected). - You think the injury has involved the bone . You want to prevent a bone infection if at all possible. That's much harder to treat and can cause serious damage. - You can’ t clean the wound adequately because it’ s too deep, grimy , or painful. - You haven’ t had a tetanus shot within ten years. If any of these conditions apply and you can't see a doctor right away, try to within a couple of days. *** Watch It!"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Click here to watch a video that shows how to irrigate a cut (TheSurvivalDoctor .com/irrigate). *** >> Back to “Quick Overview for Emergencies.” B. Close the cut. If the cut gapes open or is over a joint, and bleeding is under control, close it unless it's one of the cuts listed in \"Exceptions\" below. If you know how to suture or use a skin stapler , now’s the time to do that. (If you use a skin stapler , be sure you have a staple-remover instrument also.)

Safety note: If the wound is on an extremity and you wrap it, keep an eye on the area distal to the cut (the side furthest from the heart). If it turns blue or dark, loosen the bandage. The discoloration may mean this area is not getting sufficient blood flow and could become permanently damaged. See an expert as soon as possible to try to save the tissue. D. Keep the cut clean and dry. Daily, remove any dirt, dried blood, and debris from around the cut. Add a little antibiotic ointment if you have it. Honey is a good alternative for most people. Keep the wound covered with an adhesive bandage, cloth and tape, or a cloth wrapped around it. Y ou can air it out during the day if you don’t foresee doing activities that might get it dirty or wet. This can be helpful in healing and keeping the surrounding skin from becoming macerated (soft). *** FAQ: How do I know whether a cut is infected?

They’re usually caused by a knife or a stick or something similar . You can’t see all the damage. Scenario 1: The chest or abdomen is stabbed . Try to approximate the depth by looking at the stick or knife. If you think the object may have punctured the chest or abdominal cavity, it becomes more important to seek expert care as soon a possible due to the risk of severe infection. Scenario 2: The area around the wound begins to swell immediately . The object may have cut an artery . Apply pressure. Usually that and a pressure dressing will stop the bleeding. V ery rarely you might need a tourniquet . Scenario 3: You don't have either of the above problems, and the puncture wound is not severely bleeding . Wash the wound as best you can, apply antibiotic ointment or honey , and use a pressure dressing . Since it’s going to be difficult to see how well you’ve cleaned the deepest part, do not close. >> Back to \"Close the Cut.\" >> Back to “Quick Overview for Emergencies.”"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Bites Usually , a bite should be treated like a stab or puncture wound: Stop the bleeding (normally not a problem), irrigate it well, and apply pressure. If it's not severely bleeding, wash the wound as best you can, and continue with part C (\"Cover the Cut\") in \"Step 4. Treat the Cut.\" Only close a bite wound if it's gaping open, and then, close it as loosely as will just hold it together . Bite Wounds Are Dirty Wounds That \"wash the wound\" step is key with bite wounds. The difference between them and stab wounds is bites may pose more risk for infection. It depends on what bit you and where. Bites on the hand tend to get more seriously infected than on the arm. A hand infection intertwines with all those tendons and becomes harder to treat. So treat hand bites more aggressively . Make sure you irrigate the wounds well, and start oral antibiotics or mupirocin ointment , if available. What Bit You? Dog bites are the least likely bites to get infected, but the big dogs can cause deep bruising. You also have to worry about rabies if you don’t know the status of the dog’s vaccinations. Get to a doctor for preventive shots. Rabies is a killer, and there’s nothing you can do for home treatment if you get it. (Even doctors probably won't be able to cure it.) If you cannot get to a doctor, pen the dog up for ten days if possible. If it shows signs of illness, you'd better try your best to get those rabies shots right away . By the time you show signs of illness, it's too late. Human bites are more likely to get infected, especially on the hands. Wash well. Consider using mupirocin or oral antibiotics if any redness develops. Cat bites are the most likely bites to get infected. A cat’s mouth is filled with nasty bacteria. One minute you have some minor puncture wounds. Then, within hours, it’s a swollen, red mess. Start antibiotics at the first sign of infection. The best one for cat bites is amoxicillin clavulanate (Augmentin) if you’re not allergic to penicillin. Cats can also have rabies. *** FAQs"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"What about wild animals? Depending on your area of the country, skunks, raccoons, and foxes can have rabies. For more information check the CDC's website . Rabid bats are a risk everywhere. And, apparently , a bat bite is so small it’s sometimes impossible to find. So, if one touches you, or you find one in a room where you’ve been asleep, you have to assume you may have been bitten and you need rabies shots ASAP . Rabies is deadly. Don’t risk it. If you’re bitten by a nonvaccinated animal, see a doctor. What if I absolut ely cannot see a doctor for a bite from an animal that could have rabies? Your best bet of not getting rabies, other than getting the shots, is to wash the wound immediately and vigorously with soap and water. If you can, pen up the animal for ten days to watch for signs of illness. *** >> Back to \"Close the Cut.\" >> Back to “Quick Overview for Emergencies.”"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Cuts Associated With Broken Bones When a bone breaks through the skin, the break is called an open, or compound, fracture. If you have a cut and even suspec t a broken bone nearby that happened in the same injury, treat it as an open fracture. You can’t be certain that the bone didn’t poke its way out sometime during the injury. Even a millisecond of bone exposure greatly increases the risk of a bone infection. Stop the bleeding as you would otherwise. Just apply the pressure more carefully so you don’t move the bone. If the bone is out of place and the bleeding won’t stop, you might apply traction to get it better in place. (Grip the end of the extremity , and pull with a gradual increasing force for about a minute. Never jerk.) This might stop the bleeding. Priority With Open Fractures: Preventing Infection Bone infections are very hard to cure. You can lose a limb, or your life . Get professional medical treatment right away, if at all possible. If that’s impossible, then: - Irrigate the wound vigorously and thoroughly with water. Use ten or twenty ounces or more per inch—as much as you can spare.

Granted, it’s painful and tends to get infected. But we don’t stitch the mouth, inner lips, inner cheeks, tongue, or gums unless the wound is big and gaping or won’t stop bleeding. If you have a cut inside your mouth: 1. Clean the cut. Pick out any obvious debris. Irrigate the cut with water: Swish it in your mouth, or squirt it into the cut. (No running water? See \"What to Do When Water Is Scarce.\" ) 2. Stop the bleeding. Stuff a clean cloth between the cut and your gum or teeth. (No cloth? Squeeze, pinch—apply pressure of some sort. Ten minutes should do it.) Ice the cut for five to ten minutes, if possible. You can use the ice as part of the compression inside the mouth to stop the bleeding or wrap cloth around the ice and use it on the outside. 3. Start an antibiotic , if available.

Animals don't have outhouses, after all. Their stuff goes right down the river. Pond water is also loaded with bacteria just waiting to make you deathly ill. Even rainwater isn't safe. So, to clean wounds, it's best to use disinfected water . How to Make Running Water If you do have clean water in plastic jugs and your tap's just not running, you can create water pressure for irrigating wounds. Just use a safety pin to punch a hole in the bottom of a full jug. Then let the water flow out of the hole onto the wound. Alternatives to Water If water is scarce, use peroxide. Alcohol is okay, including liquor, but be aware that it’s going to hurt worse. How to Disinfect Water Disinfecting water is relatively simple, and the process will make it drinkable too. Step 1: Filter the water . If the water is cloudy, strain it through a clean piece of cotton fabric (gauze is fine), or a coffee filter.. This removes debris and bacteria. Then let the water sit for a couple of hours to let residual sediment settle. Pour all but the sediment into another container . Step 2: Use one of the following options to disinfect your water : A. Boil the water . Just bringing the water to a boil will disinfect it. Some would say, to be safe, boil the water for one minute. If you have a lid, keep the lid on for a few extra minutes after you turn of f the heat source. OR B. Add chlorine. Add two to four drops of unscented, 5 percent chlorine bleach to each quart (four cups) or liter of water. That’s eight to sixteen drops per gallon. Mix it well. Wait thirty minutes or so before drinking the water . OR C. Add iodine. Add one iodine tablet, five to ten drops of 2 percent iodine solution, or eight to sixteen drops of 10 percent iodine-povidine (Betadine) solution to each quart of water.

Place the container on a black surface. It needs a minimum of four hours of sunlight. The more the better . These are but a few ways to disinfect water. None of these methods removes toxins, poisons, or any chemicals from the water .

Buy some gallon or five-gallon, container s to use for drinking. Keep them full. Even unopened bottled or chlorinated water should be renewed every six months or so. Check for an expiration date. You need to drink at least two quarts of water per day. There are four quarts in a gallon. So one gallon would last you two days. Fourteen gallons would last a week for a family of four. You may want few gallons extra for bathing and cleanin g wounds. In fact, I would suggest at least two gallons per person per day since you'll need more with heavy activity or in hot weather .

It kills bacteria and helps cuts, scrapes, burns, bedsores—even ulcerated leg wounds in people with diabetes—heal, and there have been plenty of studies to prove it. In my mind you can’t have enough honey. It’s tasty and good for coughs too. The fact that it kills bacteria is why it stores forever . Just keep it sealed. If it turns to sugar, gently heat it. Or use it in its granular form. It’ s all the same. Warning Babies have died from eating honey because of botulism spores . Honey can contain a few of them, though not nearly enough to hurt an adult. They've also never been known to cause harm in wounds. Still , to be safe, don’t use honey on children under two years old unless it’s the kind you buy sterilized. Sterilized honeys such as Medihoney have been zapped clean of bacteria and can be found at pharmacies. How to Use Honey As an Antibiotic Ointment Option 1: Apply liberally. If the wound is deep, pour it in. For scrapes and abrasio ns, paste it on. Then cover the wound and seal it with tape. Option 2: Apply the runny honey to gauze or clean cloth first, pop the material on the wound, and seal it with tape. If the bandage remains clean and dry, only change it every day or two. You may have to change it sooner if the wound is oozing a lot of fluid on its own. How Honey Works As an Antibiotic Honey's high sugar concentration dehydrates bacteria. Plus, it’s acidic, and most bacteria hate that. Honey also produces a small amount of hydrogen peroxide when it's mixed with a little fluid—say , from the wound. Unlike the commercial kind, this peroxide is dilute enough to not irritate or inflame the skin. Researchers are finding other ways honey works as an antibiotic.

Most of the time, this is to stop the bleeding. Don’t wrap the dressing all the way around an extremity if you can help it. If you wrap any bandage too tight around an extremity , you've got a tourniquet . Same story if the extremity swells and the bandage has no give. You’ve cut off blood supply coming from the arteries, and the tissue distal to the dressing (the side farthest from the heart) is going to die. Instead, think bulk . Add extra layers of gauze, or bunch up some clean cloth. Sanitary napkins are an option. When you tape the dressing down, the bulk will press down on the wound, but it will also have some give so it doesn’t cut of f circulation. Tape it down firmly—about one-half or two-thirds around if it’s an extremity . Or use an elastic bandage instead of tape. Wrap it firm but not too tight. You should be able to stick a couple of fingers under the wrap. If the hand or foot gets discolored, cold, or tingly, loosen the compression bandage immediately .

Starting at one end of the laceration, stick half the length of the strip to one skin edge, close the cut using your hand, and stick the tape to the other side, closing the wound tightly . 5.

If not, you’ll find it in this section. Please read it. It’s basic information everyone needs to know before treating a serious wound. You’ll also find a section on how to sterilize your instruments. When treating wounds, bacteria is your enemy . It’s always lurking, trying to find a way to sneak in. Sterilizing instruments that are going to touch the wound is one good way to keep it from catching a ride. Remember to wash your hands and the wound also. If you can stop the wound from bleeding, clean the bacteria out, and close the wound in a sterile manner , you have a good chance of the wound healing with few complications."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Arteries Versus Veins You can bleed to death from either a vein or an artery, but a cut artery generally poses more problems. Arteries are too deep to see from your skin surface, but sometimes you can feel the pulsing. They pump oxygenated blood fresh from the lungs and heart to our tissues. If the arterial pipeline is cut of f, the tissue dies. Arteries also have thicker walls than veins—walls that actively pulsate and pump. So it’s harder to stop an artery's blood flow. And in order for the blood to clot, the flow must stop. How to Tell the Difference Between a Cut Vein and a Cut Artery Just remember: Arteries spurt. Veins don’t. Arteries pump blood away from the heart. V eins drain blood back to the heart. If the blood is oozing out of your wound, you've cut a vein. The blood is probably also a darker color because it doesn’t have as much oxygen. Stop the bleeding with about five minutes of direct pressure or pressure just distal to the wound (toward the fingers or toes). Remember , it’s draining back to the heart. If the blood is spurting, it’ s an artery . An artery may need more pressure to stop the bleeding. Use direct pressure or pressure proximal to the wound (the side closer to the heart). If that stops the bleeding, hold the wound for up to fifteen minutes if you can. Then pack it with clean cloth, and apply a bandage. The bleeding should be under control before trying to close the wound with suture or tape (after removing the cloth packed inside). *** FAQ: What about little cuts? Small cuts and scrapes are most often to capillaries. These blood vessels connect arteries to veins and are very small. Bleeding from capillaries can usually be stopped fairly easily. Even if they’re squirting , a little pressure for five to ten minutes does the trick. *** >> Back to \"Second, if it won’t stop the bleeding.\" >> Back to “Determine Whether the W ound Is Life-Threatening.”"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":">> Back to \"See What's Been Cut.\" >> Back to “Stab W ounds.”"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"How to Sterilize Instruments Unless you have a commercial autoclave and a power source, or some prepackaged sterile products, you’re going to have to make do. First, always clean any obvious debris off your instruments. Clean with soap and water or alcohol. Use a cloth or brush if needed. A couple of quick methods for sterilization are: 1. Heating the instrument. Hold the part that’s going to touch the injury under an open flame. If the handle is also metal, find something to hold the instrument with so you don’t burn your fingers. When the part under the flame is red, that’s enough. Let it cool and you’re ready. If I have alcohol, I also like to dip it in that just for good measure. 2. Using a disinfectant. If you don’t have fire and you're in a hurry, you can wipe the instrum ent off with a clean cloth soaked in iodine, povidine, or alcohol. No clean cloth? Dip the instrument in the solution and stir it around for ten seconds. If you have more time you can: 1. Boil. This is good method for larger instruments or those that might melt under the flame. Let the instrument soak in boiling water for twenty minutes. 2. Use a disinfectant longer. Soaking the instrument for twenty minutes is better than just the wiping/dipping method. What to Do Before and After the Procedure Always wash your hands. Wear clean gloves, if available, to protect yourself and the patient.
