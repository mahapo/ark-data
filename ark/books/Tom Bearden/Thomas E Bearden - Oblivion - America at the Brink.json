E. Bearden First edition Oct. 13,2004 Drafted Sept. 11, 2004 on the Third Anniversary of 9/11/ 0 1 Revised and updated 23 April 2005 Cold War Development of Scalar Interferometry Prior to 1990, the weather over North America was being steadily engineered by the KGB — particularly beginning on July 4, 1976 — using giant strategic scalar interferometers on site in Russia {i, ii, iii, iv}. From the beginning of the development program which started shortly after WW II, the KGB personally controlled the development of startling new Russian weapons under the Soviet energetics program {v, vi, vii}. That pr ogram was for the research and eventual development of highly advanced new superweapons more powerful than the atomic bomb. The new superweapons were developed, produced, manned, and operated by the KGB itself, and were never placed in th e hands of the regular Russian armed forces. Speaking to the Presidium in 1960, Khrushchev referred to the forthcoming scalar interferometer weapons with the following statement: \"We have a new weapon — just within the portfolio of our scientists, so to speak — so powerful that, if unrestrainedly use, it could wipe out all life on earth.\" The large Soviet strategic scalar interferometers were deployed and became operational in April 1963 — a bit too late for use by Khrushchev to counter the U.S. confrontation in the Cuban Missile Cr isis of latter 1962. However, the first operational weapon was used to destroy the U.S.S. Thresher nuclear submarine while on underwater maneuvers off the East Coast of the United States, in April 1963. Thereby Khrushchev demonstrated the power of his new weapons over nuclear submarines — one of the major th ree elements of the strategic military nuclear firepower of the United States. Extension to the other two elements — intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and strategic bombers — was obvious. Incidents Where Outside Intervention Saved the United States Many dramatic but largely unheralded incidents occurred during the so-called \"Cold War\". For example, in the 1970s a small nation saved the United States from total destruction by Soviet nuclear weapons which had been inserted in our OBLIVION 1"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"cities. That nation did it very simply: they likewise insert ed an appreciable number of nuclear weapons of their own, some thermonuclear, inside Russia itself, in its population centers and its primary target zones. All these inserted nuclear weapons — both in the United States and in Russia — are still there with their activation teams, waiting. In such manner was the \"balance of terror\" — the Mutual Assure d Destruction or MAD doctrine — really implemented and enforced vis a vis the Soviet Union. At the time this approach to deterrence was called \"Dead Man Fuzing\". In April 1986 a private little U.S. group in tervened to prevent a forthcoming giant earthquake that was being built up for the greater Los Angeles and San Francisco areas by the KGB scalar interferometers. Via a special electronic device, the group suddenly destroyed one of the distant So viet scalar interferometer transmitters — thereby initiating the nearby Chernobyl nuclear incident but preventing the loss of perhaps 200,000 U.S. lives in Los Angele s and San Francisco, together with preventing terrible destruction and economic damage. Also in 1986, the same friendly little nation again prevented our strategic destruction by even more powerful energetics weapons developed by the Soviet Union. As early as 1984, the friendly nation simply began exploding very large Russian missile ammunition storage sites, to warn the Soviet Union of what was in store for it, if it attacked. In 1997, again the U.S. would have been utterly destroyed on two occasions had it not been for the same little nation. Several professional colleagues and I played a desperate role in both of those frighteningly real incidents, which were never reported in the news media. Indeed, our own intelligence agencies had no inkling that a full strategic Soviet superweapon attack to destroy the United States was imminent on each of the occasions (the second of which would have occurred on May 1, 1997) {viii}. The May Day attack for 1997 would have been the \"big one\", had the Federal Security Service (FSB/KGB ) not been checkmated by \"an offer it could not refuse\" — delivered once again by the friendly nation. During those critical periods when every hour on the clock seemed a week in length, the hostile armada that would have struck us included the Japanese Yakuza and Aum Shinrikyo teams on site in Russia, oper ating leased KGB/FSB strategic scalar interferometers against the U.S. Yakuza Acquisition of Soviet Superweapons With the collapse of the old Soviet Union's economy, by the end of 1989 the Russian financial situation was grim. By courtesy of the Russian Mafia {ix} — which works directly for the FSB/KGB — a rogue Japanese group consisting of the Yakuza {x} and the Aum Shinrikyo cult {xi} was conducted to Russia in latter 1989, met with the KGB, and leased some of those large KGB strategic scalar interferometers on site in Russia {xii}. The down payment was $900 million U.S. in gold bullion, and the lease is rumored to be some $1 billion per year. The payment was no problem for the Japanese team. The Yakuza had ripped off the OBLIVION 2"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Japanese taxpayer fur hundreds of billions of dollars, never repaid, and so the rogue Japanese group could easil y afford such leasing {xiii}. The Yakuza and Aum Shinrikyo then assigned teams to man those superweapon sites and begin weather engineering operations against the U n i t e d S t a t e s a n d o t h e r t a r g e t s . The Aum Shinrikyo even set up a small university in Russia where the energetics theory and technology could be taught to the rogue Japanese teams by the KGB scientists. After much training, in 1990 the rogue Japanese teams began operating the leased interferometers {xiv} worldwide for weather engineering and other purposes under the supervision of the FSB/KGB. The Yakuza and its vast resources worldwide were thus incorporated into the FSB/KGB planning and coordination for the coming destruction of the United States and the Western world. Much later, Western investigations into the Aum Shinrikyo did clearly establish the sect's links in Russia, but missed the major involvement of the Yakuza. The Soviets easily made it appear that contact of the Aum Shinrikyo with Russia had been harmless (with the exception of the sarin nerve gas). Quoting Turbiville {xv}: \"Russian, Japanese, and other investigators quickly identified a substantial number of [Aum Shinrikyo] sect members in Russia, including members in the government and other walks of life. Media commentators took note of a 'gas analyzer' of Russian origin seized at a sect facility; reports of Aum Shinrikyo sect members among Russian Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Defenses Troops; alleged sect ties to the Russian Academy of Sciences; the large volume of commercial Russian ship and aircraft traffic between Russia and Japan; and other issues that suggested questionable Russo-Japanese linkages to sarin production or transport... Official Russian military and security service spokesmen, while acknowledging Aum Shinrikyo's presence in Russia, reiterated the absolute security of mi litary chemical depots and munitions...\" So it was that in early 1990, the FSB/KGB transferred their North American weather engineering operation to th e Yakuza/Aum Shinrikyo teams, who perpetuated it using the Russian scalar in terferometers that the Yakuza had leased. Today the rogue Japanese teams on site in Russia and elsewhere continue their weather engineering against the United States under FSB/KGB supervision. At the end of 2004, the FSB/KGB and Yakuza entered the 2-year \"Operations Phase\" of asymmetric war against th e United States. Weather operations — including Hurricanes Charlie, Frances, Ivan , Jeanne, etc. — intensified and remain intense, wreaking great economic damage. The program included directly influencing and controlli ng each hurricane's power and behavior, as well as directing its course, speed and targeting path. Indeed, Ivan did a 180 degree turn, and Jeanne did a 360 degree loop before reaching Florida, demonstrating an unprecedented and sophisticated level of storm control. Meteorologists do recognize periods of in creased or decreased hurricane activity for various reasons {xvi}, but very few consider deliberate human induction of OBLIVION 3"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"hurricanes or human control over their direction, power, and progress {xvii}. Fortunately, a few do. Indeed, in latter March of 2004, Hurricane Catarina — the first-ever recorded in the South Atlantic — formed and came asho re in Brazil on March 28 with 90 mph winds, doing substantial damage. So while the conventional wisdom is that hurricanes cannot form (naturally) in the South Atlantic, this one did and \"broke all the records\". It appears to have been a deliberate pr obe by the Yakuza: Produce and drive ashore a hurricane where the textbooks state one is impossible, to test whether Western governments and scientists recognize the artificial weather engineering. The answer, of cour se, is that — as expected — the West did not recognize its importance, or that it was a deliberate \"stimulus.\" Western meteorologists and governments simply sh rugged off Hurricane Catarina as an interesting little phenomenon of no great concern. Some time after their 1989 lease of the Russian interferometers, the Yakuza carried the science and technology of scalar electromagnetics (energetics) back to Japan. There they set up their own clandestine facilities to manufacture such weapons, including small portable scalar interferometers, electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons, and even negative energy EMP weapons. Any group or nation possessing scalar interferometers is also able to produce either positive energy EMP or negative energy EMP in the distant interference zone. Smaller, more portable weapons then follow. Selected portable weapons of such types will be inserted — probably have already been inserted — into the U.S. for destroying its key internal targets and centralized electrical power system. With the final coup de grace to be delivered about two years from now, the loss of our national electrical power system is intended to evoke the catastrophic collapse of the entire U.S. economy, followed by the fall of other Western nations' economies like toppling dominoes. Despite the risk, the U.S. Government, scientific community, intelligence community, and electrical power industry seem totally incapable of confronting the desperate requirement to replace our entire centralized electrical power system with fuel-free self-powering \"energy from the vacuum\" (EFTV) systems as rapidly as possible. Merely mentioning the requirement evokes psychological displacement activity, denial, and fierce person al attacks on the proponent. It also induces strong opposition from the powerful cartels in our society — energy, science, government, the environmental community, the financial and industrial community, etc. Hence the U.S. continues \"energy business as usual\", while the clock licks away to our destruction {xviii}. Our Desperate Need to Correct the Seriously Flawed Classical Electromagnetics (CEM) and Electrical Engineering (EE) Models In the past we have described the longitudinal electromagnetic (EM) wave transmitters used in these interferometer wea pons with the phrases \"scalar electromagnetics\" and \"scalar interferomet ry\" {xiv}. Tesla did not originate these OBLIVION 4"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"terms, nor did he originate scalar interferometry, although he had indeed stumbled onto longitudinal EM waves and what can only be called force-free precursos engineering {xix}. Quoting Tesla {xx}: \"...I showed that the universal medium is a gaseous body in which only longitudinal pulses can be propagated, involving alternating compressions and expansions similar to those produced by sound waves in the air. Thus, a wireless transmitter does not emit Hertz waves which are a myth, but sound waves in the ether, behaving in every respect like those in the air, except that, o wing to the great elastic force and extremely small density of the medium, their speed is that of light.\" If \"gaseous body\" is replaced with the m odern term \"virtual particle flux (active virtual state gas) of the vacuum\", Tesla' s words agree with the basic view of the modern active vacuum. Whittaker's 1903-4 discovery that sets of longitudinal EM waves actually comprise all normal EM waves, fields and potentials {xxi,xxii} leads to a much more fundamental electrodynamics in which ordinary EM waves, potentials, and fields can undergo sophisticated alteration, enabling them to contain hidden internal field vectors and dynamics. (\"Dynamics\" refers to change over time.) Indeed, the so-called \"transverse EM waves\" measured by our instruments are merely precession wave envelopes of charged particles (charged masses) responding gyroscopically at right angles to the more fundamental longitudinal EM waves. Longitudinal waves are force-free except when interacting with matter. Transverse EM force field and force field waves exist only in association with charged matter, never in free space. What exist in space as the \"precursor field\" are the Whittaker sets of bidirectional long itudinal EM wave pairs, for each force f ie ld wave, force field, or potential in charged matter when the precursor wave- sets are interacting with that charged matter. What Whittaker showed as th e \"decomposition\" of such waves is actual ly the precursor longitudinal force-free EM wave mixture existing in charge -free space, whose summation — via the wave interaction with charged matter — yields transverse force field waves. An EM wave in space (i.e. where no matter is present) actually consists of a dense, multi-frequency mixture of bidirectional l ongitudinal EM wave pairs. It is not a \"pale thin shadow\" of the form of the matter wave in charged matter. Every EM \"field\" and \"wave\" and \"potential\" in space — including so-called \"static\" fields and potentials — actually exists as a large ensemble of ongoing EM energy flows in the form of those propagating longitudinal EM wave sets. But our standard classical EM and electrical en gineering model's false assumption of a material ether has prevented recognition of the fundamental character of these longitudinal EM wave ensembles. The model continues to erroneously assume forces and force fields in space. Yet forces and force fields cannot occur in space but only in mass, because one of the components of force is mass, by the definition F = dp/dt = d/dt(mv). Simply replace m by 0, and F = 0. OBLIVION 5"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"When electrons are in a conductor, their travel is limited to a few inches per second down the wire in a typical nominal case. Thus, when an electron in a wire experiences a longitudinal EMF, it has to precess laterally. Most of its motion is perpendicular to the wire. This rotational movement is what generates the transverse EM waves that our instruments measure, as the electrons respond to the more fundamental longitudinal vibrations. At least Jackson {xxiii} clearly states what CEM/EE assumes: \"Most classical electrodynamicists con tinue to adhere to the notion that the EM force field exists as such in the vacuum, but do admit that physically measurable quantities such as force somehow involve the product of charge and field.\" So the measured EM transverse force F is the effect of a more primal, precursor, force-free EM field (longitudinal precursor waves) in space, in and on charges q in the ongoing interaction of that precursor EM field with those charges q. To see this, examine the simple equation F = Eq, as a definition F = Eq. In the absence of charged matter, q = 0 and F = 0, but E, defined as the mass-free wave in mass-free space, need not be zero. It is a force-free precursor field wave set in space with no charges present. Further, for a given q 0, if E = 0 and thus precursor field interactions are absent, then F = 0, but q 0. For that reason, as Jackson admits, the observable E-force (i.e., in charged matter q) has to involve the product of charge and field. But the notion — almost universally assumed by universities teaching CEM/EE — that a force field somehow exists in mass-free space, Jackson admits, is totally false. The energy flux of the vacuum is enormously dense and comprises the scalar potential of Einstein's spacetime itself. This energy decomposes into Whittaker harmonic sets of bidirectional EM longitudinal phase conjugate wave pairs {xxi}. It is an axiom that any mathematical mode l, including this one, can be engineered by a model of sufficiently higher group symmetry. The mathematics generally used to model Western classical force-field electrodynamics is U(l), a lower group symmetry model. Thus, CEM/EE can be engineered using a more sophisticated mathematical model, as the preceding discussion of precursor fields pointed out. Our scientists, engineers, and thermodynamicists have also largely failed to grasp the implications of the gauge freedom axiom when asymmetrical rather than symmetrical regauging is used. The first requirement for EFTV systems producing more energy output than the operator alone inputs is to break Lorentz symmetry in the system's circuitry and thus to violate the Lorentz invariance imposed by the U ( 1 ) theoretical equations by which CEM is presently modeled. 1 Further, when 1 See Maxim Pospelov and Michael Romalis, \"Lorentz Invariance on Trial,\" Physics Today, 57(7), July 2004, p. 40-46 for a good discussion of present efforts to violate invariance and Lorentz symmetry. OBLIVION 6"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"o n e deals with force-free EM fields, potentials, and waves as they exist in mass- free space, a priori one does not have to \"pay\" to furnish the energy flows that are necessary to develop powerful working forces in matter. Instead, one only has to deliberately direct nature's own energy fl ows, exhibited by the internal Whittaker d e c o mposition of any static EM potential, field, or wave in space; the energy is already pouring freely from every charge. Force is an ongoing effect of a more primary ongoing precursor interaction between dynamic spacetime (and dynamic virtual particle flux or VPF of the vacuum) with mass. Force is not a fundam ental cause. Every EM field or potential in space is in fact already a great set of ongoing free EM energy flows, s te a d i l y flowing from the associated source charge(s). Any \"energy\" being lost to provide that set of energy flows is furnished by the reordering of disordered virtual energy absorbed by the source charge from the seething vacuum. Since the totally- disordered vacuum is alr eady at maximum entropy state, at equilibrium, any change in that state is a negative entropy change a priori. Using such thus involves negative entropy engineering. (The terms \"precursor engineering\" and \"negative entropy engineering\" are essentially synonyms.) Thus precursor engineering advances beyond the present notion of four primary forces of nature. Instead of four primar y forces, precursor engineering deals with four \"brands\" of precursor wave sets and energy flows, each kind interacting with a particular kind of mass to produce one particular kind of \"fundamental force\". The Whittaker decomposition for an EM force field in matter actually gives the energy flow set, which is the form of the actual precursor EM energy field in space. Envelope summation never occurs un til the precursor energy interacts with charged matter. In theory, by asymmetrically directing these Whittaker precursor energy flows, one can generate forces of any strength and pattern in charged matter. One can even shape the internal dynamics (to be explained later) of such forces. We refer to forces created in this manner as \"e ngines\". The energy for creating these engines is present in nature; one only needs to furnish switching and control. By paying a small energy \"cost,\" one can direct and structure the desired patterning and dynamics of large precursor flows of energy in space. The interaction of these \"precursor engines\" with charged matt er can produce very powerful forces in charged matter. In hard military terms, precursor engineer ing (that is, Soviet energetics) provides an enormous and ubiquitous force amplifier that may be put to startling use on the battlefield. Very large energy effects in physical matter can thus be obtained for only a small investment in switching and control of nature's ubiquitous free energy flows. Conservation of energy is not violated, since the charges furnish the excess energy utilized, in their continuing extraction of real EM energy flow from the vacuum's OBLIVION 7"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"fluctuations. 2 Thermodynamics is not violated , because these precursor energy flows are nonequilibrium steady state system s, with continuous free energy input from the vacuum's subquantal fluctuations and with continuous free energy output in the form of the precursor energy flows. This is negative entropy engineering, the ultimate \"far from equilibrium\" approach that totally violat es the present flawed Second Law of thermodynamics {xxiv}. Observable forces and force fields do not exist in empt y space. They exist only in matter, because matter is a necessary comp onent of force. Subquantal energies fluctuating in the vacuum of space are not observable until they produce state changes in matter. Our fundam ental mechanics greatly errs in assuming a separate vector force in mass-free space, acting upon a separate mass. No such \"separate force in mass-free space\" exists, and none can exist, since mass is a component of force by F = d/dt(mv). If m = 0, then F = 0. When there is no mass, there is no force. As Nobelist Feynman stated: \"Everything we know is only some kind of approximation, therefore, things must be learned only to be unlearned again or, more likely, corrected.\" Speaking specifically about force, Feynman stated {xxv}: \"...in dealing with force the tacit assumption is always made that the force is equal to zero unless some physical body is present... On e of the most important characteristics of force is that it has a material origin...\" \"If you insist on a precise definition of force, you will never get it!\" But then, facing Feynman's dilemma of defining a force, what kind of electromagnetics exists in force-free space, prior to the presence of mass and thus prior lo the formation of forces and forc e fields assumed by the present CEM/EE? Speaking of the electric field from a source positive charge in space, and the responses of charged masses placed in that field and interacting with it, Feynman stated {xxvi}: \"...the existence of the positive charge, in some sense, distorts, or creates a \"condition\" in space, so th at when we put the negative charge in, it feels a force. This potentiality for producing a force is called an electric field.\" Feynman also pointed out that we really did not know what \"energy\" was. In the particle physics view of energetics, what basically exists in mass-free spacetime is the disintegrated and disordered virtual particle flux (VPF) of the vacuum. Energy in said space means an ordered change in that VPF. In the general relativity view of energetics, the basic space is \"spacetime\" which now must be considered highly structured and highly dynamic. Ener gy in said spacetime is a change or distortion in i ts curvature. 2 In this book we give the exact mech anism by which the charge does this. OBLIVION 8"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"All of the so-called \"energy in space\" - such as a field or a potential - may be thought of as an organized change of th e virtual state energy and curvature of spacetime. The \"enormous\" vacuum energy (using the term \"enormous\" as if the energy were already coherently integrated) is actually disintegrated into very tiny vi rtual bits of energy and ordered patterns in that energy. The energetic vacuum consists of intense and dense subquanlal fluctuations! An EM field, potential, or wave in vacuum (i.e. in empty space) is actually an organization (ordering) and dynamics imposed upon and in the basic disordered VPF and virtual energy. The fundamental field or potential is thus an \"organizing pattern\" of ongoing energy flows, and must already include negative entropy, since it reorders the disordered virtual energy of the vacuum a priori {xxvii}. Any persisting pattern (organization) of EM change in a region of the VPF — once it interacts with observable charged matt er — can be and is integrated to the quant u m level so that it becomes observable EM change and produces force and force fields in the charged matter with which it interacts. There is no observable force a priori until a pattern of virtual change in a region of the vacuum (a vacuum engine or precursor engine) is reacting with observable matter and being integrated to observable quantum level in that interaction. We have explained that integration process elsewhere {xxvii, xxviii} as demonstrated by every charge in the universe. If charges did not reorder and integrate disordered virtual stale energy changes to observable state energy changes, there could not be any observable EM forces in nature, or any observable masses in nature. How the Notion of Transverse EM Waves in Space Originated To explain sets of longitudinal EM waves in the vacuum, and also to explain then detection as transverse waves in a re ceiving conductor {xxix}, consider the longitudinal flow of Drude electrons in a conductor, which is known to be severely restrained. While the electrons in the Drude gas may individually move at greater velocity, their net flow longitudinally down the conductor is the drift velocity {xxx}, usually on the order of a few centimeters per second in a typical bench circuit with small voltages and currents {xxxi}, very much less than the speed of the field or potential down the wire. Hence there exists an effective restraint of the electron's spinning gyro axes in the longitudinal or current-flow direction along the conductor. To a first order, when the precursor longitudinal EM force impinges upon them, the Drude electrons — due to their continuous spin — act as gyros with longitudinally restrained axes. They occas ionally slip a bit longitudinally, but are immensely freer to move transversely. So they easily precess with lateral motions that can be very large and/or very fast indeed. The intense lateral precession of the \"Drude electron as a gyro\" quite well demonstrates the overall longitudinal nature of the causative disturbing precursor OBLIVION 9"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"agent(s), with the longitudinal impulse force strongly resitted by the longitudinal restraint force, and with most of the electron's effect force being the resulting gyro-electron precession force at right angles. Even when electrons are in empty space and not in a conductor, their mass inertia and spin results in a similar much larg er precession at right angles to the longitudinal disturbing forces of the precursor force-free fields and waves. The observation of the lateral electron pr ecession waves of these precessing Drude electrons in our instruments is the accepted measurement of the so-called transverse EM waves in vacuum. Th e measurement does not measure the oscillation direction of the causative precursor EM wave in vacuum at all, but only its oscillation effect created in the precessing Drude electrons of the charged matter. There are really no transverse EM waves in mass-free space, albeit we seem to be stuck with such a model since the founders of classical electrodynamics assumed the material et her filling all space, which they modeled as matter waves (force field waves) in space. If there were such a material ether, then there would be matter and charge at every point in space, and there would indeed be transverse charge precession EM waves in this \"ethereal but real matter\" filling all space. The CEM/EE model of electrodynamics and its equations have implicitly propagated the erroneous assumption of a material ether and the mi sinterpretation of what our instruments are measuring, from at least 1865 to the present day. Yet the material elher was falsified over a century ago, in 1887. The false assumption of the material ether and the resulting false assumption of the tr ansverse EM force field wave in space continues even after Drude's fundamental work —just as the erroneous notion of a separate force vector in space acting separately upon a mass is still propagated in basic mechanics. It is astounding that the NAS, NSF, NAE, Doe, national labs, and universities blithely continue to propagate such known errors in major models, even after eminent scientists such as Wheeler, Feynman, and many others have pointed out that there are no forces or force fields in space. We know of no other Western analyst who has pointed out the lateral precession of Drude electrons resulting from their longitudinal restraint to a slow drift velocity. This phenomenon appears to prove that the EM wave sets in matter-free space are longitudinal rather than tran sverse, precisely as Tesla stated. We pointed out this anomaly in the erroneous \"force in empty space\" theory for years, to little avail. The Soviets not only discovered it but also highly weaponized it shortly after WWII, in their secret superweapons science called \"energetics\". CEM and EE Still Erroneously Assume the Old Material Ether The misinterpretation of the detected tr ansverse EM force field waves as actual force-field waves in a mate rial space has been perpetuated erroneously since the inception of classical electrodynamics, a nd it continues today. The entire U.S. OBLIVION 10"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"scientific apparatus — including the National Academy of Science, National Science Foundation, National Academy of Engineering, Department of Energy, national laboratories, and universities — continues to bury its head firmly in the sand, covering itself with the old luminiferous material ether. Because of its importance, we reiterate that those measured waves in our measuring instruments actually are integrated transverse EM force field effect waves in and of the interacting Drude electron material medium in the conductors of the intercepting instrument. But the causative interacting EM field entities in the vacuum are themselves force-free longitudinal EM wave set disturbances of the curvature of spacetime (g eneral relativity view) and of the local VPF of the vacuum (particle physics view). Else the theory of gyro precession is voided by every Drude electron and transverse EM force field wave detection in Drude electron gases. The EM force fields so blithely assu med by our present electrodynamics absolutely do not and cannot exist in mass -free space, since force only exists in a muss system, and then only during its inter action with force-free precursor fields. Because of charged particle spin, the el emental responses of the charged mass system are precessions at right angles to the disturbing force-free fields. Neither do transverse EM \"effect\" waves exist in mass-free space, but only in charged mass systems (such as the Drude electron gas) engaged in an ongoing interaction with the longitudinal precursor waves. Here also, the elemental response of the mass system is at right angles to the fo rce-free fields of the disturbing precursor wave set. The primary, longitudinal force-free fi elds in massless space are the more fundamental EM fields, as Tesla had real ized. Tesla actually began the process later partially captured by Whittaker {xxi, xxii}, which was taken to fruition after WW II by Soviet weapon scientists as the new weapons science of energetics. It is what the present author is calling precursor waves, precursor fields, and precursor engineering, in trying to penetrate the mind-fog barrier generated by the \"transverse EM forcefield wave in space\" idea so branded into scientific and engineering minds. Our Archaic and Flawed Situation in CEM/EE Today Sadly, electrical engineering departments still erroneously teach EM force fields and EM transverse EM fo rce field waves in space — a notion which still assumes the old luminiferous material ether {xxxii} that was falsified in 1887 by the Michelson-Morley experiments {xxxiii}. Reiterating: Jackson, one of the superb electrodynamicists of our day, at least admits that the problem exists and that electrodynamicists continue to ignore it. He states {xxxiv}: \"Most classical electrodynamicists cont inue to adhere to the notion that the EM force field exists as such in the vacuum, but do admit that OBLIVION 11"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"physically measurable quantities such as force somehow involve the product of charge and field.\" In summary, one does not have electromagnetic force until the \"force-free precursor field in space\" is interacting with charged mass. It can easily be seen by examining the simple standard EM equation F = Eq, and writing it as F = Eq so that it becomes a true definition of the electromagnetic force field. Now let q = 0, as it would be in space. In that case, F = 0, even though E 0. In that identity, the actual E-field in space is force free, and fo rce is the ongoing interaction — of the force-free E-field in space — with charge d mass q. Given q and its interaction with force-free E, that ongoing interaction is the rigorous definition of — and generatrix for — electric field force itself. What is missing from the identity and therefore the definition is that F and E are at right angles to each other because of the spin of the charged particles comprising q. Again, let q = 0, while E remains nonzero. In that case, there is no ongoing interaction of E with charged matter, since there is no charged matter. Therefore the effect of such a reaction — force F — goes to zero because there is no interaction and therefore there is no effe ct of an interaction. So the equation should really be written as an identity, to show clearly that electric field force is produced by, and exists as, an ongoing in teraction of the force-free E-field in space with charged matter q. The very concept of \"electromagnetic field\" must therefore be separated into two parts. Using \"the E-field\" as an example, E M refers to the E-field interacting with mass, and E S to the E-field in empty space. Using this notation we might state that E M = f(E S x q). In short, if there is any chance for misunderstanding, the writer/lecturer should clearly explain whet her he is referring to the force-free E- field E S in space, or to the force E-field E M in matter. Indeed, the CEM/EE model itself should be altered to clearly show that difference. The sharp-eyed reader w ill note that we may have (hopefully successfully!) indicated the solution to Feynman's force definition problem, at least electromagnetically: An electromagnetic force in static charged matter is identically the ongoing effect (in the static charged matter) of an ongoing interaction of the force-free EM field in space with that static charged matter. Eminent scientists such as Feynman, Wheeler, Lindsay, Margenau, Bunge, and many others have pointed out that there are no force fields in space. But our electrical engineering departments and classical Maxwell-Heaviside electro- dynamicists refuse to change and correct the horribly flawed CEM/EE model. Repeating for emphasis, Feynman {xxvi} stated it this way: \"...the existence of the positive charge, in some sense, distorts, or creates a \"condition\" in space, so that when we put the negative charge in, it feels a force. This potentiality for producing a force is called an electric field.\" OBLIVION 12"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"In other words, a true E S -field is a \"force-free condition in pure mass-free space;\" i t h a s o n l y the capability to interact with a charged mass and thus create force in that ongoing interaction. Feynman underst ood that \"true fields\" were naught but conditions in space itself, and changes in space itself. He clearly understood that only the interaction of the field-in-sp ace with charged mass - should some be introduced — produces EM force fields in that charged mass. So our present electrical engineers have absolutely no notion at a l l of what a force-free EM field in mass-free space real ly is. They have never even calculated a real EM-field in space, and they do not do so today — nor do their professors and their textbooks, though all profess to do so. One is reminded of Tesla's acrid remark 3 when he stated: \"The Hertz wave theory of wireless transmission may be kept up for a while, but I do not hesitate to say that in a short time it will be recognized as one of the most remarkable and inexplicable aberrations of the scientific mind which has ever been recorded in history.\" Tesla also was well aware that energy coul d be had from space, for the taking, and he was at some pains to express it. In 1900 he stated: \"Whatever our resources of primary energy may be in the future, we must, to be rational, obtain it without consumption of any material.\" Nearly a decade earlier, he had formally 4 stated: \"Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be driven by a power obtainable at any point in the universe. This idea is not novel... We find it in the delightful myth of Antheus, who derives power from the earth; we find it among the subtle speculations of one of your splendid mathematicians...Throughout space there is energy. Is this energy static or kinetic? If static our hopes are in vain; if kinetic — and this we know it is, for certain — then it is a mere question of time when men w i l l succeed in attaching their machinery to the very wheelwork of nature.\" Tesla himself was stopped from doing that very thing, by powerful vested interests who realized that for the financial cartels involved in energy, energy must continue to come from fuels and materi als, etc. Today, similar cartels of very great power still control which way science thinks and researches, and still effectively destroy any scientist who dares to seek energy from the vacuum, and Tesla's nonmaterial energy source \"obtainable at any point in the universe\". 3 Nikola Tesla, \"The True Wireless.\" Electrical Expe rimenter.

Other Severe Foundations Errors in Our CEM/EE Indeed, besides the material ether (fals ified over a century ago), the inane CEM/EE model still erroneously assumes a flat spacetime (falsified since at least 1916) and an inert vacuum (falsified since at least 1930). It also assumes that every EM field, potential, and joule of energy in the universe was freely created from nothing at all by the associated source charge, which the theory begrudgingly admits continuously emits real observable EM energy without any energy input. In so doing, the CEM/EE model implicitly assumes the universal violation of the conservation of energy law. Every EE department, professor, and te xtbook in the United States unwittingly advocates the total violation of energy c onservation, without even recognizing it. So do our National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, great national laboratories, universities, our intelligence analysts — and the entire Taliban-like professional Skeptic community — by not pointing out the known terrible errors in classical electrodynamics and electrical engineer ing, and by not correcting the flawed model!

The Development of Scalar Interferometry There are two papers by E. T. Whittaker, one in 1903 {xxi} and the other in 1904 {xxii}, that detail the beginning of scalar interferometry. Shortly after WW II, these two papers were a starting point in the Soviet Union scientists' development of a secret weapons science called energetics, which led to the development of powerful scalar interferometers that are now possessed secretly by at least 10 nations worldwide, and even by the Japanese Yakuza. For a deeper understanding of scalar interferometry, a higher group symmetry electrodynamics must be used {xiv}, instead of the Standard Mo del's limited U(1) electrodynamics. After leasing large strategic scalar interfe rometers in Russia, the Yakuza took the technology back to Japan and set up production facilities of their own. This was not an act of the Japanese government but of the Japanese Mafia in concert with a remnant of the Aum Shinrikyo (under its new name, Aleph). The Yakuza is very powerful, and it penetrates the Japanese government and also every large Japanese OBLIVION 14"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"company. All dealings with any large Japanese company inherently involve the Yakuza, due to their penetration into all aspects of Japanese society and business. In 1997, then Secretary of Defense Willia m Cohen— at a conference on Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), held in Ge orgia under the auspices of Senator Sam Nunn — publicly confirmed this kind of electromagnetic weaponry without the technical details. He also confirmed the weather engineering, climate control, induction of earthquakes, and stimulation of volcanoes into eruption. Secretary Cohen stated {xxxv}: \"Others [terrorists] are engaging ev en in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic wave. ... So there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that are at work finding ways in which they can wreak terror upon other nations. It's real, and that's the reason why we have to intensify our efforts, and that's why this is so important.\" This was the first time (and to my knowledge, the only time) a high U.S. government official has openly confirmed the superweapons. So obviously certain parts of our government do know about such weapons, but there has been little or no communication of that to the public, save by Secretary Cohen's illuminating statement. The news media at the time — panting heavily after the juicy Clinton-Lewinsky sex scandal — totally ignored Cohen's epoc hal strategic statement. So much for the perspicacity of our news media! The Yakuza Strategic Role in Our Present Terrorism Threat Today the Yakuza/Aum Shinrikyo, one of our deadly foes, will be involved in the planned destruction of the United States that is scheduled to conclude about three years from now. A major facet of the plan is the destruction of the power grid in about two year's time. The incidents will start very gradually at first 5 , and then escalate fairly rapidly until the power system is in ruins. There are a l r e a d y sufficient terrorist assets inserted into the U.S. — being held ready and waiting - to destroy the nation, particularly when one considers the damage potential of scalar interferometers. A single large inte rferometer can, for example, disable the entire power system and keep it nonfunctional by causing power surges at will. It can destroy power plants, grids, distribution stations, refineries, etc. Or it can keep the system failing and nonfunctional by damaging or destroying electronic controls. 5 The 2004 hurricane passing through the Gulf of Mexico did substantial damage to the oil and gas pipelines and some of the oil rigs.

Further, within the government the entourage {xxxvi} seems to have again largely suppressed the information that Defense Secretary Cohen knew and publicly confirmed. The Yakuza strategic threat to the U.S. is one of the most potent we face today, and it increases year by year. That th reat — as is much of the organized international terrorist threat — is being generally coordinated from the old die- hard Communist faction of the FSB/KGB. The Yakuza strategic threat is also being generally ignored by our intelligence analysts, yet the Yakuza are proteges of the same dominant FSB/KGB faction, the one which possesses, controls, and utilizes the Russian energetics superweapons, never having allowed them to pass into the regular Russian armed forces. Thereby the communist faction retains power and will do so. President Vladimir Putin, from the younger faction of the KGB, would like to reach an accommodation with the U.S. However, the Russian communist faction, which remains dominant, prohibits him from doing so. Accordingly, Putin has been forced to reinstitute harsher state control measures and take control of domestic oilfields from private industry. Instead of becoming the \"trusted cheap oil supplier\" to the United States as Putin wished, Russia has allowed China to invest in developing Russian oil fields. This appears to be part of the new alliance among Russia, China, and India. Suppression of \"Energy-from-the- Vacuum\" Electrical Systems Electrical power systems freely taking their energy from the vacuum rather than from fuel are suppressed worldwide by several large and powerful cartels — including in the U.S. scientific community — and for some time the Yakuza has suppressed all EFTV systems successfully developed in Japan. As part of their scheduled plan to catas trophically collapse the U.S. economy by obliterating our power supply, the Yakuza have suppressed several of these legitimate Japanese overunity electrical power systems — such as the Takahashi magnetic Wankel engine {xxxvii} and the Kawai motor {xxxviii} — to prevent them from being marketed. Were these already-developed Japanese systems allowed on the market, they would quickly resolve the world energy crisis, and enable the dismantling and rapid replacement of the horridly vulner able, centralized U.S. electrical power system. Needless to say, the availability of such systems would cleanse the biospheric contamination from energy -related operations and developments, alleviate the march toward global warming, etc. OBLIVION 16"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"All the field energy and potential energy used in every EM circuit already comes directly from the vacuum, and not from cranking a generator shaft or dissipating chemical energy in a battery. The energy is extracted from the vacuum itself by the system's source charges and dipolarities. And yet our own scientific community perpetuates a model assuming th at the field energy from the charges - and therefore the available usable energy in the circuit — is freely created out of nothing at all, while also erroneousl y teaching that it is the mechanical power turning the generator shaft which powers the electric distribution line and distant loads. We do not have to rediscover how to extract usable EM energy from the seething vacuum! Every charge in the universe already continuously does that, and it continuously gushes forth real EM energy extracted from its ongoing \"ratcheting\" vacuum interaction. All we have to do is learn how to properly intercept, extract, and use the already-real energy flows fro m source charges and dipoles. This has to be done by uncovering and eliminating the limitations unwittingly incorporated into the CEM/EE model — such as the ubiquitous closed current loop circuit containing the source dipolarity (the source of potential wired into the external circuit as a load to be continually destroyed — and such as insisting on invariance and Lorentz symmetry of the model because of the \"mathematical beauty\" in symmetrized equations and an invariant sy stem. \"Invariance\" refers to the notion that no new net observable is permitted wh en the equations are regauged. To do that requires symmetrical regauging, which kills any modeling of asymmetrical receipt of excess energy from the active environment. The Lorentz symmetry of our inane electrical power circuits thus guarantees that the much simpler Lorentz- invariant equations can be used to describe the deliberately crippled system's operation. It also guarantees that the sy stem will not electri cally perform with a coefficient of perfor mance (COP) > 1.0. The scientific and industrial and financial entourages love it, and will do whatever is required — destroy careers, withhold funds and tenure, or even k ill the researchers — to keep that status quo. Hence it is not accidental that, in a world filled with an uncountable number of free energy generators called \"source charges\", our vaunted scientific community still opposes energy from the vacuum systems and will not fund or allow research on them. Their position is the ultimate irony, because all of the energy driving every EM system ever built has been extracted from the seething subquant al fluctuations of the vacuum! On the other hand, by deliberately avoiding the Lorentz-invariant equations, one can violate the Lorentz symmetry, resulting in asymmetrical circuits and systems that collect excess energy (i.e., asymme trically regauge themselves) from the active vacuum's interaction with all the ci rcuit's charges. Asymmetrical regauging freely produces a net nonzero force field. A properly designed circuit can utilize this force field to dissipate the previously-collected \"free potential energy\" in external loads to power them almost \"for free\" (as far as any cost to the operator for the energy dissipated). No law of physics is violated, and no valid law of OBLIVION 17"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"thermodynamics is violated (once the erroneous Second Law is corrected, and is no longer the oxymoron and \"half law\" it presently is). Sometimes simple equations contain pr ofound truths. Because a potential (envelope) is actually a set of ongoing EM energy flows, then from any fixed source of potential V, any amount of energy W can be freely collected on intercepting charges q, given sufficient q and also dq/dt = 0. The simple equation is W = Vq. Further, by only increasing V, while pinning a fixed amount of intercepting charges q so that i = dq/dt = 0, any amount of potential energy density V can be freely produced in the system by work-free voltage amplification alone. Regauging is changing the potential(s), nothing else. From such simple equations, one can see that a circuit can self-regauge and take on extra potential energy freely, from any external source of potential energy providing the necessary potential energy flow, without having to do work — so long as the source of potential is not deliberately destroyed. This is done in a two- phase process. In the first phase, dq/dt is made to equal 0 by pinning the charges q to prevent current flow. In this phase the pinned charges are freely potentialized. One can potentialize as many charges as desired without draining the external source of potential, because the source's di polarity is not reduced. In the second phase, the source of potential is disconn ected, the circuit is re-closed and the charges q are unpinned. Now the circuit fr eely dissipates the previously-collected energy to power loads \"for free\". The circuit can perform this two-phase process repetitively and continuously because dq/dt = 0 during the potentialization process. In short, the external sour ce of \"static\" potential will last indefinitely, so long as current is not forcibly pushed up through its dipolarity's back emf. Via a flashlight battery or electret as the \"external pote ntial source, \" under proper circumstances sufficient energy could be extracted from the vacuum to power New York City, at least in theory. We do not have to learn how to extract energy from the vacuum. We only have to learn how to more properly use the energy freely flowing from charges already doing so, and build and use circuits that do not keep killing the source of potential energy flow faster than they power their external loads. The energy we input to the shaft of the generator is to continually restore the destroyed dipolarity, that we intentionally build our \"external systems\" to do, faster than they power the external loads. We pay the power compan y to engage in a giant wrestling match inside its generators and lose. Our classical electrodynamicist s and electrical engineers ha ve missed the fact that, since every EM field and potential is a pattern in the continuous flow of EM energy from the associated s ource charges, the field or pot ential is itself a set of continuous free EM energy flows.

The next morning, a stunned and totally demolished Kawai no longer controlled his invention, his company, his life, or further developments. If not for the Yakuza's intervention, CTEC would have placed self-powering Kawai motors on the world market by mid-1997. Such self-powering electrical systems ar e no more mysterious than windmill powered generators or solar cell array power systems. In each case, the active vacuum environment furnishes all of the energy required. Even though any system has losses and its overall thermodynamic efficiency cannot exceed 100%, the coefficient of performance can equal infinity when the external active environment, not the operator, is the s ource of all of the energy collected. Energy-from-the-vacuum systems to replace our centralized electrical power grid would take nearly-free energy directly from the local vacuum, n eeding no external fuel, pipelines, fleets of tankers, railroad coal cars, refineries, etc. Most of the massive and expensive support structure for our bloated centralized electrical power system would gradually be dismantle d as it was replaced by a decentralized EFTV system.

If the United States did not comply, it would be at war with the Islamic nation, a nation that al Qaeda's leaders said 'desires death more than you desire life'.\" This perhaps explains the morose statem ent of Vice Present Cheney, only a month or so after 9/11, and after he had received intensive briefings on terrorism and its present conduct against the United States. Cheney stated {xlviii}: \"The war on terrorism will not be over in our lifetime. It is different than the Gulf War was in the sense that it may ne ver end. At least not in our lifetime. The way I think of it is, it's a new normalcy.\" Bin Laden also certainly knows the importance economics plays in a war.

Meaning that every dollar of al Qaeda defeated a million dollars, by the permission of Allah!\" He declared his policy is \"bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy,\" and joked about the U.S. \"economic deficit... estimated to total more them a trillion dollars. \" Indeed, our known total obligatio ns are already some $47 trillion dollars, and climbing. Welcome to asymmetric warfare, where war is war, peace is war, and there is only perpetual war, including a virulent form of economic warfare augmented by \"stretching and bleeding the dragon\" and by direct damage of infrastructure. Our Analysts Missed the Yakuza's Key Role and Significant Aspects of the Centrally-Coordinated KGB/FSB Strategic Plan Our own intelligence agencies do not appear to be aware of the key role played by the Yakuza. Nor are they aware, it seems, that the Communist faction of the KGB/FSB directs the entire asymmetrical wa rfare against us, so that, rather than isolated incidents, the actions of all the far-flung pieces are coordinated in a strategic plan of increasing intensity and effect. Our intelligence analysts do not appear to realize that we have entered in to a 3-year Operations Phase schedule - consisting of a two-year initial \"gradual intensification\" period and a 1-year \"maximum intensity and total destruction\" period — to collapse and destroy the United States. The strategy for the initial two-year period is to \"bleed and disorganize the dragon\" until it collapses in fatigue a nd economic chaos. Mind conversions - inserting an additional modified mind in a human, then switching control of the thought and behavior between the indi vidual's normal mind and the implanted mind, thus altering the individual's behavior as desired — will be massively unleashed to guarantee total confusion and disorder. The plan for the third year is to violently attack and dismember the prostrate dragon, swiftly and utterly destroying the United States by totally unleashing the terrorist assets already inserted into the U.S. and waiting. At present, \"bleeding the dragon\" is in full progress and being steadily increased as part of the overall strategic plan against us. We are already stretched well past the capability of our regular Armed Forc es, and we are inducting many of our Reserves and National Guard forces for repeated tours overseas. We have no national draft, and a bitter societal polarizat ion will occur if the draft is reinstated. Our national debt and expenses are escalating rapidly. Our country is hemorrhaging jobs also, further increasing unemployment and financial duress.

The American dollar is propped up only by ever- increasing purchases of U.S. Treasury instruments by foreign nations such as China and Japan, which could change at any time. Several prominent Asian politicians and central bankers have recently made public statements suggesting a coordinated intent to divest dollar-denominated reserve assets and shift reserves to other currencies. An avalanche of covert dollar selling appears to have already begun. Many destructive natural phenomena can be evoked or augmented by the scalar interferometry weapons possessed by the Yakuza. Such phenomena include volcano eruption, earthquake induction, and weather and climate engineering, as confirmed by Secretary Cohen's epochal 1997 statement. But the achievable phenomena also include tsunamis, freak waves in the open ocean, and rogue waves of numerous kind and occurrence {l}. Quoting Wolfgang Rosenthal of the GKSS Research Centre in Geesthach t, Germany on rogue waves {li}: \"The waves exist in higher numbers than anyone expected... Two large ships sink every week on average. But the cause is never studied to the same detail as an air crash. It simply gets put down to 'bad weather'.\" Even super-carrier ships are frequently destroyed by such waves {li}: \"Over the last two decades more than 200 super-carriers — cargo ships over 200m long — have been lost at sea. Eyewitness reports suggest many were sunk by high and violent walls of water that rose up out of calm seas.\" That's an average of ten per year. Inde ed, a satellite test readily confirmed the occurrence of such previously un suspected freak giant waves {li}: \"As part of a project called Max Wave — which was set up to test the rumors — two ESA satellites surveyed the o ceans. During a three week period they detected 10 giant waves, all of which were over 25m (81 ft) high.\" And that was just a one-time survey by only two satellites. Indeed, during that exact three week period while the Max Wave satellites were seeking out huge rogue waves, two large tourist liners endured terrifying ordeals from such waves but survived. The Breman and the Caledonian Star cruisers had their bridge windows smashed by 30m high waves in the South Atlantic. It appears that at least 10 to 12 oil tankers are lost each year to giant rogue waves alone. To appreciate total shipping losses from all causes: In a single year— 1981 - 250 ships of 500 tons or greater size were lost and perished {lii}. Many of these were probably sunk by unexpected large rogue waves. We hardly need point out that a giant oil supertanker on the ocean is also easily destroyed in a single shot by a strategic scalar interferometer. A burst of energy, placed adroitly under the surface by a di stant interferometer, can also produce large waves that arise and smash a ship. This also \"disguises\" the incident as if it were due to anomalous large waves of natural origin."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"With U.S. dependence on foreign oil and most of the oil delivery dependent on supertankers, oil continues to climb in price. In the past the U.S. government has opened the Strategic Oil Resrve a bit, to assist two hard-hit companies while they scrambled to reinstate their supply. It has also just recently squeaked through the authority to drill for petroleum in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge. It would take very little Ya kuza effort to increase the loss of oil tankers, further strangling the U.S. oil supply and dramatically increasing prices. Since the oil supply for all oil-dependent nations comes from known major oil field locations and harbor facilities, deliberate and careful reduction of the tanker fleet and facilities can place extraordinary pressure on oil's availab ility for several major nations at once. 7 Coup de Grace: Strategic Strikes of Great Magnitude Great \"coup de grace\" blows have also b een prepared by the Yakuza, in order to guarantee the catastrophic collapse of the U.S. economy, followed by the swift destruction of the United States itself. Several of these involve opportunistic volcano eruptions and tsunamis {liii} that can readily be evoked. As an example, prior to the end of 2004 the Yakuza registered one or more of its large scalar interferometers upon one of the world's largest supervolcanoes — whose calderas lie beneath or near Ye llowstone National Park. The symbolic timing so close to the anniversary of the 9/11 attack should not be overlooked. The Yellowstone supervolcano erupts about every 600,000 years, and some 640,000 years have elapsed since its last er uption. Hence — geologically speaking - its next eruption is overdue, and the caldera undoubtedly harbors great pent-up stress. Presently a Yakuza finger is on the trigger of the registered scalar mterferometer(s). If that finger pushes the trigger, the interferometer w i l l gradually inject tremendous energy into the Yellowstone supervolcano's stress zone, resulting in a violent eruption. Its previous eruption, about 640,000 years ago, devastated much of North America, including most of the higher life forms. By deliberately kindling the supervolcano into eruption, most of North A m e r i c a would be devastated, and particularly most of the United States {liv}. The supervolcano could eject more ash, lava, rock, and debris than the entire Grand Canyon can hold. Additional side effects would include the instant destruction of most of the agricultural food crops in North America by covering the farmland with thick ash a meter or more in thickness. Survivors would be faced with the immediate problems of starvation and fatal lung disease (Marie's disease), the degree of lung disease varying with exposure to silicon particles of different sizes. Food animals would also be killed in the same catastrophe. 7 In 2004 a Yakuza-generated and Yakuza-stee red hurricane passing through the Gulf of Mexico also was accompanied by just such fre ak waves, which were responsible for much more damage being done to the Gulf oil rigs and pipelines than initially thought. Pipelines on the seafloor were damaged particularly heavily, requiring very costly repairs. OBLIVION 27"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Even worse damage occurred some 74,000 years ago or so, when another large supervolcano exploded, killing all human life on earth except for a few thousand in Africa. More on that shortly. Most of all, in 1997 Secretary of Defe nse William Cohen specifically confirmed that terrorists already were using elect romagnetic weapons to stimulate volcanoes into eruption {xxxv}. Since that is confirmed, and since the Yakuza has the scalar interferometers to do so, it follows that the Yakuza also will have identified the volcanoes in which the most damaging eruptions could be induced to strategically destroy or severely maul the United States. And so it has. To further illustrate the killing power of a supervolcano, consider the eruption, about eleven million years ago, at Bruneau Jarbridge south of Hagerman, Idaho. This eruption covered half of North America with ash two meters thick. Distinctive fossils as far away as Nebraska, 1600 to 2000 kilometers distant, reveal ash piled two meters high that choked the vast animal population of North America to death. Marie's disease, a deadly lung disease caused by ash exposure, contributed to the mass extinction of North American megafauna. Also consider what probably happened about 74,000 years ago with the explosion of the supervolcano whose caldera today lies under Lake Toba on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Though the findings are still controversial, increasingly it appears from multiple evidence that the eruption of Toba wiped out all human life on earth except for a few thousand humans in a location in Africa. This follows a formal theory by Professor Stanley H. Ambrose {lv}, which has gained support as a result of independent geological {lvi} and genetic evidence {lvii}. Genetically, the human mito chondrial genetic trace clearly shows a dramatic and sudden reduction in genetic variability (called a genetic bottleneck) some 74,000 years ago. Also, present human genetics s hows that the ancestors of every person living today came from Africa. After a pe riod of continuing extinction, then during the last 74,000 years following that violent eruption, every human born on the planet descended from the few thousand humans in Africa who survived. Apparently all other humans on earth perished, along with their inherited genetic variations, producing a profound genetic bottleneck in the entire human species {lviii}. Quoting Professor Lynn Jorde, a specialist at the University of Utah who uses deep analysis of mitoch ondrial DNA to investigate mankind's past {lvii}: \"We have a dramatic reduction in genetic diversity during this time when the population is very sm all and then after the bottlen eck the people who we see today would be descendants only of those who survived. And they're going to be genetically much more similar to one another, reducing the amount of genetic variation. ...Mutations in the mitochondria take place with clocklike regularity, so the number of mutations gi ves us a clock essentially that we can use to approximately date the major event. In the case of a population bottleneck, we think that this would have occurred roughly 70-80,000 years ago, give or take some number of thousan ds of years. So then the real question "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"is: What could have caused such a reduction - an extreme reduction - in the human population down to as few as 5 or 10,000 individuals?\" Increasingly the cause appears to be almo st certainly the recognized supervolcano eruption at Toba, some 74,000 years or so ago {lix}. As another example, there is a volcano named Cumbre Vieja, on the Island of La P a l m a in the Canary Islands, which split in the past. The split-off western flank - about the size of the entire Isle of Mann - still hangs above the ocean, poised to slip into the sea. Its eventual crash into the sea will evoke massive tsunamis, moving outward at some 600 miles per hour. Within 7 to 10 hours, an immense wall of water, up to several tens of mete rs high, will strike New York, Boston, and the eastern seaboard, penetrating inland and devastating the area {lx}. It is not a matter of if the incident will occur, but only a matter of when. Tsunamis from underwater volcanoes, seafloor earthquakes, and other shocks occur around the world, including in the Pacifi c Ocean. Quoting {lxi}: \"In the last 1,000 years, Pacific Ocean tsunamis have been observed and recorded over 1,000 times. All of thes e were major catastrophic events, since smaller events often go unrecorded.\" Cumbre Vieja presents another wonderful opportunity to the Yakuza, who almost certainly has registered their scalar interferometers on it, intending to evoke a tsunami by triggering the volcano into eruption. If so, then this is one of the earthquake eruptions that are aknost certain to be initiated by the Yakuza, during the next two years, to assist in causing huge economic damage and mass casualties to the east coast of the United States. Incredibly, the U.S. apparently does not monitor Cumbre Vieja to enable hours of advance warning of the giant tsunami. Without a warning system and lead time to evacuate major cities, great loss of life and economic destructio n can be expected. Further, there are conditions off the west co ast of the U.S. that are also suitable for induction of undersea quakes and large tsunamis. Undoubtedly these arc already on the Yakuza's target list and schedule for striking. As pointed out by Stockton {lxii}, there is also the possibility of heating methane hydrates (frozen natural gas) on the eastern continental shelf to cause missive undersea landslides, which would also cause tsunamis. The strategic significance of Secretary of Defense Cohen's statement {xxxv} in April 1997 becomes abundantly clear. He was referring to a grave strategic destructive capability, already in the hands of the terrorists an d available. He was confirming that this capability is already being used by the terrorists in their asymmetric war against us. That strategic destructive capability, when adroitly utilized, as in the simple examples given, is as powerful as the fu ll nuclear ICBM capability of the Soviet Union or the United States. OBLIVION 29"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Since the Yakuza interferometers can also massively intervene in submarine volcanic and earthquake activity on the ocean floor worldwide, their capability to induce giant tsunamis and other violent waves, in addition to giant quakes and volcanic eruptions, is of the gravest si gnificance. Indeed, the Yakuza recently spectacularly demonstrated such effects, under the direction of the FSB/KGB. On Dec. 26, 2004 they initiated the magnitude 9.3 seafloor quake that caused severe tsunamis and loss of life in Asia, now thought to include more than 300,000 deaths in addition to enormous economic damage. Summary of Some Weather Engineering and Other Capabilities Some of the simpler scalar interferometer capabilities in engineering of the weather and geophysical events are: a. Steering the jet stream, thus steering a weather entity (i.e., storm, front, air mass, and hurricane). Warming the air in one region expa nd it so it becomes less dense, creating a low pressure area. Gradually moving the targ et interference zone determines its path. Cooling the air in a region produces the oppos ite effect, a high pressure zone, steerable in the same fashion. By making multiple highs and lows and adroitly positioning and steering them, the jet streams and other prevailing winds can be entrained, captured and steered. This alone allows substantia l augmentation and steering of weather effects. b. Warming or cooling the atmosphere in a storm or front to affect its power. c. Producing sharp negative energy EM pulses in side a storm so that the negative energy Dirac sea holes \"eat\" electron charges, reducing the storm's charge and power. d. Producing positive energy EM pulses just outside a storm in order to lift extra electrons from the Dirac Sea, to increase the storm's charge and power. In that case the resulting Dirac holes expand outward an d away from the storm, having no effect on it. As they meet stray electrons, these holes eat the electrons and both disappear back into the vacuum, as ordinary vacuum (the Dirac Sea). e. Building very large rotational atmospheric flow in the path of a storm, and then sharply decreasing the diameter of its curvature, so that the storm's angular momentum spawns concentrated spin flows or meteorological circulations, to form tornadoes, waterspouts, etc. f. Establishing a large high pressure area in a region to block lower-pressure normal winds and storm directions. g. Establishing a large low pressure area in a region to attract higher-pressure normal winds and storm activity. h. Focusing the interference zone inside a volcano's magma chamber and steadily depositing additional EM energy there builds up internal pressure, causing an eruption. A slow rise in pressure, resisted by friction, engenders a large and violent eruption, and consequently maximizes the distant dispersion of great quantities of ash, lava, and other debris. i. By more rapidly inputting the energy in to the volcano, the eruption will occur at a lower pressure and so a smaller eruption will ensue. OBLIVION 30"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"j. All sorts of EM energy forms glowin g spheres, hemisphe res, etc. can be produced and used against various targets, for electrical and electronic destruction or f o r an electromagnetic explosion when th e energy contacts the intended target. k. Depositing extra intcrfcrometry energy into a fault zone increases stress and piezoelectric activity in the rocks, thereb y inducing an earthquake when the rocks fi n a l l y slip. By adjusting the rate at which the excess energy is added, the size of the r e sulting earthquake can also be changed. l. By increasing the charge of a storm, its electrical activity and the resulting lightning strikes can be increased. This is useful, e.g., in repeatedly producing large forest fires, particularly when combined with weather engineering to produce a drought condition. On the other hand, by decreasing the charge of a storm, its electrical activity and therefore its lightning strike activity can be decreased. m. By inducing repeatedly pulsed negative energy in an area containing living animals or humans, the animals or humans can be direc tly killed. Strong pulsing will result in rather instant death, where the bodies drop limply, with not even a nerve cell firing thereafter. Everything living — cells, microbes, viruses, whatever — in the powerfully struck bodies is killed instantly, and the bodies do not decay, even over a month or more. The Soviets tested such weaponry in this mode against two Afghan villages in their own war in Afghanistan, and it is prob able that the Yakuza has produced portable negative energy EMP weapons with similar capability. n. The longitudinal EM wave sets — and beams of such — transmitted by a scalar interferometer easily penetrate Faraday shie lds, the ocean, the earth, etc. That is because matter is mostly empty space filled with Whittaker EM fi elds and potentials, which in turn are bundles of longitudi nal EM wave sets. Hence matter is a \"superhighway\" for the throughput of long itudinal waves. Such longitudinal wave weapons are very useful in attacking deep underground targets and facilities and destroying them or wreaking damage. As an example, the leader of a nation can be killed sitting in the chair at his desk, by a precision scalar interferometer. The interferometry focus has been demonstrated down to a few inches. In Japan, the Yakuza has demonstrated this capability on a few occasions to kill several Japanese critics inside shelters or shielded facilitie s. The significant impact on the very notion of shielding by strategic command and co ntrol centers in underground bunko and facilities can be easily appreciated. Essent ially all facilities and personnel become completely vulnerable. o. The use of a more portable scalar interferom eter to destroy the electronic controls of a normal or nuclear power plant from a distan ce is obvious. With nuc lear power plants this poses the risk of a melt down. Electrical controls for pipe valves, etc. are also vulnerable; spent nuclear fuel rods are la rgely stored in underwater pools on normal power plant sites. If valves open and the water drains from those pools, the rods will heat up and a melt down or very hazardous venting of radioactivity can ensue. p. The control systems for hydroelectric dams are deadly vulnerable to scalar interferometry attack. q. Large electronic complexes such as switching and control systems, centralized control systems for power grids and substations, etc. are highly vulnerable to attack by long- or short-range scalar interferometers. OBLIVION 31"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"r. Chemical plants, refineries, fuel storage sites, tank farms, etc. are also highly vulnerable to scalar interferomctry, including to portable attack. s. Liquid natural gas ships, oil tankers, et c. are also extremely vulnerable to scalar interferometry attack. t. Surges on the power distribution grid tr ansmission lines can easily be accomplished by scalar interferometry at will, methodically causing great damage to the grid and emergency shutdown of most of its \"feeding\" power plants. As much of the grid as desired can easily be kept nonfunctional, as long as desired, by occasional repeats from a single long-range scalar interferometer. u. Any communications center or headquarter s is completely vulnerable to attack and destruction by strategic or portable scalar interferometers. Since a scalar interferometer can also produce negative energy EMP pulses of extreme lethality in the interference zone, all centralized co mmand and control systems are essentially totally vulnerable. As an example, our own future network centric warfare communications systems can be totally destroyed in a few minutes by only a few scalar interferometers, even by just one. v. Many other capabilities also exist to use the interferometry to affect the weather, the atmosphere, the rocks in the earth or at the bottom of the ocean, etc. Once the Yakuza scalar interferometers ar e factored into the strategic terrorist threat situation, there is no recourse that can save the present centralized electrical power system, large U.S. comma nd and control systems, etc. The only way to prevent the total economi c collapse of the United States induced by collapsing the centralized electrical power system is to immediately initiate the strongest possible energy from the vacuum systems development and production program. For the nation to survive the coming destruction of its power system, the goal must be to replace the entire centra lized power system, including its long distribution lines and large feeder power plants, with decentralized EFTV power systems as rapidly as possible. That centralized system is simply not defensible and not sustainable against current threats, and against the hostile assets already successfully inserted or waiting abroad to support terrorist operations inside the U.S. So the strongest possible immediate efforts are necessary if we are to prevent our total economic collapse in about two years, and also our subsequent total destruction by combined scalar interferom etry and internal terrorist attacks. A massive Manhattan-type project to develop and deploy EFTV electrical power systems is most urgently required, as at least equal to the highest U.S. priority. We bluntly state without further discussion that such EFTV systems are indeed already developed in our own country and worldwide, and so they are available, but they have deliberately been withhe ld or suppressed for decades. Now they must be unleashed.

If so, that will leave the U.S. prostrate for its subsequent rapid physical destruction by the jubilant Yakuza in a giant \"turkey shoot\". And hence our oblivion. U.S. Societal Polarizations Are Being Gradually Increased Among sociologists, there is much support for the notion that societal polarizations naturally tend to increase {l xiii}. Further, many pollsters state that the nation is very seriously polarized already, particularly since the recent presidential election. For example, quoting John Zogby on the 2004 elections {lxiv}: \"I have been calling this the Armageddon election now for months because we are so polarized, so split culturally, politically, ideologically, demographically, like almost no other time in American hi story. ... The last time the nation was this deeply divided over what course to take was the original Armageddon election of 1800.\" However, for the first time in history, certain rather esoteric \"mind war\" FSB/KGB weapons are being directly employed to gradually and reliably intensify the societal polarizations in America— straight vs. gay, conservative vs. liberal, Republican vs. Democrat, one re ligion against another, one race against another, labor class vs. financial class, etc. The strategic objective is to increase and intensify the extreme ends of these polarizations, by altering the behaviour of certain leaders. With intensification, th e polarizations will slowly become so fierce that, about two years from now, serious rioting and bloodshed massively spilling into the streets and cities will result in chaos, martial law, etc. and severe polarization and disorganization. In short, the society will be engaged in fiercely consuming itself. So far, the deliberate escalation of our so cietal polarizations by the new mind war and conversion techniques is right on schedule, as anyone can see now, and will increasingly see over the next two years. U.S. societal polarizations will continue to increase now that the election is over. Temporary conversions and fractional conversions {vii} of the minds and mind operations (and therefore the behavior) of selected leaders or prime movers in the various polarization areas are being used and will increase. This capability arises from the branch of energetics known as psychoenergetics, and such measures are now being used selectively to intensify ou r polarizations. Particularly see our giant briefing on mind war and conversions, in the second part of this book. OBLIVION 33"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Dramatic tests of the distant, total control over the mind and behavior of a person performing an intensive technical task (flying and operating an aircraft as a weapons platform) {lxv} were conducted against Captains Button and Svoboda in 1997. A third test against Captain Hess in 1998 demonstrated total control of the autonomic nervous system as well. Those dramatic \"suicides\" were deliberate, high profile stimuli to see if our own intelligence analysts knew anything about psychoenergetics yet. The answer was a very resounding and clear \"No, they are still ignorant of that area, they are very determined to remain ignorant of that area, and hence the nation is still deadly vulnerable to use of such weapons and effects.\" Our scientific community still does not understand that mind operations are totally electromagnetic but temporal, not spatial, although they also have virtual state projections in 3-space. Because the sc ientific community has suppressed the source charge problem, they have no notion of the exact mechanism by which virtual state changes can be integrated to observable changes, electromagnetically by the action of charge itself. They also do not understand that observations in 3-space have small virtual state projections in the time domain (as mind operations). Our scientists have no understanding at all that mind operations are (i) electromagnetic, (ii) temporal, and (iii) directly engineerable and creat able (but using time-polarized EM photons and waves). They do not understand what thought is, what intent is and what its exact mechanism of expression is, and how mind and body are coupled to provide a living biological system. Again, because our nation is so totally vulnerable to mind war conversions and fractional conversions, a U.S. crash program of utmost rapidity to catch up in that area, under a Presidential Decision Di rective, is urgently required. For example, on his customary morning exercise jog at a military post in the U.S., in March 1998 Captain Gordon Hess suddenly veered aside, sat down, took out his knife and calmly stabbed himself in the neck and torso some 26 times, including multiple thrusts directly through th e heart. Note that the shock of a stab through the heart is considered in forensic medicine as generating such shock and recoil of the autonomic nervous system that it is not possible for an intentional suicide to continue, much less to achieve a total of 26 repeated stabs until the body simply became nonfunctional and toppled over. In short, total control of even the deep autonomic nervous system was demonstrated resoundingly. The purpose of the test was two-fold: (i) demonstrate distant instant conversion and total control, including of the autonomic nervous system itself, and (ii) stimulate and \"ping\" U.S. intelligence to see if they knew what was going on, what had been tested, and why. Both purposes were achieved, The test went perfectly, and the U.S. demonstrated it was totally asleep and totally ognorant of such technology, and even of the technology's ansatz. Indeed, by order of the U.S. Army, two days later front loaders dumped two tons of dirt on the death scene, effectively hiding any further evidence.

The Yakuza view is that - together with the other terrorist organizations already ha ving infiltrated substantial assets into t h i s n ation, and together with chaos in U.S. streets due to severe polarizatopms gradually being intensified now — they are already helping to bleed the dragon increasingly. Then as the scenario progres ses they will joyfully begin the direct destruction of the centralized U.S. electrical power system and other key economic targets (harbors, refineries, pipeline s, etc.). They will also participate in immune system spreading (explained later in this paper), as a force amplifier to biological warfare strikes by other terror ists. As all of this hostile action and destruction ramps up over the next two years, it will crescendo and catastrophically collapse the entire economy of the U.S. Added to assure that great economic collapse, there will also be a sudden and massive collapse of \"group ordering and coherence\" (GO) induced by massive conversions of \"sleeper\" inserted conver sions and fractional conversions. E.g., by sudden switching conversion of massive numbers of key persons whose behavior instantly and dramatically changes all ove r the map, the order and coherence of any important group can be and will be devastated and lost, immediately. Our police forces may suddenly begin attacking our populace, while crews manning and operating our ICBMs, nuclear subs, and nuclear bombers \"go crazy\" and erratically start firing at our own cities, an d at each other. And so on, in a society that has suddenly erupted into total schizophrenia. Throughout the U.S. and Canada, GO will rather dramatically be come NO-GO, as all group coherence is lost and total chaos sets in, as in the two examples given.. Given the planned present offensive schedule and the insertions already accomplished, indeed the plan for full strate gic destruction of the U.S. is likely to succeed. The psychoenergetics conversions and fractional conversions are a major strategic weapons program in support of the pr esent three-year \"Operations Phase\" schedule for strategic destruction of the U.S. So it is also a program that supports the strategic destruction of the centralized U.S. electrical power system including its infrastructure, as one purpose. The original targets desired by Bin Laden for the 9/11 attack actually were nuclear power plants etc. —parts of th e centralized electrical power system — rather than the more symbolic Twin Towers, Pentagon, and White House.

So to guarantee success, he opted for strikes on symbolic but softer targets, which would provide great publicity stimulus in the MidEast for his cause, in addition to causing great consternation in the United States. Insertions Far Exceeding Public Acknowledgment Long before its economic collapse in the latter 1980s, the former Soviet Union inserted nuclear weapons in all our major cities and population centers, along with Spetznaz teams to detonate them on command. Lunev's book {lxvi} even tells a few of the ways the weapons were inse rted. Those weapons and teams, still controlled by the old-guard Communist faction that dominates the FSB/KGB, are still here, still waiting for the order to detonate the nuclear weapons and destroy the United States. The Communist faction (not the younger and more liberal faction from which Putin comes) is the one plotting to destroy the United States. These Russian nuclear weapons and teams may be brought into play during the operations phase as several substantia l nuclear explosions in major U.S. population centers that will be blamed on the international terrorists. The result will be great loss of life, nuclear cont amination of several large U.S. cities, complete overwhelming of our Homeland Defense and medical capability to handle mass casualties, and terrible physical damage to further guarantee the scheduled catastrophic U.S. economic colla pse once the centra lized electrical power system is taken out. As previously mentioned, we would have been destroyed by the former Soviet Union in the late 1970s, by those successfully inserted Soviet nuclear weapons already at their target sites on station in th e U.S., except that a friendly nation also inserted nuclear weapons massively into th e cities and key target areas of Russia. Those friendly weapons are also still in place, waiting for the order for their detonation if necessary. This sort of thing in the \"old days\" of cold war intelligence was called dead man fuzing. It is still in place today, but its \"range of uses and functions\" has substantially increased. Being chess players and rational adversar ies, the Russians can be countered by a balance of terror including dead man fuzing — the old Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) notion with the twist of using inserted nuclear weapons already on site in the targeted nation — because they will not just commit mass suicide for Mother Russia. So the United States survived in the 1970s, courtesy of a friendly nation, and we were not suddenly destroyed by American city after city blowing up in a nuclear inferno. The MAD tactic worked because the adversaries were known and their location could be destroyed at will. However, with irrational foes such as those in the war on Islamic terrorism, mutual assured destruction is not an effective deterrent. There is no single nation or location in which to insert \"dead man fuzing\" against the terrorists or target with deliverable weapons of mass destruction. The present terrorists are not localized, but are dispersed worldwide a nd embedded in the civilian populaces of many nations, including our own. In that case, there is only assured destruction of OBLIVION 36"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"the nation targeted by the terrorists, if and when the terrorists successfully place enough weapons of mass destruction into the targeted nation(s). In short, MAD simply turns into AD. The te rrorists will soon achieve that capability, if they have not already reached it. In the case of assured destruction, the insertion phase — which can reach a very high assurance level before the operations phase is initiated — becomes th e k e y t o winning or losing, given that the terrorists have or obtain sufficient WMD assets to insert. T h e purpose of strategic asymmetric warfare is to kill or destroy t h e targeted populace. It is a fanatical ultimate expr ession of General George Patton's famous, blunt statement: \"I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country...\" {lxvii}. Modern Asymmetrical War: The Scorpion Duel We thus are back to the absolutely primitive warfare of two dueling scorpions: He who first succeeds at insertion, and then strikes his enemy hard and decisively in his vitals, is he who wins a priori. T h e procedure is to first ensure that on e will hit the foe's vitals catastrophically, and sufficiently to destroy th e entire foe himself. That is the Insertion Phase. Then the procedure is to unleash what has been assembled, thereby destroying the foe. That is the Operations Phase. Hence the success of the insertion phase — inserting the necessary WMD a n d operational teams into those vitals in advance — predetermines the success of the subsequent operations phase, where one strikes on order, unleashing the WMD and destroying the nation's vitals and therefore destroying the foe. For the targeted scorpion, there is no turning back or delay, once the insertion phase of the scorpion duel begins against him. Successful insertion of the required WMD and WMD teams — during a time our folks innocently think of as \"peacetime\" — almost inevitably wins the war by destroying the penetrated adversary very shortly after the operations phase begins. In a nutshell, those two phases — insertion followed by operations — constitute the \"offense\" part of asymmetric war. And since peacetime is ju st the insertion phase, asymmetric war is perpetual war, whether or not shooting is ongoing. There has been little public \"briefing\" by our government on what the estimated success of the insertion phase against us has been and is now. Apparently much of the analysis is in disarray, filled with assumptions, and very short on actual definitive data. It also follows that most definitive data in this area would be highly classified, particularly to protect effective human intelligence (HUMINT) sources. OBLIVION 37"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Now one can appreciate VP Cheney's moro se statement. Since \"peacetime\" now is just another name for \"insertion phase\", then \"perpetual peace\" is still \"perpetual war\" in the new vernacular. So we have entered a \"perpetual war\" we have not previously known or understood. There is no real peace in the sense we think of it. There never will be any pe ace again, until one opposing side of the dueling scorpions is utterly destroyed. The \"defense\" part for the terrorists is to hide or defend their own \"vitals\" — their actual bases, support organizations, supply routes, troops and forces and equipment, etc. In the present asymmetric war, there are no si ngle terrorist bases for us to just \"knock out\" decisively. We cannot win this war by simply having our troops riding out of \"Fortress America\", meeting and defending some hostile army on some distant battlefield, and then riding back into our protected fortress again. There no longer exists such a thing as a \"protected Fortress America \". Instead of an identifiable single army on a single foreign battlefield, the terrorist foe's \"vitals\" are hidden around the world, in many places, and in many ways. Many of them — often the most dangerous of them — are secretly hidden right here in the United States, inserted during the insertion phase which has been ongoing for at least 20 years. In the U.S., we cannot \"hide\" our vitals such as refineries, pipelines, railroads, bridges, electrical power plants and long transmission lines, harbors, water supplies, food supplies, etc. Instead, we can only try to protect them against their certain attack, and try to limit the damage and destruction. The main target for the terrorists is not just our military forces , but is primarily our civilian populace and especially our national economy — which is particularly vulnerable by the rather simple destruction of our centralized electrical power system and its primary support infrastructure. The real art of asymmetric war is to fi rst draw most of the targeted opponent's military forces out of the protected fortress and get them scattered widely in distant locations and distant struggles. By augmenting the distant resistance, this forces the targeted nation's military forces mostly to be deployed elsewhere, leaving the internal fortress itself much less protected, and thus making it highly vulnerable. Once the major decisive action is shifted to inside the protected fortress, there is an urgent necessity for (i) a strong Homeland Defense, (ii) well-organized and effective mass casualty treatment capabilities (which presently do not exist), and (iii) strong border defenses, sealing of th e borders, and interception of insertion attempts as they occur, etc. This also pr esently is not in place; our borders are full of holes and in many ways almost a joke. There is also the urgent need to go after the opposing scorpion's \"vitals\" wherever the pieces can be located and \"fixed in place\" and destroyed. Ironically, for the U.S. these urgent needs come at a time when our HUMINT resources have largely been abandoned or nullified, by the past fascination of our OBLIVION 38"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"intelligence community for technical widgets such as s a t e llite photography, etc. So our ability to ferret out inserted cells and WMD has been sharply reduced by the intelligence community itself. Effective HUMINT takes years to get established with successful agents infiltrated into the terrorist cells and pl anning organizations. So not too much is going to be rapidly accomplished to re solve our HUMINT shor tfalls. Much of what HUMINT is available is either from foreign sources or is due to the clandestine cooperation of much of the peaceful U.S. Muslim community, which sees this nation as its own country, and thus sees any threat to destroy the U.S. as a threat against the peaceful Muslim re ligion itself. To understand some of the factions and divisions of the Muslim world, the reader is referred to treatises by Williams {xcvi, xcvii}. But the scorpion duel is highly sensitive to being able to (i) find the opponents vitals (which now are the inserted assets and terrorist teams within one's own nation) and (ii) go after the scorpion's vitals and destroy them in what are erroneously called \"peacetime operati ons\". Ironically, one sets up winning or losing the asymmetric war, by one's actio ns in peacetime. Once in an asymmetric war, \"peacetime\" is the absence of significa nt overt active hostilities, but with the presence of fierce covert insertion and preparations for the follow-on operations phase and the \"knockout\" punches. Distant Military Actions: N ecessary but Not Sufficient Hence one cannot think of winning major battles and the asymmetric war in a few months or even a few years, simply by fighting successfully on well-defined distant battlefields. Those distant conflicts and confrontations are necessary but not sufficient, a term mathematicians delight in using. It simply means one has to do it, to prevent losing, but by itself it is not sufficient to win the war on terrorism. Instead, one must also think of a continuing gritty, gruesome war, lasting for decades, ongoing in one's own cities and population centers and installations. One rather gradually grinds down the terrorist opponents and rather gradually uncovers and destroys the various parts of their vitals, while protecting one's own v i t a l s as much as possible, and while rooting out everything one can of the insertions made by the foe or further attempted by the foe. Here effective HUMINT is vitally important, and our shortage of it is a grave strategic vulnerability. Obviously our intelligence agencies are also scrambling to try to get such HUMINT effectively going again. If one destroys the terrorists' assets and capabilities before they destroy him, one survives, but still must root and destroy th e terrorists themselv es. If one does not succeed in doing that, one di es because the terrorists will resurge and destroy him without mercy. This is the message the Al Qaida and other terrorists are symbolically sending, when they behead prisoners and hostages. It is absolutely a scorpion duel to the death. OBLIVION 39"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"With the abrupt wake-up call of 9 / 1 1 , we were suddenly confronted with the continuing and unrelenting nature of this asymmetric warfare. At least officialdom and our armed forces were confronted wi th it; there has been no truly adequate news briefing or educational series for the American public on such matters. The military schools of the Army, Navy, and Air Force do include education on such asymmetric warfare, including highly classified courses at the top secret level. But certainly the U.S. public still does not underst and the absolute necessity for Cheney's morose statement or the full nature of the new re ality of asymmetric war {xlviii}. Indeed, much of our population is polarized, because of— for one thing — a substantial and naive belief that all problems could readily be solved by negotiation, if only Bush were so inclined. Indeed, as with every other strong and emotional subject, the subject of \"asymmetry\" in warfare is itself a societ al polarization area. Typical \"anti-views\" simply downplay the very notion of asymmetry as being \"nothing new or special\" in warfare {lxviii}. As one reads such tr eatises, it becomes crystal clear that our own strategic planners and strategic th eorists themselves are often confused, simply recasting asymmetric war into what has gone before. They are not factoring in such radical developments as the Yakuza's acquisition and use of scalar electromagnetic superweapons, or the dramatic change that occurs in the theory once full strategic U.S. destruction is a capability already in terrorists' hands, with multiple knock-out blows already cocked and waiting. And they certainly are not factoring in the stunning implications of mind war, conversions, etc. If one can disable an entire populace mental ly, at a single stroke, one can use such \"mind war\" conversion switching to destroy any order in the society nearly instantly. With suitable preparation during the insertio n phase, terrorists and foes with such capability can indeed achieve sudden mass ive \"knockout\" of a targeted populace, in ways presently not dreamed of by the open press. Asymmetric Warfare Simp lified: An Overview Let us briefly discuss this \"new\" kind of \"old\" warfare in the most direct manner possible. The present war is a very different kind of warfare called asymmetric war. It consists of two phases: (1) the insertion phase, (co nducted in what we erroneously call \"peacetime\"), during which the necessary WMD and teams to operate and unleash them are inserted in the targeted nation's populace, population centers, and key target areas and made ready to go, and (2) the operations phase, in which the inserted fo rces and assets are unleashed, thereby destroying the targeted nation — in this case, the U.S. itself. The bulk of the target and intention is to kill U.S. civilians and destroy critical facilities right in the U.S. homeland — as many as possible, as efficiently as possible, and wherever and whenever possible. OBLIVION 40"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Secondary 8 to the important of population kill during the operations phase is the destruction of the targeted nation's economy, catastrophically and decisively. If the foe succeds dramatically in accomplish ing the insertion phase, the foe will almost automatically win the follow-on operations phase a priori, unless he is an utter fool. Further, the development of secret weapons and superweapons is not confined just to their use in overt warfare. Depending on their nature, they can a l s o be used in covert or asymmetric warfare, in grea t surprise and shock upon the targeted populace. Our very real problem today is that the insertion phase has been going on for at least two decades, while we were literally \"sleeping\" as far as intercepting and degrading the insertion effort by any substantial degree at all. The blunt truth is that the terrorists' Inser tion Phase has just about b een successfully accomplished already. We are in grave danger of being utterly destroyed, with high assurance, in the three-year Operations Phase whose first part has already begun. Compare the conduct of asy mmetric warfare as analogous to orienting and setting up weapons and ammunition and target lis ts for a massive artillery barrage, and preparing to make a massive attack with that barrage. One first gets the artillery guns shipped into the necessary assembly areas, assembled in place, with their ammunition and crews inserted and made ready, with their target lists completed and waiting. Then one gets the vast assembly of guns and crews properly registered on their specific targets and ready to go. That's the \"insertion\" or \"preparation\" phase for a normal mass artillery bombardment. Then the assemblage of \"weapons in place\" simply fires the massive barrage on order, and that is the \"operations\" phase, exploding with suddenness and great violence right on the enemy's vitals. An important major characteristic of this \"normal\" warfare insertion phase is that it is the insertion of the delivery systems, to chosen \"attack positions\" outside the targeted area. In asymmetric war, instead of assemb ling all the external delivery systems (cannon, rockets, missiles, bombers, etc.) it is as if most of the deadly ordnance is already delivered and is assembled right in its target areas, inside the targeted nation, along with the necess ary teams to set them off right there in place. Long- range additional systems placed \"outside\" the targeted nations can also assist or lend support, particularly if the system s are still secret and unknown to the targeted nation. 8 However, if the economy can be catastrophica lly destroyed along with total disordering of the society by sudden massive mind conversions, destroying all coherence, the entire population is reduced to hapless targets and al ready completely defeated. Such a hapless populace can then be methodically destroyed. OBLIVION 41"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"In short, in asymmetric warfare the \"delivery\" pan of the former operations phase is pre-accomplished, before hostilities even begin. So the insertion phase gets the artillery rounds placed right at the target during \"peacetime\", and avoids any further assembling of the external artill ery pieces, rocket launchers, and other delivery systems necessary in the conventional war approach. Thus successful insertion in asyminetric war overcomes one of the vagaries of standard war: the inaccuracies and mishaps caused by misdeliveries and/or losses of the delivery systems themselves prior to delivering the ordnance on the distant targets. In normal war, those misdeliveries and losses to the delivery systems directly subtract from the effects achieved on the target once the attack is initiated. In asymmetric war, the cost of misdeliveries and losses to the inserted WMD are paid for before the hostilities and before th e attack (the operations phase) begins. So given a successful insertion, \"deliver y system losses\" prior to attack do not subtract from the effectiveness of the a ttack results, once the attack is initiated. Indeed, successful insertion is a great force amplifier. Once the hostile terrorists possess weapons of mass destruction and have already delivered them onsite to the actual target s, the \"massive barrage\" of the operations phase is certain to destroy the targeted foe, if the terrorist leaders have any competence at all in their planning and preparations. The great advantage of the insertion phase is that it covertly prepares a great \"barrage\" where the \"ordnance delivery to the exact target locations \" has already been accomplished and its lethal effectiveness against the actual targets has therefore been assured in advance. With proper stealth and intrigue, the insertion phase can be accomplished slowly and at will, and wit hout any extraordinary resistance being offered by the \"sleeping\" targeted nation or population! After all, it is \"peacetime\" when such clandestine insertion operations are conducted. In the new concept, \"peace\" is simply the insertion phase of the perpetual war. So asymmetric war bypasses much of the normal overt concern with long range delivery systems such as ICBMs, strate gic bombers, aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines, etc. The usual giant armada of delivery systems is largely unnecessary, if the terrorists can successfu lly perform the covert insertion phase, instead, the terrorists' major early activity is in ordnance procurement, not in building long range delivery systems. Obviously asymmetric war dramatically differs dramatically from normal symmetric war, and so there are definitely some new questions which must be asked and answered. A Few Questions to be Answered In an asymmetric war situation, some major appropriate questions for the targeted nation are: Are all the terrorists identified as to parent organization, etc.? How certain is the targeted nation that there have been no substantial omissions from its foe identification and capabilities list? Are there already effective compensatory OBLIVION 42"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"plans in case there suddenly are uncovcre d additional tcrrorist organizations or parent organizations, and/or additional capabilities? What is the WMD and o t h e r clandestine w eapon capability of the terrorists, their organizations, their supporting nations or groups, etc.? How certain is the targeted nation that there have been no substantial omissions from the weapons capability lists? Are there already effective compensatory plans in case there suddenly are uncovered additional WMD or clandestine weapon capabilities of the terrorists or their parent organizations? In view of Secretary of Defense Willia m Cohen's seminal 1997 statement, what specifically is the capability of the terrorists to cause those volcanic eruptions, weather engineering and climate cont rol, and initiation of earthquakes? Particularly in view of anomalous quake swarms ongoing, and the disastrous 9.3 undersea quake on Dec. 26, 2004 that initi ated the catastrophic tsunamis in Asia? What specifically is the nature of these strange \"electromagnetic\" weapons confirmed by Defense Secretary Cohen? What specifically are the counters to them, and specifically how effective are these counters? Further, why is so large a percentage of the government still unknowle dgeable of this critical portion of the terrorist threat and thus totally unprepared for it? Why has the American public not been completely and adequately briefed on these confirmed terrorist developments? Even though known specific foreign areas with concentrations of the terrorist organizations and/or their support groups are targeted for attack and neutralization, how much of the total terrorist capabilities have been reduced by such measures? What if anything has been the impact on the inserted capabilities already inside the United States? Exactly what information is officially available (and to what degree of confidence) on the \"missing\" 5 Ukraine SS -19 Stiletto ICBMs, each missile with 6 nuclear warheads and each warhead of several hundred kilotons yield? {lxix} To add spice to the controversy, three years after \"all\" the SS-19s were supposedly turned in and accounted for, another 31 physically turned up in Ukrainian s i l o s and warehouses! One also questions what happened to the additional 230 or so missing \"extra\" nuclear warheads from the Ukraine total? {lxx, lxxi} What happened to the missing Russian suit case nuclear weapons? {lxxii} What happened to the 20 suitcase nuclear weapons allegedly purchased by Bin Laden {lxxiii}, etc.? What if anything has been done about the already-inserted Russian nuclear weapons and Spetznaz teams in our cities and population centers? What if any defense or countermeasures exist to prevent our destruction at some point, from these nuclear weapons alone? And again, why has not the American public been adequately briefed on such hostile capabilities and on the \"nuclear knives already at our throats\"? How long has the insertion phase been ongoing? How effective or ineffective has interception and neutralization or intercept of the insertion attempts been? Again, why has the American public not been thoroughly briefed on these areas? Why OBLIVION 43"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"has the Congress not been adequately briefed on them? What is Homeland Defense doing about them? What is the probable target listing believed to have been compiled by the terrorists, based on their actual weapon capabilities and the degree of insertion success actually accomplished? Considering Bin Laden's background in economics, and his past statements on th e importance of disrupting the economics, is not the near-absolute vulnerability of our centralized electrical power system our greatest strategic weakness, insofar as catastrophic collapse of the U.S. economy being introduced? If so, why has the scientific community and industrial community been allowed to push for hot fusion, hundreds of pebble bed reactor nuclear power plants, etc. wh en our entire centralized el ectrical power system will be destroyed long before any of those could come on line? Even if the nuclear power plants were built and on line, they too are \"sitting ducks\" and \"fat targets\", so what is to prevent their easy instruct ion by the Yakuza scalar interferometers, both long range external systems and portable inserted systems? What are the various options for the assessed terrorist \"preparation\" at the particular stage of their insertion phase, or in the near future? Which of these options have the greatest probabilities of destroying or inflicting unacceptable damage on the targeted nation? Which of these options are also matched by known or detected insertions al ready accomplished or attempted? Since we know that certain of our enemies — e.g., the KGB/FSB — understand the importance of surprise weapons or superweapons, what is our very best assessment of the probability and cap ability for the terrorists possessing and inserting surprise weapons or superwea pons for which the targeted nation has little defense capabilities? E.g., what about the surprise \"electromagnetic\" weapons the U.S. Secretary of Defense confirmed, while most of the U.S. government officials — and even our own intelligence agencies, which still largely base their EM intelligence analyses on the totally inadequate electrical engineering model — are s till unaware of them? Why has not our scientific community been made fully aware of them, and put to intensive work on them? And since it is perhaps our greatest vu lnerability, why is an aged piece of inadequate EM modeling with known serious falsities still perpetuated by the U.S. scientific community, NAS, NSF, NAE, the DoE, etc.? Who's competently watching the \"technical store\" anyway — is anyone? Or is everyone just blithely accepting the self-serving scientific cartels' pronouncement that \"we are the greatest\"? With a three-year plan already in motion for our total destruction, and with a large key role played by the vulnerability of our electrical power system and its coming destruction, why are not our Departme nt of Energy, National Academy of sciences, National Science Foundation, etc. already under strong Presidential orders to reprioritize their energy resear ch at the greatest speed possible? Why has not the U.S. scientific community alread y corrected the terribly flawed CEM/EM mess that is taught in our universities an d used by our power engineers? Why are OBLIVION 44"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"they not conducting a massive Manhattan-type project for energy from the vacuum systems to totally replace the pres ent centralized power system? Then is no other possible solution, once one rec ognizes that the centralized electrical power system itself is going in be destro yed with very high assurance, within about two years from now. So why are all our scientific efforts actually siphoning off research funds for puerile things wh ich will take decades and will not do the job even then, while enriching and perpet uating the \"scientific entourages\" driving this sad situation? Since a major part of the problem is the great leap forward of the Russian science of energetics — now 50 years old — and its development of superweapons, then why are our scientists still largely preoccupied with standard electrical engineering and classical elect rodynamics — models so hideously flawed and made so antiquated by the progress of physics that they should have been dramatically changed at least three quarters of a century ago? Why is there no really substantive unde rstanding or definitive work ongoing to lapidly develop means of collecting and using the unlimited free EM energy pouring from every charge and dipole in the universe, including in every EM circuit and self-restricted electrical power system? Many other similar questions can be a nd should be raised, but the foregoing questions demonstrate the direction and intent of what should be queried. The Ease with which Terrorists Could Obtain WMDs In facing an asymmetric war launched ag ainst us, the availability of clandestine WMD to the terrorists, so that the weapons can be inserted, becomes a primary consideration — along with an extraordinary need to understand the new superweapons and rapidly develop counters and defenses. An internet search for two search terms: Voz Island in the Aral Sea {lxxiv} and anthrax, will quickly demonstrate th e ready availability of WMD to any competent and supported terrorist organization. The Russian biological weapons research and production facilities there were the world's best, appreciably ahead of similar facilities in the West. Hundreds of tons of very high quality biological warfare agents were just dumped on Voz Island from those Russian facilities. Quoting Marshall, Malakoff, and Holden {lxxiv}: \"The United States and Uzbekistan are close to finalizing plans for a $6 million cleanup of a former Soviet bioweapons facility. The effort is aimed at preventing terrorists from harvesting live anthrax spores from a secret dumping ground. For nearly 60 years starting in the 1930s, the Soviets released anthrax, plague, and other weaponized pathogens on Vozrozhdeniye (Resurrection) Island in the Middle of the Aral Sea. In 1988, at th e end of the Cold War, weaponeers buried tons of a particularly potent strain of powdered anthrax at the site, mixing the bacteria with bleach in steel drums to kill it. But several years ago testers found that some of the anthrax is still alive, and water diversions from the shrinking Aral Sea have since opened a land bridge to the once isolated island. Fearing OBLIVION 45"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"that terrorists might try to harvest ready-made bioweapons from the site, U.S. Officials agreed in October to pay fo r destroying the anthrax and a nearby testing facility.\" Actually, for quite some time, any funded terrorist organization that wished a copious supply of the finest anthrax ever made, and wished a strain already resistant to many of our treatments, could just go to Voz Island, pay the natives a little sum, and dig up the dirt in the appropriate part of the dump site, sack it up, and carry it away. Or pay the natives a bit more, and they would dig it up and sack it for the buyer. Wash out the dirt, and one would have all one wanted of the highest grade anthrax spores ever made. It's safe to assume that those terrorist organizations who wanted a copious supply of high grade anthrax already obtained it with relative ease. Bin Laden also obtained anthrax and other BW agents from other sources {lxxv}, as well as at least a few nuclear weapons. Other BW agents and nuclear materials were available on Voz Island also, in the same way. And much of that WMD procur ement will already have been covertly inserted into the U.S. E.g., where do our agencies think that the extraordinarily high grade anthrax mailed in some letters after 9/11 could have come from? Most probably, it came right from Voz Island. The mailing of high grade anthrax in letters sent to a few important U.S. targets after 9/11 was not an attack at all, nor was it so intended. The mailings were undoubtedly a small test attack to ascertain the amount of disruption and economic damage that could in theory be obtained by mass mailings simultaneously, through the mail in many locations, to thousands of targets. The results obtained by these little sample mailing tests showed that mass mailings of anthrax powder, in letters sent to selected high level targets, would create chaos, extensive delay, and substantial economic disruption. Here again one sees the coordinated planning toward our economic disruption, damage, and collapse. A Simple but Lethal Strategic Strike with Horrific Casualties As is known, anthrax is highly lethal when ingested or breathed into the lungs. So a simple spray attack on a large metropolitan area, by a small 2-seat Cessna aircraft with two men aboard — one flying and one spraying out the side — could account for from one to three million casualties {lxxvi}, almost all of whom will die. Quoting Betz {lxxvii,}: \"A 1993 study by the Office of Technology Assessment concluded that a single airplane delivering 100 kilograms of anthrax spores — a dormant phase of a bacillus that multiplies rapidly in the body, producing toxins and rapid hemorrhaging — by aerosol on a clear, calm night over the Washington, D.C., area could kill between one million and three million people, 300 times as many fatalities as if the plane had delivered sarin gas in amounts ten times larger.\" OBLIVION 46"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Needless to say, the emergency treatme nt capabilities of the entire struck area would be completely overwhelmed. In such a case, triage becomes the official policy. Unless the treatment were starte d immediately for a civilian who inhaled the anthrax, it would be largely ineffe ctive anyway. Once the symptoms appear, conventional treatment is largely hopeless. Triage is the classification (medical screening and sorting) of patients to determine the need and priority for treatment and transportation {lxxviii}. Triage generally separates patients into four cat egories, according to the priority for treatment that will be followed: High Priority (Red): Pati ents who need immediate treatment and immediate transport in order to survive. (But refer also to category 4 below). Those who need immediate treatment but cannot be expected to survive even if treated go into category 4 (Black), not Red. Intermediate Priority (Yellow): Patients who will most likely survive but require treatment. Low Priority (Green): Patients who requi re little or no treatment or whose treatment and transportation can be delayed. Lowest Priority (Black): Patients who ca nnot be expected to survive even with treatment, those who cannot be expected to survive in a mass casualty situation, and those whose vital signs are absent. In a mass casualty situation with very scarce supplies and nowhere near sufficient mass treatment capabilities, triage becomes necessary and officially applies. That means casualties classified in the Black (lowest priority) category — such as patients already showing the anthrax symp toms, and therefore almost certain to die with or without treatment — will just be set aside, made as comfortable as possible, and allowed to die. There is very little to be gained by treating them with conventional treatment. Even if given every treatment available, almost a l l of the patients in this category would die anyway. With triage sorting, the very scarce and precious antibiotics and treatments will be reserved for those who have a better chance of surviving if treated. This is one of the harsh decisions, of the type formerly reserved for military forces in the field under desperate circumstances, which will have to be made for our civilian populace and wounded as well. The True Cause of Gulf War Disease By use of scalar interferometry (as is possessed by the Yakuza) or quantum potential weapons (which the Yakuza does not have, but the KGB/FSB does), in advance of the attack it is possible to trick the immune system of each person in the targeted populace ar ea so that it erroneously \"det ects\" invasion by, say, two dozen different pathogens at once. This is done by simply placing the EM \"shadow disease engines\" or \"shadow precursor engines\" (in the virtual level just OBLIVION 47"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"beneath quantum level) for those specific pathogenic conditions in weak EM radiation or in quantum potentials focused into t h e bodies in the area targeted. The immune system reacts to what it detects, not necessarily to what is actually occurring. Given this deliberate stimulation and the resulting alarming false detection, the deceive d immune system desperately sp reads its finite assets across those \"detected\" two dozen invading \"shadow\" pathogens. And it does detect the interaction of faint precursor engine s for the specific two dozen diseases, deliberately radiated into the body and thus interacting with charges in its cellular mass. Such a \"spread\" immune system is then just about totally vulnerable to any real attack by any normal opportunistic real pathogen in the area — either natural or terrorist-induced — because the immune system cannot marshal any additional resources. In a bizarre way, this is a new form of asymmetric biological warfare, designed to pre-disa ble the immune systems of the targeted populace, dramatically increasing the effe ctiveness of the real BW pathogen being introduced (by anyone, including other terrorists). In the absence of deliberate BW pathoge n attack, the result of spreading the immune systems in a targeted area is an extraordinarily heightened vulnerability of the radiated populace to ordinary opportunistic infectious pathogens in the populace's environment, to which the humans in that populace are then physically exposed. There are always such opportunistic pathogens in one's environment, but usually the immune system can handle most of them with a shrug. But the deceived living body with a spread immune system will be quickly and easily attacked by multiple environmental pathogens, unable to effectively resist, and without the organism's usual immune system's protective resistance {lxxix}. That living body with its spread immune system will shortly develop a whole \"cocktail\" mix of opportunistic diseases. If the immune spreading intensity is lowered a bit, then only a percentage of the persons with the effect will develop the \"cocktail mix of diseases\" syndrome. If the immune spreadin g is lowered even further, then only those persons already having additional \"immune system lowering\" will be affected. This \"spreading of the immune system\" is what was deliberately done to generate the \"Gulf War Disease\" in some of our soldiers in the first Gulf War. The immune systems of our soldiers in certain areas — already weakened a bit by multiple vaccinations — were spread by hostile forces , as a test to see if our scientists and analysts recognized what was being done. The immune spreading signals were deliberately lowered to the point that none of the French troops — who had refused to take the mix of vaccinations we administered our own forces, and which do reduce the ability of the immune system for some weeks — developed the \"cocktail mix\" diseases and syndrome, while some of the U.S., Canadian, and British forces who did have lowered i mmune systems as a result of their vaccinations did develop the \"cocktail mix of diseases\" called the Gulf War OBLIVION 48"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Syndrome. The natives in the area had not had their immune systems lowered by vaccinations, and so no change occured in that populace. Our scientists did not understand it at all. They did not understand it then, they do not understand it to this day, and they will not understand it tomorrow unless forcibly ordered to meticulously consid er and experimentally investigate what happens when immune systems are indeed spread in the fashion being advanced, and when specific tailoring to select th e targeted populace subset is also used. Combining immune system pre-spreading with subsequent real BW attack will increase the yield of the attack itself by a fa ctor of at least three. At the same time, other opportunistic infections will also interact very strongly, with lit tle resistance, so that a \"cocktail\" mix of diseases will ravage the population whose immune systems have been spread. We point out but do not further discuss the dramatic effect on those treated Triage casualties, if those casualties have pre-spr ead immune systems. The effectiveness of the treatment will be severely lowered, so that a much greater percentage of those treated will also die. Our scientists still have not comprehended the higher group symmetry electromagnetic mechanisms by which health and disease changes in personnel in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow were induced during several decades of microwave radiation by the Soviet Union. They do not intend to further try to understand it, and they have simply buried it. It does not matter that three U.S. Ambassadors eventually died as a result, or that hundreds of persons were made sick or developed real diseases. Also, our scientists do not know how to properly investigate and explain the directly related Kaznacheyev experiments {lxxx}, nor do they intend to. As a consequence, they have already guaranteed that BW attack on the U.S. populace under the conditions stated above will be spectacularly successful, while U.S. treatment of th e mass casualties will spectacularly fail. This appalling situation further buttresses our previous comment that, not only will our scientific community fiddle while Rome prepares to burn, but it is also assuring that it burns completely. Terrorism by Electromagnetic Biological Warfare Not comprehending \"immune system spreading\" or how it is induced, our medical scientists certainly have no knowledge of the electromagnetic use of specific precursor engines for a specific disease — such as anthrax — to directly induce the disease in targeted b odies in an entire great ar ea. Instead of the passive measure of immune system spreading, the same EM weapons can directly transport and induce the precursor engines for developing the anthrax conditions in the bodies in a large targeted populace — such as the greater Washington D.C. metropolitan area, which was the area considered in the referenced Government study involving a spray anthrax attack {lxxvi}. OBLIVION 49"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"For example, the exact structural patte rn of the necessary disease induction engines for anthrax can be directly \"reco rded\" from the EM emissions of sickened human cells or humans with anthrax. Such ordinary EM carrier emissions do contain those specific anthrax EM disease engines as infolded Whittaker patterns {xxi, xxii} — particularly in the infrared and ultraviolet spectrum, and particularly when both spectral ranges are considered simultaneously (i.e., when a full harmonic interval of radiation is considered, and especially when that harmonic brackets the visible spectrum and the targeted organism is in the dark to remove possible interference from the intervening visible light spectrum). Our scientific leaders have little or no understanding of the Kaznacheyev experiments, and most of them simply are not interested in understanding them, since it would require thinking in terms of a higher group symmetry electrodynamics, not the common old seriously flawed el ectrical engineering. Hence they do not even conceive of the result of electromagnetically enhancing a strike by a BW agent such as anthrax, or of electromagnetic biological warfare, where the disease itself is induced in th e body by the exact disease engine that pathogens carry, but mostly without the in tervening physical carrier. This \"direct induction of the specific disease condi tion\" via tailored induction of the appropriate specific EM disease engines in the bodies of the ta rgeted populace, is another gargantuan force amplifier that can be either used alone or in conjunction with the previous force amplifier of spread immune systems. The U.S. has no defense against it, nor do our medical science leaders and establishments intend to develop such defenses. Terms such as \"immune system spreading,\" \"precursor engineering,\" \"precursor disease engine,\" and \"electromagnetic biological warfare\" are not even in their lexicon. As a force amplifier, the combination of the two force amplifiers — immune system spreading and EM BW induction of a single disease simultaneously — can increase the overall casualties from an anthrax attack by from 5 to 10 times what would be obtained by the basic anthrax spray attack of physical anthrax spores alone. An influenza epidemic, e.g., can be made horrific beyond all present expectations, as can a smallpox outbreak, etc. Further, the present physics of the va cuum already prescribes the basis for precursor engines and their use, including their use in induction or augmentation of disease, or in elimination of disease. Quoting Aitchison {lxxxi} \"Vacuum polarization, in general, alters the effective force law. Forces, in quantum field theory, are understood as being due to the exchange of virtual quanta... In the case of QCD and QFD,... a crucial new feature is that the force- field quanta themselves carry the 'charge' of the force-field, i.e. it is as if the photon of electromagnetism carried electromagnetic charge.\" Notice, however, that even Aitchison failed to recognize there were no force fields in space, but only the precursors, and that precursor engineering is involved. Every chemical and biochemical reaction emits characteristic EM radiation — based on the making and breaking of electron bonds etc. as modeled by ordinary OBLIVION 50"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"chemistry. Even these radiations could be recorded and played buck, inducing disease, without even going into the more complicated explanation oi precursor states and virtual disease engines. The upper limit of the force amplification (more simply, the gain) achievable by precursor attack combinations is of course the limit entailed by the size of the targeted population. Medical and emer gency personnel in biohazard protection suits and \"deeply protected facilities\" are just as vulnerable to this mode of attack as the unprotected populace. So devastatio n of the treatment teams and facilities also results. Further, even decontamination spraying to kill the anthrax spores would not mitigate the damage already done by EM BW. The combination of force amplifiers, coupled with an anthrax spray attack even much weaker than that in the Congressional study, can effectively infect and sicken almost the entire population, with nearly everyone becoming casualties and dying. EM BW thus becomes a strategic force amplifier of strategic \"total knock- out \" strike implications. In a mass casualty situation, the presence of these force amplifiers will also move the vast percentage of the stricken casu alties to triage category Four (Black). Casualties in the Black category will receive no treatment, but will just be allowed to die — even if some vestiges of the treatment teams and facilities survive. The use of the force amplifiers means that a mu ch greater percentage will be classified Black and be allowed to die without treatment under normal triage rules. But our own National Institutes of Health (NIH) and medical science community — and our own intelligence community in that area — are simply not interested in such bioenergetics weapons already developed and tested. Nor have they apparently done even elementary homework in the area of higher group symmetry electrodynamics. Most do not even recognize the term! Nor have they funded any specific higher group symmetry electrodynami cs research in th e area, outside the terribly crippled U(1) electromagnetics and electrical engineering, even though the disease force amplifier capabilities of higher group symmetry electrodynamics have already been repeatedly demonstrat ed, first by the KGB against the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in the former Soviet Union and then by the KGB/FSB in Russia against our troops in the first Gulf War. The FSB/KGB already knows and plans such force amplifying measures, which will likely be unleashed upon us to dramatically augment any milder conventional BW attacks. The nature and magnitude of the asymmetric war to be unleashed against us is dramatically different from what our society knows, expects, and plans for. Sadly, most of our present scientific medical research is a vast wasteland as far as any study of (1) scalar interferometry use in disease induction or force amplification, (2) the mechanism used in the decades long EM induction of health changes and diseases by the long so-called \"microwave radiation\" of the former U.S. Embassy in Moscow, (3) the spread ing of immune systems of a targeted OBLIVION 51"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"population, and (4) electromagnetic induction of specific disease in a targeted populace via the induction of the specific precursor engine for that specific disease. Further, our medical scientists' knowledge of higher group symmetry electrodynamics appears to be nil. Worse, the organized medical science community appears to have no concern at all over its own total lack of knowledge in such higher forms of electrodynamics. Possibly, a part of this nonchalance may be due to — or influenced by — the important financial exchanges that have long occurred in the past between some NIH scientists and outside industrial cartels intent on keeping medical science within the bounds presently imposed. But as a step in the right direction, NIH has imposed stricter rules on its scientists with respect to their consulting to, or employment by, outside drug companies which in turn are receiving payments from NIH funding {lxxxii}. The agency has even proposed banning all its scientists from doing any consulting work with drug companies for a year {lxxxiii}, while the agency's investigations continue. Recently a real clampdown has been ordere d, effectively closing this questionable avenue. Let us fervently hope that this cleanup continues, so that NIH really does again function as an independent government agency dedicated to the benefit of the American public, not just for the benef it of the big drug companies. At this point, every little bit helps! Unethical Release of U.S-Made BW Mycoplasma Sometimes, there also appears to have been collusion between the NIH and rather illegal (and unethical) testing on human citizens without their consent. As an example, our NIH leaders are still doing absolutely nothing at all about the modified mycoplasma BW agent {lxxxiv} that our own BW researchers developed in the 1950s to burrow inside red cells, feed off their hemoglobin shells, and dramatically decrease the oxygen transport capability of the red cells in the blood. This modified BW mycoplasma agent was developed, and then it was thinned by about 2,000 times and sprayed into the populace and into the environment by combined U.S./Canadian teams in the 1950s in Canada. It was also sprayed by U.S. agencies in Florida. These sprayings caused the deliberately-manufactured BW agent to enter the mosquito population and thence into the human population of North America. Indeed, in the cooperative joint U.S./Can ada program, the modified mycoplasma agent was deliberately implanted in mosquitoes by the government researchers, and those mosquitoes were then released, to ascertain the \"spread effectiveness\" of the mosquitoes as disease vectors. That's rather like firing some machinegun bursts at random into a very large crowd, to determine the average pattern of \"hits\" and \"kills\". The author personally contracted that specific biological warfare disease — courtesy of our own BW scientists and the inane officials directing the tests, who carelessly assumed that dilution rendered the mess safe — while in the U.S. Army, residing in Quebec, with duty station at the Canadian Armament Research OBLIVION 52"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"& Development Establishment (CARDE) at Valcartier, Canada in 1966-68. I survived three serious hospitalizations in Canada only by the final Herculean efforts of the French doctor s in Quebec, who opened both the chest cavity and the abdominal cavity and moved the internal organs around for about 3 hours, aerating the tissues thoroughly and un knowingly killing th e exposed surface mycoplasma. After that oxygenation of the tissues, the mycoplasma already burrowed inside the red blood cells survived and then went dormant, slowly increasing over the next three decades. I survived, but with a time bomb ticking away inside my body. Left with slowly increasing chronic fatigue syndrome over the next 33-year period, I even managed to serve a tour in Vietnam and still no one knew what was wrong. No medical tests or examinations showed what it was. I retired from active military service at the end of 1975, and wa s employed in the aerospace industry in Huntsville, Alabama. Then in spring 2001, resurgence of the mycoplasma generated runaway heart fibrillation and a heart attack. When the te rrorist attack of 9/ 11 struck a stunned America later that year, I was still struggling to stay alive from the heart attack, with runaway heart fibrillation, and significant hypoxia from my own prior encounter with a \"terrorist BW attack\", where the terrorists were our own fellows! As fate would have it, a colleague with the equivalent of a Ph.D. in biochemistry who checks on me about once a year then called; he has been in many \"deep black\" programs, most of which do not officially exist. He knew of the mycoplasma BW agent development program and the mycoplasma spraying in Florida and Canada. He immediately re cognized that the strange malady contracted in Canada in 1968 wa s actually that BW mycoplasma. He also told me where to get definitive information on the web and from Senate hearings, and voila! The puzzle was solved. Finally in Dec. 2001 a Specific lab test was obtained and the chronic BW mycoplasma infection confirmed - after 33 years of puzzlement, doubt, and slowly increasing physical debilitation. The resulting treatment was a year (2002) on antibiotics, which did annihilate the mycoplasma that were hiding in the red blood cells. But it did not and cannot undo the damage already done throughout my body during those 33 years. As my doctor stated, \"You name it, it's damaged. \" After such a long-term case, one has permanent chronic fatigue, cannot walk very far or stand very long at all, and one takes blood thinner for the rest of one's life to try to prevent strokes and blood clots. One also takes medication to try to control the heart fibrillation and stay alive. Th e eventual expectation is to go on a pacemaker, then eventually have anot her unexpected heart attack or stroke, finishing the process. I've also now developed pulmonary fibrosis. The problem is that, if one takes all the medication necessary to control the heart fibrillation, it also reduces the volume of blood pumping, which places one back in hypoxia, leading to strokes and/or heart attacks. If one does not take the OBLIVION 53"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"fibrillation control medication, one reverts back into hypoxia from the fibrillation, which leads to strokes and/or heart attacks. With the usual treatment by well- meaning heart doctors, one is damned if one does and damned if one doesn 't. They do not and will not prescribe remedial oxygen, since they do not consider any possible involvement of mycoplasma in heart problems and attacks. Attempts to get the NIH to notify the heart clinics and doctors of this terrible problem have fallen on deaf ears — probably because of the NIH's original involvement in producing the modified mycoplasma and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting and trusting North American populace. Hence the NIH does not wish to admit that such programs ever even took place with its participation. The only way out of the dilemma is to take the medicine to defeat the fibrillation, and also take extra oxygen to prevent the resulting hypoxia. So I take remedial oxygen and pay for it on my own volition, since the heart doctors know nothing of the modified BW mycoplasma and they do not wish to hear of it. Nor does one's insurance company, Medicare, the Vetera n's Administration, etc. Nor does the NIH. All those fine agencies simply wish that the disabled veteran with such BW- modified mycoplasma would just die and get out of the way. By taking one's own remedial oxygen, one remains just barely above the hypoxia zone, at least until something else unexpected occurs to make things worse. That way, one remains alive a while longer, perh aps even for a few years. Even so, one has acquired a delayed death sentence just waiting to happen at any moment. And one remains with severe chronic fatigue, weakness, etc. Perhaps then it is understandable that the present author has a very personal interest in that particular B W mycoplasma disease and that set of incidents, and in the continuing gross failure of the NIH to acquaint heart doctors in the U.S. of that nefarious program and what happened. Today there is a direct involvement of this BW-modified mycoplasma in a significant fraction of patents with heart disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, etc. Many of the citizens of the U.S. and Canada already have that BW organism infecting their bodies, like a ticking time bomb waiting to erupt perhaps many years later. To this day, very few hospitals and medical clinics are capable of doing the test that can detect the very specific type of BW-modified mycoplasma. Apparently the NIH considers any contact on this problem — or a similar BW problem — a hot potato to be handled by its \"policy\" section (i.e., \"spin control\" section). Bluntly, the attitude seems more concerned with political control than with saving the lives of countless Ameri can citizens who unknowingly continue to be afflicted with that BW-modified mycoplasma, continue to die of its complications, or are disabled and their lives shortened because of it. NIH political orientation seems to be one of th e major shortcomings of the U.S. in its required defenses against the biological warfare aspects of the \"new \" asymmetric war. It also appears that the NIH direc tly participated and cooperated with the U.S. BW organizations that developed and unleashed the BW mycoplasma in the first place. If so, the misdirected attention of the NIH to cover up will probably OBLIVION 54"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"continue, and that will help guarantee mu ch of the success and increased mass casualties resulting from professional te rrorist BW strikes against the U.S. populace in the near future Ironically, that nefarious modified mycoplasma is a strange kind of BW \"force amplifier\" that the Soviet BW weapons la bs initially developed to \"soften us up\". Eerily, they themselves did not have to introduce it into the North American populace. Instead, we ourselves developed it and — in what has to he one of the most stupid and asinine BW actions of all time — we deliberately unleashed it into our own environment and against ou r own North American populace In comic relief, one is tempted to remark that \"With friends like that, who the hell needs enemies!\" No Effective Treatment for Mass Casualties Sadly, in this present asymmetric warfare problem, we are forced to conclude that the N1H and the Centers for Disease Contro l will not do the research necessary to develop adequate response therapies and means for quick, effective treatment of mass BW warfare casualties. Seemingly they continue to prefer Category 4 triage — just letting most of the patients die — to developing unorthodox but real mass treatment capabilities. None of the associat ed agencies appears likely to develop anything innovative in this area, and particularly not a portable higher group symmetry electromagnetic treatment unit {lxx xv} that could effectively treat those millions of Category 4 Triage casualties that will result and die in our cities in the near future. As we mentioned, there is a precursor EM engine for every disease and every debilitated condition of the living body. That means there is also a precursor EM anti-engine that can be formed, amplified, and introduced into the diseased patient — and that will very quickly reverse the disease condition in situ and cure the disease. Because the anti-engine is electromagnetic and can therefore be amplified, the treatment period can be reduced to circa five minutes of nun- ionizing radiation by the amplified specific disease anti-engines. In s u ch treatment, the body's own potentials and fields thus have the anti-engines kindled inside them, and after the treatment is removed, the body's own \"activated\" fields and potentials — at every level — now continue diminishing and destroying the disease engine, and reversing the patient's condition back to normal. Further, anti-engine patterns for a variety of expected and known BW agents can be developed and incorporated into such treatment machines, and the machine can then just be \"switched\" to the appropriate anti-engine-generating radiation spectrum required to treat the patient's BW condition (destroy the patient's specific disease anti-engine and reverse the patient's condition back to normal). The radiations from the machine are after all precursor radiations, whether or not the scientists using the machines know it. As a further example of U.S. medical orientation, in 1998 the author, with a colleague, tried very hard to persuade the NIH, DoD, USAF, and other federal OBLIVION 55"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"agencies to develop a portable unit for such EM mass casually treatment in a crash U.S. government program, to save millions of l i v e s in the coming asymmetric warfare debacle {lxxxvi}. The EM mechanism proposed would have generated an amplified anti-engine for a specific BW-induced disease. \"Pumping\" the diseased body with opposing longitudinal EM waves will form amplified anti-engines to a specific disease engine in the stricken body. By then radiating the body with the amplified anti-engine, or simply pumping the body to produce the amplified anti- engine, it overrides the actual disease engine, eroding away the disease engine and the disease along with it, and reversing the physical condition back to normal. Or, in biological terms, this is the secret of dedifferentiation of a diseased or disordered cell or cellular body back to norm al cells and normal health. It is quick, it was thoroughly proven in France in the 1960s and 1970s, it was evidenced in Becker's work, and it was documented in the hard French medical science literature. Once developed, this would be a mass casualty treatment therapy far superior to anything presently existing, which could save millions of lives in the debacle now roaring down upon us. The NIH, DoD, USAF, CDC, and other fe deral agencies had not the slightest notion of what we were talking about, and we never got out of the \"policy\" section at NIH, even with the a ssistance of Congressman Bud Cramer. Not a single scientist in any of those government agencies cared a whit, or even called to discuss the proposal and its novel physical mechanism. Apparently none checked the hard scientific references we cited from the French medical science literature where the basic mechanism had been proven. None of those agencies had the foggiest notion that the decades-long microwave radiation of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow already demonstrated the use of higher group symmetry electrodynamic \"disease e ngine\" signals to directly generate health changes and diseases at will. They had no concept of the use of appropriate amplified \"anti-signals\" and \"disease anti -engines\" to reverse and cure illnesses, or that an extended EM can be developed to either induce or cure specific diseases to order as one desires. They certainly do not comprehend the higher group symmetry operation of the human cellular regenerative system — which is responsible for the body's healing — and have not gone much further than Becker's brilliant seminal studies of that system {lxxxvii}. Unfortunately, Becker's work was limited by his use of U(1) electrodynamics. Otherwise, Becker would have had the \"anti-engine\" EM healing process then and there. Even so, he almost deciphered the control operation of the cellular regenerative system {lxxxviii}. His EM healing method for otherwise intractable bone fractures survived and is still utilized in some hospitals from time to time {lxxxix}. It is simple to understand: an electrostatic scalar potential (common voltage) decomposes into a set of bidirectional EM longitudinal precursor bidirectional wave pairs — in other words, a perfect set of \"pump waves\" for creating specific amplif ied anti-engines for the specific disease or disorder. So Becker's silly little DC voltage across a horrible bone fracture actually contained and initiated a most important and specific mechanism for OBLIVION 56"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"producing specific anti-engines and specific dedifferentiation of the diseased cells back to earlier normal condition. In show what simple potential (voltage) across an otherwise intractable fracture can do, using its component longitudinal EM pump waves, Becker showed that it dramatically affects many of the red cells that arrive in the fracture area, reconverting those affected red cells to a suitable \"precursor\" cell (more primitive, earlier cell). The \"pumped\" red cell shucks its hemoglobin and grows a nucleus - this is dedifferentiation, and it is generated by the appositive longitudinal Whittaker precursor wave sets — that constitute the voltage — acting as \"pump waves\" in the nonlinear optical sense. The pumped bone fracture s i t e has thus become a pumped phase conjugate mirror site, with the input or \"signal wave\" being the specific physical disorder's \"e ngine\" already in the stricken body. The amplified phase conjugate output is the am plified specific \"anti-engine\" for that specific disease or disorder condition. In accord with nonlinear optical pumping theory, the energy of the pumping waves then establishes an amplified \"phase conjugate replica\" signal set. This amplified signal (anti-engine) will then quickly reverse the entire physical red blood cell back along its past travel through time in its past short life (red cells only live about three months). Hence the red cell dedifferentiates back to an earlier stage. The \"delta\" condition in the fracture site involves bone cells. So the red cell is redifferentiated by the pumping to move forward to the type of cell that makes cartilage. Then it further redifferenti ates yet again to the type of cell that makes bone, and that cellular material is deposited in the fracture site, healing it. In simple language, that is precisely how Becker's bone-healing EM treatment works. The process and its proven experime ntal success already demonstrates the beginning of the required capability to tr eat and reverse dise ases and physical injury conditions by a peculiar variation of nonlinear optical pumping, using the \"disease or disorder engine\" as the input signal, producing an amplified \"anti- engine\". This anti-engine forcibly interacts upon any and all aspects of the cells and the physical body to reverse the situation and restore the body to health. But the NIH was not interested, even though the elements of this process had a l s o been resoundingly proven by the Priore group in France, in rigorous work funded by the French government. Eventually the NIH just shipped the entire package over to the DoD (to whom we had already sent the package anyway) because the package mentioned the Gulf War Syndrome and \"that was the purview of the DoD\". In short, the NIH wasn't interested in what Gulf War Syndrome really was, or in curing it either. So unless it involves drugs or some form of ionizing radiation treatment or some such, our own NIH was not and is not interested in a proven, demonstrated cure for cancer and other dread diseases, accomplished in France in the 1960s and early 70s, with astounding experimental results of thousands of lab animal experiments already rigorously reported in the French medical science literature but resoundingly suppressed today.

The entire U.S. medical science community is still using an archaic seriously flawed classical electromagnetics of the ma terial luminiferous ether, rather than the more modern higher group symmetry electromagnetics of mass-free spacetime. Consequently it is far more concerned with the immune system's responses which \"physically kill the bad gu ys\", or harsh drugs which \"chemically kill the bad guys\", rather than the cellular control system responses which actually accomplish all healing within the body after the \"bad guys\" are already dead. The immune system and the drugs do not actually \"heal\" anything — not even the immune system \"s own damaged cells. The fundamental orientation of American medicine is on physically attacking and killing the pathogens which transport the disease engines, rather than on augmenting and amplifying how the damaged body then regenerates its own cells and reverses its own disease engine via use of higher group symmetry electrodynamics. This strongly prejudices and canalizes our medical science development. It also makes us extraordinarily vulnerable — helpless is the proper word — to the coming mass casualty attacks in our cities and population centers. But to uphold the status quo, our medical scientists seem quite willing to accept that, for really substantial WMD attacks, triage Black will apply on a massive scale. So they will just let most of the casualties die without any treatment at all. The predetermination to lose all those American lives has already been made, and it seems that nothing will change it. Indeed, the entire U.S. electrical engineering community itself does not realize that it doesn't even know or apply what electrodynamics in mass-free space is.. In the face of such appalling scientific ignor ance for more than a century, it is little wonder that our nation is so terribly behind in understanding what can be done — and is being done — by the terrorists using the primary (precursor) electrodynamics in free space, before its interaction with matter.

Our national agencies adamantly are not going to develop the proven Priore-type EM treatment or really get to the bottom of Becker's anomalous EM bone fracture healing, because such would not be common old electrical engineering. It would also greatly disturb the pharmaceutical cartels, which have bought American medical science by financing research, medical scholarships, medical university expenses, etc. and by providing \"consulting fees\" etc. to a variety of scientists in the system. Even though most of those cartel companies are benign or even intentionally beneficial, any threat to their dominant positions evokes a sharp response from their evil 1% entourages.

We are going to unnecessarily lose millions of American lives, with most casualties receiving no treatment at all. Those future wounded Americans would not have to die if such EM c o u ntermeasures were intensely developed in portable treatment machines and massively deployed {xc}. We are describing a vast force amplifier that could be developed for the defending nation that has been targeted and very seriously struck. Our own government and scientific community adamantly will not permit i t s study or development, and will simply \"fight to the death of every one of us\" to preclude such a desperately needed therapeutic method and capability, 9 despite rigorous scientific proof by the Priore group in the 1960s and early 1970s {xci}, as aforesaid. Impact of Immune System Spreading Weapons such as scalar interferometers in the hands of the Yakuza have given the terrorists a terrible force amplifier of WMD bioweapons that parallels the destruction capabilities of all a modern state's ICBMs, strategic bombers, nuclear subs, aircraft carriers, etc. All without a single ICBM, strategic bomber, nuclear sub, or aircraft carrier. So for the strategic asymmetric war threat, now one considers — say — three large U.S. city areas hit just about simultaneously by effective anthrax spray attacks, and augmented by EM BW means. One immediately sees the grim picture very probably in store for us. To be conservative, we assume 1 million casualties in each city as the \"baseline\" achieved by the spray attack pathogen itself. Thus a total of 3 million casualties are obtained in the three strikes, with no other augmentation. However, if immune syst em spreading were also incorporated simultaneously, the casualties in each city will reach, say, 3 million, almost a l l of whom will die. That is a total of 9 million American casualties in the three cities — and almost all of those wounded will perish. 9 The leopard has not changed its spots. See Betsy McKay, \"CDC Aims to Create Experimental Pandemic Bird-Flu Virus,\" Wall Street Journal. Wed. Mar. 28, 2005, p. Bl, B2. Incredibly, CDC as part of the NIH is sti ll engaging in the deliberate production of potentially highly contagious pathogens, capable of causing rampaging pandemics if unleashed or accidentally escaping. All sorts of \"reasons\" are advanced. A little analysis from the viewpoint of precisely what FSB/KGB bioenergetics can do in such situations would be enlightening — but then neit her CDC nor NIH knows anything about bioenergetics, even after four decades of its testing against us to see if we recognize it.

If, in addition to the immune system spreading, some supporting scalar interferometers are also inducing the same anthrax disease pattern via EM BW, that's now perhaps 5 million casualties in each city area, for a total of 15 million American casualties, almost all of whom will die. If the intensity of the scalar interferometry disease indu ction is further increased, that's perhaps 18 million or so total American casualties in those three city areas — almost all of whom will die. Here one directly sees the transition from the kind of estimates our own analysts usually make for BW agent attacks, to estimates that show the more maximum risk of massive strategic destruction and even strategic knockout of the U.S. by the same \"front line terrorist troops\", due to the advent of the supporting scalar interferometers, immune spreading, and EM BW. All that would be caused overtly by 6 men, three light 2-place Cessna-type aircraft, 3 little agricultural sprayers wh ich can be purchased at any Home Depot or similar store, and 300 kilograms of anthrax spores from Voz Island — and, in the 9, 15, and 18 million casualty cases — a little force amplification support from three or more scalar interferometers. But that's not the end of it. In addition, the contamination of those large built-up population areas will require the ruthless spraying of decontamination agents, killing many thousands more of our own populace. The effectiveness of the decontamination sprays would also be seriously hampered if the scalar interferometers continue their EM BW anthrax induction. None of these kinds of \"force amplifier\" effects are presently known or taken into account by our analysts and our intelligence ag encies. They are designing and planning for the type of warfare they themselves know and expect. They are not designing and planning for the type of warfare that is coming down upon us. The most urgent \"action fact\" that should be concentrated upon by our medical science agencies is that most of those casualties are going to wind up as triage Black category 4 patients. Most are not even going to be treated, and so almost all of them will die. The jobs of the leaders of our national health research agencies should be made directly dependent upon them rapidly examining and finding new and revolutionary treatment capabilities that will negate the present \"triage 4\" massive catastrophe.

There is simply nothing else out there that w i l l produce such a dramatic savings of human lives, and probably the survival of our nation itself. Impact of Smallpox Release It is almost inevitable that the terrorists also obtained smallpox BW agents — to could anyone who wanted it, had guts and had money. Reliable information already confirms that the terrorists obtai ned many BW agents, including smallpox by going into the BW labs in former Soviet republics, and buying it. Or one got it from North Korea. Or one just hired very desperate Russian smallpox BW scientists who urgently needed to support their families. Or one got some of it from Voz Island. The collapsing Soviet state was unable to pay salaries to scie ntists, generals or soldiers for protracted periods. In desperation to get money to survive, those individuals were forced into extreme meas ures. Anything there that one wished to buy could be bought, including even a nuclear submarine — see Lunev's book for an incident {ix} where a Russian nuc lear submarine was actually purchased. Among other things, one could obtain smallpox agent and the services of Soviet BW smallpox specialists themselves. And of course it included nuclear weapons. Once smallpox is unleashed in any major city on the planet, it will eventually kill almost one-third the present human population. Quoting Garrett {xcii}: \"If the smallpox virus were released today, the majority of the world's population would be defenseless, and given the virus' 30 percent kill rate, nearly two billion people would die.\" Note that Garrett also knew nothing about immune system spreading, or direct \"smallpox engine\" induction electromagnetically, to augment and increase t h e k i l l rate. Smallpox will almost certainly be released against the U.S. populace, probably with EM augmentation. The Yakuza and other terrorist organizations will see to it, with smallpox toxin supplies almost certainly already inserted in the U.S. and waiting, and with the scalar interferometers already waiting to i n d u c e immune system spreading and direct EM BW engine insertion in the targeted populace. As an intellectual exercise, we leave it to the reader to ponder the impact of a few limited smallpox releases in our cities combined with simultaneous wide usage of the force amplifiers (immune system spreading and EM BW smallpox induction) previously discussed, particularly in the grim absence of any effective mass casualty treatment capabilities. The impact is not pleasant. The Grim Nuclear Problem One can also see the damage that can and will be done by dirty weapons (ordinary high explosives surrounded with nuclear materials), spreading nuclear fallout in densely populated areas.. OBLIVION 61"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"But there is another, even grimmer, side of the story. When the Soviet Union collapsed economically, many nuclear weap ons were made available on the black market, and sold to the highest bidder. Some 200 or more nuclear warheads for missiles came up \"missing\" from the Ukraine alone. Quoting Communist Party leader Petro Symonenko {xciii}: \"Out of 2,400 nuclear warheads whic h were on Ukrainian territory, the withdrawal of only 2,200 warheads has been verified. The fate of the remaining 200 warheads is unknown.\" Further, in 1996 Alexander Lebed, then Boris Yeltsin's national security adviser, reported that some 100 suitcase-sized Ru ssian nuclear bombs were missing. In a donnybrook, some Russian officials denied the existence of such weapons, while others confirmed their existence. The charges and counter charges faded away, and nothing was ever resolved. Nuclear weapons do not just \"go missing\" with a shrug of one's shoulders! All those missing weapons were in fact sold on the nuclear black market. Guess who bought them, and guess where many of them have been inserted already, waiting to go, along with teams trained to detonate them on command. It is almost certain that Bin Laden and Al Qa ida succeeded in purchasing some of the stray Russian nuclear weapons. Other terr orists such as the Yakuza and the Aum Shinrikyo almost certainly purchased some of them also. Terrorist efforts to obtain further bomb grade material such as highly enriched uranium (HEU) have continued. Quoting Bunn and Wier {xciv}: \"The 41 heavily armed, suicidal terrorists who seized hundreds of hostages at a Moscow theater in 2002 reportedly considered seizing the Kurchatov Institute instead — a site with enough highly enriched uranium for dozens of nuclear weapons... Al-Qaida has been actively se eking nuclear material for a bomb and has strong connections to Chechen terrorist groups.\" Bunn and Wier {xcv} also point out that: \"More than 130 research reactors in dozens of countries still operate with HEU fuel, and many have no more security than a night watchman and a chain-link fence. Pakistan's heavily guarded nuclear stockpiles face huge threats, from both insiders and outsiders, including large remnants of al-Qaida and the Taliban in the country.\" ... Comprehens ive U.S.-funded security upgrades have been completed for only 22 percent of Russia's potential nuclear bomb material; upgrades for tens of thousands of bombs' worth of material are still incomplete.\" At this moment, no one knows how many Russian nuclear weapons have gone \"missing\" and were sold on the world black market by unpaid Russian generals and soldiers desperate for money to feed their families. No one knows how many Russian nuclear weapons are still \"going missing\" and being sold on the nuclear black market. Because the terrorists wanted them and had the funds, and because the Russian generals and soldiers sold them to someone, it does not take a rocket OBLIVION 62"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"scientist to understand that the two parties almost certainly did business with one another. For more specific information, sec Williams {lxxiii, xcvi}. The Al Qaida has quietly confirmed to the Arab world that it, the Al Qaida, already has inserted seven nuclear weapons in major U.S. cities, and some of the w e apons were 200 KT. At least one U.S. author has assessed the Al Qaida as having nuclear weapons in the U.S. {xcvi}. The present author personally suspects the actual number inserted by the Al Qaida and other terrorist organization combined is about double that figure, at least. Bin Laden apparently bought some 20 suitcase nuclear weapons himself {xcv ii}, using funding obtained from the Arab world and/or drug production in Afghanistan. Recall that the KGB/FSB faction which controls the Russian superweapons — and the leasing and transfer of scalar interferometry technology to the Yakuza/Aum Shinrikyo — also controls th e previously inserted Russian nuclear weapons in American cities, as well as th e associated Spetznaz teams. During this orchestrated two year period we have now entered, somewhere in the United States at least some of those weapons are very probably going to be transferred or sold to the Yakuza/Aum Shinrikyo, and perhaps a few will go to other well- organized groups such as Al Qaida. The capability exists. It serves the purpose of the FSB/KGB in assuring the destruction of America. It will be done. As another example, the former Soviet Union also probably inserted anthrax and smallpox agents into the U.S., along with teams to unleash them on command. If so, those assets are also still here, waiting for the order to move. It seems highly probable that at least some of these BW weapons caches will also be released to the terrorist organizations such as Al Qaida, for use in the coordinated coming attacks. So in addition to the BW threat, somewhere between 14 and 40 already inserted hostile nuclear weapons probably form the \"minimum nuclear weapons pool\" available to the coordinated terrorists during this two year period. At least that would appear to be a reasonable estimate . We accent that this estimated nuclear weapons pool has — with high probability — already been inserted on s i t e in th e U.S. This is another startling capability of the present terrorists to deliver a resounding strategic nuclear knock-out blow against the United States, without ever firing a missile or launching a strategic bomber. These are examples of the true state of a ffairs concerning the \"War on Terrorism\". The great battle of that war has already slowly started, with the zeroing in of strategic Yakuza scalar interferometers on the Yellowstone supervolcano (giving them a \"single shot knockout capability against the U.S.), and with the subsequent Yakuza induction of the 9.3 seafloor earthqu ake on Dec. 26, 2004 that induced the catastrophic tsunamis in Asia.

The intent is to generate a terrib le and catastrophic economic collapse of the U.S. two years hence, and then have th e Yakuza methodically destroy our cities and every living American. Harshness of the Terrible Decontamination Problem No one has a good solution to decontaminating mass metropolitan areas that have been destroyed or heavily damaged and th at are dramatically contaminated with nuclear fallout. Neither does anyone ha ve a solution for decontaminating the distant large nuclear fallout areas surr ounding those devastated cities after the nuclear detonations. Consider the similar terrible task of decontaminating a large city (such as Washington D.C. in that government study), once the city has been sprayed en masse with anthrax by the terrorists. Yes, there are some chemical sprays that will kill the anthrax spores (else they last for a century or more, apparently). But these sprays are very hars h. To spray a civ ilian populace and area with them is to unavoidably kill a certain number of t housands of one's own sprayed civilian populace. Multiple sprayings of each cont aminated area will be necessary, in order to attain the required assurance of sufficient decontamination. So far as is known, there are no similar sprays available that can remove contaminating nuclear radiation! Now note the extreme severity of the co ming decisions necessary in asymmetric war. In war, high level military commanders have always been faced with agonizing decisions. For example, suppo se an Army commander has — say — a dozen divisions under his control. Suppose his war front is attacked by overwhelmingly superior forces, and breakthrough and destruction of his Army is imminent. The commander will have to deliberately sacrifice — say — two divisions (that's 36,000 men) by hurling them into the teeth of the attacking forces, to temporarily halt and delay the attack momentum while those two divisions fight and die. They will be ground up just like hamburger meat, but that delays the enemy onslaught for a precious short time. That desperately-bought short delay time gives the Army commander the chance to get his other 10 divisions out of there, and back to prepared defensive positions, to live to fight another day. This way, he saves the bulk of his army, by deliberately sacrificing those two divi sions. The point is, military commanders have always had to agonize and someti mes deliberately send large numbers of men under their control to their certain deaths. The soldiers sent on such missions also knew when they received their orders that they went to their certain deaths. Any fool can make a military decision when there is a \"good\" option and a \"bad\" option. But when there are only two \"bad\" options, one is forced to decide for the OBLIVION 64"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"\"least worst\" of the options — even though it entails the deliberate sacrifice of friendly lives to save otln Now the battlefield is our own cities, and the targeted force is our own civilian populace. That same type of \"least bad\" decision necessity falls now on t h e sacrifice of some thousands of our own civilians. Some commander at high level (probably the President himself) will have to assess the situation as so desperate that multiple decontamination sprayings of the anthrax-contaminated area and populace are absolutely necessary, to pr event spreading mass destruction by anthrax carried to other areas, and resulting in the deaths of many millions more. So such an order will have to be given, agonizingly, to spray multiple times (necessary to neutralize the anthrax with a good probab ility of success). Each massive spraying might kill perhaps an additional 5,000 or even 10,000 U.S. civilians. Heartbreakingly, these will be the most defenseless and helpless of our citizens, and the ones we would strongly wi sh to defend to the death with our very lives and with every heartbeat in our breasts. The most vulnerable group will largely consist of persons with hampered breathing or vulnerable immune systems - the old, the feeble, babies, the sick, nursing home occupants, etc. It has been said that war is hell, and indeed it is. Asymmetric war resoundingly brings that hell home to our civilian populace. In the past, our troops have mostly ridden out of the protected U.S. fortress/castle to a foreign land, and fought the war \"over there\", with our civilian populace largely immune and shielded from the horro rs of such fighting, particularly when the fighting is intense. No w in addition to our involv ement in foreign places, in asymmetrical warfare the major battlegr ound is right here in our own cities, because the major target being attacked by the hostile forces is our civilian populace — including our aged, the infirm , women and children, babies, etc. These devils who are our foes believe that, if they can kill lots of American civilians, babies, etc., they personally acquire a very high religions status from God Almighty. In short, we are up against a fanatical, irrational foe, one who has also unfortunately had two decades or more of almost unrestricted access into the United States, to insert the necessary WMD assets for this \"final great Jihad\" against us in our cities and homeland. This \"final great Jihad\", in the opera tions phase fought inside our cities and nation, is what is really coming upon us, together with a simila r grim dedication to our total destruction by the Yakuza. This is the coming horrible nature of the struggle. We are actually in a clash to th e death between civilizations and cultures. Quoting Seib 10 : 10 Gerald F. Seib, \"Deeper Threat is Being Missed amid Iraq Debate,\" Wall Street Journal. Wed. 8 Sep. 2004, p. A4. OBLIVION 65"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"\"The far bigger question is whether the U.

The goal is to eliminate those governments — in fact, to eliminate those nations.\" According to the present Yakuza/KGB/FSB an d international terrorist plans, their actions are expected to reduce the U.S. to lying prostrate and helpless two years from now. With a U.S. nation in utter chaos and ruin, and economically already collapsed catastrophically, a touch-up with the FSB/KGB quantum potential weapons (the most powerful weapons on ea rth, but possessed by at least five nations) would quickly dud every nuclear weapon, ICBM, nuclear bomber, nuclear power plant, nuclear submarine propulsion system, etc. on the planet {xcviii}. The dudding could be achieved in about 10 minutes, although an hour or so seems to be allotted for it. This is \"pulling the dragon's teeth and claws.\" The conventional strategic military power (IC BMs, nuclear bombs and warheads, and nuclear subs etc.) will be suddenly disabled and effectively wiped out, to exist no more. All that giant strategic apparatus will be just so much trash on the garbage dump of history. Further, the U.S. society will be enme shed in total chaos from the intensity developed in its polarizations. The society will be massively spilling its own blood, fighting in the streets, as a result of conversions of the leaders of the polarization areas. In addition, massive \"sleeper\" conversions suddenly triggered en masse throughout our government leadership, scientific leadership, police, armed forces, large technical corporations etc., will generate a society instantly gone totally berserk. We shall see police attacking cities and civilians, armed forces attacking each other and the civi lian populace, etc. The order in all organizations that is necessary for civilization to survive will suddenly have dissipated, never to return again. This is one way in which, by themselves, psychoenergetics weapons can totally destroy an entire culture or the entire Western civilization. At that point, with a U.S. in total chaos, the Yakuza gleefully pl an to participate in the methodical destruction of the United States — the terminal part of the present Operations Phase. It will be a turkey shoo t. The Yakuza will be freed to just blast away at will with their scalar interferomet ers, as they wish, to continue to the full destruction of the United States by destro ying cities, infrastructure, and the entire civilian populace.

We will see the operational unleashing of this terrible plan, already just beginning l i n i n g the two years starting at the beginning of 2005, and gradually increasing in intensity, and finishing at the end of the second year with the catastrophic economic collapse of the United States. Once the economic collapse is complete and chaos is supreme, the sudden dudding of all our nuclear weapons, power plants, and nuclear propulsion systems will be the coup de grace that leaves us a hapless target. The rest of it is the turkey shoot, to simply execute us and finish us off. In the interim, we will see damaging volcano activity increasing, and very probably we will see powerful tsunamis striking both the U.S. West Coast and East Coast. If it were to somehow become necessary , the Yakuza will also trigger the Yellowstone supervolcano into violent eruption, destroying the United States and most of North America. Summary and Conclusion In closing, we reiterate some massive st rategic capabilities alre ady registered and waiting. Toward the end of 2004, the Yakuza scalar interferometers registered (zeroed in) on the Yellowstone Caldera, th e largest supervolcano on this planet. With that \"registration\" completed, they now can initiate that supervolcano into violent eruption, whenever they wish. Again, the supervolcano's eruption will likely expel more ash, lava, debris, and rocks than the entire Grand Canyon can hold, devastating a large part of North America. The caldera is overdue for another eruption anyway, so undoubtedly t h e r e is increased geophysical stress there already. One should also check the latest findings in geology, and see what happene d to North America the last time that Yellowstone Caldera erupted violently. Th e last eruption devastated quite a portion of North America, kill ing most of the higher forms of life in a large area. Now check what happened the last time the somewhat smaller Toba supervolcano in Sumatra, Indonesia erupted violently, about 74,000 years ago. It destroyed all human life on earth, except for a few thousa nd humans in Africa {lix}. The human genetics shows this sudden \"bottleneck\" in our genetic variability that sudden occurred about 74,000 years ago {lix}. Also, this is why the present human genetics also shows that \"we all came from Africa\". And so we did; we are all descendants of that small group left al ive in Africa about 74,000 years ago. In registering on the Yellowstone caldera, the Yakuza has already achieved an additional tremendous \"knockout\" strategi c strike capability against the United States. The Yakuza can indeed wipe out much of North America in a single strike, then finishing the destruction of the Unite d States at its pleasure. There are of OBLIVION 67"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"course other volcanoes in the U.S. that can also be stimulated into eruption to add to the chaos and carnage. Several of th em are already being \"actively tickled\". Again, in 1997 U.S. Secrelary of Defe nse Cohen already confirmed the use by terrorists of electromagnetic weapons for precisely such purposes — initiating volcanoes, generating earthquakes, and controlling our weather and climate. The recent September 2004 \"shooting\" of one powerful hurricane after the other into the United States, is just one example. The economic damage done by those hurricanes Charlie, Frances, Ivan, etc. has been adequately covered on the national news, so it is already familiar to the reader. Other powerful capabilities available to the Yakuza scalar interferometers are also possible and therefore registered, such as deliberately generating tsunamis that then strike targeted coastal areas at jet liner speed {xcix}. One such \"tsunami looking for just a touch to complete its preparations to happen\" is provided by the Cumbre Vieja volcano in the Canary Islands. A large section of the volcano has already broken loose, and threatens to slid e into the sea. If so , it will generate an enormous tidal wave (tsunami) that will strike the East Coast of the United States a few hours later {lx}. For example, quoting Bill McGuire, dir ector of the Benfield Grieg Hazard Research Centre at University College in London {c}: \"A 12-mile chunk of the Cumbre Vieja volcano in the Canary Islands rattled loose during a previous eruption and is at risk of smashing into the Atlantic Ocean, triggering what could be one of the largest tidal waves in recorded history. ... It's not a matter of if, but when.\" Obviously, if this \"submarine slump-induced tsunami\" is induced sharply by Yakuza scalar interferometry, so that the slump occurs with sufficient force, then 8 to 10 hours later a great tidal wave 70 feet or more in height (conservative estimate! Some estimates run 200 feet high) could strike New York and the Eastern U.S. Coast, as well as the Caribbean, moving at some 600 miles per hour. Such a giant tsunami would penetrate inland and devastate entire coastal areas. It is an opportunity that will not have gone unnoticed by the Yakuza, and undoubtedly one or more scalar interferometers have already registered on that target. Again, we strongly stress Defense Secretary Cohen's confirmation of just such use of electromagnetic weapons by terrorists. This is one more example of what can be done by \"deliberately evoking, assisting, and directing already available giant geological forces\". So weather engineering and steering and augmenting hurricanes and other storms is just one facet of the real threat. But it is a very important part of the strategic threat, as indicated by Secret ary of Defense Cohen in 1997. Hostile Yakuza fingers are already on the tr iggers of those zeroed-in scalar EM interferometry weapons, 24/7, waiting for the order to be given to strike. If deemed necessary, this already includes the eruption of the Yellowstone OBLIVION 68"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"supervolcano and the massive tsunami hitting the Eastern U.S. seaboard from induced violent eruption of the Cumbre Vieja vulcano. These two examples are the k i n d of things that, to one extent or another, are now coming down the pike at us full-speed. We have also briefly pointed out the horrific casualties that can be obtained by very small and simple anthrax attacks, when bolstered by force amplifiers (immune system spreading and EM BW disease induction). As can be seen, once the superweapons (such as scalar interferometers) already in the hands of the asymmetric warfare terrorists (the Yakuza component) are factored into the analysis, indeed the terrorists have already achieved a strange kind of \"rolling thunder\" strategic knockout capability against the United Slates. At least publicly, this major change in the capabilities of the terrorists against the United States has not been analyzed or pursued by the conventional U.S. government agencies and their traditional support analysis agencies. Specifically, the U.S. Congress has not been adequately informed, particularly of the terrible mess that our decrepit old electrical engineer ing really is, and the consequences of not correcting it when our foes already have done so. Finally, the reader is strongly urged to review in detail the section on psychoenergetics weapons and scenarios, in the second part of this book. Massive conversions will be used against the U.S. and Western nations, and it alone can in fact wipe out Western civilization. Hundr eds of scenarios are available; several examples have been chosen and will be discussed. Massive insertions of \"sleeper\" personas in massive numbers of individuals in the targeted U.S., Israel, and Western Europe are already underway. The nonmaterial precursor robots, which were launched against us in an eerie and officially undetected giant war against us at the end of 1999 and first few days of 2000, are once again coming at us en masse. Again the reader is strongly urged to check the information on that potent threat in the second part of this book. When the strategic strikes and new kinds of force amplifiers are factored into the war with terrorism, we find that we now confront a den of raging but carefully controlled tigers, not just a den of small cats using car bombs and solitary humans with strapped on C-4 explosives. Instead, we confront a coordinated strategic threat of awesome and un precedented power and tremendous damage capability, one that already has the capability to destroy us several times over, and one that is slowly tightening the noose about our collective necks in a deliberate three year schedule ending in our total destruction and oblivion.

The time-density carried by the waves is oscillating. Quantum field theory • Four types of photons (polarizations): x, y, z, t. • Two (x, y) are transverse photons (familiar). • Third is longitudinal (z) photon; energy oscillates to and fro along line of propagation. Bunches and thins energy density of space; is dynamic oscillation of curvature of spacetime. • Thus is basis for engineerable integrated unified field theory. • Fourth is scalar (t-polarized) photon. Energy oscillates to and fro along the time axis.

Ramifications of Kaznacheyev's experimental results (2) • A heterodyne signal — at the difference frequency between an input signal and a reference signal — can be enhanced by adding noise* as is well-known. • Thus the signal of the disorder in the cellular pattern emitted from diseased cells, received by normal cells, can be amplified electronically and rather easily. * Powerline radiation (electronic smog, a form of noise) thus carries its own amplification mechanism. Eventually the amplification overcomes any squelching by sunlight, etc. * The Russians promptly (as early as the late 1950s) weaponized and tested these and similar effects. * Dykman, M.

Correction of the second law of thermodynamics (2) • Present second law is (0 < dS < ), which states that the system entropy can only stay the same or increase. • System in equilibrium is in state of maximum entropy. Thus to produce entropy, the system must first depart from equilibrium, lowering its entropy.* • This is a negative entropy operation ( < dS < 0) and it produces a \"potentiahzed\" system or \"excited\" system not in equilibrium.* • The excited or potentiahzed system can then entropically decay back to equilibrium condition, if no further excitation or potentialization (negative entropy operation) occurs to interrupt it. This is (0 < dS < ) — the present old second \"half-law\". •If the energy is furnished to the system in the same form as the system's potential energy that is changed in ma gnitude, no work is done. Th is is gauge freedom, which is inherently negentropic. If the energy is furnished in a different form, work is required in order to change the form of the input energy.

These are superweapons using a new approach for using force-free fields in space prior to their interactio n with matter to form force fields in matter. We have also called this ne w approach \"precursor engineering\", in order to tie it to conventional Western physics as an extension thereof, and hopefully to convince Western scientific leaders to correct the seriously flawed and horribly archaic old classical EM and electrical engineering models taught today in Western universities. The standard CEM/EE model is so fouled with known major errors that it has become a reflection on the lack of scient ific ethics at the highest leve ls of our scientific community, Our scientific leaders continue to advocate an d promulgate such erroneous models, and are directly contributing to the immi nent destruction of our nation and people. They continue to ignore the serious flaws of the models as poi nted out by imminent scientists such as Feynman, Wheeler, Bunge, Lindsay, Margenau and many others. This cannot be simply shrugged aside and ignored with impunity, if we wish to survive. Because of its long inaction on this problem, the U.S. scientific community is directly responsible for the presently escalating energy cr isis, and it is also pa rtially responsible for the high probability of success of the present 3-year terrorist strategic program leading to our total destruction. It is further responsible for our having no effective \"amplified EM anti-engines\" treatment for mass casualties, so that millions of stricken Americans will die who did not have to, had the scientific community changed its ostrich position with its head firmly in the sand. Any high level scientific organization or gr oup involved in electromagnetics that is not discussing and working on the source charge problem — how a charge continuously pours out observable photons in all directions, wi thout any observable energy input — is a scientific organization or group that is pa rticipating actively though unwittingly in the coming destruction of our nation and our people. By the same token, any high level intelligence agency not addressing this seemingly innocuous \"archaic CEM/EE model\" probl em will have no knowledge of the KGB energetics weapons and capabi lities. Any such intelligence group is simply failing to perform its designated scientific intelligence mission. Sadly, almost all our present high level intelligence agencies have hardly even heard of the problem; most don't even care that it exists.

No open release of this document has been made by the auth ors. The document gives the basis for actual production of a living and functioning human mind in the laboratory, the insertion of that mind in another human being, and alternation (conversion) between the two minds to shift the behavior of the individual back and forth at will. Information on that subject is in the present paper. What is demonstrated in a multiple personality case can be directly produced on the laboratory bench and in any human target anywhere on the planet. An operational fraction of the mind can be used in conversion techniques also, without total mind switching but only with switching of that fraction involving a certain area or class of behavior. Thus selected leaders in a societal polarization area, on both extreme ends, can be selectively and repeatedly \"temporarily converted\" to more extreme and dramatically different behavior and leadership, to push the polarization to greater intensity. That capability will be increasingly exercised over the next two years. The general background of the KGB development of this ability, actu al dramatic human test incidents, and the science on which it is based are given in th e present book.

Bearden, \"Precursor En gineering: Directly Altering Physical Reality,\" Explore. 13(2), 2004, p. 50-60. Briefly, there are no forces or force fields in mass-free space, but only in mass systems. For electromagnetic systems, what we call \"force\" is the ongoing interaction of the force-free EM field in space, with charged mass q. That ongoing interaction is identically force. Force is th erefore the ongoing effect of a more fundamental ongoing causative interaction of curved space with mass. The field in space is simply an energy pattern, existing as a change to the virtual particle flux of the vacuum (particle physics view) and a curvature of spacetime (general relativity view). It is also a set of Whittaker energy flows, where by \"change in energy\" we mean \"change in the VPF of the vacuum,\" and \"change in the curvature of spacetime\". Accordingly, we may formally define energy as spacetime curvature, and also as change in the VPF of the vacuum. The precursor EM field is simply the EM field as it exists in mass-free space, prior to the field's interaction with matter to form forces and a force field. The precursor EM field — even a \"static\" field — is also a set of ongoing Whittaker energy flows that continue so long as the fiel d is merely present. So unlimited energy flow itself is free for one's taking and using, from any precursor (force-free) field or potential that is established in space. A region of sp acetime curvature may be modeled as comprised of a harmonic series of bidirectional longitu dinal EM waves —real EM energy flows from OBLIVION 354"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"the source charges producing the associated EM fields and potentials (EM curvatures of spacetime). One merely has to intercept and collect the freely flowing EM energy from any static field or potential, and prevent any of the collected energy being used in one's circuit to destroy the source of potential or the source of field. This is easiest accomplished by potentializing the circuit with its charges q pinned, so dq/dt = 0. Then switch away the completely undepleted external source of potential, recomplete the circuit (as with a diode and resistor in series), unpin the electrons and allow current to flow. The new \"freely potcntialized\" circuit will then freely dissipate power in that circuit's loads and losses, until a l l the initial free potential energy is dissipated. The free energy flow phenomenon and insulting free potential energy change in the absence of current, actually is the physical mechanism that generates the gauge freedom axiom, whereby the potential — and thus the potential energy — of any EM system can be freely changed at will, and without doing work. Because precursor fields are copious free flows of energy continually extracted from the vacuum via the source charges, one can direc tly engineer very powerful changes in the energy of the causative force-free precursor fiel d, requiring that one furnish only a bit of work for the switching and structuring and controlling of the freely available energy flows comprising that change. Thus one can almost freely produce a very large precursor energy field set prior to forces and \"field work\" bei ng involved at all. By s ubsequently interacting this very large but nearly free precursor energy field set with charged mass in a physical system, extraordinarily large forces and physical effects (work) are then almost freely produced in the mass system. This strongly calls attention to the fact that there are no \"conservation of work\" laws in physics! There are only conservation of energy laws. Work is simply changing the form of energy; if the \"energy changed in form\" is received for free, then so can the resulting work be \"for free\". In the present scientific view, this is negentropic engineering — and it is perfectly permissible by the laws of nature and of physics. One must also be careful to distinguish between \"internal system work\" and external work by the system on something else (an ex ternal load). To do internal work, a single joule of EM energy can be \"used\" (converted in form) again and again, to produce multiple joules of work all internally on the system. Work rigorously is the change of form of energy. Given X joules of energy to begin with , one can get X joules of work in one change of form of the energy — and if that work was internal and none of the energy in the new form is lost from the system, one still has all the energy left within the system, just in a different form from what it was in the beginning. If the system still collects this energy in its new form and does not allow its dissipation, it can again be changed in form (e.g., back to the original form) to produce X more joules of work internally to the system. But then the energy is still present, and now in the original form again! Closed looping that \"circulation\" of changing-form-energy, while preventing any losses of the circulation flow, is a problem for the dogmatic advocate castig ating perpetual motion (which is actually Newton's first law of motion). The \"perpetual motion while doing continuous work with no additional energy input is impossible\" statem ent contains a false assumption: that each time energy changes form and thereby does work, the work is external work by the system on an external load, and the control of the energy in the new form is just \"lost\" — i.e., the energy in the new form is just dissipated on out of the system, never again to return. One does not have \"dissipation of energy\" as work unless the energy in its new form after the work is lost from the system. If it is not dissi pated out of the system, control of it by the system has not been lost. It can again be used to perform additional internal work in the OBLIVION 355"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"system, though not external work outside the system if it is to continue doing internal work. So it will do that internal system work indefinitely. Note that this form of \"perpetual motion and perpetual internal work with no a dditional energy input\" is quite compatible with the conservation of energy law, once one recognizes the difference between internal work and external work, and understands that work is rigorously the change of form of energy, nothing else. It is still quite true that , in the engineering sense where one wishes to do external work on an external load outside the system, then the dissipated energy performing work in the external load is not recovered (usually), and the usual simple thermodynamics emerges. By precursor engineering (i.e., Russian ener getics), one can pay a little bit to almost freely engineer very large energy patterns in mass-free spacetime, prior to their subsequent interactions with matter. Then by simply interacting these \"almost freely developed pure energy structures and dynamics\" with charged matter, very great work (force effects, or force engines acting in that charged matter) can be almost freely produced, including at great distances. By continuing to propagate a hoary old false EM model that still assumes force fields in space (and thereby still assumes the old material ether), our own scientific leaders are blindly and very determinedly w ithholding the U.S. scientific community from knowledge and use of precursor engineering (e nergetics) and therefore from knowledge and use of negative entropy engineering. Since th e KGB weapon scientists are using precursor engineering (energetics) in superweapons of great power, the ignorance of our scientific leaders and their refusal to change the terribly flawed CEM/EE model are leading the United States directly into our catastrophic destruction. xx.

Elsewhere we have formally corrected the present Second Law of thermodynamics, which is an oxymoron impl icitly assuming its contradiction has first occurred (to move the system away from equilibrium, thus lowering its entropy — a negative entropy operation). The old Second La w deliberately does not account its assumed preceding negative entropy oper ation. It then accounts only for the entropic decay of the out-of-equilibrium system back to equilibrium — the state of maximum entropy. That is why it prescribes only the production of increasing positive entropy. Written presently as the Second Law assumes — but deliberately does not account for— its own contradiction by a prior negative entropy operation 0), and thus formally is a logical oxymoron and always has been. The old Second Law (0 must be replaced by the new law which now also accounts for the previously unaccounted but implicitly assumed prior negative entropy precursor operation. Very often, this overall new Second Law is app lied in systems in two serial phases: first OBLIVION 356"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"an excitation (potentialization, or asymmetric regauging) phase occurs in which the system departs from equilibrium via the new half-law . The potentialization phase is then followed by the excited system's decay back to equilibrium by the old half-law For such separate potentialization a nd decay phases, the second law can be expressed as the equation In that form, the old second law is the rightmost term and is easily seen to be only a \"half-law\". It merely accounts the decay of a previously excited system, back to equilibrium. The new overall Second Law is (i) consistent with experiment, (ii) includes the known thermodynamic contradictions to the old Second Law (sever al are given in Kondepudi and Prigogine, Modern Thermodynamics, Wiley, 1999, p. 459), (iii) includes tr ansient st atistical fluctuations in an equilibrium system includi ng their initial negative entropy halves, (iv) removes the logical error in the old law's st atement, and (v) now includes negative entropy engineering (precursor engineering, or wh at the Soviet KGB weapon scientists dubbed \"energetics\"). Since every charge and dipole in the universe explicitly and freely pours out real observable EM energy at light speed, without any observable energy input (which means with only virtual-state energy input), then every charge already demonstrates eontinuous production of negative entropy and experimentally falsifies the present old Second Law. It does, however, comply with the new and corrected Second Law, which is clearly and experimentally established once one studies the \"source charge problem\" together with its polarization of the vac uum and its consequent \"broken symmetry of opposite charges\" solution. Every charge th erefore happily and continuously produces negative entropy, of the sort shown theoreti cally possible by D. J. Evans and Lamberto Rondoni, \"Comments on the Entropy of Nonequili brium Steady States,\" J. Stat. Phys., 109(3-4), Nov. 2002, p. 895-920. Evans and Rondoni despaired of finding any real system exhibiting such continuous production of ne gative entropy, but did allow that, for deterministic systems, the \"problem remains. \" After solving the long-vexing source charge problem, we then nominated every charge and dipole (and dipolarity) in the universe as examples of real physical systems continuous ly producing negative entropy as predicted by Evans and Rondoni. xxv.

In any large and powerful organiza tion, essentially the leader does not personally implement anything, but makes decisions an d issues orders. The circle immediately surrounding him (first level down in the organization) is his adviso rs and staff; they also do not personally implement, but relay the orders to appropriate sections of the organization. The second level down is where the large parts (directorates, Sections, etc.) of the organization exist. A manager at that sec ond level down is busy with administration matters, so he personally does not implem ent. But at the third level down, where the suborganization is now smaller, that manager is usually the implemente r. To implement is to perform actions laterally, in and outside the organization, so the third level manager's world is largely a lateral world, with extens ive functions, contacts, agreements, etc. with outside groups and agencies. Now call those third level managers and organizations the \"implementation entourage\" or just the \"entourage\" for short. This is where all the lateral action happens. Now apply the bell-shaped normal distribution curve to the entourage managers. At least 9% are lacking in matters such as ethics et c. Shrink that 9% down to 1%, and now one has managers who are in fact very evil persons. Th ey would kill their own grandmother to gain power, control, etc. Law and rules mean nothing except unfortunate encumbrances. Hereafter we will simply call this evil, gr asping, conniving 1% \"the entourage\", simply understanding it is only 1% or so of those manage rs at that level. But the entourage is the level at which all the skullduggery, murders, assassinations, etc. are planned and either carried out or arranged. We are speaking of every large and powerful organization on Planet Earth! The entourage is dictated by primate dominance, and this big monkey game has been going on in humans as long as there have been humans. xxxvii.

Edwards reported an electric motor scooter with top speed of 50 mph and range of more than 50 0 miles using an electromagnetic engine and magnets developed by Takahashi. The new scooter, developed by Sciex Corporat ion of Japan, ran on four ordinary 12-volt car batteries. The magnets were based on powder-metallurgy techniques and special "},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"neodymium material which produced a magnet with the world's highest Megagauss Oersted rating at the time. 55 MgOe was the maximum previously, but Takahashi's magnet material achieved 120 MgOE. The Takahashi engine produced 15 horsepower from just a few amperes of electricity. When the scooter was free-wheeling, the engine became a generator and partially recharged the batteries. Another novel use of the Takahashi magnets was as \"battery doublers\" to extend the life of rechargeable batteries. Thin inch-wide sq uares, attached to mobile phone batteries, doubled the amount of charge they retained and allowed the batteries to last twice as long.

Any university electrical engineering department wort h a hoot can readily build a magnetic Wankel engine, which kills its back mmf and thus continuously develops torque in a single rotary direction. One pays only a tiny bit to kill the back mmf, and self-powering of the system and its load can be achieved by tapping off a bit of power from the shaft- powered generator, and feeding it back to power the switching and control circuit. That none of our EE departments design and build su ch devices is a sad commentary on the lack of \"forward vision\" of our scientific community. xxxviii.

In 1996 Kawai met with this author and his C TEC board of directors, here in Huntsville, Alabama. After much negotiation on his s econd trip here, Kawai and CTEC reached agreement. We at CTEC would immediately proceed to set up laboratory and production facilities for producing and marketing worldwid e Kawai's self-powering motor, so that in 1997 we would have had such systems in mass production and on the world market everywhere. Our only exclusion would have been Japan, as Kawai had already licensed the marketing rights for that nation. Kawai was b acked by the second richest man in Japan, a multibillionaire, and he was financing our effort himself. In short, full financing was already accomplished. The night of the same day that we reached agreement verbally, a private jet arrived post haste from Los Angele s, with Yakuza on board. The next morning Kawai no longer controlled his company, his in vention, or his own fate. He was absolutely stunned and shamed, and could hardly lift his head to look me in the eye. He was a totally broken man. Instead, we found ourselves facing the arrogant Yakuza, some with the blue markings and the missing fingers, and very hostile Japanese. The agreement with Kawai was dissolved by the Yakuza right there on the spot. The Japanese team then coldly packed up the Kawai motors that had been shipped to us, and bundled up the Kawai team and left. And that was that. But once one understands the Yakuza's role in this Operations Phase that opened about the first of 2005, one then understands why the Yakuza have suppressed all the Japanese ove runity EM systems. xxxix.

In the vernacular, it proposes that we shouldn't sweat the small stuff; everything is still AOK and there isn't any really new or unique problem.

Missing and unaccounted, in the official Ukraine records and accounting for its nuclear weapons transfer to Russia. The reader should understand that there are no officially acknowledged missing nuclear weapons, and there likely never will be! In the real world, there turns out to be hundreds of such weapons that have \"mysteriously disappeared from accounting,\" and then in the hue and cr y and charges and counter charges, the hullabaloo has just faded away and been ignored. lxx. The Ministry of Defense reported on transfer and destruction by the Ukraine of 3772 nuclear warheads, but the general staff reported there were more than 4,000 to begin with. In other words, something other than tr ansfer or destruction was done with some 230 or so Ukrainian nuclear warheads. lxxi. Even under U.S. agreement with the Russians (START II) for dismantling some of the nuclear weapons, there has been no truly accurate accounting. E.g., quoting from Jo L.

Nov. 1997: \"From the outset, the Russian government was unwilling to permit the United States to have a role in the actual dismantlement of former Soviet/Russian nuclear warheads.
