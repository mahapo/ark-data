You will no longer be able to rely on law enforcement to protect you and there are going to be crowds of angry, scared, unprep ared people struggling to survive. Just because you took the time to prepare for the events that broke down society doesn’t mean that your job is done. On a daily basis, you will be tasked with protecting the supplies you so carefully stockpiled during b etter times.

Try to keep your possessions hidden from plain view whenever possible. Fences work but make it pretty obvious that you are attempting to hide something. Instead, consider using natural ways to obscure your possessions. Trees, shrubs, and other foliage block the view of people passing thro ugh without making it seem too obvious that something is being hidden. Make sure that windows in your home do not divulge what may be inside either. If your family is sitting at the table eating a home cooked meal and someone can see this event from the wi ndow there is a good chance they will try to join you; invited or not. Take a look at your home from the street to get a better understanding of this vantage point. You are better able to make changes after seeing for yourself what angry mobs of people w ill see as they pass your property. As a general rule, home invasions tend to be a crime of opportunity. An open window or unlocked door serves as an invitation for criminals. A home that looks secure is less likely to be attacked by people looking for an easy score. More often than not, these people will move on in search of an easier target elsewhere. Secure the Yard Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) is a technique that relies on landscaping to make your property, and ultimately you r home, less likely to be targeted for attack. Trees and shrubs can serve another purpose in addition to obscuring the view of your property. By carefully landscaping your property, they also make it difficult for intruders to gain casual access."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 7 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems In fac t, shrubs can be used to create natural funnels that force potential threats to move into defined areas. These areas should be easily viewable from your home so you have time to make preparations for an attack. CPTED has another aspect known as Natural Ac cess Control. This refers to the use of holly bushes or other thorny foliage near potential access points. It becomes very difficult (and painful) for an attacker to climb through these obstacles and into your window. It may thwart the attack completely. At the very least, it weakens the attacker making your counter - assault more effective. S ecure the Windows and Doors Sometimes all the landscaping and other perimeter defenses in the world are not enough to stop a determined attacker. Fortifying all the e ntry points into your home can keep attackers at bay long enough for you to plan your next move. Doors are the first point of entry that any thief looks for. The front door should be a reinforced security door. Although intricate glass paneling makes you r home look inviting now, those glass panels can become weak points in y our structure during an attack. There are thousands of security doors available that complement the design of nearly any home without sacrificing protection. Installing a security scre en door adds an additional layer of protection. The security door can be broken into but it makes access more difficult. Pay special attention to the back door of your home."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 8 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems As many as half of all home invasion attempts originate from the back door beca use it typically provides additional cover for the intruder and the doors tend to be much weaker than front doors. A plain wood or hollow - core fiberglass door is very common in the back of a home and both of these can be destroyed relatively quickly. Con sider replacing your current back door with a more robust model similar in construction to your front door. Be sure to use deadbolts on every exterior door in addition to the handle locking mechanism. Each deadbolt should be a Class 2 (rated the best for r esidential use) and the throw bolt should be at least one inch in length. Inferior deadbolts are far too easy to bypass with simple tools. Even if the door is robust, there is another weak spot that should be considered. The door frame itself can often be unseated or broken with a swift kick or a battering ram. Most door frames are simply tacked into place using small finishing nails during home construction. Installing three - inch screws into the door frame every few inches is an easy way to increase the security of these entrance points. Flimsy striker plates are another weakness inherent to most doorways. Replace striker plates with high - quality metal and use three - inch screws to secure these into the door frame. Sliding glass doors are easy to break . Consider boarding them up with plywood to make access more difficult. The locking mechanisms on these doors are a lso notoriously easy to break. Place a wooden dowel into the track behind the sliding door to prevent opening if the lock is compromised."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 9 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems Wi ndows are the second access point that requires your attention. Even locked windows can easily be popped open if there is a gap big enough to force a crowbar or screwdriver into. Adding stoppers to window frames makes access more difficult. The stopper is simply a metal pin or nail installed in the window frame. This prevents the window from opening more than a few inches even if the lock is compromised. Since these pins are not easily viewable from outside, the attacker will waste valuable time trying to force the window open. This time can be used by you to prepare a defensive stand or retreat is necessary. Board up any windows that are not absolutely necessary to survival. Windows that allow in sunlight can help with passive solar heating techniques but other windows are not needed and create unnecessary access points during an attack. Securely boarding up these windows forces intruders to look for alternative entrances and increases the chances that they will give up and look for an easier target down th e road. If you live in a populated area you are much more likely to be attacked. Especially in the days immediately following the apocalypse, high - population areas are expected to fall victim to extreme violence and riots. Although these techniques can h elp ward off an attack, determined individuals will find a way in. Consider retreating to a bug out location in a remote area. Attacks are much less likely in these areas and your chances of launching a successful counterattack are much better. Taking ste ps to secure your home now is helpful after a catastrophe but can also thwart home invasions now. In the United States, a home is broken into approximately every 11 seconds. Fortifying your home and property now ensures that you are less likely to become a statistic now or in a survival situation in the future."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 10 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems The Best Survival Dog For anyone who has lived (or still lives) in the countryside, the terms livestock guardian dog (LGD) and livestock herding dog (LHD) are probably familiar. What these two terms refer to are the two types of working dogs one might expect to find on a typical working farm. The terms indicate what role the dogs play, though both livestock guardian as well as livestock herding dogs may simply be referred to as sheep dogs or wo rking dogs. D ogs of all shapes and sizes have enjoyed the special distinction of man’s best friend for thousands of years, but many modern pet owners don’t realize the true potential of their canine companions."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 11 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems Whether they are acting as vigilant guardian s, aiding in the location and management of livestock, assisting in search and rescue, or laying down their lives to defend their human master, a well - trained dog can be worth its weight in gold. Indeed, on working farms and in rural communities around th e world, livestock herding and livestock guardian dogs, the quintessential working dogs, retain immense popularity to this day. The best livestock herding dogs and livestock guardian dogs come from specific breeds that have been bred and raised to perform certain tasks, as in the case of the Australian Koolie (a herding dog) breed or the Great Pyrenees (a guardian) breed from France. As their names distinguish, LGDs and LHDs have distinctly different purposes when working with flock or herd animals. Livest ock herding dogs are bred, raised and trained specifically to work with a farmer or shepherd. As such, these breeds generally have an abundance of energy, are highly intelligent, and are really at their best when they have a job to do or a lot of mental s timulation. L ivestock H erding D ogs The effectiveness of a LHD stems from the fact that it uses predatory behaviors (ex. nipping at the heels, moving fast, barking, circling, etc.) to herd prey animals by bunching and flocking. Some of the most renowned b reeds of livestock herding dogs are:"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 12 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems Border C ollie The B order collie is famed for its intelligence and is a popular breed chosen by families around the world as a pet, border collies are known for their ability to learn many tricks and they excel in agility training and competitions. All these traits stem from the fact that border collies have traditionally been the go - to shepherding dog in many localities for literally hundreds upon hundreds of years. Australian Shepherds Australian shepherds, de spite their name, originated in the western states of the US on ranches and farms, working alongside their owners to herd sheep and other livestock. Like most herding breeds, Australian shepherds are highly energetic, with eager - to - please temperaments, an d they’ve become quite popular as family pets as well as in agility and training exercises. Unfortunately, they can become highly destructive if they get bored, so they need a combination of either a lot of attention and daily training/play/exercise and/o r a large area to roam, such as a farm or ranch."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 13 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems German S hepherd The German shepherd is famous for its use as a working dog alongside police and military detachments the world over . B ut this breed (like so many others) has its true roots in the rura l countryside, working with sheep and other livestock alongside humans. Capable herding dogs with great intelligence and capacity for obedience, German shepherds are one of the most popular breeds chosen as pets as well as show and competition dogs. They are very protective and can be quite fierce toward strangers, predators or other potential threats, but with proper socialization they can be quite safe to handle and have around family, friends and of course livestock. Lancashire Heeler Lancashire Heelers, more commonly known simply as heelers, are an example of a rather speci alized livestock herding breed. B uilt long and short, heelers have traditionally been bred to maintain their low - to - ground stature for use in herding cattle. Because these effe ctive little dogs are so small, kicks from cattle traditionally go right over the dog’s head rather than striking and injuring or killing the animal. They might be small, but when properly trained these little dogs can prove quite useful as a working breed ."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 14 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems Another similarly small - statured herding breed is the Welsh corgi . Typically trained for use with sheep, cattle and goats, livestock herding dogs can also be used (with adequate training and supervision) to handle chickens, ducks, geese and other fowl and smaller animals as well as pigs and llamas. In addition to their skill and usefulness as working dogs, many LHD breeds also make loyal family pets, often with an innate, super - alert guarding instinct to boot. Unfortunately, because of their more preda tory instincts, LHD aren’t as well suited to being left alone or otherwise unattended with their flock or herd, as they may slip up and eat their charges. L ivestock G uardian D ogs That’s where LGDs come in. With their more relaxed, patient temperaments, we ll - trained livestock guardian dogs can be left unattended amongst your sheep, cattle, goats or flock of fowl. Indeed, it’s what they have been bred and trained for, because the main purpose of a LGD is to protect your herd or flock from other predators by staying with them at all times. A good LGD will fight off predators that may prey on your livestock, but in many cases farmers with LGDs among their herd or flock find that they have very few issues with predators. This is because predators are known oppo rtunists, so once they’ve identified that your LGD (another predator as opposed to a prey animal) has staked out its own patch of territory with your livestock, the predators will look for easier, unguarded prey elsewhere. This makes LGDs ideal for use wh en you have free range cattle, goats, sheep or other free - roaming animals. Good livestock guardian dogs can also protect your stock from"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 15 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems theft by strangers, though humans may prove more lethal to your dogs than predatory animals if they should target your stock. In any case, some of the best livestock guardian breeds include: Anatolian S hepherd Anatolian shepherds are a resilient, hardy breed of guardian dogs that historically came from Anatolia, a region in central Turkey. Compared to some of the more relaxed, even ‘lazy’ livestock guardian breeds, Anatolian shepherds are agile and swift, capable of chasing down predators or intruders if they try to flee. They also have exceptional hearing, are quite strong, and generally show good situational awa reness. Like several other livestock guardian breeds that originate from Turkey, the Anatolian shepherds descend from dogs with ancient heritage and history as working animals. Kuvasz The kuvasz is a dedicated livestock guardian breed that descen ds from dogs kept for thousands of years to serve as guardians and protectors. As such, this breed is truly intended for life as a working dog, and they are really only happy when"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 16 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems they have large areas to roam in and preferably a flock or herd to guard. W ith great intelligence and independence, this breed is characterized by great protectiveness and gentleness toward its herd or flock. Wary and potentially even aggressive toward strangers, the breed is intensely loyal to their family and will protect any h umans or animals that it recognizes as being part of the flock. Kangal The kangal dogs that also originate from Turkey are another popular choice as LGDs. W ith strong guardian instincts that have resulted from thousands of years of selective breed ing and use with livestock, the kangal is a formidable guardian with a relaxed but attentive temperament. In recent years, kangals have gained in popularity as family dogs specifically because of their gentle but strongly protective dispositions. Gre at Pyrenees Great Pyrenees are one of the breeds often referred to as the ‘white dogs’ of the livestock guardian group. Another, similar breed in the ‘white dogs’ group is the Maremma sheepdog which is often used in tandem with a Great Pyrenees."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 17 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems A proper ly bred and raised Great Pyrenees will be a calm, relaxed, confident dog with strong protective instincts for its herd but is extremely gentle with livestock and children. It is also important to remember that, in addition to the training that a good dogs needs to become a great herder or guardian (but particularly a herder), your flock of sheep, herd of goats or other livestock to be handled must also be trained to respond properly to the dog. Ornery sheep, aggressive rams, cattle and even pigs that have never been handled by a herding dog or been in the presence of a guardian dog will need to be acclimated to the new animal. Another important distinction between livestock herding breeds and livestock guarding breeds has to do with their ability to learn, and willingness to follow, commands and orders from their owner. Traditional herding breeds are, by necessity of their job and the fact that they must respond swiftly and accurately to their master’s commands, generally extolled for their obedience and a bility to learn new commands and tricks quickly. By contrast, most livestock guarding breeds, especially those hailing from more ancient lineage, are reputed for their stubbornness, their independence, and their general sense of autonomy and even aloofnes s towards the human members of its pack. As opposed to being stupid or particularly disobedient, it must be understood that livestock guardian breeds are actually quite intelligent and have been specifically bred and raised for their capacity to work with livestock wile unattended."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 18 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems When it comes down to it, while there is some training provided by the owner (and the older dogs if you have older LGDs working your stock), most of what a good LGD does stems from instinct and good breeding. Since these dogs have traditionally been left unattended with the stock, often for days at a time with little or no contact with their shepherds, it is important that they be able to make decisions on their own without relying on the orders of their master.

Snakes Yeah, we know. Snakes aren’t exactly on the top of the list of most lovable pets for most people. However, a snake kept in a cage right beside your door is prohibitive to many people for exactly that reason. This is actually an old crazy cowboy trick that we heard about a while back. The guy had the rattlesnake (not our first choice of pets, or even our 100th choice) in a slatted box lined with screen that was nailed at about face - level right beside his door. An atta cker may not see the screen at first, and even if he did, he may just think that if somebody keeps a snake, they probably have even crazier things INSIDE the house. Good mental tactic. We’d recommend going with a king snake or some other non - poisonous yet scary - looking, loud serpent.

Wolves or Part - Wolves Right up front, you should know that special permits are required if you have a wolf, or part - wolf, as a pet.

This is especially true in modern - day suburbia where many homeowners keep their lawns and gardens looking pristine. The landscaping outside sets the stage for what the inside of the home will look like. A well - manicured lawn with trimmed bus hes and freshly planted flowers is more likely to surround a home with hardwood floors, granite counter tops and expensive electronics. A yard with uncut grass and crumbling walkways is more likely to give way to unkempt home with less valuable possessions."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 25 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems This isn’t always the case, but thieves have taken advantage of this rule of thumb many times over. It’s usually the dead giveaways and false sense of security that certain homes display that make them easy marks for burglars. The car you drive and you r trash can give a thief a lot of information about your finances and purchases. Yet it’s also the homes with little or no visible security features (cameras, motion lights, and fencing ) that often draw in the criminal. People break into homes because t hey are driven by greed and the desire to take from others, or we make it too easy for them to do so. Instead of going for the big homes with sports cars in the driveway, thieves often go for the most vulnerable homes that offer the easiest access. As a h omeowner, you can go to great lengths to fortify your home and property to protect it against thieves and home invaders. Fortunately, you don’t need to shell out a ton of cash on hi - tech alarms and cameras to deter them. Instead, all you need is to make it more difficult for them to access your home’s weakest entry points from the outside. Below we will discuss the idea of protecting your home with various plants and defensive bushes, which are often all it takes to make a prowling thief skip your home al together. Believe it or not, plants and bushes have been used for centuries to designate property lines and home perimeters. They’ve also been adapted to make those homes and properties more protected against outside threats. These same techniques still apply whether you simply want to bolster your home’s security or are preparing your property for surviving the apocalypse."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 26 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems Thorny and spiked plants growing in vulnerable spots near your home and property are unwelcome signs to intruders. Their natural f orms of protection create a hostile environment for a potential thief to pass through. Defensive plants and bushes can scratch, cut, and puncture the thief and cause him to leave behind DNA in the form of blood, skin, or torn clothing. Keep in mind that n ot every variety of plant can grow in certain parts of the world. It’s up to you to do the research as to what will work best for your home and property. A hedgerow of thorny bushes can go a long way to discouraging unwanted intruders. These bushes sho uld be thick and tall enough to discourage intruders from fight ing their way over or through. Yet they should also be cropped low enough to keep your home visible from the street. That way, thieves are less likely to go to work without being spotted. Acco rdingly, most plants and trees in your yard should be trimmed regularly to give you a clear line of sight across your property and eliminate hiding spots for thieves. Trees"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 27 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems with thorns on their trunk and branches are less likely to be scaled in order to ge t to a second floor window or balcony. Some examples of thorny trees include:  Argentine Mesquite (2 - inch thorns),  Black Locust (1 to 2 - inch thorns that cause skin swelling),  Honey Locust (sharp red thorns). Thorn bearing bushes, especially when planted around windows, can be a nightmare to get caught up in. Just one brush against certain thorn bushes can be enough to send a thief packing. That is unless he’s wearing several layers of protective clothing and fueled with determination (or stupidity). Spe cies of Thorny Bushes The pyracantha , or fire thorn bush, contains thorns that leave a burning sensation that lasts for hours. The catsclaw acacia also contains burning nettles that it conceals under yellow flowers and plumes of green leaves. Oregon grape holly (as well as other"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 28 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems varieties of holly) is both attractive and dangerous with its abundance of multi - spiked leaves. Then there’s always the many variety of cacti, most of which are covered in sharp and irritating thorns that can grow several inches i n length. Vined plants that grow upward and out are another eye pleaser that also serve as a natural form of security. Bougainvillea (common to Central and South America) bloom beautiful pinkish - purple flowers that conceal pointy thorns. Climbing varieti es of roses can serve a similar purpose and be cultivated to span entire walls of your home. Blackberry and raspberry vines also grow thorns that serve to protect their fruits, giving you both protection and a supply of freshly grown food. While not compre hensive, these ideas should help you get started using Mother Nature to help protect your home and property. Landscaping as means to fortify your home against intruders is a concept that most homeowners overlook when formulating a security plan or prepar ing for a disaster survival situation. In today’s times, a locked door and security alarm isn’t always enough to stop a determined thief. But if your yard, walls, and windows are covered with defensive bushes and plants, most thieves will think twice bef ore attempting to break in.

Obviously, in rural areas, crimes are less likely to be reported, and suffer a far longer response time. After a large scale terrorist attack, EMP strike or nuclear war, rural and agricultural areas will most likely be the first to suffer, as police forces are stretched thin.

With some farms exceeding 1,400 acres in size, it can be unreasonable to expect that such an undertaking could be affordable. In fact, the price for fencing the perimeter can surpass the value of the farm entirely. That’s why selective fencing erected to secure valuable resources such as livestock and cro ps can be a reasonable precaution. To keep unwanted invaders out, a fence needs to stand at least six feet high and be constructed of a sturdy, weatherproof, non - scalable material. Additional coverage features While high - tech solutions mig ht not seem cost - effective, the investment in motion sensors, flood lights, and property alarms are far more economical when dealing with a large property. Automated lighting can be extremely effective in maintaining a presence on your property. Security c ameras and tracking systems, concealed by equipment such as water pumps and near sheds, can be invaluable in keeping an eye on all reaches of your property. Incorporating an alert system allows you to be instantly notified when intruders appear on your property. While these measures can be less effective in dealing with natural predators, they are highly effective on warding off thieves from targeting your farm equipment and valuab les."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 31 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems T hese security features should operate on a sustainable alternative power source to keep your home secure even during grid - down scenarios. In case of an emergency, when food supplies become a valuable commodity, these security features can be your home’s lifeline. Finally, one of the most versatile security features you can keep on a rural property is one of the most time - honored security solutions: a tough, strong guard dog . While they aren’t the only solution by any means, they’re pa rticularly helpful in guarding livestock (especially when in possession of a herding breed). They’re also far more perceptive during scenarios in which you find yourself without your standard security measures. While they might not alert authorities like a n alarm can, they can keep you informed on potential wrongdoings. Protecting farm equipment and property One advantage you could have in home security is by installing non - traditional locks which are inherently bump - proof. Lock - bumping, a widely recognized and extremely easy lock - picking method, is one the most fatal flaws affecting home security today. The method is so fool - proof that even expensive “bump proof” traditional pin tumbler locks take an extra few seconds to open. Consider replacing any of thes e pin tumbler locks on your tool and supply sheds with magnetic, combination, or electric locks. Electric locks have the added benefit of being able to be remotely unlocked if you have smart home integration. And keep in mind that you need that alternative power source for them either ."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 32 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems Another way to resist invasion is by investing in doors and windows which withstand a higher level of punishment. Heavier doors should be installed on sheds containing valuable tools and resources. These can be supplemented with anchor chain locks, reinforced door jambs, and other features. Any windows should be replaced with shatter - resistant panes, or at least reinforced with a theft - resistant window film if this isn’t financially feasible. While these improvements can be effective for any property, they should definitely be included on any spaces tha t include resources you need to maintain your crops and livestock. These areas are more frequently targeted by criminals due to a lack of oversight by most rural property owners. By taking these measures, it can be far easier to catch criminals in the act before any real theft or damage can occur.

We all know horrific stories about robberies from our friends or our neighbors; burglars and looters are not mythical creatures that exist only in nightmares, unfortunately. Some people choose to install a professional security system. But not everyone can afford such a high - tech system; therefore one could try to improvise a DIY home protection system. If this idea appeals to you, read this article."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 34 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems I bet you enjoyed the “Home Alone” movie series, but keep in mind that using booby traps to catch burglars in the act only works in movies. If you’re considerin g building booby traps for your home protection, you should consider a few things before doing so. Firstly, a homemade booby trap may injure or even kill an intruder. And if it works, you can go to jail; it’s as simple as that. Even if this may sound stra nge to you, there are some legal issues you must be aware of before going full speed ahead with your DIY home protection system. DOs Here’s a short list of what you can actually do, legally s peaking, about home protection:  You can build yourself a survei llance system, by install ing motion sensors that trigger motion lights or an alarm. Use an alternative source of energy for these devices.  U se pepper spray systems for protecting your house. They work just like a regular alarm, but instead of triggering a loud noise when a trespasser is detected, the potential thief will be sprayed in the face with a pepper solution, which is very unpleasant, to say the least. The good thing about such a pro - active mean of defense is that it’s a non - lethal one; hence it’s p erfectly legal to use.  Get yourself a dog as a mean of discouraging burglars. There are even electronic dogs available, i.e. alarm systems that sound like a dog bark.  I nstall tripwires in sensitive places. This is the low - tech solution for an early warni ng system. Attaching a noise - maker device on the tripwire (like a chime or a bell) will warn you in advance about an intruder."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" few Off - grid Home Protection System Page 35 of 36 © Off - grid Home Protection Systems  If your property is protected by a fence, you can try to make that fence hard to scale by planting nails on top of it, or broken glass; something that will hurt the intruder. Of course, all fences can be breached, in final analysis, so don’t bet your life on it! Also, if somebody is injured on your property, even scaling a fence, you’re legally liable if you can’t prove that he was committing a crime. DON ’ Ts Now, read carefully what NOT to do, when building yourself a DIY home - defense system. DO NOT build actual booby traps inside of your home. They can kill or cause severe injuries to innocent people and they’re actually complet ely illegal. Yes, you will go to jail for booby trapping your home. There are countless unfortunate stories about when booby traps harmed family members or friends. DON’T install booby traps that work by triggering a shotgun, or any other weapon for that matter. Even if you’ll manage to stop a burglar in that way (maybe even kill him), you’ll be held accountable for manslaughter, not to mention that you could accidentally kill a child or the cable guy. Basically, any artisanal devices that can severely in jure or kill a person are to be avoided. They are way too risky and work indiscriminately and you’re legally responsible if anything bad happens. You might end up killing yourself by mistake if you’re booby trapping your own house. This scenario has actua lly happened more than once and it’s maybe the most ridiculous way to die."}]
