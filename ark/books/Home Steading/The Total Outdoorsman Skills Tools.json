It’s a small thing, a basic elemental skill, but there are few things that give me more satisfaction than starting a campfire the way I was taught to many years ago by my outdoor mentors. Finding natural tinder from the woods around you, gathering armloads of kindling, and piling up a stack of good, dry wood. Finally you arrange the material in a way that one strike of a waterproof match ignites a flame that slowly builds into the kind of fire that heats your body, warms your spirit, and creates a deep bed of coals for cooking your supper—preferably fresh fish or game. One of the fundamental rewards of hunting, fishing, camping, and paddling is that these activities are built upon the kinds of atavistic skills that are too often neglected in our increasingly plugged-in world. From outwitting game animals with calls and camo to fooling fish with a bit of feather tied around a wire hook, and everything in between, being a total outdoorsman depends on skills, competence, and self reliance. It can take a lifetime to acquire these skills, and the mission of this book is to not only help you learn them but also inspire you to use them. One of the core principles of Field & Stream is that the more you know, the more fun you can have. Every season, every day, brings a new opportunity in the fields, woods, rivers, lakes, and oceans that make up the world of the total outdoorsmen. It’s easy to stick with what you know, but it’s much more rewarding and a heck of a lot of fun if you’re always pushing yourself to try something new. I can think of no better guide to becoming a well-rounded sportsman than the author of this book, T. Edward Nickens. From first descents down Alaskan rivers to hunting ducks with his son in the local swamp, Nickens has done it all and written about it in his long career as an outdoor journalist and adventure writer. One more thing about Nickens and Field & Stream : While we value the fundamental, old-school skills that are a part of these sports, we make it our mission to look forward as well as backward. So this book is full of not just the tried and true but also the cutting edge and innovative. We believe that being a total outdoorsman is not just mastering what the basics, but evolving and embracing new tools, techniques, and tactics. If you master half of what is in this book, I promise you that you’ll not only be a better hunter and fishermen, but you’ll have more success and have more fun doing it. ANTHONY LICATA Editor, Field & Stream"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"I found it on a ridge top where heavy rains the day before had scoured the top layer of turned earth in the muddy field furrows. I was headed for a deer stand, barely looking at the ground, but the object’s leaflike profile caught my eye. Some primordial corner of my brain recognized the angles, the edges, instantly. It was a stone point, perched on a tiny pedestal of red-clay dirt, a gift left by the ancients and unwrapped by time. The white-quartz edges were still sharp. A lance point—an old one—it dated from the Archaic Period that predated the development of the bow and arrow. And yet, I could lash the point to a straight sapling and kill a deer with it today, perhaps 5,000 years after some hunter stalked this very same ridge top. I believe whoever made that stone point—whoever hunted with it—would have had much in common with you and me. He would have appreciated tools—sporting gear, fishing tackle, ropes and packs, and knives and bows. And not just for the sake of having tools, but because tools would’ve helped him feed his family and move quietly in the wild and stay alive when things turned rough. That long-ago hunter would have been obsessed with knowing how to use tools. Just like I am. Just like you are. He would have liked this book. No doubt, he would have some great ideas for these next few hundred pages. This is a book about sporting tools. It’s a book packed with essential skills about how to use stuff, fix stuff, improvise stuff, and improve the stuff you already own to create better hunting, fishing, and camping experiences. A lot of the skills in this book I wrote for Field & Stream ’s annual Total Outdoorsman issue, published every May. A few of the tips come from the magazine’s accomplished staff and field editors, and we’ve even"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"pulled a few of our favorite reader’s tips. But the majority of these skills are brand new. They’ve never been published—until now. A lot has changed since that ancient hunter moved in moccasins across that river bluff, spear in hand. Corn and soybeans clad the hill these days, not beech and oaks. Many hunters now carry a daypack crammed with gear my native predecessor could not imagine—GPS units, LED headlamps, laser rangefinders. No doubt he would have scoffed at the surgical gloves I wear while field-dressing deer to keep blood out of any nicks and cuts. I don’t want to think about what he would say about a spinning-wing decoy. He would have drooled over my knives, though, and he would have marveled at the modern riflescope. No question about that. I’ll tell you what would blow his mind: my basement. Honestly, I’d be embarrassed for a guy who killed deer with little more than a stick tipped with a sharp rock to see the mountains of gear I’ve amassed. Barrels bristling with fly rods and canoe paddles. Storage bins bulging with camouflage clothing. A pair of gun safes. Trolling motors. Bags of soft-plastic baits. Duck decoys stuffed into every corner. My collection will be nothing out of the ordinary to anyone holding this book. Your garage is likely no different from my basement. We’re gear-heads. We love tools, and there’s not a thing wrong with that. But owning tools isn’t the same as knowing how to use them. There’s nothing worse that some yahoo who shows up with the latest, greatest gear but can’t cast close to the pond bank. Or hit the broad side of an elk. Or sharpen a hatchet. Or cinch down the tent fly. Or stop the bleeding from a buddy’s gashed leg. Gear is just stuff that gets in the way—unless you know how to use it, fix it, improve it, and improvise with it. This is a book for folks who want to learn new ways to do all of that with hunting, fishing, camping, and survival tools. It’s not a what-to-buy book. You won’t find a single gear review in here. This is a book that will make you a better hunter, angler, paddler, game cook, and camp companion. It’s a book for people who love stuff for the right reason: They love the stuff that gear allows them to do. T. EDWARD NICKENS Editor-at-Large, Field & Stream"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"EVERYTHING WE NEED We make quite a scene at the airport: two adults, two teenagers, four carry-ons, and eight pieces of checked baggage, each of which weighs within ounces of the 50-pound-per-bag maximum. It’s all there: everything a family of four will need for a week-long camping trip in the big American West. We’ve done it enough times now to have it down to a science. A 48-quart cooler is packed with a stove, a lantern, and cookware. Every man, woman, and child has his or her own duffel of clothes and personal gear, fishing rods, and summer reading. There are two backpacks loaded with tents, sleeping bags, and pads, and my beloved canoe barrel packed with breakables. Once on the ground, we rent a van and buy cheap camp chairs and a square of indoor/outdoor carpet. We hit a grocery store. And just like that we’re off for a week of camping and fishing and hiking. Two adults, two teenagers, and pushing 400 pounds of gear. Every year we make the trip, I spend the night before we leave cinching straps and triple-checking gear lists and wondering if it’s worth all the work and hassle. And every year, as we pack up camp the night before we fly home, I know the answer. Yes. A thousand times, yes. There is simply not a more American pastime than camping. And despite the fact that we’ve upgraded from birch bark canoes and Conestoga wagons to jetliners and $40,000 pickup trucks, the spirit is still there, still true: pack up a semblance of home, move it to some distant riverbank or mountain ridge, and reassemble. Raise the tent, hang the grub, lay the fire. Set up camp. Pair a camping trip with a rod or gun, and the fun factor rockets. Now there’s fresh trout on the fire, and elk quarters hanging in the dark timber. Of course, having the right gear is a big part of the difference between a string of miserable nights in the woods and an unforgettable week in the wild. And the right stuff doesn’t necessarily mean the newest stuff or the most expensive gear. It can mean knowing how to get the most of some of the most basic tools you own. Consider the tent guyline, the cord that attaches the rain fly to the tent stakes. It’s a piece of cord, really, so what else is there to know? Plenty, which is the point of this book. Learn to tie a taut-line hitch at the end of the guyline and you can cinch the rain fly tight in front of a storm. Replace all your old manufacturer-supplied guyline cord with reflective cord and you’ll never again trip on those dark midnight trips to the groover. Learn how to rig a guyline picket stake and your tent fly will never again loosen when the winds start to howl. Those are three examples of how you can rig and"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"modify one overlooked piece of gear. I’m an unapologetic gear hog, and I admit that I have a hoarder’s tendency to keep just about everything. My basement is crammed with camping gear that spans a half- century, from my dad’s old lensatic compass to a set of GPS-enabled two-way radios. Even in the woods, I’m the guy who brings it all. I was never one to drill holes in my toothbrush to shave a few ounces from my backpack’s weight. I’d rather sweat a bit more up the ridge so I can kick back with real coffee than make do with instant swill. I’d rather have two headlamps because you never know. Most likely, I’ll be the guy with the gun-cleaning kit stashed in the boat bag, and you’ll come looking for me when your canoe turns over. But we can’t forget attitude and aptitude. Good gear and know-how have a hard time trumping a whiny disposition when the trail turns tough. A positive frame of mind invites on-the-fly innovation and makes the most of every situation. A gracious spirit is thankful for every night spent under the stars—no matter how rocky and rooty the ground under your back. Your brain and your heart are your most important tools. Once, during an 8-day paddling and fishing trip down Ontario’s remote Palisade and Allanwater rivers, my buddy Scott Wood and I had to put in a monstrous day. We broke camp early and paddled 22 miles, with a 3-mile lake crossing and mucky overgrown portages. We were still on the go at 11 P.M. , with no food for eight hours and daylight fading fast, yet we had our largest rapid to run. At the base of Black Beaver Rapids, we dragged the boat to shore as an orange moon rose through spectral fire-blackened forest, too exhausted to cook supper. We stamped down a rough bivvy 10 feet from the water, running tent guylines to blueberry shrubs, and collapsed in the sleeping bags as northern lights arced overhead, wholly unappreciated. We had a few more days on the river, and I spent the few fitful minutes before sleep triple-checking the map and wondering if it was worth all the hassle. In the morning we limped out of the tents to find the blueberry plains sheathed in frost, a world so glittery and serene, I half-expected unicorns to come prancing through the valley. We caught a breakfast walleye, cleaned it on the bottom of an overturned canoe, fried it hot and fast and washed the fish down with pure, cold water from the river and handfuls of blueberries. And just like that—I was ready to do it all again. Worth it every time."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"1 SLEEP UNDER THE STARS Growing up we slept under the stars, sans tent or tarp, to prove how tough we were, but now I sleep in the Big Scary Open because I get a huge kick out of nodding off to shooting stars and waking to the first rays of the sun. And it’s super cool to sleep with frost sheathing your sleeping bag. If you’re squeamish about dozing off without the protection of a nylon cocoon, try it my way: Spread out a space blanket first, then a super-comfy sleeping pad. Having a spread of ground cloth between you and the bare ground is a mental comfort, and it also means you can spread your arms and thrash around a bit without actually wallowing in the dirt. I wear a toboggan to hold in extra body heat and keep a flashlight tucked in a boot near my head so I can find it quickly. If it makes you feel better, the other boot can hold a knife, handgun, pepper spray, or ninja death stars."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"2 MAKE GUYLINES SHINE In 30 minutes you can replace all your old tent guylines with reflective cord, and never again trip over them while stumbling around during a middle-of-the-night pee, during which you stub your right big toe so badly that the nail splits and the toe swells and you can’t wear wading boots for two days. Listen to me."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"3 STRENGTHEN A TENT WITH PICKET STAKES This supercharged guyout plan kicks in when the wind cranks up to 25 mph. Picket stakes boost the holding power of tent stakes, so use them on the guylines attached to the side of the tent that faces the wind. STEP 1 Drive the first stake into the ground at the desired location, and attach it to the tent guyline. To make a picket-stake line, tie an overhand loop in one end of a 16- inch length of parachute cord. Attach the p-cord to the first stake by threading the running end through the overhand loop and cinching it tight against the stake. STEP 2 Drive a second stake—this will be the picket stake—into the ground 8 to 12 inches from the first stake so that it’s in a straight line with the guyline. Wrap the running end of the p-cord around the picket stake twice, then tie it off with two half hitches."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"4 FIX A TIRED TENT POLE It ranks among the most humiliating of outdoor snafus: When you pull the tent poles from the stuff sack, where they have been lovingly stored since portable CD players were all the rage, the pole sections fall to your feet like pick-up-sticks, the shock cord holding them together slack and limp. It’s always best to replace old shock cord as it starts to lose its elasticity, not when it is gone forever. In most cases, elastic bungee cord is threaded through the pole sections and held in place with a stopper knot that jams against a washer or some other stop inside each terminal pole section. A few tent models require a kit if the shock cord goes south, but most can be handled with nothing more than new bungee. First, remember to keep the pole sections in their original order throughout this process. Access the cord by prying off a pole tip. Remove the old cord. Tie an overhand knot in one end of the new cord. Thread the cord through the poles one section at a time, joining the sections together as you make progress. If the bungee bunches up while being pushed, cut a straight length of coat hanger wire, attach to the end of the bungee, and feed the wire through the poles. When finished, pull the bungee cord fairly tight, but leave some slack. Tie another stopper knot, but don’t cut off the excess yet. You may need to experiment with the cord length to get the tension right. You want enough to hold the poles together, but not so much that the cord is stretched too tightly when you decouple the sections."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"5 USE GARBAGE BAGS AS SAND SPIKES It’s always been a challenge to anchor a tent or tarp on beaches, river sandbars, and other places where tent stakes won’t hold. The solution: bag it. Fill garbage bags or empty stuff sacks with sand, tie a knot in the opening, then tie the tent’s stake loops and rain fly guylines to them. For high winds, burying the bags will provide a rock-solid stake point. And stuffing sand bags along the inside tent edge will help batten down the hatches."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"6 TURN BACK EVERY TICK AND CHIGGER It’s taken me decades of tinkering to perfect this system, but I’ve cut my number of tick and chigger bites by 90 percent or better with a tactical approach to applying bug dope and modifying clothing. The advent of roll-top and sponge-top insect repellents also helps keep the required dosage to a minimum. Here’s the drill. Start with the strategic placement of high-percentage DEET bug dope. I rarely use anything less than 30 percent, and when the chigger infestations are at their worst, I use 100-percent DEET without hesitation. The idea is not to slather your entire body with the strong stuff, but to minimize use by drawing hard chemical lines to turn back the insect hordes. Run a stripe of dope around each leg on the upper thighs, below the bottom edge of your underwear, and another one below the knee. Now lift up your shirt, pull the pants waistband down an inch or two, and apply another stripe of bug dope around your waist an inch above the top of where your pants ride. The idea is to prevent a tick and chigger recon squad from crawling up or down. Now tuck pant hems into socks and run a band of duct tape around the seam. Apply more DEET to boots, socks, and pants legs below the knees. Exposed areas around your neck need bug dope, as do wrists. A double stripe below and above the elbow will keep creepies from crawling up your arms. Designate a hat as your bug-dope-friendly brim. Apply dope to the crown. Last, run a stripe of repellent along the edge of the hat brim. This helps produce a vapor barrier of bug dope in front of your face, but keeps the chemicals out of your eyes."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"7 FIX TORN MOSQUITO NETTING Having a properly sealed mosquito net can spell the difference between a healthy safari and a bout of malaria—or at least, a good night’s sleep and one full of itches and welts. For straight tears less than 2 inches long, thread a needle and stitch the rip closed. If you have extra netting in a repair kit, reinforce with a netting patch cut ½ inch larger than the tear. In the field, any makeshift thread will work: dental floss, fishing line, or even plant fibers. You can always pretty it up with nylon sewing thread back home. For jagged, Frankenstein rips large enough for bats to fly through, heavier lifting is required. First, pull the edges of the tear together and tape with masking tape (A). (Duct tape is too sticky.) Then tape a strip of paper over the tape to serve as extra backing (B). On the other side, brush on a layer of silicone-based repair adhesive (C). Give it two days to cure, then remove the paper backing. Dust the patch with body powder (D) to knock back the stickiness and prevent it from picking up dirt or sticking to the rest of the tent."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"8 MAKE A BUG BLOTTER Duct tape makes a fine insect blotter. Wrap a few strips around your hand and blot the bugs trapped inside the tent. Better than smashing them into the tent fabric."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"9 SURVIVE A LIGHTNING STRIKE There are lots of snappy sayings to help you remember lightning safety: When the thunder roars, get indoors! If you can see it, flee it! But what do you do when you’re caught outdoors with almost nowhere to hide? The National Outdoor Leadership Schools, or NOLS, and other experts, recommend the following. IF YOU ARE CLOSE TO YOUR VEHICLE OR AN ENCLOSED STRUCTURE Get inside something—your car, a house, a barn. Open shelters such as picnic shelters provide little to no protection. IF YOU ARE CAMPING Avoid open fields and ridge tops during seasons when thunderstorms are prevalent. Stay away from fence lines, metal and tall, isolated trees. Tents provide no protection. If you are in dangerous open terrain during a thunderstorm, leave the tent and assume the “lightning crunch” (described in the last paragraph). IF YOU ARE IN OPEN COUNTRY Avoid the high ground and contact with dissimilar objects, such as water and land, boulders and land, or single trees and land. Head for ditches, gullies, or low ground. Spread out at least 50 feet apart and assume the “lightning crunch.” IF YOU ARE ON THE WATER Head inside a boat cabin, which offers a safer environment. Stay off the radio unless it is an emergency. Drop anchor and get as low in the boat as possible. If you’re in a canoe on open water, get as low in the canoe as possible and as far as possible from any metal object. If shore only offers rocky crags and tall isolated trees, stay in the boat. IF YOU CANNOT FIND SHELTER Some experts believe that the “lightning crunch” provides little to no protection for a direct or close strike, but at this point, some action is better than nothing. Stand on an insulated pad or bag of clothes. Do not stand on packs; the metal in frames and zippers could increase chances of a lightning strike. Put your feet together and balance on the balls of your feet. Squat low, wrap your arms around your legs, tuck your head, close your eyes and cover your ears. Maintain the position until danger passes."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"10 MAKE CONTACT WITH YOUR TOUCHSCREEN Most of us bring along a smartphone on our camping trips. When it’s cold, however, the device is impossible to use with gloves, which block the transfer of electrical energy from your skin to the capacitive touchscreen. You can buy touchscreen-compatible gloves, outfitted with small, conductive fingertip dots. Or you can save 40 bucks and take pride in being a postmodern mountain man by sewing a few stitches of conductive thread to the tips of your own mitts. All you need is a pair of old-school gloves, a sewing needle, and a couple feet of conductive thread. STEP 1 Thread a sewing needle with 18 inches of conductive thread. Double the thread, and tie an overhand knot in the end. STEP 2 If possible, turn the glove finger inside out to start the stitching. (If your glove is too thick to turn it inside out, trim the excess thread as close as possible to the knot, and start from the outside.) Make 4 to 5 parallel stitches, keeping the threads as close as possible. You want enough exposed thread to conduct the electricity from your skin, but not so much as to make the active touchscreen dot too large. On the inside of the glove, create a half-inch bird’s nest of thread to help transfer the electric charge. STEP 3 Tie the thread off by slipping the needle through the last two stitch loops and snugging down with a knot. Trim the thread with a 3-inch tail on the inside of the glove. This will serve as a kind of antenna to help pick up electricity. Turn the glove right-side-out and you are smartphone-app ready. Now you can text your pal about the bruiser buck headed his way. The one you could have shot had you not been playing Fruit Ninja."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"11 FIX MISBEHAVING ZIPPERS When it comes to gear failure, temperamental zippers top the list of easy-to-fix issues. Problems with a $5 zipper can turn a $550 tent into a heap of useless nylon. Broken or stuck zippers are often easy to fix, though, and here’s how. CLEAN THE MACHINE If a zipper is just dirty and so gunked up the pull doesn’t want to slide, scrub with hot water and a toothbrush, then give a worn zipper some spa love with Gear Aid Zip Care. If you’re in the field, lubricate a zipper with a few strokes of a graphite pencil, bar soap, or a smear of lip balm. You’ll want to clean thoroughly once at home. DIY PULL TABS Replace broken or missing zipper pulls with a short loop of reflective tent guyline cord or old fly line. Use a double fisherman’s knot to provide a smooth, grippy connection. FIX SLIDER SLIPPAGE A loose slider fails to stitch a zipper’s teeth together. Fix with needle-nose pliers. Crimp each side of the slider very slightly, alternating between sides, and check after each round of crimping so you don’t overdo it. PREVENT TOOTH DECAY Sometimes an individual zipper tooth goes out of whack. Gently squeeze it back into formation with pliers. CLEAR THE PATH If you’ve wedged a wad of fabric between the zipper pull and the teeth, you’ll need to either tug the fabric gently from the zipper pull’s jaws, or move the zipper pull past the point where the fabric bunches up. A squirt of window cleaner can help. Test a small swatch of the fabric first to make sure the window cleaner doesn’t stain, then soak the zipper pull and fabric with window cleaner. It acts as a cleaner and lubricant that will make removing the fabric wad much easier."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"» THE ICON: SVEA 123 STOVE When it comes to backpacking stoves, the Svea 123 is the origin of the species. Strip away all the most modern elements from today’s cutting-edge stoves—the piezo-electronic ignitions, the adaptors for French press coffee makers, the USB ports that enable you to charge a phone while heating gruel—and this is what you’ll have: a tough, compact, light means of applying heat to a pot. You might expect that from a Swedish company known for building blowtorches. The Svea 123 hit the market in 1955, just as backpacking was hitting the American mainstream. At the time, of course, it was positively futuristic. The stove featured a pressurized naphtha fuel tank that could be preheated with a small amount of fuel, which meant the contraption would fire up in unholy cold. At full speed, it will boil a liter of water in 7 minutes, depending on altitude. Made of solid brass, with a minimum of moving parts, there was little to break. With an empty tank, the Svea 123 weighed only 18 ounces. It found a place beside external-frame backpacks, Goodyear-welt boots, and egg-grate foam pads as a tool revered by backpackers, alpinists, and even long-distance motorcycle riders. Happily, the Svea 123 is still a viable gear option. More modern versions come with a self-cleaning fuel needle, but otherwise, they are near-exact copies. Mine dates from the late 1960s, and I remember when my dad bought it at a sporting goods store where campstoves and lanterns shared shelf space with World War II patches, bullets, and German battle helmets. Pulling out the stove these days makes a statement, and I’m not referring to its retro lines. On high, or anywhere near it, the Svea 123 absolutely roars—like a jet takeoff roars. Subtle it is not, and it elicits a horror-stricken what the #@+*! is that ? double take from some modern-gear weenies. But it burns hot, it lights every time no matter the conditions, and you can drop this stove off a cliff and cook breakfast at the bottom."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"12 DIVVY UP KP Assigning kitchen duty is no fun at home, and it’s a drag at a hunting or fishing camp, too.

DEPLOY THE KNIFE TIP DOWN Many prefer a tip-down carry for safety reasons. If the blade were to open slightly in your pocket, a tip-down carry will help prevent an accident slicing of your fingertips. Assisted opening knives should be carried tip-down. To deploy, reach into your pocket with your thumb on the inside of the knife, two fingers on the outside at the clip position, and draw. As the knife comes out of your pocket, grasp the pivot point between thumb and forefinger, and use the middle finger to catch the edge of the pocket clip and rotate the handle slightly into your palm, keeping your thumb on the opening stud or hole. You’re ready to open the knife. DEPLOY THE KNIFE TIP UP The tip-up position allows for very rapid deployment of flipper knives. To deploy from tip-up, reach into the pocket and slide your thumb down the handle almost to the pivot point, with other fingers on the clip side of the handle. One slick modification for tip-up knives, such as many Spyderco knives with opening holes, is to use a zip tie to create a quick opening feature. Insert a small zip tie through the opening hole and cinch down tightly so that the protruding side of the zip tie is on the same side of the knife as the clip. Cut the tails off flush. (You might need two small zip ties to prevent each from wiggling around.) Now as you pull the knife from your pocket, pull back slightly so the zip ties catch on the back corner of the pocket seam, pulling the knife open. Practice the move and it can be impressively instantaneous."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"18 SWITCH UP A POCKET CLIP Many folding knives come with pocket clips that can be placed on either side of the handle, either tip-up or tip-down. Where and how you carry a knife is personal preference, but keeping a clip tightly screwed in place is critical. Many clips are attached with the 6-sided star screws called Torx screws. Designed to prevent cam-out, Torx screws can be screwed down very tightly, but you’ll have to have the proper size of Torx bit for the job. Add a tiny drop of blue Loctite, which is a medium strength threadlocker that will prevent clip screws from loosening."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"19 REMEMBER FOUR KNIFE NEVERS Keep these tips in mind, and your favorite blade will last as long as you do—or even longer. NEVER store a knife in a leather sheath; it can cause rusting or discoloration. NEVER use water to clean a horn handle. Horn absorbs moisture and can splinter. NEVER use hot water to clean a wood handle. If the wood is cracked or dried, rub it with olive oil. NEVER touch the blade or metal parts after oiling. This can leave behind salt and acids, which can cause oxidation."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"20 CHOOSE A KID’S FIRST KNIFE How old is old enough for a knife? Some will consider it heresy, but I used a rotary tool to grind the blade on a Swiss Army knife down to butter-knife dull, and let my 5-year- olds putter around camp with it at will. That sparked plenty of early conversations about knife safety and has paid off now that they are teenagers. General-purpose folders will whittle a stick, clean a panfish, and help take the hide off a deer. While shopping, look for features that make certain designs safer for smaller hands, and don’t drop a pile of cash on a kid’s knife. For ages 10 and younger, look for a locking main blade. Some newer models of Swiss Army knives have been updated with locks, and they still have all the cool stuff— tweezers, toothpick, screwdrivers —with an ergonomic handle for an even surer grip. For kids 11 to 13, blades shorter than 3 inches are still stout enough to cut through a squirrel. Look for jimping at the base of the blade spine to help provide control, and find a knife with a fat handle that will fit smaller hands well. I like indentations deep enough to serve as a finger guard. For those 14 and older, flipper opening mechanisms create a nifty blade guard when the knife is open. Older kids will also appreciate a backup locking mechanism for an added measure of safety."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"21 RE-WATERPROOF YOUR RAIN SHELL Rain should roll off your shell in beads. If it doesn’t, you need to restore the fabric’s DWR, or durable water repellent, finish. Otherwise the outer fabric will “wet out” and prevent sweat vapor from passing through.

If not, iron the garment with a warm iron. Heat redistributes the DWR coating throughout the fabric. Still wetting through? Apply a new coating of spray-on DWR.

Plenty. Just ignore the stares of other shoppers, and think twice about buying from a store that won’t let you put their products through the ringer. SLEEPING BAG Roll the bag out on the floor, and climb in. Sit up and try to touch your toes. If you bind, opt for a longer size. Next, lie back down. Zip the bag open and closed three times from the inside, and three times from the outside. If the zipper hangs up, keep looking. BOOTS Shop in the late afternoon, when your feet are swollen. Wear the sock combination you prefer in the field. Lean forward and slide your index finger between heel and boot. There shouldn’t be more than a ½-inch gap. Next, kick the wall. If your toes hit the front of the boot, keep shopping. FLY ROD Wiggling a rod won’t tell you much, so walk into the store with a reel loaded with your favorite line, with leader attached, and a few flies with the hook points snipped off. Ask if you can try a few casts in the parking lot, on a nearby lawn, or off the loading dock out back. They’ll let you. BACKPACK Load it with a volume similar to a typical day’s worth of hunting gear, stuff one more spare vest inside, and sling it on.

These devices are slow and require some pretty serious muscle power, but they will get you out of a bad spot when there’s no one else around. Before you start, tick off a few safety items. Make sure the come-along is adequate for the pulling load. Wear leather work gloves and safety glasses. STEP 1 Attach the stationary hook—the one affixed to the come-along frame—to a fixed object such as a tree or vehicle that will handle the load of the pulling operation. Release the drum safety lever and pull out the cable. Always retain at least 2 full cable wraps on the drum. STEP 2 Connect the pulling hook to the load. It’s best to use some type of attachment —a chain, eyebolt, or sling—to provide a secure connection between the hook and the load. STEP 3 Engage the drive pawl with the drum ratchet. Make sure the ratchet lock is engaged before you begin to crank on the come-along. STEP 4 Pump the handle back and forth in order to wind cable onto the drum.

Many mornings I greeted a gorgeous dawn sleep-deprived and grouchy. Then I figured out the system for the best summer night’s sleep ever.

While everyone else fought with snoring tentmates and fitful sleep close to the festivities, I tucked my selfish little shelter into some leafy nook half a football field away. Nite-nite, suckers. Here’s my setup. I like tents with a body made almost entirely of mesh to hold summer bugs at bay but let summer breezes right in. Since I’m a big tosser and turner, I like a sleeping bag with an integrated sleeping pad. They’re so sturdy even a sumo wrestler could not push me off the pad.

They do not. They spray an oily, foamy matrix of thiols and thioacetates such as bifurtryphenoliate that smells every bit as bad as you’ve heard. All carnivores have scent glands and ducts, but only the skunks have evolved overly enlarged scent glands attached to an aimable nipple tucked near the rectum and manipulated by a group of highly controllable muscles. (And you thought they just stank.) That nipple works in two modes. A skunk can send out an atomized burst of redolent mist that covers a relatively large area, or the animal can employ what famed skunk researcher Jerry Dragoo (he was born with very little sense of smell) calls “the .357 magnum tactic”: one compact stream of stink juice. A skunk’s funk is accurate to 10 feet out and ballistically viable for another 15 more. And they have plenty of time to practice. Baby skunks arrive with chambered rounds and can spray the stuff before their infant eyes open. Happily, skunks don’t open fire willy-nilly but engage in highly ritualistic behaviors prior to the main event. Stumble up on one and it might stomp its feet. It might bluff charge. Or stand up and hiss. You’ve been warned. If all that—plus the fact that it is, after all, a skunk—doesn’t convince you to hit the dirt, the skunk will likely spin around, raise its tail (or not) and open fire. If you’re hit, you will quickly find out who your good friends are, and it’s a good bet you won’t have many. Deskunkifying will be a lonely task. Begin by bathing with a solution of one pint hydrogen peroxide, ¼ cup baking soda, and a teaspoon of dishwashing liquid. Lather, rinse, repeat. Again and again, most likely. If you’re close to civilization, try a commercial application such as Nature’s Miracle Skunk Odor Remover. During this process, try to ponder what an impressive creature the skunk is—an efficient predator, beautiful to behold, and packing one evil olfactory boot knife.

Dunn says a dog with a dozen or so quills stuck in the nose, chin, or lips is a DIY job: Drape a towel over the dog’s eyes and grasp the quills firmly with pliers. “A lot of the time the dog feels that sensation and instinctively backs away,” Dunn reports. “The quills will pop out almost on their own, and you can get 2 or 3 at a time.” Spread the pain over an hour or two if needed, giving the dog a break, a walk, and a dose of tasty treats in between treatments. For hounds pin-cushioned with more quills, or quills embedded in the mouth, tongue, or near the eyes, the dog needs a veterinarian and anesthesia.

Loaded like a standard backpack, there’s still room for tackle bags and vests, daypacks, maps, and all the other crap that winds up strewn from bow to stern.

Remove the materials and repeat until you’ve gotten as much moisture out as possible. STEP 2 Heat rocks in boiling water or near the fire, then carefully place in spare socks or a bandana. Test the stones for 10 seconds to make sure they don’t scorch the material, then fill up the boot. Or pour boiling water into water bottles or smaller spice bottles. Tuck the smaller bottles into the boot foot, and stand a full-sized water bottle in the shank. STEP 3 While your boots are cooking, work on the insoles. Press them between spare clothing, paper towels or dried grasses, and squeeze hard to express water. Toss them in the bottom of your sleeping bag for the final overnight finish. STEP 4 If you can’t resist the temptation to prop boots and insoles by the fire, go easy. Fire-baked leather will crack and synthetic material can melt. Insoles can harden in the heat without much of a visual warning. If you can’t press your hand to the warmed boot and leave it there, move it back from the fire."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"42 KEEP GEAR DRY There are lots of reasons to store camp foods in vacuum bags. Cuts of meat and poultry lie more or less flat, so they take up less room in a cooler. Vacuum bags don’t permit food smells to permeate. And vacuum bags are watertight, so it’s no big deal if your sealed-tight cheese goes swimming in the cooler slop. But don’t stop with the cold cuts. Use vacuum bags to keep these items dry, handy, and safely stored in duffels and day packs. • Strike-anywhere matches • Spare ammunition • Change of thermal underwear and socks • Maps • Batteries • Hunting and fishing licenses • Toilet paper • Trail snacks • Items you don’t want to rattle while hunting on the move (spare game calls, compasses, survival items)"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"43 MAKE A BACKWOODS ENERGY DRINK Smooth and staghorn sumac are found across most of eastern America, and the tall clusters of red berries produce a tart drink—like Kool-Aid gone wild. Look for the shrubby trees in open sun; the upright berry clusters are on the tips of leafy branches. (Stay away from poison sumac. It prefers wet, boggy soils, and the white to pale green berries hang down like grape clusters.) Sumac-Aid is best made with summer berries that are fully ripened, but before heavy rains dilute their potency. STEP 1 Collect six to eight clusters—called panicles—of sumac berries. Examine closely for spiders and bugs. STEP 2 Place the panicles in a pitcher and add ½ gallon of cold water. Wash your hands, then reach in the pitcher and agitate the berries to rub off the red coverings that contain most of the flavoring.

Start by cutting one end off the oranges and hollowing out the pulp, all the way down to the white pith on the insides of the peels. Add a bit of fresh-squeezed orange juice to prepared brownie mix, and spoon the batter into the orange peels until three- quarters full. Place the orange top back on and wrap with two layers of heavy-duty foil.

While ATVs are trail-worthy right off the factory floor, you can take your machine’s performance up several notches with shade-tree mechanic skills and a modest cash investment. “If you can change the oil in your truck, you can handle most of this,” says Rick Sosebee, an off-road guru and the ATV blogger on fieldandstream.com . Here are Sosebee’s five ATV upgrades that will boost your machine’s mud-eating potential in half-a-day’s work. PULL HARD You’re going to get stuck. Be prepared with a winch whose pulling power is rated at least twice the weight of your machine. That way you’ll have plenty of reserve for uphill tugs. Make sure the components are sealed for a waterproof unit; water resistant is not good enough. GEAR UP Recalibrate the CVT (continuously variable transmission) with an upgrade kit. “This changes the engagement of the transmission so the motor ramps up into a higher power range before engaging the drive,” Sosebee says. The result: less spin, more get up and go-through-the-muck. Many kits are available with the tools required. It’s a three-hour job, give or take, and any hobbyist grease monkey could pull it off. DO TREAD ON THESE Upgrade to a mud tire. Look for a lug at least 1 inch deep and in an open pattern with plenty of spacing between the lugs. Sosebee particularly likes a broken-chevron pattern, in which the two sides of a V come in from the right and left and cross at the centerline of the tire. STOP GAPS To keep grime out of differentials, extend a hose from the differential vent up to the steering bracket. You can cap it with an inexpensive fuel filter to double the protection. While you’re at it, remove CVT covers and run a ¼-inch bead of silicone around the rims, then replace. It’s a snap. “If you can caulk cracks around your house to keep air from coming in,” Sosebee says, “you can caulk CVT covers to keep water out.” GET A GRIP Many factory grips are too smooth for real mud work. Look for a honeycomb pattern that will shed muck and water just like a mud tire."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"48 BUCK A LOG WITH AN AXE You round a trail corner and groan: A fallen tree blocks the path. Your buddy’s default response is to stomp to the back of the truck, pull out the chain saw, check the tension, futz around for fuel, find ear plugs, and look for safety glasses. By the time he walks back to the log, you have bucked the tree into pieces with little more than an axe and attitude. Smirking follows. Bucking a log this way is not a beginner skill. It’s best to have experience with an axe and to wear protective clothing. Stand on top of the log and chop a V-notch into the side, between your feet, using a six-stroke count: Make three swings angling in from the right—the first one high on the log, then low, and then in the middle. Next, repeat with swings angling in from the left—high, low, and middle. On that sixth and final stroke, flick your wrist slightly outward—an inch will do—the instant the bit bites wood. This will help toss the chips out of the notch and prevent the axe from sticking. Cut halfway through one side of the log, then turn around and chop another V-notch through the other side. Plan the Vs so the tips of the two notches are slightly offset. This prevents the final stroke from over-traveling and sending the axe bit between your legs and the handle into your nuts at warp factor 9."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"49 SPLIT CAMP WOOD WITH A TIRE Old tires piled up in the garage? Don’t think of them as eyesores. Those are handy wood-splitting devices that can save you time and trips to the chiropractor. Stack spare tires on top or around a chopping block, and those worn-out Goodyears hold wood rounds in place while you work axe magic. You can load the tire with multiple smaller pieces to split, or one large round to work into quarters. The wood stays inside the tire, so you can split smaller and smaller pieces without having to bend over and pick them up each time the axe falls. When the wood splits cleanly, the tire helps keep your axe from biting deeply into the block. Miss the round entirely—hey, it happens—and the tire catches the errant edge and guards your legs against a horrific gash. There are a couple of variations, depending on the size of your chopping block. Just remember to drill holes or cut drainage slits into the lower sidewalls of the tires so they won’t collect rainwater for breeding mosquitoes. For larger chopping blocks (A), use a single tire. To hold the tire in place, use a heavy knife to create tabs along the sidewall on the side of the tire facing the ground. Cut through the rim bead and a couple of inches into the sidewall, depending on the diameter of your block. Slide the tire onto the top of the block, tabs facing the ground, leaving plenty of tire above the block surface to hold up the wood rounds. Nail these tabs into the side of the chopping block. Use a smaller block (B) that will fit completely inside spare tires, and stack four tires with the block in the middle. The top tire needs to extend above the chopping block surface. Tie the tires together with parachute cord. This arrangement provides stability to smaller splitting blocks."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"50 HAUL FIREWOOD WITH A WEB STRAP To make a handy wood hauler, take a broken 1-inch ratchet strap, cut off the end with the hook, and tie a loop at that end.

These small pits also excel in windy conditions and consume less wood while burning hotter than open fires. Plus, the layout provides a great platform for cooking. Here’s how to channel your inner Sioux. The fire hole works by sucking fresh air into the combustion chamber. Hot air rises from the hole, drawing air through the air vent and into the base of the fire. The cycle is self-sustaining, and digging the air vent on the upwind side of the fire hole helps capture the breeze like the air scoop on the Bandit’s Trans Am. Dig the fire chamber first. Excavate a pit 1 foot in diameter and 1 foot deep. Now widen the base of the chamber a few inches so it has a jug-like shape. This lets you burn slightly larger pieces of wood. Dig the air tunnel next. Start about a foot away from the edge of the fire hole, on the upwind side, and carve out a mole-like tunnel 5 or 6 inches in diameter, angling down to the base of the fire chamber. That’s it. Top the fire hole with a grate or green saplings to hold a pot over the flames. When you break camp, refill the holes and leave no trace."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"53 BURN YOUR GEAR INTO A HOT INFERNO Marshmallows make awesome firestarters.

It’s a bit of a pyro mash up. The outside is a log cabin fire built of slow-burning green wood, inside of which burns a teepee fire that throws out tall flames to light your way. SHELL CONSTRUCTION First, build the outer shell of a log cabin fire. Start with two 6-inch-diameter logs about 24 inches long, and build a log cabin fire of 2 logs for each of 4 “stories,” using smaller logs as you go up. Choose whole green logs or branches of a slow-burning wood that won’t throw a lot of sparks, such as white oak, ash, birch, or ironwood. Keep these structural logs whole. Split wood burns more quickly, and you want this to burn very slowly. The log-cabin walls will hold the sticks of the teepee fire upright, and that’s the next step. STOKE THE FURNACE Inside the log cabin structure, build a teepee fire of dry sticks, branches, and split woods. Break some of these pieces into lengths 6 inches taller than the log cabin structure. When burning, they’ll produce tall flames that give out plenty of light. TURN ON THE LIGHT Inside the teepee, lay your tinder bundle and light it. Now use wood as a mood-setting dimmer switch: Feed the teepee fire from the top as the flames consume the wood. If the log cabin walls start to burn too quickly, dose with water to knock back the flames."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"56 KNOW YOUR AXES & HATCHETS At the turn of the 19th century, more than 200 different axe-head patterns were being manufactured in America. In 1925, long after the crosscut saw had largely replaced the axe as an industrial grade tree-feller, True Temper Kelly still offered no less than 28 axe head patterns. The choices are more limited today, but being able to swing an axe —or deftly work a hatchet—remains a core skill of the American outdoorsman. Here’s what you need to know to match the edged tool for the woodsy job. HEAD CASES: FIVE DESIGNS TO KNOW FELLING AXE The classic American axe design, the felling axe evolved into dozens of regional variations such as the Dayton and Jersey axe. The thin, sharp bits excel at tasks that require cross-grain cutting, such as felling trees and removing limbs, but they are not the best choice for splitting wood."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" BROADAX Designed to shape squared-off corners for timbers and railroad ties, or rounded poles for masts, the broadax was a fundamental tool in American history. HUDSON’S BAY With a smaller handle and head, the Hudson’s Bay design was favored by fur traders traveling long distances by canoe. Hefty enough to work through medium-size logs, it’s light enough for limbing. Choking up on the slightly elongated beard increases control when shaping wood. PULASKI Mostly used by firefighters and trail construction crews, the Pulaski boasts a traditional cutting bit on one side and a grubbing adze on the other. SPLITTING MAUL The wedge-shaped head splits wood apart along the grain. A poor choice for anything else, splitting mauls are unsurpassed for chopping log rounds into fireplace-ready fuel. Small splitting hatchets bridge the gap between mauls and standard bits and excel around the campsite."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"57 NAME THOSE PARTS HEAD The shape of an axe or hatchet head defines its primary use: cutting or splitting. POLL An extended poll helps balance the tool, but only hardened polls are designed for hammering. Hammer with an unhardened poll and you risk mushrooming the head. BIT General term for the cutting portion of the axe or hatchet head. BEARD A downward extension of the bit, common on tools designed for shaping wood, such as carpenter’s axes and broadaxes. The beard allows the user to choke up the handle to control shaving. CHEEK Lies between the bit and the poll. TOE Upper corner of the bit. HEEL Lower corner of the bit. EYE The hole in the head where the handle is fitted. LUG OR LIP Metal protrusion gives more wood to metal contact and helps secure head to handle. BELLY The long midsection of the handle, or haft. THROAT The sweep of handle towards the grip. KNOB OR SWELL KNOB Prevents handle from slipping from sweaty hands."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"58 CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON BIT BY BIT The bit profile is the most important aspect of performance. A thin cutting profile works well when limbing felled trees or cutting campfire wood. A more wedge- shaped profile excels in splitting log rounds. CONSIDER THE CURVE A pronounced curve in the bit lessens bit-to-wood contact, allowing for deeper cuts. A flat bit cuts more evenly, but not as deeply. GET A HANDLE ON IT Proponents of curved handles consider them more efficient and easier on the hands. Straight-handle fans point out the strength inherent in wood grain running the length of the handle. Both camps claim greater accuracy. The best choice is the one that feels best in your hands. SINGLE OR DOUBLE? A double-bit axe can serve double duty. One blade is sharpened to a narrow felling edge for taking down trees. The other is ground to a more blunt edge for working through knots and cutting trees on the ground. The single- bit axe or hatchet has other advantages. The poll can be hardened for hammering, but even an unhardened poll can be pounded with a wood baton to boost the cutting power of hatchet-sized bits."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"59 SHARPEN A MACHETE For lane clearing, you’ll want a 25- to 35-degree angle on a machete blade. Anything finer will roll and chip with heavy chopping. Clamp the blade in a vise, edge up, tip pointed toward you. Use a 12-inch bastard mill file, and wear heavy leather work gloves. Push the file into the blade at the proper angle: two 15-degree bevels create a 30-degree blade angle. With a correct angle on one side, turn the machete around and repeat. Finish the edge with a sharpening puck, which you’ll carry into the field for touch-ups."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"60 FINISH A BLADE WITH A LEATHER STROP Using a leather strop to hone a blade to a whisker-shaving edge isn’t just for small- town barbers. This final stage in the sharpening process removes the tiny burrs, nicks, and microscopic rolled edges left by even the finest-grit stones. To polish a knife edge with a leather strop, the knife must be quite keen in the first place. Then it’s a simple matter of taking the edge to atom-splitting sharpness. You can use a leather belt, but better results come from a bench strop, which is honing leather mounted to a block of wood. Charge the strop with a thin film of honing compound made from either chromium oxide or diamond paste. Chromium oxide is a favorite of many, but if the blade is made of the newer, harder stainless steels, diamond paste may be required. Lay the knife on the leather nearly flat. Draw the edge backwards along the leather strop. The leather will conform to the profile of the knife edge. Start with very light pressure and increase if needed. Start with a dozen strokes to each side of the blade. Once the knife, is shaving-sharp, wipe the blade clean with a few drops of honing oil."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"61 SHARPEN AN AXE Before you begin, place your beat-up axe in a vise, with the head facing up. No vice? Use a stout C-clamp to secure it to the edge of a workbench with the edge just hanging over the table. Since you always push the file into the edge, never pulling it toward you, you’ll need heavy gloves. RESTORE THE PROFILE Hold the file and work it into the edge, maintaining the file at about 15 degrees. You want to work back into the axe head about 2 to 3 inches at the middle point of the bit, forming a clam-shaped effect on the cheek. When you can feel a burr on the backside of the blade, repeat the whole process on the other side. SHARPEN IT Put a primary bevel into the first bevel by filing again, this time at a 10- degree angle on both sides. Hone with a whetstone, coarse side, then the fine, moving a honing puck in small, circular motions."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"62 GIVE YOUR KNIFE A SPA TREATMENT Fixed-blades need only a quick wipe down with a damp cloth after each use and a light application of honing oil on the blade. Folders and multitools collect blood and dirt at pivot points and locking mechanisms. If the tool has a plastic handle, immerse it in boiling water for one minute, then put it in a pot of warm water (so that quick cooling doesn’t crack the handle). Scrub nooks and crannies with a toothbrush, working pivot points back and forth, then air-dry the knife before oiling. Use compressed air to blast out gunk. Wipe away surface rust with an oily cloth or 0000 steel wool. Carbon blades naturally discolor with use. Bring them back to near original luster by rubbing with a cork dipped in cold wood ashes."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"63 SHARPEN USING A SHARPIE When sharpening a knife (or axe or hatchet), it can be difficult to know for certain that you are maintaining the proper angle, and sharpening the exact edge and not the “shoulder” of the bevel. One way to tell is to “paint” the edge with a Sharpie or other marker. Look closely after each few strokes. If the ink is removed at the very edge of the knife, then you are sharpening the edge. If the ink comes off on the shoulder, leaving color on the edge, your angle is to shallow. If all the ink is being removed, you’re re-profiling the edge to match the original angle. It’s a great way to monitor your progress."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"64 PREPACK FOR CAMPING Organization wins the day.

Keep the third bin stocked with items you’ll need for camp and kitchen: a small bag of favorite spices, toilet paper and paper towels, camp soap, spare rope, first aid kit. Resist the temptation to raid the bins while you’re at home and down to your last paper towel. Now all you have to do is load the bins into the truck, and half your work is done. At camp, the empty bins serve as great dirty laundry hampers and dry storage for firewood until it’s time to pack up and head home.

The fabric itself is twice as thick as standard duct tape, with offset textile patterns that the manufacturer claims make it 145 percent stronger than duct tape 1.0. Its only shortcoming: Gorilla Tape doesn’t stretch. TENACIOUS TAPE Made from tough nylon tent fabric, this strong repair tape closes up rips in tents, tarps, sleeping bags, packs, and down jackets.

Available in a half-dozen colors, plus clear. RESCUE TAPE This self-fusing silicone tape chemically bonds to itself, creating an air- tight, waterproof seal almost instantly. It’s perfect for field fixes of leaky hydraulic and radiator hoses on outboards and ATV fuel and water lines. It insulates 8,000 volts per layer and stretches easily, so it’s a go-to tape for exposed metal connections and tool handle wraps. TREAD TAPE Made with a textured, rubberized finish for ladder treads and outdoor steps, tread tape comes in rolls and strips. Use it to wrap climbing stand rails for a better grip, provide extra purchase on the bottom of a boat, and for a slip-resistant upgrade to ladder stand steps. Wrap handgun pistol grips and bow grips for a firm hold during warm weather seasons. SINGLE-SIDED AUTOMOTIVE FOAM TAPE Cheap and easy to find, foam tape will soundproof climbing stands and metal shooting rails and protect rods from rubbing against boat seats and casting decks.

Lines 15 to 20 feet long work well, and use rope hefty enough that it is comfortable to pull. Never attach painter lines to handles, thwarts, or deck plates. You can pull them off under heavy loads. Instead, drill a hole through the hull 2 inches below the gunwales at bow and stern, and tie the lines with a bowline looped through the holes. To keep the lines out of the way, tuck coiled lines under a short length of bungee cord attached to holes drilled 6 inches apart through the deck plates.

MY TOOL: THE CANOE BARREL I’m a sucker for classic camping gear, from Duluth packs to Opinel knives to paper topographic maps. They have patina and class and hard-won authenticity. None of this can be said of my most recent camping gear love: the canoe barrel. These hard-plastic containers are the best solution I’ve come across for packing food, cookware, and stoves for camping trips, whether I’m off for a week in a canoe or a weekend 20 feet from the truck tailgate. They are entirely waterproof, and tough enough to survive a swim through a Class V rapid. You can check them on an airplane. They make a nifty camp chair. The top doubles as a cutting and fish-cleaning board. Bread goes uncrushed for eternity. I can fit 10 days’ of grub in a 60-liter canoe barrel, and still have room for the stove. They’re not bear-proof by any means, but I’ve yet to meet the raccoon that can get inside one. They are ugly, available in a single shade of blue that is unknown in nature. But they bury the needle when it comes to usefulness. Canoe barrels are the modern replacement for one of the most cherished pieces of canoe-tripping gear, the wanigan. Woven of ash or crafted of wood panels, wanigans were handed down from generation to generation. The very word wanigan is a honeyed term that comes from the Ojibway wa·nikka·n, meaning a pit in the ground for storage. The canoe barrel is freighted with neither heritage nor charm. According to Kevin “The Happy Camper” Callan, one of Canada’s most authoritative canoe trekkers, the canoe pack barrel has only been around since the 1980s, when a group of Ottawa canoe guides were casting about for better ways to protect food on long trips. They picked up a few old olive barrels from delicatessens and yard sales, and the rest is a story of function over form. I ordered my canoe barrel from Recreational Barrel Works, of Peterborough, Ontario.

All morning long, stocker trout had snubbed our dough baits, following them through slow riffles, eyeing them warily in the pools, but simply refusing to eat. We were stumped, but not yet beaten. It seemed that we needed some kind of hack for the lowly ball of scented dough, some trigger to turn the trout’s obvious interest into a committed bite. The Puffball was Lysne’s idea—I’ll give him full credit—but it fell to me to field-engineer the innovation. Our solution was to fasten a pea-sized glob of fluorescent orange PowerBait to a tiny #16 treble hook. Next, we smeared the glob with a skim of Secret Bait, a dough-and-glitter conglomeration made by some Ozark hillbilly and sold in every trout park for miles around. A split shot and split-second timing were the only other ingredients. To work the Puffball’s magic, I’d cast it downstream and watch the drift until a trout eyeballed the mutant wad but refused to eat. That’s when I’d snap the rod tip, telegraphing a pulse of energy down the line, which jerked the Puffball just enough to release a brown smudge of atomized Secret Bait into the stream. Intrigued by the piquant fog, the fish would then spot the orange PowerBait emerging from the mist. It would be like waking up from a dream about Thanksgiving dinner to find a ham biscuit on your pillow. The wiliest trout couldn’t resist. Unorthodox? You betcha. But jerry-rigging a doughball is just par for the course for the avid angler. Fishing seems to bring out the shade-tree design engineer in outdoorsmen. With fishing, the margin between success and failure is often tippet-thin —and dependant on an angler’s ability to innovate, modify, and adjust gear to specific conditions. Trim a spinnerbait’s rubber skirt by a half-inch and you might double your rate of hook-ups. Upgrade a baitcaster’s gears and you can rip lunker bass from the thickest weeds. Make your own fly rod and you can save hundreds of dollars. And most fishing gear tweaks and hacks are cheap and easy. In fact, a lot of the tricks in this book require little more than odds and ends you likely have in your basement or garage right now.

That’s so much of the fun of fishing—figuring out how to use what’s close at hand to better your odds at catching fish. After all, it’s not enough to know where the fish are. It’s not enough to be able to make the perfect cast or tie a gorgeous fly. You have to put a hook in the fish. You have to convince your quarry to eat whatever you’ve tied to the end of your line. Sometimes that’s easy. Sometimes that’s nearly impossible. You never know until you’ve done everything you can to stack the deck in your favor. I learned that lesson down on Florida’s Suwannee River, in a tip you can read about in this chapter. Sometimes the smallest tweaks can make a huge difference. During the spring spawn, the male redbreast sunfish, known in the South as a “robin,” is a riot of crimson, green, and blue colors. Fishing for redbreast is a tradition so steeped in Southern culture that it’s the subject of local festivals and highbrow doctoral dissertations. Jim Greek and Billy Cason, however, were less concerned about the robin’s role in the fabric of rural experience than in how to entice one onto a hook. When I ran across this pair of anglers, they were each 64 years old and had forged a deep friendship based on a love of bream fishing. Thirteen years earlier, Cason was running a backhoe on his peanut farm when Greek, his neighbor-through-the-woods, dropped by to ask if he might have time to push dirt over his trash heap. Cason was there within 30 minutes. A couple of days later, they went fishing together for the first time. Ever since, they’ve fished two or three days a week. Every week. These boys know how to catch a robin, and they were happy to share their secrets. “I think a worm’s about the sorriest bait there is, at least for river fish,” Greek told"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"me matter- of-factly, as he threaded a cricket on a hook.

Each one was hacked very specifically. I won’t tell you how, not right here. Just turn to item #151 for the details. But I’ll tell you this. Their change resulted in a cooler slam-full of robin, and a riverside fish fry I’ll never forget. “It makes the line slide through the cork easier,” Greek explained about their tweak. “It don’t get hung up as bad, and drifts deeper.

Here are a few. HANG YOUR HEAD Make a wacky-rigged worm or Senko even wackier by putting a small finishing nail into the head of the bait. The soft plastic will flail more erratically. MAKE A BACKDROP Push a nail into a soft-plastic shad’s back just ahead of the tail and run a plain hook through the nose. The lure will drop back when you pause the retrieve.

With a careful trim, your lures can take on new life. MAKE A MINISKIRT One solution to bass tapping at your spinnerbait without connecting is to add a trailer hook. That’s fine for open water but can result in more snags around any structure. Instead, trim the skirt so it hangs evenly with the hook bend. SHAVE YOUR LEGS Sometimes bass grab the skirt legs of a hollow-body frog lure and miss the hook. Trimming legs back even ½ inch can reduce short strikes and actually give frogs a smoother side-to-side glide when “walking the dog.” TAKE A BACK SEAT How many times have you reeled up a curly-tailed grub with no tail? Solve this by cutting away a portion of the front so the hook sits just in front of the tail. Cut back a soft-plastic shad for the same hook placement."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"76 MAKE A WOODEN DOWEL POPPER Making custom diving lures is a challenge. Lips, weights, balance, and buoyancy all factor in to getting one to swim properly. But making a popper is cheap and easy. All you need is a wooden dowel, some screw-in eyelets, hooks, split rings, and some simple tools, like a drill and sandpaper. Cut the dowel to your desired length, taper one end of the cut piece with the sandpaper, drill out the mouth with a large bit, and screw an eyelet into the tail, the belly, and the mouth. How you decorate the popper is up to you, but it will float and it will pop, and you need not be an engineer to get it right."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"77 AVOID TREBLE I recently spent half an hour un-trebling a trio of snarled plugs and—more than once— I’ve had to extract trebles from human flesh. And they can rip fish mouths to pieces. If you’re fishing with kids, especially, replace treble hooks. Most spinner hooks aren’t attached with a split ring, so use side-cutting wire snips to remove the trebles. If the hook eye is particularly stout, clip it in two places to create a gap, and slip it off the body wire. Replace with open-eye hooks. Before replacing trebles, evaluate the track of topwater and diving lures so you can compare their performance with single hooks. Most will do fine. For many largemouth baits, replace the hooks with some 1/0 or 2/0 ringed live-bait hooks. Remove the belly treble entirely, or just replace it with a ringed live-bait hook with its point facing forward. The point on your trailing hook should face up."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"78 MAKE A CUSTOM FLY ROD Working just an hour or two a night, you can build a fly rod in less than a week, and fish with your handmade custom beauty for the rest of your life. Rod kits contain all the components and instructions, and you can use rod blanks that vary from basic to cutting-edge. SEAT THE REEL Find the hood recess at the base of the handle. You’ll probably need to enlarge it slightly to fit the reel seat hood. A rotary tool works well. Set the handle aside. Use 1/2-inch-wide masking tape to create two bushings under the place where you’ll glue the reel seat, just thick enough so that the reel seat fits snugly over the bushings. Spread waterproof two-part epoxy over these bushings, then slowly slide the reel seat into place. As you slide the reel seat down, fill all gaps with epoxy. Attach the butt cap with epoxy. TOP IT OFF Use epoxy to glue the tip top in place. HANDLE IT The rod channel needs to be custom fitted to your blank, so use a tapered rat-tail file to create a good fit. Go easy and check the fit frequently. You should have to use gentle pressure to fit the handle into place. Once you have it right, prepare the blank by gently sanding under the handle with 200-grit sandpaper. Spread more epoxy at the location of the handle, and slide the cork into place. If your kit has a winding check, glue it into place now."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"GET GUIDANCE Taper the end of each guide foot with a fine-metal file. Rod-building kits will come with a spacing chart. Hold guides in place with thin strips of masking tape. For a consistent width, mark up a business card with the desired width of the wrap, and use it as a template to mark the beginning and ending points of each guide wrap with a grease pencil. Begin by wrapping the rod blank with a half-dozen tight wraps over the tag end of the thread. Snip off the tag and continue. As you spin the rod, angle the thread from the spool slightly so that each wrap is snug against the previous one. To finish a guide wrap, stop when the wrap is 1/8 inch shorter than the planned finished length. Form a loop of monofilament with an overhand knot, pinch it so that the closed end is narrowed, and place this closed end on top of the wraps so that the pinched end sticks out just a bit. Wrap over this loop to the end of your wrap marks and cut the winding thread with a 3-inch tail. Thread this through the exposed end of the loop, then pull back toward the wrap. This will pull the loop and the tag end under the wraps. Trim the excess with an X-Acto knife. To hold the rod in place and provide thread tension while wrapping the guides, make a rod wrapper: Cut notches in a cardboard box to hold the rod blank horizontal. Run thread under a book and through a small hole punched through the box. Last, wrap the female end of the ferrule with a 3/4-inch wrap to give it added strength. Apply rod finish to all the windings. To prevent the finish from running, support the rod in a horizontal position and rotate 90 degrees every minute for 15 minutes."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"79 MARK FLY LINES I had wads and wads of mystery fly lines until I started marking each new fly line with a permanent marker: eight tiny little hatch-marks at the end of the fly line for an 8- weight, seven hatch-marks for a 7-weight, etc. Simplified my life and saved money."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"80 FLOAT A LINE WITH AN EARPLUG For a cheap yet effective bobber for light-tackle fishing, use a foam earplug.

It’s still a great tactic. Fishing with a greased leader suspends pupae and midges at predetermined depths and makes it easier to track the path of a fly by keeping an eye on the floating leader. But there’s a cost. A leader floating in the film is more visible to trout. Beware. Use a thick silicone paste, and smear the goo on your thumb and forefinger. Pinch the leader butt with these fingers, and pull the leader through. Stop a few inches farther from the end of the tippet than the depth you want to suspend the fly."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"82 DAMPEN LINE TWIST A big problem for spinning anglers, whether using live bait or lures, is dealing effectively with line twist. This can cause tangles or affect the action of a lure to the point where it won’t attract fish. Here’s how to keep the line running straight and true. STEP 1 Close the bail with your hand, not the reel handle. When you turn the handle, the spool also turns slightly before the bail snaps shut, which causes the line to twist. STEP 2 Set the drag properly. If the line slips too much while you’re playing a big fish, you’ll end up with line twist. STEP 3 Let the rod fight the fish. Spooling line under tension creates line twist. When you have a big fish on the line, raise the rod. Reel in line only while lowering the rod (when the line is no longer under tension)."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"83 SEE RED (OR NOT) There are line companies that sell red line because it’s supposed to disappear underwater, and lure companies selling red lures and hooks that they say make a lure look like a bleeding baitfish. Confused? Fish can see color and lots of different hues as it turns out. You get a thumbs-up, then, on adding crimson hooks and those cutting-edge realistic colors to your tacklebox —as long as you’re not fishing too deep. Here’s why: Red is produced by some of the longest wavelengths in the visible spectrum, and these longer wavelengths are the first to be absorbed by water. That means that the color red nearly disappears in water below, say, 12 or 15 feet. Next to go are oranges, yellows, and greens. Which is where those red lines are a factor. The deeper you go, the less distinguishable red objects will appear. If you want to fish with red line in shallower water, use a fluorocarbon leader."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"84 KNOW YOUR CANOE The right canoe is the one that can handle the conditions you’ll most likely encounter and haul your stuff while allowing you to cast, plunge over a 3-foot ledge, or stay straight out on open water. Here’s a guide to features to consider in a fishing canoe. GUNWALES The top rails of a canoe, which provide support and rigidity. BOW FLARE The outward-sloping sides at the bow of the canoe. Will turn away chop for a drier ride—good for big expanses of whitewater. TUMBLEHOME The inward slope of the side as it approaches the gunwale. This helps keep your hands closer to the gunwale as you paddle more easily. HULL STYLE A canoe with a traditional style is built with a stern and bow that are similarly shaped, tapering to points at each end. An asymmetric hull is more pointed at the bow than at the stern, which lets the canoe glide more efficiently. ROCKER A lift of the canoe bottom at the bow and stern. Rockered boats turn more easily. HULL MATERIAL Forget aluminum. For a tough, sturdy, maintenance-free craft, there are two choices: cheaper (and heavier and also more susceptible to sun damage) rotomolded polyethylene or the old proven Royalex laminate. If you want to get to where you want to be fast, and there are no rocks in the way, consider a fiberglass hull or a more modern composite such as those including Kevlar. These are the lightest canoes ever made—a 16-footer can tip the scales at less than 45 pounds—but they are expensive. BEAM The boat's maximum width. THE BOTTOM LINE If you’re canoeing out in quiet waters, beamy, rockerless boats are stable enough so you can stand up and cast, and they swallow minnow buckets, tackleboxes, spare rods, and a couple of kids with ease. Crank up the paddling conditions, however, and you’ll need more technical goodies. For big-lake fishing with wind and waves, a deeper bow and a more pronounced bow flare will turn away wind-blown chop. If getting to big fish requires finessing through Class III whitewater, you’ll definitely want a boat with rocker and a good Royalex layup. No matter the water, a bit of tumblehome makes it easier to land fish over the side."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"85 PULL OFF A CHEAP CANOE-CAMP TRIP It’s late spring and the dogwoods have bloomed. The first quail chicks are in the nest. Nothing could be finer. The water is warm enough for a quick dip, the nights still cool enough for a fire. Every element of the natural world is begging with you, pleading with you: Put a paddle in your hand, now. You’re not going to find an easier getaway. In a three-day canoe-camping trip, you might spend 75 bucks if you really try. There’s a 90 percent chance that you’ll find a canoe-camping river within 20 miles of your garage, and it’s a good bet that the gear and food you need are in your gear closet and refrigerator right this very minute. KEEP IT SIMPLE Grab twenty bucks for gas (maybe $25 tops), another $10 for live bait from the gas station. Pack half the clothes you think you should, because you’ll only wear shorts. Bring two rods: a good spinning outfit and a 7-weight fly rod that’s light enough to make panfishing fun and heavy enough to handle a middling-size river monster. You’ll want simple lures that you can lose in heavy timber—in-line spinners are a good bet—and hooks and sinkers for live-bait rigs. River fish are willing, so pack half the food you think you’ll need, and eat what you catch. (Don’t scrimp on the frying pan, though. Bring the big one.) Pack a tarp and leave the tent. Stow an extra paddle. Drag live baits along the bottom of the deep scour holes you find on the outside of river bends, and fire those spinners at every blowdown, rock pile, and current seam you pass. SET ASIDE $40 FOR GROCERIES Make a list on the fingers of one hand. Eggs, bacon, oil, fish batter, and beer. Grab a loaf of bread from the cupboard and rake all the leftover lunch meat into a cooler. Fill some jugs with water. Leave a note for your spouse and food for the dog. Cut the grass so the neighbors won’t talk. Go now, right now, before the phone has a chance to ring. Pared down to the basics, every moment on a river is seasoned with the memory of the moment just before, and the promise of the next river bend, and the next cast, the next shooting star that streaks across the sky and brings a grin to your face when you think of your best wish ever: next weekend, spent just like this."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"86 MASTER THE BIMINI TWIST Tying the Bimini twist seems to be every angler’s nightmare—at least among those who haven’t tried it. Although it can look intimidating, it isn’t all that difficult. After 30 minutes of practice, you should be able to tie this important knot easily. The Bimini creates a doubled line ending in a loop. The doubled line can then be tied directly to a lure, swivel, or hook. Often, a Bimini is tied in a light running line or leader, and the loop is then tied to a heavier shock leader. That’s standard procedure in flyfishing for bigger fish like stripers, tarpon, marlin, and tuna. STEP 1 Start by doubling about 3 feet of line. Hold the tag end and standing line together in your left hand. Put your right hand into the loop at the end.

STEP 4 Now move your right hand (tag end of line) downward so the line is roughly perpendicular to the twists, and slightly relax the tension from your right hand. Maintain tension on the loop with your knees and on the standing line with your left hand. You’ll feel the tag end start to wrap itself around the twists. Keep loosening tension with only your right hand as the tag end wraps downward, over the twists and to the beginning of the loop over your knees. STEP 5 Anchor the resulting wraps by making a half hitch with the tag end wrapped around one side of the loop. Then make three half hitches around both loop strands, pulling the hitches up tightly against the base of the wraps.

Mix in carpenter’s glue in about a 50-50 ratio, and stir to create a thick paste. Next, pick out any loose shreds and pieces of cork in the grip’s damage zone, then pack in the cork paste.

A hoop that’s too big is not often an issue, but trying to catch a muskie in a net intended for bass is a recipe for heartache. GO LONG Having the extra reach that a long-handled net provides is definitely worth the effort when a big brown is thrashing on the surface. Having to reach too far out forces an angler to put more strain on the line in those last critical moments. It can also throw a net man off balance as he’s stretching out over the gunwale of a boat. SCOOP SMART If you’re wading in moving water, get downstream of the fish, then lift its head slightly out of the water while scooping at the same time. From a boat, you should always net a fish head first. The rod man should also make an effort to guide a fish’s head into the net that’s already submerged. Any misses or tail bumps can spook fish, causing them to surge and pull the hook or break the line."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"94 SKIN A CAT WITH YOUR TOOLBOX Back in your grandpa’s day, skinning a catfish meant nailing the sucker to a backyard pine tree and stripping the skin with pliers.

SCORE IT Place a 3-foot-long 2×6 board on a level, waist-high surface (a truck tailgate works well). Using a knife, score the skin all the way around the head, just in front of the cat’s gill plates. Make another slit down the length of the fish’s back. NAIL IT Drive a 16-penny nail through the fish’s skull in order to secure it to the board. Cut off its dorsal fin. Brace the board against your waist, with the tail pointing toward you. Grasp the skin with fish-skinning pliers or whatever is handy from the toolbox, and pull it down to the tail and off. GUT IT Remove the fish from the board. Grasping the head in one hand and the body in the other, bend the head sharply downward, breaking the spine. Now bend the body up and twist to separate head from body. Open the belly with your knife, remove the remaining viscera from the body cavity, and rinse thoroughly.

Even if the rod’s handle is tucked under your arm, the less it slips and moves, the more control you maintain. To increase that grip, try wrapping your handle hockey stick–style. Start with a spool of cloth stick tape; you’ll find it at sporting-goods stores. Make a few wraps around the butt of the rod, unwind about a foot of tape, and spin the spool to create a thin tape rope. Wrap that rope in inch-wide spirals around the handle toward the reel.

Companies like Boca Bearing and Big Green Fish produce custom ceramic and ceramic-metal hybrid reel bearings for many models that won’t corrode, are much lighter than stock metal bearings, and spin more freely than many factory bearings. Working on the guts of a round-profile baitcaster takes patience and focus (reading the manual helps), but new bearings can extend a reel’s life and can get a muskie spinner, striper plug, or a big chunk of catfish bait into distant honey holes much more frequently.

It’s about the size of the casting deck on a flats boat and will give you a sense of being out on the edge where the action happens. DOUBLE STACK Strip 50 feet of shooting line from the reel and stack it in large loose coils in front of your left foot (B). If you shoot that line now, it will be pulled from the bottom of the stack, all but guaranteeing an unrighteous tangle. You can avoid this problem, though: Grasp the line where it exits the reel in the crook of the pinky on your rod hand (C). Now, with your free hand, grab the fly line and pull all of it through your pinky, essentially re-stacking the line so it will shoot tangle-free. FIRE WHEN READY Pull 10 to 12 feet of the stacked line through the rod tip. Hold the fly at the bend of the hook in your reel hand (D) and point your rod tip up. This is the ready position. GET ON A ROLL Begin with an aggressive roll cast to load the rod, and let go of the fly as you snap the rod forward. Back-cast with a haul, then shoot the line with a forward cast with another haul. If you need some more distance, false cast one more time."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"102 GET A FLY TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS There was a time when my buddies and I set out to catch every fish possible on a fly rod. When the fish is an amberjack, skulking in 60 feet of water, that presents a difficulty. To sink the flies, we tied a small dropper line of light trout tippet from the hook bend in a big nasty fly to a 3-ounce surf sinker. We marked wrecks with the bottomfinder, then we dropped our weighted fly rigs overboard. When the sinkers hit bottom, we hauled hard on the lines to snap the mono, freeing the flies to flitter seductively in front of bottom-dwelling predators.

Getting that much lead out to the top of the pool without smacking yourself in the back of the noggin takes skill. Master the chuck-’n’-duck cast, and you’ll score more fish and suffer fewer welts. STEP 1 You have to avoid false casting, so start out by feeding line straight downstream with the rod tip held high to stop the weights from snagging on the bottom until you have enough length to reach the top of the hole you’re trying to fish.

The whippy tip makes it possible to toss light lures farther and with more accuracy than a shorter spinning rod. Likewise, the rod length allows you to fish into tight seams and eddies without casting at all. When a trout strikes, the longer, softer rod will let you maneuver it around rocks and overhanging limbs more delicately. Some steelhead anglers customize such outfits further by fitting fly rods with large gathering guides and spinning-reel seats; for small streams, those tweaks aren’t necessary. Ultralight or ice-fishing reels will fit the seats of most 3- to 5- weight fly rods. If you prefer a longer grip, tape your reel into place farther up on the rod’s handle."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"105 STROKE LIKE A PRO These four paddle strokes will get you there and back with efficient style, whether you are headed to fish camp or trying to line up the perfect cast.

Using small boats and canoes, anglers rig set lines to limbs overhanging the stream, then while away the hours working one line after another. For hunters and anglers camping on or near moving water, it’s a fine way to fill a frying pan while attending to camp chores or chasing other fish and game. To fish a bush hook, find a stout sapling or limb that extends over the water a few feet upstream of a desired fishing location. Your best bets are strong eddy lines, tributary outfalls, and any deep holes beneath undercut banks. To tie the bush hook, attach a three-way swivel to 30- to 50-pound monofilament line. Tie one dropper line to an egg sinker, and another to the hook. Tie the bush hook to the sapling or branch, load the hook with a bait that will hold up to strong current—cut bait, live shiners, shrimp—and drop it into the water. You’ll want to check it every couple of hours. And check your local laws. Some states consider bush hooks as commercial gear, and may require the use of a cotton line or other specifics.

Taking your fish photography to the next level will mean taking it underwater with a point-of-view camera like the GoPro. SLOW DOWN Use a lower frame rate, such as 24 frames per second. You’ll need the added boost in light gathering underwater, and this will also reduce visual “noise” in the video. If possible, choose the 4:3 format to take advantage of a slightly taller and wider frame. FIGHT FOG Some manufacturers offer antifog inserts, which work great. Another trick: Open up your camera’s housing and hold the camera near the car air conditioning vent for a few minutes before you get out of your vehicle. Then close up the camera, thus trapping the superdry air inside. CONTROL THE POLE Whether you’re in a boat or wading, dedicate a pole or stick for the camera. Net and gaff handles, broomsticks, and tree branches all work. A pole helps hold the camera steady, and enables you to get it into position for hero shots. Speaking of which ... MAKE LIKE HITCHCOCK Experiment with camera angles. With the camera on a pole, capture the trolling motor propeller or your wading boots moving along the stream bottom. Film a lure or fly as it’s worked through the water. Then take some time to dial in these two shots. Mount the camera to a fixed stake in the water, a few inches above the surface, back off, and cast toward the camera. With a dry fly, you can cast as close as you want to get, or plop the fly slightly upstream and let it drift into the shot. With a bass plug, better aim a foot or two in front. One of the coolest videos is a release shot taken from slightly below the fish, showing it being held underwater with the angler’s grinning face above. Be sure the sun is to the side or in front of the angler to avoid a dark silhouette. Move the camera into position with a pole, guided by verbal instructions from the angler.

Herpetologists have long used coverboard surveys to track the populations of amphibians and reptiles. Coverboards are simply large pieces of untreated plywood that are placed on the ground and later lifted and searched under for a wide array of creatures. (Chemicals found in treated woods can leach into the ground below.) One coverboard project has tallied 27 species of salamanders, frogs, snakes, and turtles hunkered down under these makeshift shelters. The plywood rooftops provide security, moist soils, and protection from predators. All that is equally attractive to earthworms, crickets, and beetle grubs—the Holy Trinity of live bait for panfish. Coverboard sizes are dictated by how much ground you want to cover. A dinner- plate-size coverboard set in a shady corner of your backyard should shelter enough crickets and worms for a quick after-work trip out to the local pond. A full 4-foot by 8- foot plywood sheet might end up home to half a day’s worth of serious bait dunking. All you need to do is put down the plywood in a shady spot and give it a few weeks to work its magic.

To prevent knots and malfunction, unscrew the side plate that houses the internal bail gears and remove the spring. Some reels require the removal of small bail-tripping mechanisms as well, but on many models, ditching the spring will suffice.

Solid brass bodies add heft for deeper-running lures and greater castability. Trim any excess wire and add beads. STEP 3 Thread the blade onto the clevis, and slide the clevis onto the shaft. The blade’s concave side should face the body. STEP 4 Using your pliers, grasp the shaft firmly about 3 / 16 to ½ inch above the clevis or terminal bead. Hold the pliers steady and slowly bend the shaft three-quarters of the way around the nose of the pliers and under the main shaft until you have formed a loop. STEP 5 Wrap the tag end of this loop tightly around the shaft twice, as close to the pliers as possible. Trim the end with wire cutters."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"136 WIDEN YOUR GATHERING GUIDE Ask a custom rod builder about common requests they receive, and one will invariably be using a gathering guide wider than what is typically used on stock rods. The gathering guide—the guide closest to the reel on a spinning rod—allows line to peel off the reel smoothly during the cast and feed back on the spool evenly during the retrieve. A wide gathering guide increases both casting accuracy and distance by giving the line more freedom of flow during the cast and will let you feather the line more effectively when you need to put a frog between two pads. During the retrieve, it can reduce kinking and memory by adding more tension to the line as it winds back onto the reel. You will also be able to use a reel with a wider spool on a lighter rod. That means you can increase your line capacity without the need to downsize line strength and lure weight. And you’ll be able to use a lighter outfit for bigger fish."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"137 MASTER THE WORLD’S FAIR KNOT This easy knot was the winner of a Great Knot Search event sponsored by DuPont (Stren fishing line) at the 1982 World’s Fair.

You’re landing plenty of small trout, but suddenly a 22- incher sips the fly. How do you keep it on and get it to the net? “Nothing can be sudden,” says Joe DeMalderis, a trophy trout hunter who guides from the upper Delaware River in New York to Patagonia in South America. “Everything has to be done easy, starting with the hookset. You want to gently lift to set. If you swing hard, it’s already over. The whole key is managing your line and keeping pressure on without doing anything jarring. When the fish gets on the reel, loosen your drag and keep your hands off. If the fish wants to take line, let it go. Whether you’re wading or in a drift boat, chasing the fish is a must. When it’s time to net, try to gently lead the fish into a bag that’s already submerged. Don’t take a sudden swipe, because if you hit the tippet, it’ll break. “If you panic, you don’t have a chance. People are afraid of light tippets, but 7X is a lot stronger than you think. I tell clients to tie their 7X to a bush and slowly bend the rod. They’ll bend it almost in half. But if you whip the rod fast, the tippet will snap. As soon as you try to stop the fish by choking off the line or changing directions too suddenly, it’s over. It’s a balancing act, and if you do one tiny thing wrong, you risk losing the trout. Most mistakes happen because the angler is panicked and does something too abruptly.”"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"141 SET A SPOOL BRAKE Calibrating a baitcasting reel is one of those skills it behooves the total outdoorsman to develop.

When was the first time I saw the sun rise? How long have I been wearing pants? Hasn’t the 33 been around since forever? Almost. In the 1940s, a Texas watchmaker, barber, and inventor named R. D. Hull created a new kind of fishing reel inspired by a string reel he saw in a grocery store. The fixed spool allowed butcher twine to feed off the end with few instances of backlash, the bane of baitcasting reels of the period. Hull pieced together a prototype with, depending on which account you read, a Folger’s Coffee can lid or a beer can. He took the contraption to a few investors he knew, but they weren’t impressed. These were the same men who years earlier had kicked in $7,500 each to bankroll Hull’s first rodeo with fishing reels, a design he called the “Lashmaster.” That company went belly-up. Undaunted, Hull continued the hunt for more amenable investors, and in 1947, stumbled across the Zero Hour Bomb Company of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Zero Hour made electrical time bombs for the oil-drilling business. Its patents were about to expire, and it was looking for new items to manufacture. A single employee—an ardent angler—convinced his bosses that Hull’s new fishing reel was the next big thing. The Zero Hour Bomb Company started production of Hull’s “Standard” reel in 1949. In 1952, the Model 22 hit the market. Two years later, Zero Hour debuted the Model 33. The reel flew off store shelves; it was so successful that in 1956 the company changed its name to reflect a shift away from the time-bomb trade. The name “Zebco” has been one of the most recognizable brands in fishing ever since. Perhaps the most famous fishing reel ever invented, the Zebco 33 is as utilitarian as it gets. Its predecessors were dubbed “a beer can with a hole in each end,” but the 33 was chromed up like a classic Cadillac bumper, with a push- button action and a fish-face bell that kept line unspooling free and true. It was marketed as a revolution, a reel so easy to use and cast that, literally, a monkey could fish with it. For a while, a Zebco “Fishing Chimpanzee” proved the point, traveling the sports show circuit, clad in overalls and a porkpie hat. To date, Zebco has sold more than 40 million Model 33s. I have owned at least three over the years, and one still has a place in my fishing quiver. Over the last few decades, Zebco has been bought and sold, and the company moved its manufacturing overseas in the late 1990s. But Tulsa remains the worldwide Zebco HQ, just as the venerable 33 remains the defining fishing icon of generations of anglers."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"148 FISH LIKE A JAPANESE STREAM WARRIOR Developed in Japan 200 years ago, tenkara fishing was introduced to American anglers in 2009. It involves using a very long fly rod with no reel; the line is tied directly to the tip. Using a truncated style of short-distance casting, anglers can use these rods to reach across conflicting currents and prevent a faster (or slower) current from pulling the fly and causing drag. Adherents are nearly worshipful of tenkara, which they say puts more emphasis on skill and less on gear. Tenkara rods telescope, and some can extend to nearly 15 feet. With a base length of less than 2 feet, they’re great for packing into tight headwaters. Use the longest rod you can. The limiting factor is how much canopy might impede the cast, not overall length. You’ll quickly get used to the length, and you’ll want the line control. Lines are about the length of the rod and attach to the rod tip. There are two broad types: More traditional tapered lines afford a super-delicate fly presentation. Newer level lines are more easily altered on the stream but harder to cast. Lines are tipped with a short 3- to 4-foot tippet. Most tenkara flies feature a reverse hackle in which the feather is brushed forward towards the hook eye. This gives the fly a pulsing, bloomlike profile, like a jellyfish opening and closing. Unlike traditional western flyfishing, tenkara places little emphasis on fly selection, and more on manipulating the fly to entice a strike."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"149 CATCH A DINOSAUR WITH A ROPE Longnose gar have been around for about 100 million years, skulking in freshwater with few predators.

It all comes together as super crappie cover—except for those pesky docks. There’s no way to get a traditional cast in between all those boat lifts, finger piers, pilings, and gangways. You’ll need to shoot your way in. Shooting docks for crappie is where fishing meets bowhunting. You turn your rod into a bow and your grub into an arrow, shooting a jig deep into shady haunts beneath a dock. Look for old docks with wooden posts. Spool an open-face spinning reel with high-visibility monofilament in 4- to 6-pound test. Use a medium-light or even ultralight rod in the 5- to 7-foot range. Arm it with a soft-bodied crappie jig. You are locked and loaded. STEP 1 Point the rod tip up and open the bail. Release enough line so the lure falls to the bottom rod guide. Trap the line against the rod with the trigger finger of your rod hand. With your free hand, grasp the jighead between your thumb and your forefinger and middle finger with the hook point up and the rest of your fingers extended out of the hook’s way. Holding the jig to your side, extend the rod tip toward your target zone. This creates a bend in the rod. STEP 2 Keep the drawn line between the rod tip and the jig low and parallel to the water. You may need to crouch. The lure should start skipping just before the dock. STEP 3 Let go of the jighead first, and in the next instant, release your trigger finger to allow the line to play out.

You can stop here or continue on for an upgrade. STEP 2 On the flat end, mark a hole 12 inches from the end and drill a ¼-inch hole through both walls of the pipe. Thread a 2½-inch galvanized bolt through the hole, and fashion with a lock washer and nut. The butt of a surf rod will rest against this bolt, keeping the reel away from the lip of the pipe. STEP 3 If you’re really feeling fancy, add an S-hook. Use pliers to crimp one end of the hook down to about ¼-inch diameter, and bend the hook in the middle so that the two ends are perpendicular.

While small bass in streams might be ravenous, large bronzebacks are often more wary, feeding less frequently and holing up in tight spots for most of the day. To entice small-stream trophies, you need to appeal to their predatory instincts, dialing in a presentation and lure size these fish can’t resist. This twitchbait and teaser fly combination packs a one-two punch. RIG IT Cut a length of mono from your main line (which should be around 8-pound- test) and splice it back onto the main line with two Uni knots, creating tag ends that measure 5 or 6 inches. Trim off only the tag from the main line close to the knot. Next, tie a twitchbait, such as the Rapala X-Rap, to the end of the spliced line. Now, tie a small Muddler Minnow or a white Zonker fly onto the remaining tag on the splice. DIG IT Cast the rig upstream of holes, deep-cut banks, or slow runs, and aggressively jerk the rod three or four times to make the twitchbait dive (A). This mimics a baitfish (the twitchbait) chasing a smaller baitfish (the fly) and should get the attention of any bass holding within striking distance. HOLD IT After those initial twitches, pause the rig, thus allowing the lure and fly to hover, then slowly rise up as they get swept along by the current (B). Smallmouths often attack at this point. Streams tend to feature smaller baitfish than large lakes and rivers, so don’t be surprised if the fly gets hammered. Even big bass will key in on tiny forage in this environment.

But dealing with dry ice takes some planning. Handle it with insulated or leather gloves or it will “burn” your skin. Keep children away from the stuff. Dry ice also expands approximately 800 times its original volume as it sublimates into the gas form, so cooler lids must be vented. And take care to crack a window if you drive with a cooler of frozen CO2. Here’s how to turn your fishing cooler into a deep-freeze for the long run. BLOCK IT OUT Two 10-inch-square blocks of 2-inch-thick dry ice (a standard 10-pound block) will keep 20 pounds of frozen foods frozen for approximately 3 days.

Wrap the dry ice in newspaper before placing in cooler. PUT A TROPHY ON ICE To ship game and fish, use dry ice exclusively to prevent water spoilage of trophies. Be careful to wrap the specimen in a towel to prevent the dry ice from creating freezer-burn spots. Or mix dry ice and regular ice to save on shipping weight.

The trick to being successful with these lures is making sure you match the style of stick to the size and speed of the water you’re fishing. These three will come through in all kinds of rivers all over the country. For clear, narrow pocket-water streams, you need a stickbait that won’t splash down hard and can be worked effectively on a light rod. The 2-inch floating Yo-Zuri Pins Minnow only dives to 1 foot, so it doesn’t hang up on the bottom often, and its thin- profile lip gives it a tight wiggle even when barely twitched. Work the Pins through seams and eddies with the rod tip high, twitching it gently. On a stream with a little more width, depth variation, and structure, throw a 3⅛- inch Rapala X-Rap. What’s great about this lure is its ability to suspend at any depth. The X-Rap is most effective when cast upstream, jerked to depth, and allowed to sweep downstream with an occasional twitch through likely holding water or around boulders and deadfalls. Big-river trout hunters, especially in the South, might be married to their Smithwick Rattlin’ Rogues, but the 4½-inch XCalibur EEratic Shad will put a hurt on heavy trout. The swifter the current, the more erratically it moves on the twitch, yet it’s not tiring to work, which lets you cover more water without turning your arms to Jell-O.

Approach the task like training a puppy: short, fun sessions with plenty of opportunities for success. Using kid-friendly gear is a huge bonus. Here’s what to look for. A soft action helps kids feel the flex and load. Resist the temptation to choose a super-short rod, which can be difficult to cast. Go for an 8-foot, 6-weight outfit. Overline the rod by one line weight to make for easier casting and ability to feel the rod load. Get a barbed fly stuck in your child’s forehead and you can forget about a future fishing buddy. Only use flies with barbless hooks. For practice, tie orange egg yarn next to the fly to make it visible. On the water, cast big high-floating flies like Stimulators. MY TOOL: MAD RIVER EXPLORER DUCK HUNTER CANOE Occasionally I make a good decision, a choice that betters the shape and course of life. For some folks, these transformative moments might come in the form of a marriage vow or a winning lottery ticket. For me, it was when I bought my first canoe. It was a Mad River 16-foot Explorer, with a tough Royalex hull, and I splurged an extra few hundred dollars for the so-called Duck Hunter’s edition. That canoe was clad in an olive green skin, and it featured cane seats, a portage yoke, and eye-catching slotted gunwales of dark-stained ash. What a beauty. And that beauty goes beyond skin-deep. Despite its name, the canoe has shown its chops as an unsurpassed fishing canoe. I learned to stand up in a canoe and fly cast from that Explorer, on Van’s Pond, where bass cruised lily pond edges and crappie skulked around Christmas trees sunk in the cold waters each January. In the early 1990s, as the striped bass runs came roaring back in North Carolina’s Roanoke River, Scott Wood and I turned the Explorer into a poor-boy’s striper boat. Our sole outfitting accessory: a disposable river anchor of a rope tied to a brick or cinder block. We turned plenty of heads in that canoe, the boat anchored in an eddy line, two guys standing up in one canoe, laying out 40-foot casts of lead-core lines. One thing I love about the Explorer is its haul-it-anywhere, run-it-everywhere utility. The canoe features a shallow- V arched bottom that provides just a bit of tracking without sticking tight to logs and rocks, and while it’s a bit squirrely underfoot, there’s plenty of secondary stability to make the boat serviceable in whitewater and absolutely excel as a fishing craft. The Explorer is tough beyond description. On a rocky smallmouth bass river, I fear no"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"jagged ledge. Outfitted with a side motor mount, she’s ferried me into salt marshes in search of redfish and speckled trout. She’s not light at 70 pounds, but I can carry her on my shoulders no problem, and the boat will swallow 1,100 pounds of men and gear without a groan. Over the years, that canoe has endured abuse that would have shredded lesser craft. Its inaugural float trip was down a small bony river in a summer drought. My buddy and I bashed the boat over rock ledges and through shallow boulder gardens, each scrape and smash a dagger to my heart as I imagined the shiny, smooth hull roughed up like a new truck in a demolition derby. That first day on the water wiped the newness from the hull, and from then on, the Explorer has been a true workhorse. I’ve made only a few modifications. A few years back, I tired of replacing the cane seats and wove duct tape into a basket-weave pattern that is now a permanent fixture (see item 107). At some point I switched out the factory portage yoke with a fancy sculpted yoke I ordered from Canada and paid a bloody fortune to have shipped home. It comes in handy when I portage the canoe down closed country roads to the lake. In truth, however, the canoe is just so tough, I often simply load it with a morning’s worth of fishing gear and lunch and drag it through the woods. These days, fishing kayaks are all the rage, and I am charmed by their possibilities. There’s a lot to be said for all the gizmos available to fine-tune a kayak for anything from pond crappie to bluewater sharks. But for 30 years that Explorer has helped me find fish, find hidden waters, and find my way. She’s steady and quiet, tried and true. Occasionally, some other canoe nut will see that old Duck Hunter Explorer at the boat ramp or upside-down on my truck and offer an impressive pile of cash for the old gal. You should hear me laughing."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"IT'S THE FIRST SHOT THAT MATTERS The gun was a Remington Model 700 BDL Varmint Master, chambered in .22-250 and fired handloads that could flip a groundhog backwards out of its burrow at 300 yards. If you could hit the target. This was 40 years ago, and that was the gun that taught me how to shoot a rifle. I learned through equal parts humiliation and determination. My mentor, Keith Gleason, was a former U.S. Marine who didn’t coddle the newbie. We cruised dirt roads in the rolling foothills along the New River where it stitched back and forth between North Carolina and Virginia, trading shots at whistlepigs in greening pastures. You got one shot. After that, hit or miss, you had to hand over the rifle. If I blew my chance, well, Gleason didn’t care that I was a 13-year-old kid and he was a trained sharpshooter. Try harder, he’d say. And I would. I learned a number of valuable lessons sweating over each shot, and one of them was about the proper role of hunting gear. Gleason tweaked handloads and fussed over ballistics tables, but when it came to putting lead where he wanted it to go, those tools only accentuated his skill. It was never the other way around. It’s too easy to forget that these days, when technological advances in gear make so many things seem all too easy. But good stuff works best when it works in tandem with finely honed ability. You can spring for the finest scope glass and bullet-drop compensating technology, but to shoot a rifle well, you still need good body mechanics, no flinch, and a trigger squeeze smooth as butter. All the recoil-dampening gas port tweaks in the world won’t make a mallard any easier to hit when it’s quartering away at 40 yards. Honeycombed risers and hybrid cams make it easier to hold a bow at full draw, no argument there. But it’s pure skill that allows a bowhunter to thread an arrow through a tight slit in the dark timber. More often than not, fine and fancy gear doesn’t get the job done any better. What brings home the backstraps is knowing how to wring every drop of potential from the gear you have at hand. Like dragging a moose back to camp with a boat. I was far up in northeastern Alberta when I heard about this, hanging on to a 20-foot aluminum skiff as Junior Adams, an XXXL-sized Athabascan Chipewyan native, gunned the 135-horsepower outboard. It was a 32-mile run to Adams’ camp at a tiny Athabasca River village called Jackfish, set deep in the million-acre Peace-Athabasca Delta. As we made the run, Taylor Swift warbled from the boat’s satellite radio, a duct-taped 1903 Enfield rattling against the windshield. When Junior said he kept the rifle handy in case a moose wandered out of the alders, I had to ask, “How do you get a moose home,"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"when home is 30 miles down the river?” “We drag them to the river with an ATV,” Adams replied, “then we hook them up to the boat with a rope around the neck. It’s a little hairy at first, but once you get that moose on plane, it’s like dragging a water skier back to camp!” Of all the wonders of the sporting world, I’d like to see that at least once. I’ve always been fascinated by hunters who fine-tune gear to very specific locations and hunting situations. It isn’t always so dramatic as to involve a long rope and a 1,000-pound mammal. I remember a Quebec guide who made giant diving duck decoys for hunting out of traditional sinkboxes in the rough open waters of Lac Saint-Pierre. First, Roger Gladu had a local carver craft the perfect decoy—a tall, big-bodied bluebill that would show up on the white-capped lake. Gladu then made a mold of the decoy, and blew urethane foam into the mold. He had scores of the scaup, because divers like a big spread and his home waters ate decoys like peanuts. The decoys were practically the size of a garbage can. Each one was topped with hand-carved heads large enough to hide a softball inside. They weren’t finely finished or artfully painted, but they matched the very conditions in which they were deployed: big, brawling, snotty waters. I offered Gladu $50 for one. He couldn’t do it. It’d be like a mechanic selling his favorite wrench. And to be truthful, I think a guy like Roger Gladu couldn’t abide the thought that a working decoy he sweated over and designed to suck giant flocks of Arctic-breeding ducks from the sky would ride a bookshelf in some writer’s office back in the States. I left empty-handed, but full of respect for a gear-hound like that. That’s one of the things I like the most about traveling North America for Field & Stream . I get to meet some of the most innovative people on the planet, and few of them are computer engineers. Most are wearing Carhartts overalls. Like whoever figured out that you can sharpen a short, stout stick, thread it under the cartilage that runs on top of a doe’s nose, and drag the deer to the truck with a DIY handle. Or thread a zip tie through the open spring in a clothespin, cinch down a handful of reeds in the zip tie, and clip the pin to a duck blind or treestand rail for a quick camouflage bundle. Pure genius. The same for the old Cajun squirrel hunter who"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"mounted Vise-Grips to a pole barn and clamped squirrels in the pliers for quick cleaning. And the guy who invented the Butt Out tool—snicker if you wish, but any cheap plastic gizmo that makes it easier to remove the business end of a deer’s digestive system deserves my undying gratitude. The value of a hunting tool has nothing to do with its price, but how well it solves a thorny problem or helps a hunter step up to the next level of skill. Which is why that old Remington Varmint Master was the perfect gun for me, at the perfect time. While it was capable of more than I could do with it as a boy, it wasn’t overly complicated. And most importantly, I saw it being used with skill that I could only dream of—and set my mind to replicate. Even today, nearly 40 years after I last pulled its trigger, I can be at a gun shop, glancing down a line of 50 used rifles, and the first thing that catches my eye are those familiar white spacers between the stock and the butt plate, and Remington’s distinctive fleur-de-lis flourishes in the grip checkering. All of a sudden, I’m back on the New River, crosshairs wobbling around a woodchuck burrow, counting heartbeats and squeezing the trigger between each throb.

Add a small smartphone tripod and you’ll be armed for taking boss self-portraits with your trophy. This classic setup of the hunter approaching a downed deer is a snap. Focus on the deer’s head and move back a few dozen feet for a more staged approach. That should put the deer in sharp focus and the hunter slightly out of focus for a dramatic view. This is one of the few times that having the hunter “skylined” against a light background is a good thing. A shot as you drag the deer out of the woods can tell you an important part of the story. Use a small tripod to affix the phone to a sapling or tree branch. Frame up shots as you drag the deer towards the camera and away. Another good shot that showcases headgear in a subtle way is attaching a permit to the deer’s antler or punching a tag. Prop the smartphone on a pack or use a small tripod to frame up a shot of just your hands, a knife, the permit, and the deer’s rack."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"167 DECOY A PRONGHORN ANTELOPE There might not be any more exciting archery hunts than decoying a lust-crazed prairie goat ready to stomp the life out of the life-sized decoy you are hiding behind. During the late-summer rut, dominant pronghorns gather harems of does during a brief 2- to 3-week period and chase away any other bucks that may horn in on their love nest. Even the less-dominant bucks are ready to fight at the drop of a decoy and run out across the plains—literally—for a no-holds-barred smackdown. Here’s how you can dupe that goat with a decoy. GO WITH A PAL Decoying works best when one person handles the decoy and a rangefinder while the other is dedicated to getting the shot. Trade off positions during the course of a day. MAKE IT VISIBLE You have to be seen to be charged. Set the decoy up on a ridge or swell where it will show up against the sky, or place it out in a flat open spot where there is minimal vegetation. BE READY Your decoy might bring in a goat from the next county over or from just out of sight. As soon as the decoy is up, get on your knees and nock an arrow. Have your partner range a few clumps of brush or rocks so you’ll have a rough idea of distance. It can happen that quickly. DROP DOWN Speaking of knees, practice shooting from them, and practice shooting while leaning to one side to replicate working an arrow around a decoy.

Luckily, you don’t have to take the one-size-fits-all approach. Many bow sight manufacturers offer models that take pins of multiple sizes. Set the sight up with larger pins on top and smaller pins below. That way you get the advantage of the smaller pin size at longer distances when the target picture is reduced, while retaining the brighter pin at the shorter distances you’re more likely to shoot at in low-light scenarios. And while you’re on the range, mix and match the pins. You might find that the smaller sized pin actually works better at super-short ranges of 20 yards or so.

The first step is to examine that arrow for clues about where it passed through the deer. Find a strong source of light—sunlight or flashlight—and take a close look from nock to broadhead. BLOOD Bright pink-red blood from tip to nock indicates a hit in the vitals. Frothy bubbles can suggest a lung hit. No bubbles indicates a heart shot. Dark red blood with no bubbles could indicate a liver hit. HAIR Coarse brown hair can indicate a good shot if the arrow entered in the vitals. White hair suggests a low hit. Wait several hours before tracking. BROWNISH OR GREENISH MATERIAL An arrow streaked with any brownish or greenish material is a bad sign. An arrow from a gut-shot deer might be flecked with stomach contents such as green leaves or little bits of any partially digested corns or soybeans. Lift it up to your nose and smell for a strong odor. This typically indicates a gut-shot deer. If gray or brown hair is on the arrow, that could mean a higher hit than white hair.

Higgins Model 31 tube-fed .22. Manufactured by the long-gone High Standard Corp. and sold through Sears, that rifle was the kickoff to a lifelong rimfire romance in which fidelity has never played a role. Over the years I’ve wandered widely. My old high school flame was a Remington Speedmaster— another tubular semiauto. I had a serious college fling with a Browning 541T bull- barreled bolt action. Next came a steady relationship, sort of, with a succession of factory Ruger 10/22s. Right now, my current rimfire love is the equivalent of a trophy wife: a pimped-out 10/22 with aftermarket trigger, carbon-fiber barrel, rimfire-specific scope, and a few other whistles and bells that toll a death knell for squirrels. The highly customizable Ruger 10/22 has a screwed-in barrel and straightforward design that allows it to be inexpensively tinkered with from butt to muzzle. Here’s what I did to my own Ruger. Now, how about yours? LAMINATED STOCK With grain in their multiple layers of wood running in different directions, laminated stocks can offer you high strength, great stability, and good resistance to warping. I chose a straightforward lay-up, but there are lots of aftermarket stocks out there, from thumbhole stocks to Monte Carlo designs to lightweight configurations with skeletonized buttstocks and slotted fore-ends. DROP-IN TRIGGER Timney’s one-piece drop-in trigger is set at a crisp 2 3/4 pounds, with no creep. Machined from 6061-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum, the action houses a trigger, sear, and hammer of heat-treated steel. Replacing the famously unimpressive factory 10/22 trigger is a snap. Punch out the two action pins, remove the trigger action, and replace the entire assembly. DEDICATED RIMFIRE SCOPE The 50-yard parallax setting on the Nikon Pro-Staff 3- 9X BDC 150 gives a squirrel hunter tack-sharp focus when he’s searching for limb dancers squashed tight against a treetop limb, while the BDC reticle is calibrated for .22 Long Rifle ammo, taking much of the guesswork out of those long shots to the back of the woodlot. VOLQUARTSEN CARBON FIBER BARREL At a short 16.5 inches long and just 23 ounces in weight, this match barrel changes the look and feel of a rifle like nothing else. The carbon fiber barrel shroud is put together with tension at both the muzzle and chamber ends to provide rigidity. For long walks in the squirrel woods, it’s a delight. Such a light front end, however, is an acquired taste. PARACORD SLING I like lightweight slings on my rifles. Choose your color, choose your swivels, choose between fixed length or adjustable. There are tons of options online. Mine is created with a standard weave for a supple feel, but the Double Cobra and King Cobra designs are pretty sweet, too."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"172 USE SNAP CAPS THREE WAYS Snap caps are dummy rounds that cushion the fall of the firing pin so that firearms can be safely dry-fired.

The great majority of rifles’ crowns are recessed at the bore to protect this precious aperture from any tiny deformations that can throw a bullet off. Any nick, or chip, or uneven wearing at the crown can spell disaster, and there are two very common culprits. Each is entirely avoidable. TRUCK MUCK It is never a good idea to place an uncased rifle inside a vehicle, but it’s an idiotic move to place a rifle muzzle down in the front seat so that the barrel crown grinds into all of that mud, grit, grime, and dried ketchup you store on the floor mat. CLEANING DAMAGE An old adage holds that more guns are damaged by cleaning them than by using them, and this is what it means. When cleaning from the breech, be vigilant about pulling the cleaning brush or jag back into the barrel if it exits the bore.

I’ve used two methods of preparing the duck skulls: The first involves soaking the bones in hot water for days, painstakingly scraping away the flesh, then gluing the parts back together. Once I discovered the second, super-easy way, I’ll never go back. It starts with a friendly phone call. MEET THE BEETLES Flesh-eating dermestid beetles can clean off a duck skull in a matter of days. Plenty of museums and nature centers keep a colony or two of the dermestid beetles, and a modest contribution—say, $25—can often win you a spot in their beetle box. You will first need to skin the upper legs and then cut away most of the muscle, and skin the skull and cut out the tongue, but the bugs will do the rest. Another option: Inquire with a local taxidermist if you and your buddies can toss a few duck skulls and leg bones in with a load of deer skulls being prepped for European mounts. Tell the taxidermist there’s no need to go through the degreasing process. You will do that yourself in the next step. DEGREASE THE BONES Once the bones are back from the beetles, degrease them by soaking them in warm water and Dawn dishwashing detergent for a few hours. Rinse well. Dry in the sun. To further whiten the bones, soak overnight in hydrogen peroxide and set in the sun to dry. Use small dabs of wood glue to strengthen any loose joints. Brush bleach on stubborn brown spots, or go all natural. If you want, add a yellow bill with acrylic paint. COME TOGETHER Cross the leg bones and use hot glue to hold in place. Once they’re dry, build up a few layers of glue in the concave underside of the bill for a flat base, then attach the crossed bones to the back of the skull with more glue.

SINGLE REED First, check to make sure that the call’s wedge hasn’t slipped or, if it’s made of cork, dried out. If it won’t seat firmly in the call, get a replacement from the call manufacturer. To give the call a higher pitch, use scissors to trim off a tiny sliver at a time, and reassemble the call and test it after each trimming. To add raspiness, rough up the toneboard with 220-grit sandpaper. Or dog-ear the front corners of the reed at a 60-degree angle with a tiny diagonal cut. DOUBLE REED Pull the barrel off and take a quick photo of the insert so you’ll have a record of the reeds’ placement in relation to the wedge and toneboard. To tune, move the wedge back (to lower pitch) or forward (to raise pitch), without altering the reed arrangement. Test the call after each tweak. If the call still isn’t to your liking, trim very lightly with scissors. Again, test after each adjustment. To add rasp, carefully offset the top reed slightly back from the lower reed.

THE HULL TRUTH The long, smooth hull of a canoe will glint with sunlight and spook every duck on the creek long before you’re close enough to shoot. Even a camo-painted canoe can use some help. Use one or two long pieces of camouflage netting to knock back the hull’s shine. Drape the netting over the rails so that the bottom edge is barely above the water’s surface. Start at the bow and extend the netting at least as far back as the stern seat. FLOATING ISLAND Cut twice as much brush as you think you’ll need. Use half of it to create a fan-shaped hide in the bow. Bend some limbs so they drape over the gunwales in order to break up your boat’s outlines.

CARRY IT RIGHT Transport the camera with its battery separate. If you don’t, then the camera or its WiFi can accidentally, and easily, turn on. FIGHT THE FOG Waterproof housings are great, but be vigilant. Moisture captured inside the housing can cause the lens to fog, and it doesn’t take a deluge. Damp fingers, humid air, and hot breath can all fog the inner surface of the lens. If available for your camera, carry anti-fog pads. GET CLOSE Most of the time, closer is better, so put the camera right into the action. Let the dog lick and sniff it. Set it in a cooler and then toss in the ducks. A point of view 2 or 3 feet away from the subject is not too close for many shot opportunities. CENTER IT If there is a large sweep of horizon in the shot, it is often best to try to have that horizon line in the center of the frame. That will keep the horizon line straight, instead of bowing with the wide angle. CONTROL TIME Learn how to take and edit time-lapse sequences. Opinions vary about ideal intervals between shots, but do the math to figure out how long you’ll need the photo capture to run in order to get the desired seconds of “video” out of the time- lapse clip. For example, at 30fps video playback, and taking a photo every 2 seconds, you’ll get 1 second of video for each minute of photo capture. ADJUST FRAME RATE In low light conditions, adjust the frame rate to allow the camera to capture more light per frame. In decent sunlight, 48fps is a standard setting, but don’t be hesitant to crank it down to 24fps. RELAX Don’t let the camera get in the way of your fun, or your quarry.

STEP UP Place each camera 6 to 8 feet high in a tree, with the lens angled slightly downward. Wedge a stick behind the camera to get the correct angle. You will get a much better field of view and also increase your chances of picking up bucks in the background. Plus, there’s less chance of alerting deer with the camera flash. QUARTER ANGLE One of the most common mistakes is to aim a camera perpendicular to the trail. A quartering angle is best for maximizing the time the deer stays in frame. BUCK SHOT Place an additional camera on your stand tree, facing behind you, to capture savvy bucks skirting field edges and moving parallel to established deer trails. TIME TRAVEL If your camera will run in both time-lapse and motion modes simultaneously, switch on both modes. CHECKMATES Always carry spare memory cards and surgical gloves when you check cameras. It’s quicker to swap cards than remove the entire camera, and surgical gloves will keep cameras and trees free of human scent."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"183 TURN A PISTOL INTO A SHOTGUN Ranchers in serious snake country are known for toting revolvers loaded with rat shot for those too-close encounters with Mr. No Shoulders. There are plenty of myths and misinformation about shotshells for handguns, so here’s what you need to know before plugging away with pint-sized shotshells. MICRO-SHOT Pistol shotshells are loaded with tiny shot. In .22 and .22 Magnum, most shells are filled with tiny No. 11 or No. 12 shot. Step up to the larger calibers— 9mms, .38s, .40s, .44s, .45s—and the shot size can creep up to No. 9. That’s still pretty lightweight stuff. BARREL BASHING It’s a misconception that shooting rat shot in a rifled barrel will ruin the barrel. Lead shot won’t damage a steel barrel. Shoot a lot of the stuff, however, and lead and plastic fouling could be an issue, so clean barrels with a bronze brush after firing rat shot. SEMIAUTO PAINS It’s true that the plastic-topped rat shot is a questionable load for your semiautomatic pistol. Even if the round cycles, there’s a chance that the feed ramp or any other metal parts might tear the plastic cap and allow all the spilled lead shot to dump into the inner workings of a handgun. That’s no good. BOTTOM LINE Rat shot from these calibers is a decidedly short-range, very-small- game load. The shot cups spin from the rifling, so the pattern opens quickly. And the shot itself is too small to do much damage. They’re great for bumblebees on the wing, blackbirds at 20 feet, and rats, mice, and snakes at super-close ranges.

Waterfowl hunters often need their dogs to stay and work from a distance, be it 10 feet or 20 yards away. And retrievers should be comfortable sitting and staying on any less-than-comfortable structures, such as downed logs in beaver swamps or small platforms in marshes. Use an old tire as a backyard “place” training tool. It provides a slightly elevated platform that helps a dog understand that this is its “place.” Cut a scrap piece of plywood or even an old foam archery target to fit the top of the tire and secure in place with paracord. Ugly and effective. ONE PLACE With the dog on leash and a treat in your non-leash hand, lead the dog to the “place” stand. Using the hand with the treat, point with your finger to the stand, say “place,” and use the treat to guide the dog up to the stand. Give the treat the instant the dog sits. Repeat, repeat, repeat. TWO PLACES Once the dog knows “place,” set up a training route with multiple stations for the “place” command. Use another tire, a few cinder blocks, and other items that provide a well-defined place to sit. Once your pooch is solid on the command, add stations without any elevation, such as carpet squares. TOUGH PLACES Add “place” stations that have a degree of difficulty or instability to your training route. Log rounds, overturned canoes, and upside-down coolers work well.

Here’s a guide to matching blade shapes and grinds to the task at hand. BLADE SHAPES The blade shape is the knife in profile. Does the tip sweep up or down? Is the point clipped? Is the edge straight or curved? It all matters, greatly. DROP POINT A downward convex curve along the blade spine forms a lowered point, creating a very strong tip. The drop-point blade is particularly suited for big- game hunting as the tip curves away from an animal’s organs while field dressing. TRAILING POINT An upward curve in the blade spine meets an upward curve in the blade edge to created a large belly for slashing. Good for some fillet knives and skinning knives. CLIP POINT A general-use blade in which the spine of the blade drops to the tip for a strong piercing point with a slightly upswept belly. The clipped portion of the blade spine can be straight or curved and often holds a false edge. Bowie knives have a clip-point blade. SPEAR POINT A stabbing blade, which is both spine and edge taper equally to a point. SHEEPSFOOT Straight-edged blade with a spine that curves downward to meet at the blade tip. Originally designed to trim sheep hooves, this design does not have a sharp, piercing tip, making it a good choice for whittlers and boaters who must handle knives in unstable conditions. WHARNCLIFFE Very similar to the sheepsfoot, but with a longer trailing point. Very efficient slicer. SPEY Originally used to spey livestock, the blade spine terminates in a well- defined curve that meets another sudden upward curve at the blade tip. Allows for a fine degree of control with just a bit of a piercing tip."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":" TANTO These chisel-point blades are popular on tactical knives. Near the blade tip, the sharpened edge rises up at a sharp angle to meet the spine. This creates a blade that carries its thickness nearly to the tip for added strength. SKINNER The full curving knife belly is perfect for long, sweeping motions, such as skinning big game. FILLET A thin, flexible blade allows the knife to work over and around bones and fins. CAPER A short, pointed blade with a slightly down-turned tip is easy to control in tight spots, such as removing the cape from an animal’s head. RECURVE The slight S-shaped belly forces the material being cut into the sharp edge. Recurves can be designed into most blade profiles. BLADE GRINDS The blade grind refers to the shape of a blade in cross section. Some grinds lean towards strength, and attempt to retain as much steel as possible. Thinner designs are designed for slicing. FLAT-GRIND BLADES taper evenly from the start of the bevel to the cutting edge. There are several variations. Full flat-grind blades taper evenly all the way from the spine to the cutting edge, in the classic V-shape. In a high flat-grind blade, the bevel begins between the spine and the edge, but closer to the spine. In a Scandi grind, the bevel begins closer to the edge, below the midpoint between spine and edge. Flat-grind blades are easy to sharpen but dull more quickly than other grinds. HOLLOW-GRIND BLADES have a concave shape, as if a scoop of metal has been removed from the blade between the spine and edge. This thin, sharp grind produces an edge that slices easily, making it a common choice on a field-dressing knife. But the hollow grind will chip or roll over if it hits bone and can hang up in deep cuts."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":" THE CONVEX GRIND arcs down from the spine as it tapers to the edge, thus creating a very sharp cutting edge that retains plenty of steel for strength. A convex grind is difficult to sharpen, but creates an edge with great durability and sharpness. A COMPOUND BEVEL OR DOUBLE-BEVEL GRIND is a secondary grind on the blade close to the edge bevel. This retains thickness for strength while allow for a thinner edge for sharpness."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"194 MASTER THE GROUND-BLIND SHOT The growing popularity of pop-up ground blinds has changed the game. Deer bowhunters are down from the trees, now joined by a growing number of gobbler hunters. But there’s more to hunting from these blinds than simply sitting on a bucket with a bow in hand. Here’s how it’s done. FIND YOUR BLIND SPOT Set up your blind between tree trunks and break up the horizontal outline of the blind’s roof with cut brush. GET BACK TO BLACK Wear a black facemask, gloves, and shirt or jacket to blend in with the blacked-out interior of the blind. KNOW YOUR WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY Open the windows at 12, 3, and 6 o’clock. Sit in the back and raise your bow as the deer passes from an open side window toward the front. BE A STRAIGHT SHOOTER Concentrate on keeping your back straight.

It might be time to take the hint. Turkey decoys are getting more and more realistic, with details from fully fanned tail feathers to wobbling heads. Using a fake turkey as a confidence decoy for deer hunting, especially while bowhunting, could give you the edge you need. Some hunters report that deer seem to be relaxed while in the presence of a confidence decoy, while others figure that it can hold a little bit of the deer’s attention, thus making it easier to draw the bow undetected.

The ones that get away are the ones that aren’t in the treetops at all. They’re the squirrels that show up close and scurry along a fallen log at 30 feet. These squirrels never stop long enough to offer you a stationary shot. They can accelerate and decelerate like a pinball, and somehow they still have the ability to see you raise your rifle, which transforms them into a speeding, vanishing gray blur. The trick here is to shoot before that happens—meaning you have to hit that small, erratically moving target at relatively close range. How to drill for this? Channel the spirit of a bocce ball champ, and bounce and roll a spherical squirrel-size tar- get along the ground. You’ll need a bucket of old tennis balls and a buddy to toss them, and make sure there’s an appropriate background in order to absorb the bullets. The thrower stands a yard or two behind and at varying distances perpendicular to the shooter. STEP 1 Start out by tossing balls about 25 yards down the line. Each of the balls will cross in front of the shooter in near profile, just like that movement of an unalarmed but actively foraging squirrel. STEP 2 Make each shot more difficult by having your thrower stand closer to the gun. With the balls coming from beside the shooter, the shot simulates those all-too- frequent times when you’re busted by a feeding squirrel and he’s hightailing it to the nearest tree.

Avid squirrel hunters might be a bit surprised at such a low number. Personally, I know that squirrels have cussed me out using at least 83 separate potty-mouth squirrel-words. Point is, the limb dancer is a loquacious fellow, which can be his undoing. You can buy a squirrel call, but here are three ways to use common household objects to strike up a conversation with a tasty squirrel—just before you shut him up for good. TOY SQUEAKER Cut open squeaky dog and baby toys and you’ll find a small plastic bulb. Its high-pitched squeak can imitate the distress call of a young squirrel in the clutches of a fox or hawk, and that racket draws other squirrels that are concerned or just plain curious. There are a few different sizes of squeakers, so experiment to find the pitch that works. Works best early in the season, when young squirrels are still plentiful. BOLT AND WASHER Cutter calls involve a ridged rod and a striker and replicate the sound of a squirrel’s teeth on tough nut hulls. For the rod, try threaded plastic or metal bolts or even the brass bolts that hold toilet seats in place. For a striker, use metal or plastic washers of varying thickness. In the woods, toss a few light rocks into the leaves, which sounds like nut fragments falling. Something about the clink-clank of a couple of coins can turn a squirrel inside-out with curiosity. Rubbing the ridged edges of quarters together makes a sound not unlike a squirrel cutting nuts (poker chips are even louder). Or hold a quarter and penny between thumb and forefinger and rasp them together in short, quick movements. SPARE CHANGE Try this technique after you’ve been busted. Sit quietly for 10 minutes, then lure the squirrel back into the open. This is a short-range game, which makes the one-handed quarter-and-penny call a deadly finisher."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"200 BE THE TRIPOD A wily old South Carolina squirrel hunter named Mac English perfected this rather unorthodox prone position.

Keep your right thigh in a straight plane with your torso, and bend the right knee back at a 90-degree angle.

Here’s how to channel your inner Opie Taylor. STEP 1 Saw a 10-foot 1×8 plank (A) as illustrated below. The 3-part trigger (B) mechanism can be made from a ½-inch wooden dowel cut to 11 inches, and a 58-inch- long strip of ¾-inch x ¾-inch wood, cut as shown. Alternatively, the mechanism of lever (C), fulcrum post (D), and trigger can be whittled from a set of sticks. STEP 2 Assemble the rabbit gum as shown, fastening the pieces with nails or wood screws. Be careful placing the trap door guides (E). It’s important that the trap door slides freely in order to beat a bunny to the draw. STEP 3 Place the rabbit gum along runs in thick cover, unbaited, for a week or two to get bunnies used to it. Lean a few saplings or handfuls of grass around the trap to break up the outline, but be sure not to impede the trigger mechanism. STEP 4 Place bait between the trigger stick and the back panel. Try out aromatic goodies such as apples. Old-timers would use cabbage, turnips, salt—and carrots, of course. It’s not a bad idea to create a trail of small bait pieces that leads up to the trap opening, and then crush a piece of bait and smear the scent along the inside of the gum to lead the rabbit to the point of no return.

One day, I kept telling myself, I’ll do something with those horns. One day I did. Turning that overlooked rack into a distinctive piece of sporting art took maybe three hours of work and less than $10 in supplies. I used a paving stone from a landscape supply shop. You won’t believe how easy it is. STEP 1 Cut away as much of the hide and flesh as you can, being careful not to score the bone with your knife. Soak the antler plate in a basin of water for two to three days. Scrape away as much tissue as possible. STEP 2 Mix bleach and water in a one-to-one ratio, then carefully swab down or spray the entire antler plate with the liquid. Be very careful to keep it off the antlers or they will discolor. Repeat every 30 minutes or so until the bone is completely white. This might take one or more afternoons. STEP 3 If the antlers have lost their color, use a woodstain to restore. Test it with a small spot on the back of the antler first, and use sparingly. Let it dry, then spray the finished antlers with a clear semigloss polyurethane. STEP 4 Round off the edges and corners of the antler plate with a hand-held rotary tool, being careful not to breathe in the bone dust. STEP 5 Drill two ¼-inch holes through the top of the antler plate, approximately 1 inch apart. Drill another pair of ¼-inch holes, about 1 inch apart, through the mounting board or stone.

Here are a few options. EASIEST Stuff a pillowcase one-third full with aromatic vegetation from your hunt area, such as green leaves, pine needles, pieces of bark, moss, acorns—even dirt. Tie a knot in the top. Prior to a hunt, dampen the pillowcase with water and toss it in the clothes dryer with your clean hunting duds. EASY Gather ½ gallon of acorns; add in a double handful of green pine needles if pines occur in your hunting area. Boil them gently in 1 gallon of water for 30 minutes. Let the mixture cool. Remove the nuts and needles, mash them, and boil again in the same water. Let the mixture cool, then strain it through cheesecloth. Store the liquid in a refrigerator. To use the cover scent, pour into a spray bottle. NOT-SO-BAD Snip off one leg from a pair of hose. Remove the tarsal glands from a buck’s hind legs by cutting around each gland, lifting it with rubber-gloved fingers, and then separating the connective tissue under the skin. Use a 10cc hypodermic syringe and needle to remove urine from the buck’s bladder. Place the glands in the hose and knot closed. Squirt them with the urine and store in a sealed plastic bag in a freezer. Hang it by your stand during the hunt. HARD Remove the tarsals from a buck, following the directions above. With a leather needle, thread the end of a 5-foot length of heavy monofilament through a gland; tie it off. Tie a loop in the other end of the line. Vacuum-pack the glands separately and freeze them. Before a hunt, thaw one out, then spritz it with urine scent and use it as a scent drag. HARDEST Collect enough pine needles to fill a 5-gallon bucket. Boil in a large kettle with 6 to 7 gallons of water. Strain the needles out, then pour the liquid into a washing machine set at the lowest load setting possible. Toss in clean hunting clothes, and wash using the presoak cycle for a very intense pine scent. Clean the machine by washing a few old towels in hot, soapy water."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"212 STICK A CALL TO YOUR COAT Put a small, lightweight grunt call to your hunting jacket and you’ll be able to call deer with a minimum of movement.

Toss in a zippered plastic baggie along with 6 feet of paracord, and store in a refrigerator or freezer. To use, simply tie a cord to the tarsal gland and knot it off on one of your belt loops. Drag it behind you on the way to your stand. Once near your hunt location, hang the tarsal gland from an upwind branch.

First, vacuum the entire mount with a shop-vac using a stiff bristly dusting head attachment. Go lightly, and move in the direction of the hair. Clean out the ears and nostrils. STEP 2 Clean ear cavities, nose cavities, and open mouths with a blast of canned compressed air.

It’s a snap for you to camouflage a stock with easily available hardware store spray paint and stencils you pluck from your hunting land. Instructors at the North Carolina Montgomery Community College Gunsmithing School dolled up these beauties and gave us their step-by-step plan. All you need is spray paints in three or four flat finishes (many hardware stores stock camouflage spray paint), a little bit of paint thinner, some paracord, and a few handfuls of leaves, pine needles, and grasses. GATHER AND GLEAN Collect three species of local vegetation to use as custom stencils: a few medium-sized leaves; some pencil-thick vegetation, such as fern fronds; and finer materials, such as thin reeds and pine needles. Especially with pine needles and grasses, make sure there’s plenty of open structure for the paint to get through. PREPARE THE STOCKS Remove the barrels, actions, and sling swivels from the stocks. Degrease with a wipe of paint thinner. Use some masking tape to mask off areas that shouldn’t be painted, such as the barrels’ bedding channels and any action ports. Use a sharp X-Acto blade for precise cuts. Make a clothesline of paracord out in the workshop or backyard, and hang the stocks for painting. You can also paint them lying flat on some newspaper, but you’ll have to wait till the paint dries to flip them over, and it’s more difficult to match patterns on the two sides. LET THE PAINT FLY Paint your entire stock black. Let dry. Now use the natural stencils. Start with the medium-sized leaves and a medium-dark paint, such as brown or olive green. Hold that vegetation very still up against the surface of the stock, and spray with a light back-and-forth action with the can about 6 inches away. Rotate the camo vegetation in all directions to prevent striping—everything in nature is random. Next, use your thin grasses and pine needles with a bit of light brown or khaki paint for added depth. Use just enough paint to get the desired effect; too much, and thick paint globs will crack upon drying. Finish with a coat of clear flat acrylic sealant."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"218 CLEAN A TRIGGER WITH A TOOTHBRUSH We fuss over our barrels and actions, but we give too little thought to the first line in a firearm’s offense: the trigger. A gunked-up trigger might be, at best, cranky to pull and the root cause of a missed shot and, at the worst, the culprit of a shot that fails to go off at all. Cleaning a trigger is as easy as degreasing it with lighter fluid, which doesn’t harm the plastics, bluing, stock finishes, or epoxy. Lighter fluid flushes out the crap and leaves behind a slight residue that provides just enough lubrication for a trigger. There are two ways to apply. The quick and easy way is to remove the bolt from a rifle, squirt the lighter fluid into the trigger assembly, and work the trigger as all that evaporating liquid works its magic. For a truly gunked trigger, such as a duck gun that’s been hard at work all season long, remove the trigger assembly from the receiver. Flush it with lighter fluid, using an old, clean, toothbrush to flick out the grime. After it dries, use a can of compressed air to blow junk out of all the little nooks and crannies. Repeat as necessary."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"219 HOLD BINOCULARS ROCK STEADY THREE WAYS It’s not easy holding binoculars steady over the course of a long glassing session for mule deer, pronghorn, and other open-country game. Here are three tricks to keep your glasses from shaking—and your arms fresh for holding a rifle. RIFLE SLING Use a long, wide binoculars strap like a rifle sling for some stability. Hold the binoculars horizontally, so that the single strap loops down towards the ground. Then, one at a time, insert your hands through the loop far enough that your elbows are inside the loop. Hold up the binoculars in a typical grip. The strap should wrap around the outside of your arms at your triceps muscle. Now spread your arms apart, tightening the strap across upper arms and chest. HAT TRICK Adjust a baseball-type cap so it fits a bit tighter than normal. Hold binoculars in a regular grip, then extend each middle finger over the cap brim and grasp firmly. RECYCLE A HOCKEY STICK Developed in Finland, a “finnstick” is a device that allows you to keep binoculars at eye-level without needing your hands. Make one out of a forked branch about 2 to 3 feet long (depending on your height). The fork holds on to the center barrel of the binoculars, while you hold the other end of the stick at waist height. In another nod to their Finnish roots, many birders use broken hockey sticks as DIY finnsticks."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"220 FIX STOCK DINGS WITH AN IRON If you view the minor dents and dings in a wooden rifle or shotgun stock as badges of field honor, then skip ahead to the next skill. If not, then grab a wet cloth, a clothes iron or soldering iron, and prepare to raise a little grain. By carefully steaming the dent you will cause the wood cells to expand, minimizing the blemish. This process works best on porous oil-based finishes. Lacquer finishes may need to be removed first, however. STEP 1 Clean the dent to keep from steaming dirt permanently into the wood grain. STEP 2 Wet a corner of a towel or cleaning patch with hot water. Place the wet cloth directly over the dent, and press with the tip of a clothes iron or soldering iron. Don’t overdo it. A few seconds of steaming is enough. STEP 3 Repeat as necessary. Depending on the dent and the wood, you might need to repeat twice, thrice, or a dozen times. Let the wood dry completely between treatments. STEP 4 The steaming process tends to raise the wood’s grain, so hit the raised grain with steel wool to buff it down."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"THE ICON: SCHRADE SHARPFINGER It was the first knife to catch my eye, and I wasn’t alone. I was 12 years old in 1973, the year that Schrade Cutlery introduced its model 150OT, the Sharpfinger. This was one of the very first purpose-specific knives that I can remember—a knife made solely for gutting an animal lying on brown leaves, or stripping the hide from a beast swinging on a rope. It stood apart from a few centuries’ worth of general-purpose American blades, the Bowies, faux-Bowies, and German-style hunters that were the coin of the bladesmithing realm in my youth. To my young eye, the Sharpfinger was a bit of a global mash-up: an exotic blade shape, all swoopy and pointed like an Arabian knight’s scimitar. The subtly textured thermoplastic handle scales looked like old bone but offered the sexy unbreakability of space-age engineering. Back in the day, the old Sharpfinger magazine ads would brag: “For small elephants and large squirrels.” My dad bought one. I can still smell the leather sheath. The Schrade Sharpfinger was crazy popular. (The knife was originally called the “Sharp Finger,” but the name was changed to the one-word “Sharpfinger” in 1980.) Over the years a number of limited editions were pumped out to feed the public’s nearly unlimited appetite for the knife. There was a “Grandad’s” edition that looked even more old-timey—a knife with a faux-scrimshaw handle of fake whale tooth. The knives even caught on far outside the hunting world. Hells Angel founder Sonny Barber carried a Sharpfinger, and extolled the little blade in his memoir Dead in 5 Heartbeats . That did nothing to diminish public fervor. Schrade churned the Sharpfinger out for almost 30 years, until 2004 when the company went bankrupt. The trademark has since expired, and these days Sharpfinger-type knives are pumped out of Chinese factories like cheap shirts. It seems the old Sharpfinger magic still cuts deep. Today, I own a fleet of dedicated-purpose blades: skinners, capers, boners, gut hooks, bird knives, trout knives, camp knives, and survival knives galore. I like them all, and love a rare few. But it was that original Sharpfinger that sent the first chills up my spine. It was the first knife I ever paid for, bought with money saved from my newspaper route. It was a knife I simply had to have, no matter what. It was the first time I felt that way, but hardly the last."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"221 DOUBLE YOUR RANGE WITH A BIPOD Reaching out for long-range coyotes, varmints, and even open-country big game will require a rock-solid rest, and nothing does the trick like using a rifle-mounted bipod from the prone shooting position. There’s a little more to mastering this two-footed rest than simply flopping on the ground with the bipod deployed, so here’s the drill for the long-range game. GO LOW The longer the legs, the more they will flex, and the shorter the legs, the more stable the platform. Adjust the bipod so the rifle is as close to the ground as possible without forcing you into an uncomfortable position. NOT ROCK SOLID You’d never shoot a rifle rested on a rock, because recoil will jump the stock, sending your bullet high. It is the same idea with a bipod. Place the bipod feet on a surface with some give. Dig down to reach softer subsoil under a hard crust. At the very least, spread a jacket over an unforgiving surface and place the bipod on the material. THE GOOD FLEX Once in position behind the bipod, seat the stock against your shoulder and push it slightly forward. This will “load” the bipod, seating the feet more firmly into the ground and reducing how much the legs will flex with the rifle’s recoil. REAR SUPPORT With the gun’s forestock resting on the bipod, your left hand (for a right-handed shooter) needs something to do. Double down on bracing by using your fist to steady the toe of the stock. Reach under your right armpit, grab the rifle’s rear swivel sling and make a fist. Make slight elevation changes in point of impact by squeezing or relaxing your fist."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"222 USE BINOCULARS AS A SPOTTING SCOPE Backcountry elk hunters and high-country sheep and goat hunters look to shave ounces from their loads, so converting binoculars for use as a spotting scope holds down weight and limited pack space.

The results aren’t as clear and bright as a dedicated spotting scope, but not having to carry both binoculars and a spotting scope is a definite bonus for wilderness hunters. MOUNT STEADY Tripod adapters allow binoculars to be mounted to the ¼-inch screw bolt of a tripod. Many manufacturers offer adapters specific to their models. TWICE AS NICE Optical doublers double the magnification of binoculars, turning an 8X binocular into a 16X spotting scope, or a 10X binocular into a 20X elk-finder.

If you put an animal down, spit swab before approaching, in case you need an accurate second shot. And do this exactly the same way each time you shoot. A consistent spit swab will lead to consistent points of impact. Keep a cleaning jag attached to your ramrod. After a shot, pop a .22 cleaning patch in your mouth, wet it with saliva, and wring it out by pressing between your tongue and the roof of your mouth. Run it down the barrel and out, and you’re ready to reload. It’s also a good idea to finger space your ramrod to stop the spit swab an inch or two above the vent hole.

Locate two or three trees about 6 to 8 inches in diameter and growing 10 to 15 feet apart. Decide which direction you want each tree to fall. To hinge-cut, use a chain saw to create a downward cut at a 45-degree angle on the side of the tree that is opposite of the direction you want it to fall. Make the cut at waist height or slightly higher. For larger trees, loop a rope around the trunk as high as you can reach, and have a buddy pull on the rope to prevent the saw blade from pinching. Such a helper can be useful even with smaller trees—the less that you cut through the trunk, the more future growth the tree will be able to maintain, which will keep the bed not only thickly vegetated, but provide browse."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"232 STEER DEER WITH BUCKETS When television host and Outdoor 3-D Archery World Champion Travis “T-Bone” Turner wants to steer a buck to his bowstand, he hits the woods with a stack of 5-gallon buckets.

But not all bucks are so accommodating as to approach from the same spot every night. “He might show up within 100 yards of a certain tree, trail, or field corner,” Turner says, “but that doesn’t help very much when you’re shooting a bow.” So Turner steers these deer to his stand with buckets. Yes, buckets. “They stack like traffic cones for easy toting, and to a whitetail they say, Detour—go that way.” If a certain deer tends to show up anywhere along a 100-yard stretch of a field edge, Turner places a line of four or five of his 5-gallon buckets parallel to that stretch, 100 yards or more into the opening. He then hangs his stand along the edge of the woods, lined up evenly with the farthest-downwind pail. “When the buck comes out, he’ll spot those buckets, be leery, and instead of marching into the field, he’ll hug the edge and, with luck, walk right to you.”"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"233 PRUNE AN APPLE TREE FOR DEER Many overgrown farmsteads hold apple trees.

Figure out exactly where your blind will be, then make a “hip hole” by digging out 4 or 5 inches of dirt at the position of your butt. Once inside the blind, pull the knee of your shooting side up a bit, which will give you a bit of leverage to drive your backside into the hip hole as you sit up for the shot.

Its accuracy is legendary among snipers and beanfield shooters, and it has plenty of oomph for 300-yard deer. 6.8 SPC Designed as a longer-range cartridge, this .270-caliber round is super versatile, with muzzle energy between the .223 and .308. 7MM-08 REM Flat-shooting and accurate, this necked-down .308 carries plenty of energy far down- range, making it a fine choice for beanfield deer, elk, antelope, and other big game smaller than brown bear and moose. .260 REM For shooters looking for relatively low recoil, the .260 offers that, plus much higher energy than the .243 Win. .300 BLK Many shooters like the load for its subsonic possibilities, but at fairly short ranges—200 yards or less—the supersonic 110-grain bullet is a great hog and deer load. .338 FED Another round from the .308 family tree, this one is necked-up to handle bigger game like moose and elk.

If you shoot with one eye closed and then open both eyes, it will take a few seconds for your brain to sort out the differentiated views and those few seconds can be critical. And perhaps most important, shooting with one eye closed leads to what Gunsite Ranch founder Jeff Cooper calls “getting lost in the scope.” You see the animal with both eyes, pull the gun to your shoulder, and then waste valuable seconds waving it around trying to find the target. For those who have shot one-eyed for years, opening both eyes is easier said than done. The off-season is the time to kick the habit. METHOD AT THE RANGE Start off with two strips of masking tape on the outside of the nondominant-eye lens of your glasses. This helps to prevent the double image that is so bothersome to shooters. As you get used to keeping both eyes open, switch to frosted tape, then try a smear of petroleum jelly. Gradually reduce the amount until you need none. AT HOME Back up range practice by dry-firing your rifle. Mount the rifle, acquire the target, then shift your attention between the view in the scope and the other eye, to pick out all the details of the environment surrounding your target. The trick is to do this while maintaining a strong “cheek weld”— never lifting your face from the stock."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"240 SAVE YOUR EARDRUMS FOR A QUARTER I keep foam earplugs stashed in my hunting jacket pockets, blind bags, and gun cases. The low-pressure polyurethane memory foam is made to compress easily and re-form in the ear canal for a tight fit that blunts any sound. Covered with a skin of slick material, they are easier to insert and much more comfortable to wear than the bargain-basement PVC stopples. They offer a noise reduction rating (NRR) of up to 32 decibels, and they make high-repetition shooting safe and comfortable. I make sure to plug up any time I share a blind with a ported gun. The trick is getting the plugs deep enough into your ear canal. You can’t just stuff them in like shoving letters into a mail slot. Here’s the drill: Roll the plug in between your thumb and your first two fingers. Be careful not to roll a wrinkle into the plug. Roll it gently with increasing pressure until it’s a third the original size. Start with your right ear—hold up the plug in your right hand while still gently rolling it tightly between your fingers. Reach over the top of your head with your left hand and pull the tip of your ear lobe upward to open up your ear canal. Now, insert the small end of the ear plug deeply, retaining enough of the larger end to easily grasp and remove. Repeat with the other ear. And don’t wait. Proper insertion takes two hands and more time than you have when the ducks are coming."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"241 SHOOT A DOUBLE GUN FOR PLANTATION QUAIL Many quail plantations ban the use of any semiautomatic shotguns in favor of double- barreled side-by-sides or over-unders. Part of the reasoning has to do with conservation: Limiting a shooter to two shells for each covey rise reduces the number of birds taken. Double-barreled guns are also shorter, which means they are easier to maneuver in thick cover; and well balanced, which makes them a pleasure to carry hour after hour. But there are other reasons a “twice-barrel,” as one of my old Southern hunting pals calls them, are the go-to gun for Southern quail shoots. SAFETY Quail hunting often involves a number of living creatures other than quail, from additional hunters in the party to pointing dogs, flushing dogs, horses, and mules. There’s no safer way to carry a shotgun than to carry a double gun broken open. SELECTION Most double guns allow the shooter to select which barrel to fire first. In modern shotguns with screw-in chokes, this allows shooters to customize varying chokes for the hunting situation—for example, a cylinder bore in the first tube for close- flushing birds, followed by a tighter modified choke inside the second barrel for the next shot at farther distances. The double trigger guns can provide an instant choice simply by moving your trigger finger. The shotguns with barrel-selecting buttons aren’t quite as quick. SHOT SIZE The double-barreled configuration also gives shooters the ability to load barrels with different shot sizes. That’s a bonus for waterfowlers."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"242 REMOVE A RECOIL PAD There are plenty of reasons to remove a recoil pad, from replacing the existing pad to accessing the spring on a recoil-operated shotgun. First, however, you have to solve the riddle of the invisible screw slots. Many recoil pads are affixed to the stock with two Phillips-head screws, which are recessed deep into the pad and fit flush against a stiff spacer that lies next to the stock butt itself. You might never find them—or even know they are there—until you find the tiny slits or channels that allow a screwdriver access to the screw heads. To sleuth out these hidden slits, try this: With the butt end of the stock between the fatty bases of your thumbs, use your thumbs to apply outward pressure to the face of the recoil pad. Start at one end and work your way down. The screw slits or holes should peek open just enough to be visible. If that fails, pull the tip of a large flat- bladed screwdriver over the pad to reveal the holes. To insert a screwdriver, use a drop of dishwashing liquid or oil on the tip of a Phillips-head screwdriver, and push the point into the screw. It is critical to avoid stripping the screw head, so be sure to carefully rotate the screwdriver back and forth to feel for a tight fit. If you feel much wiggle in the screw tip, use a slightly larger screwdriver. While you have the screws out, perform a little bit of maintenance: Paint the threads with a silicone-based waterproofing agent before replacing them."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"243 BUILD A GUNSMITH BOX I keep a basement table cleared off and dedicated for gun cleaning.

Don’t forget the camo—head to toe, nose to fingertips. After all, you’re asking those birds to practically look you in the eye. GIVE A FLAP Grab the flag firmly, raise it over your head, and shake it vigorously as you flap it down toward the water. Picture your mallard back-flapping hard as it descends the final 10 feet to land. You can see the flash of those white underwings in even the shadiest corners of a swamp, and that’s what you want to replicate. Repeat three times quickly. PLAN YOUR SALUTE As the ducks begin to close the distance, they’ll be looking right down at you. Similar to calling, you should work the flag only when the ducks are “on the corners” as they loop around the decoy spread. When the hunting slows down, however, you shouldn’t be afraid to give the flag a hearty flapping every few minutes to grab the attention of cruising mallards you might not see. DO THE WAVE If you and a buddy are hunting out in thick timber and beaver swamps, a pair of flaggers can mean an especially deadly strategy. Stand about 5 to 10 feet from each other, and shake the flags in a row-row-row-your-boat round style: As one flag nears the water, that’s when the other flagger starts his turn. This sequence helps simulate one duck following another to the honey hole."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"248 COOK A DUCK WITH A STICK My hunting partners and I watched in amazement as our Athabascan Chipewyan guide cooked a whole duck on a stick.

It is not required that you put on a moosehide hat that has been sewn by your mother while cooking a duck this way, but it doesn’t hurt. Total cooking time will be about 20 minutes. STEP 1 Cut a 1-inch-thick green stick 18 to 24 inches in length. Sharpen one end. Gut and pluck the duck. STEP 2 Remove the feet and the wings. Our host left the bird’s head on, an impressive but not necessary flourish. Butterfly the duck through the breast, not the back. To do this, insert a stout knife along one side of the breastbone keel, cutting all the way to the backbone (A). STEP 3 Loosen up the bones and flesh by working the duck back and forth between your hands, like trying to break a stick. Place the duck on a flat surface and press with the palm of your hand (B). STEP 4 Skewer the duck by running the stick in and out of the breast meat on one side of the keel, and then on the other.

Semiautomatic shotguns in particular are at risk for freezing up in temperatures that drop into the teens or even lower. The first aid that some hunters turn to—additional lubrication of the action—is actually the worst possible solution you could use. Lubricants can thicken, especially when mixed with powder residue and grime, and gum up the action. Here’s what to do to make sure your scattergun performs in the next “polar vortex.” STRIP THE OIL Disassemble the barrel, receiver, and action. Spray metal parts with Break-Free CLP. Wipe all excess oil away, and wait a few minutes. Now give the parts another good wipe. Use cotton swabs to soak up any excess pooling in nooks and crannies. You want to remove any and all oil. In the field, a squirt of lighter fluid can serve as an emergency de-gunker. DUST BATH Use powdered graphite to dust primary action parts such as bolt rails and ejection latches. OUTSIDE STORAGE Many problems occur when a warm gun is brought into cold, outside air. Moisture condenses on metal gun parts, then freezes in the field. The night before a hunt, store your gun safely outside."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"251 PUT MORE SPRING IN YOUR SEMIAUTO SHOTGUN Duck hunters who frequently go wading in beaver swamps, timber holes, and deep impoundments should take a harder look at those springs in recoil-operated semiautomatic shotguns.

Water can seep in at the recoil pad and at the sling swivels, and once it’s in, it can rust recoil springs that compress inside the stock. Here’s how to make your shotgun beaver-pond worthy. Access the spring tube and get it cleaned up. Replace the factory spring with a new one or, even better still, one made of stainless steel. While reassembling the shotgun, waterproof the hollow synthetic stock by laying down a bead of AquaSeal silicone sealant around the recoil pad seam and the holes for the sling swivel."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"252 MAKE EXPLODING FLASH TARGETS FOR AN OLYMPIC-STYLE SHOOT Those big clouds of clay pigeon dust you see on shooting shows aren’t there because the shooters center every shot.

New powders, bullets, and ignition systems make it easier than ever to shoot—and clean—a modern smokepole. Here’s what you need to know to turn back time and go hit the woods with your own front-stuffer. FLINTLOCKS Traditional flintlocks fire when a cock, holding a fixed piece of flint, strikes a metal plate called a frizzen, sending sparks downward into an external flash pan filled with powder. The powder ignites, sending a tiny piece of the inferno through a small hole in the barrel called a touchhole. This flash ignites the main powder charge behind the bullet. PERCUSSION CAPS Introduced in the early nineteenth century, percussion cap firearms soon replaced flintlocks. A small cylinder of copper or brass holds a tiny load of impact-sensitive explosive. The cap is placed over a hollow metal nipple. When the hammer strikes the percussion cap, the flash ignites the main powder charge. IN-LINE MUZZLELOADERS The blackpowder arms modern era began in 1985 when a Missouri gunsmith, Tony Knight, debuted an in-line muzzleloader. Moving the percussion nipple from the side of the combustion chamber to directly behind the powder charge meant the flash would travel in a direct line—ergo “in-line”—to the powder charge. The innovation kicked off the current revolution in blackpowder firearms. More recent models include both bolt and break actions, with screw-in breech plugs that make loading and cleaning much simpler than ever before. Most in-line muzzleloading guns use 209 shotshell-styled primers."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"254 TRY A BLACKPOWDER PELLET The new kids on the muzzleloading block, pelletized powders come in tablet form. Instead of measuring a charge of loose powder in a powder measure and then pouring it into the barrel, a shooter simply drops a number of pellets down the barrel before seating the bullet. Fans love the ease of reloading, while critics argue that pellets crack and chip, eroding accuracy from shot to shot. Pyrodex and Triple Seven come in pellets, with other popular choices including IMR White Hots and Shockey’s Gold Sticks."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"255 TAKE A BLACKPOWDER POWDER While generically the guns discussed here are all called “blackpowder,” in fact you have a number of options. True blackpowder is an ancient mix of charcoal, sulfur, and potassium nitrate. It is a “fast-burning” mix that ignites easily. Classified as an explosive, blackpowder comes in several grain sizes. FFFF is the smallest grade commonly used, favored by flintlock shooters as a flash pan powder. FFF is the go-to for muzzleloaders of .45 and smaller, while .50 caliber shooters tend to load up with FF powder. Many modern shooters use Pyrodex, a substitute that is very close in burn characteristics to blackpowder. Slightly more difficult to ignite than blackpowder, Pyrodex can be more safely stored and shipped. It is not classified as an explosive, so it is more widely available than blackpowder. While Pyrodex remains the top choice, other various powder-substitute brands, such as Triple Seven, Goex Clear Shot and Black Mag3, have plenty of fans. Most are formulated without charcoal or sulfur, which makes them easier to clean than other powders. Newer gun-powder products such as Blackhorn 209 and Black MZ are even cleaner-burning and produce high velocities, and have improved resistance to humidity and moisture. There is disagreement about how closely these various propellants simulate true blackpowder in volume and burn rates, so use product-specific guidelines when calculating loads."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"256 KNOW YOUR BLACKPOWDER PROJECTILES Blackpowder rifles require their own particular projectiles. Here are the ones you’re likely to see. ROUND BALL This traditional bullet is seated in a cloth patch, which serves as a type of gasket to seal the bore and engage the barrel rifling. It’s most often used in traditional flintlock and percussion cap guns. CONICAL BULLET Elongated conical bullets weigh much more than round balls of the same caliber and shoot harder and fly flatter. SABOTED BULLETS The bullet fits into a plastic cup, or sabot (from the French term for “shoe”), which engages the barrel rifling. The sabot allows lighter, faster bullets of slightly smaller diameters than the barrel. Many saboted bullets are made with copper jackets like conventional centerfire ammunition, making them extremely accurate and deadly at ranges Daniel Boone only dreamed of. POWERBELT A mash-up between the elongated conical bullet and the sabot, PowerBelts feature a plastic base that expands to seal the bore, then pops off during flight.

The belt encircles the tree at a height just above your waist, and then connects to loops on a safety harness. This not only provides a safety catch should you slip, but allows you to lean back and work with both hands. You’ll need a safety harness built to accept a lineman’s belt, but most have the two required connections, as do many harnesses specifically made for tree stand hunting. To use a lineman’s belt, put on a safety harness. Attach one end of the belt to a harness loop above the point of one hipbone. Swing the other carabiner around the tree, grab it, and clip it into the harness loop on the other hipbone. Lean back and the loop supports your weight.

That’s why many hunters compulsively use commercial scent killers. The problem is that their cost can make you apply them sparingly, which is like putting deodorant on only one armpit. Here’s a simple homemade scent killer. Hydrogen peroxide kills the bacteria and fungi that turn sweat into a deer-busting funk, and baking soda deodorizes whatever sneaks by.

Like supermodels, they keep getting lighter, stronger, faster, thinner—and more complicated. SHAFT Microdiameter arrows will have smaller shafts of stiffer materials that can lead to greater arrow penetration. Arrows with a varying spine rating seek to tame the flex that occurs when the enormous load of energy is applied at the release of the bowstring. Double and even triple spine arrows are on the market. Stiffer back sections take up the force, while lighter middle and forward sections contain most of the flex. NOCKS Lighted nocks help you track the arrow’s flight. BROADHEADS While open-on-impact broadheads often outsell fixed blades, not everyone is convinced they fly better. They may not penetrate as well, either. But they do offer one advantage: wicked wound channels. Open-on-impact broadheads are getting ever larger, with cutting diameters well over 2 inches. If your arrow drifts back and hits the liver, that could make a difference. FLETCHING Short 2-inch vanes are stiff and tough and have nearly replaced 4-inch vanes. Most factory arrows have straight or offset fletching, but helical fletching gets an arrow spinning more quickly for greater stability. New high-speed photography has some arrow designers rethinking the role of fletching in windy conditions and longer distances."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"271 GET THE PERFECT NOCK FIT Little things matter, especially when you’re trying to send an arrow toward a target half a football field away.

Here’s the 5-minute drill. STEP 1 Clean it. First, put down the sandpaper. You want to clean the wood sidewall rails, not reshape them, and sandpaper will do both. Lightly rub the rails with a Scotch- Brite pad or other scouring pad designed for non-stick pots. STEP 2 Rechalk the bottom of the paddle with a bit of carpenter’s chalk or a chalk made specifically for turkey calls. Blackboard chalk contains wax, and that will deaden the call. Some callers shy away from chalk of any kind and go with Daniels’ advice and use pine rosin instead. STEP 3 Work the call a few times, then look closely at the underside of the paddle. Are there shiny spots? That means grime or grease still soil the sidewalls. Back to step one. STEP 4 The tension screw on a box call lid has been set precisely by the call maker, but over time, the screw can turn and affect the call’s sound. To adjust, first mark the exact position of the screw with a black marker. Tighten first, since it is more common for screws to loosen than to tighten. Give the screw the slightest turn, and test for call tone before making any other adjustments."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"274 BLOW A WINGBONE YELPER The beauty of a wingbone call is the organic feel to its sound, which can fool toms sick and tired of the calls hunters today carry around in their magnetic vest pockets.

And you won’t need to store a full-blown pig cooker in the driveway for 12 months a year. YOU’LL NEED 40 cinder blocks • A grill platform— either borrow the grate from a friend with a “real” pig cooker, or MacGyver your own out of nongalvanized expanded metal (galvanized metal will emit toxic fumes when heated) • Extra-heavy-duty aluminum foil or roof sheeting of nongalvanized metal • A shovel or two • One heckuva pile of wood—better get a half-cord, just to be safe; or augment with charcoal • BBQ sauce for basting BUILD IT Clear an area of level ground of any combustibles like leaves, sticks, or leaf litter. If not level, shovel out a flat spot. To construct the firepit, lay out a rectangle of cinder blocks in the pattern shown. On each short end, leave a cinder block “A” out of the pattern. You’ll add heat to the firepit by moving out that particular cinder block below “A” and shoveling coals into the fire through the opening. On the ends of the long sides of the pit, turn the cinder blocks marked “B” sideways"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"so the holes are exposed. You can regulate heat by regulating airflow through these cinder blocks. Cover the holes with other blocks or a board as needed. Once you are ready to cook, a grill grate or expanded metal platform will rest on this platform. If an expanded metal platform isn’t strong enough to hold the pig, add 3 pieces of rebar across the width. TO COOK Build a ginormous fire inside the pit and allow it to burn down to coals. You’ll want about four inches of hardwood or charcoal briquette coals on each end of the pit. (Essentially, divide the pit into thirds longitudinally: the shoulder end, the ham end, and the rib middle. You’ll use little direct heat under the middle third.) You’ll also want a nearby auxiliary fire that will produce more coals that will be shoveled into the pit on an as-needed basis. Place a whole wild pig or other animal skin-side-up on the grate. Now add the third and final layer of cinder blocks, on top of the others. This will hold a layer of aluminum foil or metal sheeting above the swine. Cover the entire grill. If using aluminum foil, you’ll need to be very careful to knock down flare-ups with water so the foil won’t ignite. From here on out, it’s a mix of art and experience. What you may lack in either you can make up with trial and delicious error. Figure on 6 to 8 hours of cooking, depending on the size of the animal. Keep most of the fire’s heat under the hams and shoulders. When you think you’re about halfway there, use a couple of shovels to help lift and flip the pig. Baste liberally. All helpers get to eat the ribs, which are ready first. The whole hog is done when the interior temperature of the hams hits 180 degrees Fahrenheit."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"276 KEEP WILD GAME FRESH Your trophy is now heaped on the counter top in small mountains of meat. Here’s how to keep the meat fresh-as-the-day-it-was-butchered if you plan to eat it in ... 1 WEEK There’s no need to freeze it for such a short time period. Keep the meat well wrapped, and in the coldest part of the refrigerator, far away from the door. 1 MONTH Center the meat in laminated freezer paper. Fold the short ends over the meat and turn the package over on a countertop, keeping it in contact with the counter to push out air. Once it’s flipped, use your fingers to press the air out of the sides as if you were sealing an envelope. Repeat twice more and tape the flap. 1 YEAR A vacuum sealer sucks all the air out of packages, staving off freezer burn and saving freezer space. If you don’t have a vacuum-sealer, freeze each cut in water. Place the meat in a zip-seal freezer bag, and fill the bag with ice water. Press down on the bag as you seal it so that water spills out of the top, driving air out of the bag. Also, I like to mark each package with the date, the cut, and a detail about the deer, such as “7- pointer by the swamp gate.” That way I can relive the memory with each morsel. MY TOOL: KIMBER MODEL 84M I wanted a treestand rifle, a lightweight gun short and compact enough for thick woods hunting but with enough oomph to touch a buck snacking on cut corn 200 yards distant. I didn’t need a shoulder cannon. I wasn’t interested in the short mags and beanfield ballistics. I simply wanted a gun to have and to hold from this day forward, and something I could perhaps eventually give over to a young deer hunter coming up the trail. I didn’t have all of the money in the world, but I’d squirreled away enough for something a little special. So, I wound up with a Kimber Model 84M in .308. I dare you to try and take it from me."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"The 84M is built around the .308 Winchester, which is beefy enough to suit my needs perfectly. The action has just enough length to handle that cartridge, and no longer, and the barrel is just long enough to maximize ballistics for those bullets. A gorgeous satin-finished walnut stock carries a match chamber, barrel, and trigger. The barrel is glass-bedded and matte-finished. I like its three-position safety. The gun weighs just 5 pounds, 10 ounces, and is made in America. It is one sweet rifle. This rifle is unlike all of my other deer guns, and that’s just how I wanted it to be. My very first deer rifle was a beloved behemoth. I was young and had big dreams, and I’d fallen under the Jack O’Connor spell of the hot caliber that could do it all—the 7mm Remington Magnum. For my college graduation gift, my entire extended family put into the kitty and out came a Weatherby Vanguard. Built in ’83, that gun must have weighed 83 pounds. It was too much gun for Southern woods hunting, a bit too fancy for a journalism graduate getting by on 12 grand a year. But that Weatherby wasn’t just my deer gun, but my dream rifle. One day, I’d haul it out West for elk. One day, I’d settle it across a heavy pack for a long shot at a tundra caribou. One day it was all too apparent that it was too much medicine for my style of woods hunting. I went the opposite extreme on the next deer rifle. After my shoulder grooved from the Weatherby’s bulk and weight, I settled on a lever gun—the Marlin 336 in .30-30, which was seeing new life thanks to the recent introduction of Hornaday’s LeverEvolution cartridges. I ordered up the rifle in snazzy stainless steel. O’Connor would have kicked my butt, and I would have deserved the trouncing. The Marlin made a fine treestand deer rifle, as long as the sun wasn’t shining. I loved that gun and still do, and tried to love it without a roving eye. But two deer busted me in a single week, thanks to that stainless steel. We had a quick divorce, and I went looking for a trophy wife. Hello, sweet Kimber. That .308 has filled my freezer three winters running, and my most recent whitetail with the gun is the most memorable one yet. By the time I caught a glimpse of the 9-point swamp buck he was quartering away, 80 yards out and about to disappear into a canebrake. I had to lean farther out from the treestand than I wanted, and twist farther to the right than the textbooks say I should, just to thread the barrel through a screen of muscadine vine. Thanks to that short, light rifle, I caught the deer in the last half-second of opportunity, and pulled the trigger the instant the scope reticle crossed into the vitals. The buck fell in his tracks. So far, my match with the Kimber seems to be made in heaven. I’m thinking the marriage will last."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"THE WORST IT CAN GET I’ll tell you how bad it got. The last time I saw my son, Jack, he lay gasping by the trailside, face ashen and fearful, his head cradled in the arms of my wife. Two other hikers kneeled beside them. One had a different brand of rescue inhaler than the one we typically carry, and thank God for that. Our albuterol wasn’t working. Maybe the terbutaline would. That was four, maybe four-and-a- half minutes ago, and when I left them, I could not tell you if Jack would be alive when I saw him again. Now my daughter, Markie, has vanished around a bend in the trail. I tried to keep up, but she is a cross-country runner and my knees are wrenched. When I told her to run, run like she’d never run before, she vaulted through the forests below Wyoming’s Teton crest with the winged feet of Mercury. Now I sank to one knee and prayed. That was the best I could do. My son clinging to life in my wife’s arms, my daughter running for her brother’s life. That’s how bad it got. Few of us appreciate how quickly life afield can turn south. When we’re headed out for elk camps and high-country lakes, swamp rivers, and salt marshes, we plan and pack for rough weather, rough roads, high water, poor fishing, flat tires, blown zippers, ripped tents, broken rods, and all the other evil contingencies that threaten to derail a blissful fishing or hunting trip. But when it comes to planning for situations where life or limb lie literally in the balance—and not just the fate of a wet sleeping bag—too many of us give it short shrift. A bottle of ibuprofen, a wad of old Band-Aids, maybe a tube of antiseptic cream, and we are out the door. It can get bad in the blink of an eye. I’ve been carted off a dove field unconscious, dragged to the truck by my pal Scott Wood, who thankfully didn’t wait for the ambulance to show up. I hazily recall a mid-highway ambulance transfer, injections, the world fading in and out of pure black and fuzzy light. The culprit: the sting of a single ground wasp. I’ve been on the other side of the examination table, too, field-treating all manner of ills. I’ve closed up gashes with superglue, carved away portions of infected toenail and flesh and disinfected the remains with whiskey, closed wounds with butterfly closures snipped from duct tape, removed treble hooks buried to the bend, forced food into companions stooped over in a hypoglycemic bonk. None of this stuff is rocket science. Read, think, prepare. Once, in the midst of a horrific climbing accident, I rolled my brother over on his back so he wouldn’t drown in a pool of his own blood.

We immobilized his back as best we could and raced for help. Our simple, straightforward, right-out-of-the-books first aid probably saved his life. As Markie dashed down the trail, I turned to pick my way back toward Jack and Julie. Already my mind was sifting the details, trying to figure out where this went wrong. Thanks to a late, wet spring in the Grand Tetons that year, the pollen load was epic. Bump a pine tree on the trail and yellow sheets fell. Every breeze sent paisleys of whirling pollen wafting through the woods. Jack suffers from the occasional allergy attack, so we always carry an inhaler. But he’s a strong hiker, and we didn’t think twice before setting out to retrace a favorite 14-mile loop. My mistake. A big mistake. On the far side of Jenny Lake, miles from help, the asthma attack was instant, and instantly life-threatening. Within minutes, fleet-footed Markie made it to a floating dock that served a park boat for tourists who didn’t want to hike all the way around the lake. Fortunately, a seasonal ranger was there, and radioed to park headquarters. In no time flat, a rescue boat was in the water. Meanwhile, Markie and I made our way back up the trail to Jack. I hobbled up the final rise, heart in my throat, with no clue as to what I would find. As I rounded the trail, I saw Jack sitting upright—the other hiker’s rescue inhaler worked. Jack still struggled for every breath, but there was color in his face, and he gave me a weak wave. Julie shook her head in relief. The evacuation team arrived, hooked Jack up to oxygen, lashed him to a backboard, and headed down the trail. Five hours later we were out of the clinic and back at camp, knees still weak from having dodged the bullet.

In fact, it’s now more important than ever to know how to decipher cartographic symbols, because topo maps are now accessible by desktop, laptop, tablet, and smartphone. Here’s how to read the lay of the land ... literally. GENERAL MAP DESCRIPTORS Along the top and bottom of most maps are helpful blocks of information. The map series relates to how much land area is covered by the map. The most detailed paper maps are 7.5 series maps, which cover 7.5 minutes of latitude and 7.5 minutes of longitude. Converted to miles, that covers a land area of about 9 by 16 miles. The 7.5 series was completed in 1992 and was recently replaced by the digital National Map. Declination is the difference between true north and magnetic north, in degrees. The farther north your location, the greater the declination—and the greater the need to adjust when navigating by map and magnetic compass. Scale is marked at the bottom of the map. COLORS Background colors typically relate to vegetative cover. • Green: Woods, forests, and scrublands. • White: Open or semi-open lands, such as grasslands, agricultural lands, and deserts. Could include rock outcroppings. • Gray: On maps with large blocks of public lands such as national forests and national parks, gray will indicate private inholdings within public boundaries. CONTOUR LINES These are imaginary lines that trace elevation above sea level. Contour lines that are close together indicate steep land, and the closer the contours, the steeper the terrain. Cliffs can look like nearly solid blocks of merged contour lines. Contour lines that are farther apart indicate flatter lands. There are three types of contour lines. Indexed contours will typically be marked with numerals that indicate elevation. Often, each fifth contour line is an indexed contour. Between the heavier indexed contour lines are lighter intermediate contours. These are not marked with elevation, but help express the general steepness of the terrain. In very flat areas, maps might be marked with supplementary contours, which appear as broken dashes. They indicate an elevation change of half of the total between the contour lines on either side. Ridges will appear as a series of Us and Vs that point towards lower elevations. The highest elevation contour on a ridge, hill, or mountain will be marked by a closed circle of contour lines. Sometimes the very peak will be marked with the elevation and an X. A gap, pass, or saddle appears as an hourglass, where the contour lines from opposing ridges nearly touch."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"WATER FEATURES All water is marked in blue. Small streams are marked with a single blue line. Intermittent streams are marked with a blue line broken by three dots.

Buildings and smaller structures are marked with squares of varying sizes. ROADS AND TRAILS Large interstate and divided highways are marked in red. Other roads are marked in black.

Its two main purposes are to dampen excessive needle movement and prevent static electricity from throwing off the bearing. Bubbles can form in two ways: At high altitude or in extremely cold temperatures, the liquid can contract, leaving a bubble. Or liquid can leak out of the seal or a tiny crack in the housing. Compass air bubbles are very common and won’t affect the compass unless they are so large—say, a quarter-inch in diameter—that the movement of the direction arrow is impeded. If your compass develops a small bubble, place it in direct sun. The heated liquid in the housing will then expand to its original volume. If the bubble continues to grow, it’s likely that there’s a tiny leak in the housing. If this is the case, you should simply replace the compass."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"279 TREAT A SNAKE BITE Snake bites require prompt attention, so don’t hesitate to begin moving towards medical facilities ASAP.

This will allow you to easily return to your starting point, or to duplicate the route of travel at a future date. Track logs are, basically, electronic bread crumbs that the GPS drops at various intervals of time and location. They are fabulous tools, provided you know how to operate the function on your GPS unit. Look for a menu heading that reads “track log,” “track recording,” or something similar. Turn the function on. Now the GPS will record a track point at predetermined intervals. The default settings are likely something along the lines of one point for every 25 meters traveled or whenever there’s a significant change in your speed or direction. For most of the applications this works well, but there may be times when you want to drop more or fewer bread crumbs. If your route needs a finer scale—say you are trying to stay in a narrow creek channel on a flooded lake—then you should set your GPS unit to record more frequent track points. Another setting to consider is “record” mode. Choose “wrap” to keep the display on and the track log will keep continually operating, even if it fills up and needs to overwrite your starting data. Choose “fill” if you do not want the starting data to be overwritten. The unit should sound an alarm to let you know when it’s reaching its storage capacity. Once set, let the track log function keep you on track.

They cut like a small saw, and I use mine to saw off small branches when clearing shooting lanes, shear handfuls of cattails for duck blinds, cut a length of cordage, and more. You can’t sharpen serrations with a flat stone, however. The serrated blade will still do a decent job even when dull, so many folks don’t bother to sharpen them at all. But you should, and here’s how. Get a progressively tapered diamond hone made specifically for serrated blades. They’re cheap and very effective. Think of the hone as being cone-shaped. Match the diameter of the cone to the scalloped portion of the serration—this is called the “gullet” (A). A tapered sharpener will easily match a wide variety of blade gullet sizes. Essentially, you are sharpening teeth, one at a time. Holding the hone at the original angle of the serration’s edge bevel, place the small end of your tapered hone into the gullet, and then push the hone down until the entire width of the serration is nearly filled with the hone (B). That’s the stroke you’ll want; Repeat until you can feel a fine burr on the flat back side of the blade. Move down the blade, sharpening both sides of each serration.

There are two reasons for this: First, ounce for ounce—all 3 of them—space blankets provide more protection from the elements than any other item. And second, I came of age during that glorious era when all things associated with “space travel” carried the panache of a dozen LeBron James, with a hundred-fold the gravitas. Space blankets were developed in the 1960s after a heat shield on the Skylab—America’s first space station—began overheating. NASA turned to a company that made Christmas tree tinsel to recreate a type of heat-deflecting parasol for the space module. The material used also evolved into personal emergency blankets for astronauts—the space blanket. The manufacturing process is pretty straightforward, though not simple. Pure aluminum vapor is vacuum-deposited onto an ultrathin sheet of plastic. The result—a sort of souped-up aluminum foil—packs down to a tiny size, turns away wind and rain, and will reflect more than 95 percent of body heat. They have been a fundamental part of survival kits for a half century. These days, the original space blanket is still out there, in a sea of knock-offs. It packs down to the size of a deck of playing cards, and unfolds large enough to wrap up a couple of lost and shivering hunters. Like many survival items, it is a tool, not a miracle. If you are wet and lying on the snow, you will not be warm in a space blanket. It’s part of the puzzle of staying alive. You’d better have fire and water, as well. The space blanket has also evolved into a related item, a heavier, far more durable version that goes by various names—sportsman’s blanket and all-weather blanket among them. This is what many people think of when they think of a space blanket. They are puncture resistant, with reinforced edges and grommets. When folded, they are maybe 4 times the size of the original space blanket. I’ve used all-weather blankets as a tarp, emergency blanket, roof during a hailstorm, and makeshift bivvy sack. I’ve used them as a canoe sail and an erstwhile cooler—stuff a dressed deer with ice, wrap with an all-weather blanket or two, and I can age a deer for up to 4 days in the back yard. My very favorite way to spend the night outdoors is to spread out an all-weather blanket, toss my sleeping bag on top, and sleep under the open sky.

Yes, there actually is such a thing. Developed by Justin O. Schmidt, an entomologist at the Southwest Biological Institute in Tucson, Arizona, this index is used to rate the various degrees of perceived pain visited upon a person by the large number of stinging hordes that have stung Schmidt and his colleagues over the years. Schmidt’s index rates those stings on a scale of 0 to 4; I’ve provided the real-world context. PAIN FACTOR INDEX 0 Imperceptible.

Severe allergic reactions to insect stings and other complications from allergens can lead to anaphylaxis, which includes a sudden drop in blood pressure and difficulty breathing. In extreme instances, the reaction can kill within half an hour. This is not to be taken lightly. Anyone can have a life-threatening allergic reaction to an insect sting, even if they’ve never had a problem with stings before. Avid backcountry travelers should know how to treat the condition. BE PREPARED When traveling with new companions, ask if anyone has issues with insect stings or other allergic reactions. If so, find out if they carry an epinephrine auto- injector, such as an EpiPen. If you like to travel widely in the backcountry, it’s a good idea to carry one with you. ACT QUICKLY Be alert to the first signs of a bad allergic reaction: skin reactions such as itching (especially around wrists, the insides of elbows, and on the face), hives, pale skin, or swelling of the lips, throat, or anywhere on the face. Be aware of any constriction of the airways or any trouble breathing, a weak pulse, or vomiting or nausea. At the very first sign of any of these indicators, take action. Do not wait to see if symptoms worsen. GET HELP Head to emergency medical facilities, whether a hospital or doctor’s office. If in the backcountry, begin an evacuation plan: Contact emergency personnel about the potential need for rescue, and plan on where the rescue will take place.

But we could do that only after we weighted the rope end with a knot that provided enough mass to be tossed to our stranded pal. He was quite appreciative. A standard heaving-line knot doesn’t add quite enough bulk and weight for such a heavy-duty, get-me-out-of-here-before-I-drown-in-the-mud rope hurling. But this supercharged version does. Before you try it, here’s one must-know knot factoid: A bight is a loop in which the line ends do not cross, like a U. READY Make two bights in the end of the rope. This results in three “rungs” of rope. Leaving plenty of line in the working end for the wraps, weave the working end under the middle rung and over the bottom rung. Then loop it around the back of the knot and bring it between the top and middle rungs. SET Wrap all three rungs six to nine times. On the last wrap, thread the working end through the loop. THROW Tighten by pulling alternately on the standing end of the line and the bights on each end of the knot.

I got to learn this myself at 4 A.M. at the mouth of the Atchafalaya River on Louisiana’s Gulf coast. To free up our duck boat, we dug a trench beside the boat (A), as close to the craft as possible and parallel to the keel. Then we rocked the boat side to side (B) and slipped it into that deeper channel next to the boat. If that hadn’t worked out, we could have backed out (C) or extended that shallow trench a bit further to deeper water.

It’s not as simple as scoring a few flakes into a twig, however. With just a little practice, you can carve a fuzz stick in 90 seconds or less, and putting a mass of thin, spark-catching curls on a stick of wood is nearly as impressive as the flames it will produce. Here’s the drill. STEP 1 Split soft wood such as pine, spruce, or aspen into a foot-long length, 1 to 1½ inches on each side. Choose a knot-free stick that has a long, straight grain. Flat- ground blades work better than hollow-ground, but experiment to find a knife that you can control with steady pressure. STEP 2 Wedge the stick between your chest and a tree trunk, or hold it firmly against a chopping block at a 45-degree angle. Lock your wrist and use slow, steady pressure to push the knife edge—starting at the middle of the stick—down the corner to shave a thin, curly strip. Bring the knife back up to the starting point, rotate the stick very slightly, and begin another. Avoid sawing back and forth, but experiment with the orientation of the knife tip to create curls that trend toward one side or the other. Point the tip down and curls will come off to the right. Point the tip up and the curls will shave off to the left. STEP 3 Longer, thicker curls are needed to ignite larger kindling, but to boost the fuzz stick’s spark-catching ability, finish off with short, super-fine curls. Done with one corner? You’re not done yet. Rotate the stick, and work up another."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"292 MAKE FIRE WICK AT HOME Fire wick—a wax-impregnated cotton string used to start fires—will burn for several minutes, and it’s a snap to make at home.

Keep the gas tank at least half-full during winter. You’ll need the fuel so you can remain warm in a survival situation, and more fuel in the tank will help in preventing condensation of water, which can lead to your engine failing at cold temperatures. Always inform someone where you are driving and when you are expected to return, or leave them a detailed note. If stranded, stay with the vehicle, which is much easier for rescuers to spot than a person stumbling through snow. Hike to find help only if odds of your rescue are remote or if help is in close range and you know exactly where it is. Clear snow, dirt, or ice from the tailpipe of a stranded vehicle to avoid getting carbon monoxide poisoning. Crack open a window on the lee side of the car when running the motor or before you light a stove, candle, or space heater. If high winds are sneaking in through the car doors and seals, use snow to seal the cracks. Avoid sweating, however, and use a sun visor as a snow shovel to keep hands dry. Wipe off head and tail lights so searchers can spot your vehicle from a distance. Run the motor no more than 10 minutes an hour to conserve fuel.

LET IT BITE Hold a single page of newsprint up at a 45-degree angle at shoulder height. Rest your knife blade on the edge of the paper at a shallow angle, and slice. A sharp blade will immediately bite into the newspaper and begin a clean cut. A dull blade will skip along the edge, or tear into the paper. WATCH IT GLIDE As the knife blade bites into the paper, it should easily glide with no significant sticking points. Run the entire length of your blade through the paper. If the blade cuts cleanly then hangs up, that may indicate a tiny nick or burr at that spot on the edge of the blade. Listen to the glide as it cuts: The higher the pitch, the sharper the blade.

A warming climate and drought across much of the American West makes wildfire a growing threat to wilderness travelers. When fire conditions are high, remain vigilant. Situational awareness is your first line of defense. At the first sign of smoke, start making a plan. Even if the fire is distant, know that the powerful updrafts of a blaze can send embers for long distances and ignite a secondary blaze nearby. PLOT AN ESCAPE ROUTE Look for a route that heads downhill, but avoid canyons, deep gullies, and draws. Heated air can rush up these natural chutes. Stay away from resinous trees such as fir. When heated, expanding tree sap can cause trees to explode. Try to make it to a wet area—a swamp, stream or marsh. Jump in if flames get close. IF FLAMES CLOSE IN Shed your pack and as much synthetic clothing (nylon, Gore- Tex, etc.) as possible; it will melt quicker than most natural materials will catch fire. Find the lowest spot you can, ideally in a clearing or field as far from trees as possible. Kick away as much flammable material as you can to create a 20-foot-diameter circle.

The typical right-hander will hold the slingshot in the left hand, so look for a fork where the main branch crooks to the left at 30 degrees or so, but a fork goes off to the right at a 45-degree angle. Cut the frame and let it dry for three weeks. POWER UP A number of companies sell ready-made replacement bands with pouches attached for slingshots. The trick lies in a strong connection: An inch and a half from the top of each slingshot “arm,” drill a hole that’s slightly smaller in diameter than the band. Bevel the end of the band with scissors and thread it through the hole—a pair of hemostat clamps will make this easier. Snip off the bevel.

It’s going to happen eventually. The worst case I ever saw involved my buddy who was asleep on his boat. In the middle of the night he rolled over onto a jointed Rapala plug, and stuck two of the hooks into the back of his thigh—to the bends—and he was wrapped up in a blanket to boot. By the time he stumbled into my tent the flesh around the hooks was swollen and leathery. That was ugly. Still, if you’ve got a Woolly Bugger in your thumb, a crankbait hook in the leg, or a spinnerbait in your arm, there’s no need to quit fishing. Here’s how to remove a hook sans screaming and get back in the action. STEP 1 Snip the hook or lure free of the main fishing line to get rid of any tension. If possible, detach a treble hook from its lure and clip off any of the hook points not stuck in your person. Next, cut a 15-inch strand of line from your reel and tie the ends together to create a loop. STEP 2 Double the loop of fishing line, then pass it under the bend in the hook close to your skin. The line should be resting against the hook bend. Push down on the eye of the hook. This raises the point—better aligning it with the hole it made when entering. STEP 3 Now, take a deep breath, and in a single, quick, sharp tug, yank the line straight back. (This step is often best executed by a fishing partner.) As with a Band- Aid, the faster you pull, the less it hurts, often popping right out without causing pain. If the wound is still bleeding, apply pressure until it stops. Put on antiseptic ointment and a bandage before you get back to fishing."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"302 CATCH FISH WITH A TRIGGER SNARE Trigger snares are among the most basic and effective tools for obtaining survival food, and just about everyone has seen photos or illustrations of these snares set along game trails and logs where small animals frequent. But the same primitive technology can be used to catch fish. Here’s how. STEP 1 Find a sapling located approximately 4 to 6 feet from the bank of a body of water. Look for places where fish congregate—deep holes on the outside of stream bends, near blowdowns where trees have fallen into the water, and other structures. STEP 2 Carve the trigger. You’ll need a simple one made of a base peg and a hook. Cut a notch into both. Tension from the bent sapling will keep the trigger “cocked” until a fish takes the bait, pulling the hook free of the peg and snapping the bent sapling upright. STEP 3 Tie a cord from the top of the sapling to the top of the trigger hook. Tie a hook to one end of the fishing line and bait it. Tie the other end to the bottom of the trigger hook, where it fits into the notch, making sure you have enough line to reach into the water. Now, bend the sapling over, pointing straight towards the water. Pull the trigger hook straight down to the ground—that’s where you pound the trigger base into the ground. Set the snare trigger by fitting the notches together. STEP 4 Carefully place the baited hook in the water.

MY TOOL: PERSONAL LOCATOR BEACON When my wife gave me a personal locater beacon (PLB) for Christmas, my first reaction was one of mild annoyance. Didn’t she trust me to be able to get myself out of an emergency? That ignorant response was soon replaced with thanksgiving. The more I thought about it, the more it made sense.

What if I had a heart attack on the back side of my hunting lease and no one was around? Ask yourself any of those questions, or any like them, and you’ll soon understand that carrying a PLB is pretty smart. It’s overkill—until you’re in a situation that could kill you. I now toss that PLB into my hunting pack or fishing bag every time I head out the door. There are two broad types of these beacons. In addition to the PLB there is its marine kin, the EPIRB, which stands for Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon. PLBs are more mobile and are designed for folks who are hiking or otherwise away from marine environments, while EPIRBS typically have features associated with boating, such as automated strobe beacons, flotation, and a longer battery life that transmits for 48 hours as opposed to 24. When activated, all of the devices interface with the international Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking System, called COSPAS-SARSAT. A combination of NOAA polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites detects the distress signal and relays that information to first responders on the ground in the area of the emergency. The better ones are GPS enabled, which can cut rescue time dramatically. These are not toys. By law, owners are required to register the devices with NOAA. At the end of 2013, the database contained more than 400,000 registrations. PLBs are not available so you can call in water because you are thirsty. They are to be used in grave circumstances only, where there is a clear peril to life or limb. Once you hit that button, there’s no cancel function, and the next thing you see might be a rescue chopper overhead with an SAR team rappelling down on ropes. In certain circumstances, that might be the only ticket to tomorrow. My wife knew what she was doing: giving me the gift of one more chance."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"317 SPRAY A BEAR INTO RETREAT When in bear country, I am never farther than 12 inches from the largest can of bear spray I can buy. I have it on my belt when fishing, on my pack strap when hiking, by my head when sleeping, and by my feet when my pants are around my ankles as I answer nature’s call. When I see fresh signs of bear—rolled-over rocks, scat, torn berry bushes, gleaming white fangs surrounded by patches of snarling brown fur—I unholster the spray and hold it in my hand. In test studies, bear spray stopped charging grizzlies 92 percent of the time. It’s estimated they can prevent injury 98 percent of the time. Pretty good odds. To use effectively, practice with two cans of inert bear spray. It’s not difficult, but shaking knees and a pounding heart won’t make it any easier. Here’s the drill. DRAW Practice readying the can by taking off the safety strap, pushing the nozzle safety clip free, and grasping the can with two hands. If pack straps hinder you, move the straps or tuck them away. Speed is of the essence. A charging bear can move at 44 feet per second. AIM LOW Pace off 50 feet away from a shrub, tree, or some other inanimate object. Practice by drawing the can and spraying a short 2-second burst, moving the can from side to side. Aim slightly below the target. Bear spray will billow up from the ground into the bear’s face. Aim too high and the bear could run under the spray. STRIKE TWICE Practice discharging a second plume of spray to back up the first. Yell loudly while aiming. If this were a true attack, you would drop your pack and begin backing away. GO ALL OUT Practice emptying the can to get a sense of the total load available. Most cans will spray for about 9 seconds. In a true attack, your last step will be to empty the can in the bear’s face. QUICK DRAW Now repeat the drill, but imagine close quarters: You’re surprised by a bear so close there’s no time to draw. Practice discharging the can from the hip or shoulder strap."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"318 SPARK FIRE WITH A KNIFE Use a high-carbon steel blade, or scrounge up an axe head or steel file. Find a hunk of hard stone. Flint is a classic; quartz, quartzite, and chert also work well. Stay away from round rocks; you will need one with a ridge sharp enough to peel slivers of metal from the steel. Add highly flammable tinder. Start sparking. STEP 1 Hold the stone up with the sharp ridge extending out from your hand horizontally. STEP 2 If you’re using a fixed-blade knife, wrap up the sharp edge with a piece of leather or cloth. Using the back of your blade, strike the stone with a glancing, vertical blow. STEP 3 Depending on where your sparks land, hold down a piece of char cloth, tinder fungus, or Vaseline-soaked cotton ball under your thumb and on top of the rock, or set the fire-starting material on the ground and aim the sparks down toward it. STEP 4 Strike the stone, spark the tinder, and gently blow into a flame."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"319 TIE THE KNOT THAT FIXES ALL A shear lashing mends a broken tent pole or hiking staff. It rigs a long pole from two shorter ones. Lash three poles together with one-half of this handy knot, and you have a tripod. Place the butt ends of two poles parallel to each other. Tie a clove hitch around one pole, then wind the rope around both pieces for a distance equal to the diameter of the two together. Finish it off with another clove hitch. Repeat on the other end."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"320 PREVENT A GUTPILE MAULING When you’re dressing big game out in remote bear country, it may often become necessary for you to leave a part of the meat in the woods. Here’s one way to avoid an unhappy encounter with a bear that’s found your animal: Before leaving the meat, tie a brightly colored rag or piece of T-shirt around a sharp stick. Drag the rag through the carcass to infuse it with blood, then drive the stick into the ground near the carcass. When you return, approach from downwind and use binoculars to see if the flag has been disturbed. If so, stay away."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"321 OPEN A CAN WITHOUT A CAN OPENER When the zombie apocalypse reigns in the streets—or you stumble into a remote cabin after having been lost in the woods for a week—being able to open a can of food without any utensils will put you at the front of the survival line. All you need on hand is your food can, a flat rock or piece of concrete, and enough remaining muscle strength to rub the can just the right way. Most canned foods are made with a rimmed top that is crimped closed with an extra layer of metal. It might be hard to see, but it’s there, and once you remove that thin layer of metal from the rim, the top will pop off. You’ll need to find a hard, flat surface such as slate or other flat rock, or a piece of concrete or a smooth brick. Be sure that surface remains steady, turn the can upside down, and grind the top rim vigorously back and forth (A). You might see liquid dribbling out; that indicates progress. At this point you can turn the can right side up and pry the lid off by sticking a knife blade into the open seam (B), or keep on grinding it until you see that you’ve removed metal from all the way around the rim. Turn the can over and squeeze the sides of the can to pop the top free (C). Be very careful—all that grinding has created sharp metal edges."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"322 MAKE A DUCT TAPE BUTTERFLY BANDAGE A butterfly bandage is used to pull together the edges of a wound for quicker, cleaner healing. Here’s how to make one on the fly. Clean the wound thoroughly and dry the skin. Cut a strip of duct tape 1 to 1½ inches long by one-quarter to ½inch wide. Using sharp scissors or a knife, make small cuts to create two tabs in the middle of the bandage (A). Fold one tab in so the two sticky sides are together (B). Fold the other tab over the first (C) to create a nonadhesive strip in the that will not stick to the cut. Stick one end of the butterfly bandage to one side of the cut, pinch the cut together, pull the bandage across the cut, and stick the other end in place. For larger wounds, additional butterfly bandages can be used like sutures."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"323 COOK FISH ON A LOG The modern variant of planked fish involves a store-bought cedar board and a stainless steel backyard grill. It wasn’t always so. In a survival situation you can cook planked fish without any utensils at all. Trout and panfish are small and thin enough to cook quickly, and fat enough to stay moist in the heat of an open flame. And you don’t even need a carefully squared plank. First, split an 8- to 12-inch log round in half. (Stay away from the wood of pine and other conifers.) No way to split wood? No sweat. Just use a round log. Whittle a half- dozen 2-inch wooden pegs with one sharp end. Clean the surface of the log and lay out the fish, either whole or skin side down. With the point of a knife, poke through the fish to mark the log where the pegs should be, remove the fish, then use the tip of a knife to drill a starter hole for the pegs. Replace the fish and then tap the pegs into place. Build a teepee fire so the flames rise at least to the level of the fish, and scoot the fish in place. If needed, chock the log with a rock or stick."},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"324 MAKE A DUCT TAPE BOWL Tear off two pieces of duct tape in equal lengths, about 18 inches long. Sit down on the ground with a bent knee. Form a cross with the tape, with the intersection of the cross on top of your knee, sticky side down, and press the tape against your leg. Make a bowl shape by wrapping your pants leg with more tape until you have it sized just right. Carefully remove the tape bowl, and add more duct tape to the interior to waterproof the bowl."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"INDEX A acorn cap, whistle from 287 allergic reactions 286 antlers, mounting 202 apple trees, pruning 233 arbor knot 120 archery hunts.

That mix is what makes the magazine so great, what’s helped it remain relevant since 1895. But at the heart of every issue are the skills. The tips that explain how to land a big trout, the tactics that help you shoot the deer of your life, the lessons that teach you how to survive a cold night outside, told with authority and flair. You’ll find a ton of those skills in The Total Outdoorsman Manual , but there’s not a book big enough to hold them all in one volume. Besides, whether you’re new to hunting and fishing or an old pro, there’s always more to learn. You can continue to expect Field & Stream to teach you those essential skills in every issue. Plus, there’s all that other stuff in the magazine, too, which is pretty great.

Edward Nickens began his career writing a weekly outdoors column for the Chapel Hill (N.C.) News for 25 cents per column inch. He’s been writing for Field & Stream since 2003 and has been one of the magazine’s most prolific and wide-ranging authors. His work has won many national awards and has been collected in numerous “best of” anthologies. Nickens’s first book for Field & Stream , The Total Outdoorsman Manual , has sold more than a quarter of a million copies worldwide. In addition to writing about hunting, fishing, and wilderness travel for Field & Stream , he is host and field producer for Field & Stream’s Heroes of Conservation web series, co-host of the brand’s online Gun Nuts series, and for five years was host and field producer for the Total Outdoorsman Challenge on Outdoor Channel. He also writes for various other national magazines, for which he has reported on conservation issues from the rain forests of Nicaragua to the tundra forests of the Yukon. Nickens is based in North Carolina, where he chases ducks, deer, doves, trout, and squirrels—when he’s not chasing them across North America for Field & Stream ."},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This book is the culmination of work by two extraordinary teams: the staff at Field & Stream and the staff at Weldon Owen Publishing. I’m indebted particularly to Anthony Licata, Colin Kearns, and Joe Cermele at the magazine. Field & Stream ’s approach to providing timeless editorial content to modern readers is unmatched. And my hat is off to the Weldon Owen gang: Mariah Bear and Conor Buckley especially, whose understanding of how to craft books that are as useful as readable—not to mention gorgeous—makes working on projects like this so exciting. Much has changed about hunting and fishing over the past few thousand years, but not this: We like to tell our stories and share our knowledge. It’s been that way since we first gathered by a campfire with a rabbit taken with a club, and it’s been that way now that we gather through social media. This book is only possible because of all the hunters, anglers, guides, writers, editors, and photographers, who showed me their stuff—and let me share it all with a big, broad world. While every skill in this book has been fact-checked and field-tested, the publisher makes no warranty, express or implied, that the information is appropriate for every individual, situation, or purpose, and assumes no responsibility for errors or omissions.
