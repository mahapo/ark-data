In fact, it’ s a fantastic idea to add a waterfall to your pond because not only does the sound of moving water add to the overall aesthetic, but also it is beneficial to the health of your pond. W aterfalls help to oxygenate the water in your pond, keeping the plants and fish healthy and your pond looking stunning."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"There are two structures you will need in order to add a waterfall to your pond. First, it is necessary to have a pond (hopefully you knew that) for the water to fall in and, two, you will need something for the water to cascade of f and into your pond (most people use rocks or stones for this, but there are numerous options). A pump (the size will vary depending on the height and size of your waterfall) will move water up to the top of your waterfall and continue to recirculate it. The pump can be located either inside the pond underwater or outside of your pond concealed by a pump house or any sort of shrubbery or rock pile."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The best pond waterfalls are built either on a man made slope behind the pond (if you still have the dirt you dug to originally create the pond this works great) or , if you are fortunate, a natural slope near your pond. Under the materials you use to create the cascade (again this is usually stones) you will lay flexible pond liner over the slope. The pond liner ensures that no water will escape. As you begin to actually construct the structure for the water to cascade down, you want to consider how you arrange the rocks or whatever materials you are using. As you can imagine, the arrangement of these materials directly impacts how your waterfall looks or sounds. While you play with the arrangement you need to plan where your spillway rocks will be. Spillway rocks are the rocks where the water spills directly over. For dramatic waterfalls, you will want to create space between the spillway rocks using spacers, which can be anything from extra rocks to old bricks you have lying around the house."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"One last thing — you will not regret adding a waterfall to your pond! In fact, you will be genuinely surprised at how simple it really is. A waterfall will transform the ambiance of your backyard, keep your pond environment healthy and happy , and guarantee a look of humiliation from your neighbors as they peer over your wall. It’ s a win-win!"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"TOP 5 REASONS T O GO PONDLESS So maybe you don’ t have a pond. Or maybe you are considering installing a pond, but in reality all you want is that tranquil and entrancing sound that comes from a beautiful fountain or waterfall. If the soothing sound is ultimately all you are looking for (and honestly nothing will make your neighbors more jealous than the sound of peaceful moving water coming from your backyard oasis) there are many reasons why you should go pondless."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Here is the top 5: 1. Going pondless saves you the tr ouble of maintaining a healthy pond envir onment , which entails plant and fish upkeep, as well as cleaning. If you don’ t love spending time working and gardening outside or if you find yourself out of town frequently , going pondless is the right decision."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"2. Just like opting to not have a pool in your backyard, not having a pond can be a safe option for anyone with small children who might tumble in."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"3. Some pet owners will find themselves r elieved to not have a deep pond for several reasons, including finding out that their dog is of a type that loves to jump in, get soaked, and run inside. For some pets, a lar ge pond can also pose a safety issue."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"4. If you have a yard with limited space, building a lar ge pond is a large commitment. If outdoor space is tight at your home, going pondless will help you keep a functional yard while still enjoying the sight and sound of refreshing water .

Although building a pond doesn’ t have to be expensive, it is definitely a more economical option to go pondless. Not only will the initial costs be less, but you will also save money on maintenance and upkeep."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"HOW T O CREA TE A DISAPPEARING WATERFALL It is no wonder that disappearing waterfalls are all the rage in backyard landscaping. These beautiful water features are easy to create and install, economical, and incredibly functional. Whether you have a lot of space or just a small corner you are wanting to fill, a disappearing waterfall is just the trick to enhance your at-home living (and, of course, make your neighbors insanely jealous every time they hear the beautiful sound of moving water). Sour ce: http://www .flickr.com/photos/7282451@N02/417067749/ There is endless possibility when it comes to creating a disappearing waterfall. These awesome water features have the ability to be as big or as small, as short or as tall, as you"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"need them to be. Homeowners with more room to work with might choose to create a waterfall that produces loud, rushing sounds as the water crashes from one pool to the next. Someone with less space or who wants a more tranquil sound can create a disappearing waterfall with a single drilled stone and still enjoy the peaceful bubbling sound of refreshing water. And the nice thing is that no matter which size or style you choose, they all end up transforming your outdoor space from blah to a space that you truly can enjoy and relax. Disappearing waterfalls work by placing a hidden pump in the lowest reservoir (or the only reservoir if you are making a small water feature). The pump is located in a sturdy structure that is buried deep into the ground and built to withstand the weight of heavy rocks and stones. The pump runs the water through either tubing or PVC piping and back to the top of the feature, which is usually a weir or just the top of a drilled waterfall stone. The entire waterfall feature, which can even include a stream, is formed with pond liner ."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Sour ce: http://www .flickr.com/photos/7282451@N02/417067758/ The first step in creating a disappearing waterfall is of course choosing where you are going to place it. The most important rule of thumb is to place your water feature in a location where you will receive maximum pleasure, both audibly and visually . It would be dumb to place a small waterfall at the very edge of your yard, especially if the only reason you have for going over there is to listen to your relaxing water sounds. Instead, choose a place by a deck, a patio, or outside a window so you can enjoy your water sounds without having to remember to do so. Also, keep in mind that if you decide to put your disappearing waterfall in a location with full sun or one that is not protected from lar ge gusts of wind, you will have to refill water much more frequently than necessary . The next step is deciding how big or what you want your waterfall to look like. W ould you like to have several pools for the water to run down? How about a small stream? Or maybe you just want one beautiful stone formation that falls directly into your pump reservoir? Here are the basic guidelines for creating disappearing waterfalls of any size or style. 1. Typically , the top of your waterfall has a weir , which can be purchased from most home improvement stores or local water specialty stores. The weir can be used in conjunction with a filter mat and lava rock mesh bag to keep it working properly with fewer hang-ups."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"2. You can use any type of stone or stone design to create the upper levels of your waterfall . There are even specialty stones drilled specifically for water flow . Using premade stones such as these will make this process even easier , although you may miss out on the fun of learning to arrange stones for optimum water sound (See “Secrets for Creating The Perfect W ater Sound” below .) 3. Your entire waterfall structure, every pool and stream (even if you are only creating one single reservoir), needs to be lined with quality pond liner . Using good material, such as 45 mil EPDM pond liner , will ensure that your waterfall moves water instead of leaks water . 4. On top of the liner you will want to create layers of different size stones , the lar gest being on the bottom and smaller on top. Not only will the stones look better than just seeing pond liner , but also they help to produce a beautiful, natural sound as the water passes over ."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"5. If you are building several pools for your waterfall, you will want to make your basins the appr opriate size . In general, you want your smallest flow basins at the top of your waterfall and the lar gest at the bottom. They should increase in size from top to bottom. Make sure that your lar gest basin at the bottom is plenty big to house and completely hide your pump reservoir . 6. Your final, or possibly your only , pool is where you will place your pump r eservoir . The pump for your waterfall should be buried with layers of stone (the lar gest stones on the bottom and the smaller pieces on the top). This final layer of stones is what makes your waterfall a vanishing waterfall, so be sure to do a good job with it and to choose appropriate stones (or even crushed pieces of cinder block) in order to achieve the overall appearance you want. 7. Finally , you will run tubing or piping fr om the pump in the lowest basin to the top of your water feature. Y ou will want to hide this in order to keep your waterfall looking nice. There are many possibilities when it comes to doing this so get creative and use what you have on hand. Stones and shrubs can both provide excellent camouflage and, of course, the most ef fective way to conceal the tubing is to bury it completely ."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"HOW T O CREA TE A V ANISHING FOUNT AIN For the same reasons that people enjoy disappearing waterfalls, vanishing fountains are becoming more and more popular as well. Using the same basic principles of disappearing waterfalls, vanishing fountains are even simpler to create and install because instead of having multiple pools and streams, there is only one single reservoir . A single reservoir , however , does not need to limit your creativity . Vanishing fountains can consist of one or several unique water features, such as drilled stones, ceramic pottery (glazed types hold up best outdoors), and custom statues – the possibilities are truly endless! Sour ce: http://www .flickr.com/photos/yoshikazut/5663552561/"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The same guidelines for choosing a site for a disappearing waterfall apply for vanishing fountains – it’ s best not to put them in a location that receives full-sun all day or that is unprotected from strong winds. Additionally , you want to place your fountain in a location that is easy to enjoy throughout the day and year -round. Here is everything you need to know when it comes to adding a beautiful vanishing fountain to your landscape. 1 . The water featur es for your fountain will sit on top of your reservoir . You will need to know how many water features you are going to use and how much space your fountain design will take up in order to create a reservoir that is the appropriate size. 2 . There are two ways you can create the r eservoir for your disappearing fountain. For all of you DIY -ers, you can use 2 x 12’ s, plywood, and quality pond liner to build a reservoir that is the exact size and shape you want. For all of you who are looking forward much more to the finished product than the actual building of it, there are pre-made reservoirs that you can purchase. Most of the pre-form reservoirs come in 2’, 3’, or 4’ squares. The cost of these reservoirs varies, but you can expect to spend just over $100 for the smallest and under $400 for the largest. 3 . Place an automatic float valve in your fountain to ensure that your hidden reservoir remains filled. 4 . Once your reservoir is in place in the ground, you will need a pump that will be located in the reservoir under a layer of strong reinforced plastic grating. Y ou will also want to place several concrete blocks in the reservoir as support for the grating, rocks, and water features that go on top. Y ou do NOT want all of this weight to be resting on your pump – this is a recipe for disaster and definitely money down the drain. Be sure you cut a hole in the grating (about 1’ x 1’) so you can access your pump if"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"you need to without having to completely disassemble your fountain. 5 . A tubing adaptor will connect to the pump and ball valves will control how much water flows into each fountain piece at once. 6 . Use vertical PVC piping to extend from the pump into the top of your water feature(s). If you want to use a piece of pottery that does not have a hole in the bottom for you to put your piping through, you can make your own hole using a masonry bit. 7 . The hole in your water feature that the piping goes through will need to be properly sealed (RayCrete or EZ-Poly and plumber ’s putty should do the trick!) 8 . You will cut the PVC to the appr opriate height when you are finished, but don’ t be hasty because the height of the PVC determines the flow of your water . In other words, don’ t cut until you are 100% satisfied with the way your fountain sounds and looks. 9 . On top of the reinforced plastic grating that covers your reservoir , you will place ¼” plastic mesh netting. Y our choice of stones , hopefully ones that match your fountain and overall design, will cover the netting. 10 . Lastly, you may consider installing a timer so that your fountain runs when you are home, but turns of f and saves energy when you are gone."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"CREATIVE RESOURCES AND UNIQUE IDEAS FOR CONSTRUCTION Backyard waterfalls and fountains can be created from a wide variety of materials and resources.

By using a masonry bit, you can carefully drill a hole through the statue that will allow you to insert tubing from the pump at the bottom. A hole at the top or on the side will allow the water to flow out. This can be a great way to create the unique water feature you have been looking for ."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"4.

Building a small, amphitheater -like structure behind the running water can also increase the sound of the waterfall. T o do this, use stones to make a hollow structure hidden behind the flowing water . The size of pump you use will also af fect the sound that is produced. Obviously , larger, more powerful pumps will be able to run more water more quickly and therefore create a louder sound than a smaller pump, which moves less water at a slower pace. Keep in mind that as you increase the size and power of your pump, it becomes more likely to have water splashing out, which means you will be replacing the water in your feature more frequently than necessary . Always remember that the secret to creating the perfect sound takes time. There are professional consultants that get paid a lot of money to do this job and for good reason: it is not easy .
