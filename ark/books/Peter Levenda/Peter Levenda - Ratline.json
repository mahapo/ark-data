The rumors were persistent; the evidence suggestive. Tantra is aboutmagic and power. So was the Third Reich. Was it possible that the world'sgreatest symbol of evil had actually escaped Berlin in 1945? In time, moreinformation came to light. In December of 2009, it was revealed that the skullthe Russians claimed was Hitler's—salvaged from the bunker in 1945—was not thatof Hitler at all. The news made headlines around the world. Then in 2010, filesfrom the Office of Special Investigations of the Justice Department weredeclassified, revealing a history of American intelligence providing cover forNazi war criminals.RATLINEAll this was inspired by the principle—which is quite true within itself—that inthe big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broadmasses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata oftheir emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in theprimitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the biglie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in littlematters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would nevercome into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believethat others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Eventhough the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to theirminds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there maybe some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves tracesbehind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to allexpert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying.—Adolf Hitler , Mein Kampf, vol.

I picked my way gingerly overthe stone slabs that were set down in an almost haphazard fashion, threateningto twist an ankle with every step. Leading the way was a plainclothes securityguard. Around me a small crowd was gathering: young, dangerous-looking men withcurious expressions. I was the only foreigner in the cemetery, probably the onlyforeigner for miles.But I was not the only foreigner they had ever seen. Recently, visitors had beencoming from Europe and the Middle East to pay their respects in this nondescriptplot in an obscure graveyard on the far side of the world.Thirty-two years ago, I had been on a similar expedition and had nearlydisappeared in the torture cells of a Nazi estate in the Andes mountains. I hadbeen alone that time, trusting to luck and my instincts to survive what wascertainly a foolish mission to uncover one of the links of the Ratline inPinochet's Chile. This time, after a bone-rattling eight hour drive throughsmall towns, tea plantations, and remote forests, I achieved my objective justas the muezzin began calling the faithful to prayer.I hoped that was a good sign.I was there with a professor of anthropology from Indonesia's largestuniversity. She served as interpreter and camera operator, a task far beneathher but one that she shouldered without complaint. She would provide my coverstory to the guards, that I was a relative from abroad seeking the grave of hisuncle. But the guards knew exactly whom I was seeking. The name on the tombstonehad become famous, but the “real” identity of the corpse was more famous still.As I finally reached the tomb, a stone box surrounded by a neat wrought-ironfence and gate, one of the guards leaned down over it and reverently whisperedthe name of the cemetery's most notorious inhabitant:“Hitler.”How I came to be there, and why I began to take this outrageous story seriously,is the theme of this book. I'd been researching Nazism for decades, with aparticular emphasis on Nazi mystical ideas as well as on the escape routes usedby Nazi war criminals to escape justice, the “rat lines.” I have appearednumerous times on television documentaries concerning the strange beliefs thatfueled the Nazi Party. I've been asked to speak on this subject to groups inAsia, Europe and North America, and have been interviewed for radio and podcastmore times than I can remember. But in all of those years of describing andtrying to explain the motives of Nazi war criminals I had never seriouslyentertained the theory that Hitler had escaped Berlin at the end of the war.While I like to think I have an open mind, the idea of “Hitler in Argentina” wasjust too paranoid—and just too wrong—to be believed. After all, there was ampleevidence to prove that Hitler committed suicide in the Berlin bunker on April30, 1945. I had written about it. I knew the facts of the case. There wasnothing to question.Nothing, that is, until the year 2008, fully sixty-three years after the end ofWorld War II.I had been threatened by Nazis and neo-Nazis in Latin America, as well as byKlansmen and neo-Nazis in the United States. In most cases, the threats wereempty, but in Chile in 1979 the threat was very real and immediate. They weretorturing and killing people at Colonia Dignidad, and I could very easily havebeen one of them. I had lived with the constant presence of Nazism in itsvarious forms for decades. So how could I have missed what was possibly thebiggest story concerning the Third Reich for the last sixty-plus years?The answer lies in the psychological force that history has over us all. When ahistorian writes something down, it becomes the truth. We do not realize thatthis “truth” is only one of several—perhaps many—possible narratives. Aselection process takes place when one writes history. One leaves out certain,awkward or unpalatable facts in favor of others that advance one's thesis andthereby a kind of consensus reality is created. It's a fictional world like anyother but— like the so-called “reality” shows on television—it seems genuine andunscripted. We rarely get the opportunity to go behind the scenes, talk to theproducers and directors of our shared reality system, in order to satisfyourselves that what we see and hear is “real”.We have to take “real” on faith.July, 2008Faith.The cry of the muezzin floated over the hot and humid tropical air, carryingwith it a memory of ancient Arabia and old conquests by fire and sword. Mecca.Baghdad. Granada. Palm trees bent calmly under the weight of time and torpor,providing a shade that was more suggestion than reality. Men in sarongs andflip-flops were walking slowly in the direction of the mosque, smiling gentlyand murmuring comments or prayers. In the distance, as always, the volcano withits ever-present plume commanded the landscape like a giant waving a flag.Along the side streets, food vendors were setting up in anticipation of the endof the day of fasting. Charcoal grills were lit, and colorful bunches of exoticfruit—hairy rambutans and foul-smelling durians, weird-looking snakefruit withits coarse and scaly purple shell and green starfruit with their almosttranslucent skin—were piled on rickety wooden tables next to packages of instantnoodles and pink and yellow shrimp-flavored chips. The sun was setting, and thetalk among the students sitting on the mats of the lesehan—a kind of imprompturestaurant set out on the sidewalk, without chairs, where people sat on theground and waited for their food to arrive—turned to the topic of the day. Inthis case, Adolf Hitler.The year was 2008. I had been visiting the Universitas Gadjah Mada—theubiquitous UGM—in the city of Yogyakarta for the second time in two years. Myfriends there were mostly anthropology students and teachers, and they knew ofmy interest in the Nazi Party largely through my book on the subject, UnholyAlliance and through a talk I gave at UGM the previous year. As we feasted ontempe, ayam kampung, and kancong belacan, they told me of a news story makingthe rounds of a man who was buried in Surabaya. A white man. A foreigner.The story had originally come out in the 1980s, in a local magazine articlewritten by an Indonesian doctor. The doctor claimed to have met thisforeigner—Georg Anton Pöch—in the 1960s when Pöch was running a clinic on thefaraway island of Sumbawa. He lived there with his wife—another whiteforeigner—and the doctor was suspicious of them. They did not seem to have anyreal medical knowledge, yet they were running a clinic on this remote island,far to the east of Bali, on the other side of Lombok.The night grew around us, the comfortable darkness adding to the sense ofconviviality as the smell of grilled satay became overwhelming. The most ancientdish in the world, it is simply meat—lamb, beef or chicken—grilled on woodensticks over an open flame, but it commands respect everywhere in Southeast Asia.As we ordered a few dozen sticks of satay and the necessary accompaniment—aspicy peanut sauce for dipping—the story became more complex and I listenedpolitely, prepared to dismiss the speculation as fantastic.For the whole point of this story was that the mysterious foreigner was noneother than the icon of twentieth century evil: Adolf Hitler, the Fuhrer himself!The whole idea was preposterous, of course. Everyone knew that Hitler hadcommitted suicide in the Berlin bunker on April 30, 1945. I wrote about itmyself in Unholy Alliance, and noted the significance of the date for April 30is the German pagan holiday of Walpurgisnacht, made famous in Bram Stoker'snovel, Dracula. Stories about Hitler having escaped were legion, but they werelargely the stuff of half-baked conspiracy theories and the pulp novels thatcater to them. No responsible historian would take such an allegation seriously.But Hitler had become big business lately, in Indonesia as in the rest of theworld. His autobiography and political manifesto —Mein Kampf—was available inIndonesian translation as were The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion andHenry Ford's The International Jew. The founder of Jemaah Islamiyyah (or JI, theterrorist group linked with Al-Qaeda and responsible for the Bali Bombings ofOctober 12, 2002) told me to my face that there was an international conspiracyof Jews and Freemasons to rule the world. It was 2007, and I was sitting in hispesantren in the nearby city of Solo where I was part of a group calledPsychologists for Peace. Our local contact had finagled an interview with one ofthe most dangerous men in Indonesia as part of our itinerary, and it was anopportunity I could not pass up. I sat and listened to this ageing terrorist inthe white turban in 2007 use the same words, phrases and slogans of 1930sGermany and wondered if I had somehow wandered into a time warp. How could therebe antisemitism in a country that had virtually no Jews? How could they fearFreemasonry in a country that had no Masonic lodges?So Hitler was on the minds of many people. I understood that. As I slid a chunkof grilled lamb off its flimsy wooden stick I listened with half my attention tothe story of an old European man named Pöch and how they had confused him withthe dead Nazi of sixty years ago.And then, they dropped the bombshell, and this book is the result.A little background:In 1979, I went on a hazardous trip to Pinochet's Chile to investigate amysterious German colony in the Andes mountains. It was a country under martiallaw and military dictatorship. Six years previously the democratically-electedpresident of Chile—Salvador Allende Gossens—was overthrown in a military coupwith assistance from the Nixon administration. As a Socialist, Salvador Allendewas not an “acceptable”2 [part0004.html#ft2] government leader where RichardNixon and Henry Kissinger were concerned, and they lent covert support to thegenerals comprising the coup leadership in the days and months leading up to theevent. In the ensuing battle for Chile, Salvador Allende was slain and hissupporters were rounded up throughout the country, imprisoned, tortured andkilled. Among them was an American citizen, Charles Horman, who was murdered bysecurity forces at the National Stadium in Santiago shortly thereafter. His casebecame the basis for the Costa-Gavras film, Missing.The coup took place on September 11, 1973.What was not generally known or understood at the time was the extent to whichNazi and neo-Nazi organizations were involved in the military coup and in theevents preceding it as well as the torture of political prisoners that tookplace in succeeding months and days. In fact, the assassination of formerChilean ambassador to the United States—Orlando Letelier—and his Americancolleague Ronni Moffitt in Washington, DC in 1976 by agents of the Chileansecret police was organized and directed by an American neo-Nazi, Michael VernonTownley. Some of this was covered in my book, Unholy Alliance, which first waspublished in 1994 and which uses my visit to Chile as the introduction to astudy of Nazi ideology.Attempts to publish my account of the visit to Chile met with stiff resistancein 1979 and the years that followed. There was a general disbelief amongAmericans that Nazis were living openly in Chile. When I spoke of the mysteriousColonia Dignidad—a Nazi enclave high in the Andes to the south of Santiago whereI was briefly detained on that trip—the response was “They are probablyunpleasant people, maybe even Germans, but they are not Nazis.” This was eventhe reaction from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, whose founder expressed doubtthat the Colony had anything to do with Nazis or the escape routes war criminalshad been using for years.3 [part0004.html#ft3] Although I had seen the Colonywith my own eyes and been interrogated by the Colony's founder—Paul Schäfer,replete with military uniform, fatigue cap and Sam Browne belt—my story wasignored or treated with lofty disinterest. Even though the Colony had clearlyarranged for the military roadblocks that stopped my bus on the return from theColony to Santiago, to ensure that I was still aboard, and thus proved the closecooperation that existed between the Colony and the government of Chile, mystory was considered fictional. The mainstream media— which included respectedhistorians and even organizations that were supposed to specialize in thisinformation (such as the Simon Wiesenthal Center)—had decided that they wouldnot take seriously the story of a Nazi estate in the Andes, with electronicgates, bodyguards, and a sinister clinic that “disappeared” men, women andchildren. A month after I returned to the States, in fact, the columnist JackAnderson published an article about the Colony where it was revealed that it hadoperated as a torture and interrogation center for the Pinochet regime and thatit had been investigated by the CIA and Amnesty International. Anderson's columnappeared in the mainstream media, but Jack Anderson himself had been on Nixon'sfamous “enemies list” and even had been targeted for assassination by WhiteHouse “Plumbers”—E. Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy—a plot that fell throughwhen the Watergate scandal took center stage.4 [part0004.html#ft4]Yet, there was still no interest in the only existing eye-witness account of theColony by an American citizen who lived to tell the tale.A few years later, another American citizen—Boris Weisfeiler—went hiking in theAndes mountains. He was discovered by Chilean security forces, arrested andtaken miles away to the lethal embrace of the Colony. No one knows why.He was never seen again.And still, no one wanted to pursue this story.I bring these stories up to provide a context and to establish a baseline forthe information that follows. My personal experience in investigating the escaperoute taken by Nazi war criminals—the Ratline— is representative of many otherswho have dared to pursue this story. Serious investigators have been ridiculedor sidelined. We have been told that we misinterpreted what we saw, or that wedidn't see what we saw. We were told that we were dupes, victims ofdisinformation and were being paranoid, hysterical, or just simply nuts. Thefact that there was political pressure brought to bear on this story—with regardto Colonia Dignidad—and in the post-Watergate era no less—should have beenenough to encourage an editor somewhere to run with it.But none did.None, that is, until 1994 when John Douglas at Avon decided to publish UnholyAlliance. The book went in and out of print quickly. It became something of acult classic, with second-hand copies of the rack-sized $6.99 paperback goingfor more than sixty dollars on auction sites until it was re-released byContinuum in 2002, this time with a foreword by Norman Mailer.By then, Pinochet was gone from power in Chile and in 1996 there was a raid onthe Colony by Chilean security forces who came to arrest Paul Schäfer on childabuse charges. That raid—and further raids that took place over a period ofseveral years—revealed a cache of buried weapons and secret documents. Schäferwas not to be found, however, for he had fled across the border to Argentinawhere he was eventually located (in 2005), arrested and brought back to Chile toface imprisonment for 27 counts of child abuse. He would die in prison on April24, 2010.Revelations concerning the human rights abuses, torture, kidnapping, and childabuse that came out of the government raids—as well as eyewitness testimony overseveral decades—proved the basic elements of the story I had tried to tell backin 1979. Interviews with Colony residents further revealed that Colonia Dignidadhad been used as a safe house for Nazi war criminals on the run. Its locationnear the Chilean-Argentine border in the Andes made it an ideal location to runto, or run from (as Schäfer proved in his own escape). While my research wasconsidered inconvenient by the mass media at the time—and is still ignored inSouth Florida, where the anti-Castro (and pro-Pinochet) Cuban element is strong,politically and culturally—the facts as I stated them in Unholy Alliance werenevertheless demonstrably true.Other researchers were not so lucky.Paul Manning's masterful work on the complex Nazi program for expatriating theirill-gotten gains—Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile—was picked up by renegadepublisher Lyle Stuart after every other publisher turned it down. Manning was acolleague of iconic newsman Edward R. Murrow at CBS Radio and served duringWorld War Two in both the European and Asian theaters of operation, and reportedlive on the surrenders of both the Nazis and the Japanese. As a newsman andjournalist, his credentials were above reproach and his methods impeccable, andin fact he became a speechwriter for Nelson Rockefeller after the War. For hisresearch on the Bormann material, he even had the written support of former CIAChief Allen Dulles…at least, until he got too close.Whether or not Bormann survived the war to live in Latin America is immaterialto the documents and evidence Manning gathered for his book on the number-twoman in Hitler's Germany showing financial arrangements and wire transfersbetween German and Argentine banks to fund the underground Nazi network of safehouses and ratlines after the War. His thesis—that Bormann survived the war—wasroundly criticized by the very people who were his colleagues and they used thatto discredit his entire investigation, an investigation with explosive materialand solid evidence to back it up. Lyle Stuart paid for his participation in theproject by having his legs broke—it is said—during the very week he publishedManning's work.5 [part0004.html#ft5] Manning's son, Gerald, was subsequentlymurdered in what Manning's family believed was an act of retribution by Naziagents.Ladislas Farago, the widely respected historian of the Second World War andauthor of such books as Patton and The Game of the Foxes, risked his credibilitytowards the end of his life by publishing Aftermath: Martin Bormann and theFourth Reich. Detailing a lengthy investigation in South America on the hunt forBormann, including dangerous meetings with unpleasant men, Aftermath is full ofdocumentation not only on the search for the Nazi Reichsleiter but also on theculpability of the Roman Catholic Church in providing escape routes for Nazi warcriminals, of whom Bormann was only one among very many. It was, in fact,Aftermath that alerted me to the existence of Colonia Dignidad and inspired meto take the trip to Chile to see it with my own eyes.Farago, however, was savagely attacked and continues to be attacked even now,thirty years after his death, because of Aftermath. Academics and professionalhistorians—siding with the view that Bormann died in Berlin in May of1945—ridicule his research, his interviews, and his documentation insisting thathe was the dupe of unscrupulous individuals who created a kind of “cottageindustry” in Bormann sightings. In fact, there was no irrefutable evidence ofBormann's demise until DNA testing on a skull fragment in 1998, a full eighteenyears after Farago's death, and even then, that evidence has been questioned dueto the presence of red clay in the skull: a substance that does not exist in theBerlin soil where the skull was found (thus suggesting that Bormann had diedelsewhere and was buried in Berlin, only to be “discovered” a little whilelater).Again, the bulk of Farago's work on the Nazi escape routes was ignored andespecially his revelations concerning Catholic Church complicity in thoseescapes. Like Manning, he lost his credibility and his prestige for suggestingthat Martin Bormann had escaped to Argentina after the War. Like Manning, Faragohad based his conclusions on government documents and personalinterviews—sometimes in perilous circumstances.I knew all of this that sultry tropical night as I sat and listened to myfriends talk about the rumor that Hitler had escaped to Indonesia. One of themhad a copy of one of the news articles and she pointed me to a description ofthe old foreigner's documents, left behind in the care of a local woman hemarried after his first wife left him…or mysteriously disappeared.I am always interested in documents, and put down my satay, wiped my fingers ona thin paper napkin, and picked up the article. I started to scan it when oneword jumped out at me and dropped the proverbial bomb in the middle of mydinner.That one word was Draganovic.The man alleged to have been Hitler died in January, 1970. Thus the diaries andother documents he left behind had to have been written some time before. In1970 Draganovic was not a household name. He was known to very few people in theworld, basically only Nazi hunters and intelligence agents. To come across thatname in those documents could only mean that whoever it was who had died in 1970was someone whose escape from Europe had been orchestrated by the same man whohelped so many others flee justice: Krunoslav Draganovic.Monsignor Krunoslav Draganovic.Draganovic was a Croatian priest of the Catholic Church, and a devoted Nazi. Hissegment of the Ratline was known as the “monastery route” because it usedVatican credentials, Red Cross passports, and monasteries and churches as safehouses along the escape routes. It was a Ratline used by many of the mostinfamous Nazi war criminals including members of the dreaded SS.That meant that whoever it was who died in Indonesia in 1970 was a Nazi and awar criminal. No one else would have been able to use the monastery route. Noone else would have needed it. And among the papers left behind by thismysterious European was a passport number as well as an itinerary of the routehe used to escape Europe and wind up in Indonesia.As I sat and studied what little information there was available to me on thisman, I began to feel that strange sensation that accompanies the beginning of anew quest. It is part excitement at the prospect of a chase, mixed with anxietyover the knowledge that one could be wasting years of one's life in a fruitlesssearch for data over forty years old.One thing was for certain, though. A Nazi had escaped justice and wound up inIndonesia, of all the places on earth. Most Nazis were perfectly happy withSouth America or the Middle East. There was virtually no evidence at all thatany Nazis made it as far as Southeast Asia, on the other side of the world. (Atleast, that is what I thought at the time.) Yet, here it was. Definitive proofthat someone did.Why did this man travel so far from his fellow Nazis? Why did he pick as remotean island as he could find in Indonesia, rather than stay more comfortably inone of the larger cities on one of the larger islands? Jakarta, say, or evenBali? Why settle in a country that was in the midst of political turmoil?I resisted, of course, the idea that this was Hitler. Like everyone else of mygeneration, I grew up with the firm conviction that Hitler had died likeeveryone had said he had died: in the bunker, on April 30, 1945.Then, in December of 2009, a real shock came in the form of a report that NickBellantoni—the State Archaeologist of Connecticut—had managed to examine a pieceof what the Russians claimed was Hitler's skull. And the conclusion of thatexamination?The skull was that of a woman. And it was not Eva Braun. The Russians did nothave Hitler's skull.In fact, suddenly there was no forensic evidence that Hitler died in the bunker.Indeed, there was no evidence that Hitler had died at all.Those of us who are familiar with police procedurals and television crime dramaslike Law and Order and CSI know the importance of DNA evidence. When there is noDNA evidence—or, as in this case, no body at all—a crime is very hard to prove.When your only eyewitnesses are Nazis and Soviet spies, then you had better lookfor another case…or another line of work. And when the case is more thansixty-five years old and most of your witnesses are dead…well, you don't have acase anymore.If everything we had been told about Hitler's death, cremation and burial was alie from the beginning then it was starting to look like the Indonesians mighthave a point.Then, in 2010, the Justice Department released a report by the Office of SpecialInvestigations (OSI) which detailed how Nazi war criminals were protected fromprosecution by the US Government since the earliest post-war days; protected byAmerican intelligence, the military, and even industrial corporations.There was nothing for it. I had to find out who was buried in that Indonesiancemetery. Hitler or not, this was a key to some larger mystery. Questions had tobe asked. Consensus reality had to be challenged. The truth, however improbableor counter-intuitive, had to be revealed. My trip to Chile in 1979 had beenhazardous, and I was lucky to have left the country alive. What would be thecase with Indonesia? If I pursued this story, would I wind up in a Javanesejail…or worse? Certainly no one was covering up this story anymore. It was fortyyears old; more than sixty-five years old if you count from the end of World WarTwo. Would anyone still care if I went poking around in the cemeteries, rainforests, and archives of this ancient land? I had already seen Abu Bakr Basyir,the infamous “Bali Bomber,” and lived to tell the tale. I had crawled aroundTantric temples and half-buried ruins in the punishing heat. Not too far away orlong ago, in China, I had visited military installations and prison factoriesand survived none the worse for wear. I had met with neo-Nazis and Klansmen andlived to write about it. So, how hard could this be?But…was there something else to find, something I did not as yet suspect?Everything you know is wrong.—The Firesign TheaterThe first casualty of war is the truth.—Arthur PonsonbyWar is the continuation of politics by other means.—Carl von ClausewitzI had reason to be suspicious.After all, I was told again and again in the 1970s and 1980s that ColoniaDignidad had nothing to do with Nazis, with torture or interrogation, or withthe military regime of General Augusto Pinochet. I was told this by editors ofmainstream media outlets as well as by the Simon Wiesenthal people, militaryhistorians, and others. They were all seriously mistaken—if not actually lyingfor a variety of reasons that had nothing to do with me or with the facts of thecase but which had more to do with political agendas.The very fact of the Colony itself is proof of the existence of an extensivenetwork of escape routes and safe houses used by those who supported (and stillsupport) the Nazi regime and its ideology.It was when I was being told repeatedly that I did not see what I saw, that Idid not experience what I experienced, that I began to realize that truth trulyis the first casualty of war, as well as of politics since “war is acontinuation of politics by other means”.It reminded me of the old Groucho Marx saying, “Who are you going to believe?Me, or your lying eyes?”The implication was that the interested parties—from the government to the mediato the “official” Nazi hunters themselves—all knew about the Colony (otherwise,how could they have made these assessments?) and chose to deny what they alreadyknew to be true. And to steadfastedly deny it for decades.And that leads us to the present story.There are many uncomfortable revelations in this book. The passage of time sincethe end of World War Two has not made any of them more palatable or excusable.We will learn about the complicity of our most cherished institutions—sacred andsecular in the escape of some of the world's most notorious war criminals. Wewill see men obsessed with a new enemy—Communism eagerly enlist the support ofpersons who had performed medical experiments on living human beings or whoslaughtered them in the death camps or as slave labor.

It is awell-written and compelling account of the final moments of the Third Reich,with all the pettiness, office politics, meanness, sniping, and gossiping thatcharacterized the end of the Nazi regime. One reads this book with the samebreathless intensity that one passes the scene of a traffic accident on thehighway: too fascinated and appalled at this demonstration of human mortality toturn away and look somewhere else. The figures of Hitler, Bormann, Goering,Goebbels and others are all sharply and theatrically drawn. Their weaknesses andpathos come across strongly and there is no space in Trevor-Roper's account forany other point of view, any other perspective, any other characterization. Itreads like an abridged version of Gibbons' Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.With tanks.And this is its problem. In it's strident tone and impatience with critics ithas presented posterity with certain difficulties, not the least of which is thefact that the lack of forensic evidence of any kind seemed to have been noimpediment to the conclusion of the author that Hitler committed suicide with apistol, alongside his wife Eva Braun who died of cyanide poisoning, and botharound three o'clock in the afternoon of April 30, 1945.What we have in the case of the deaths of Hitler and Braun is a purelycircumstantial case: one with no corpus delicti, no forensic evidence (orforensic evidence whose provenance is uncertain or unproven), and conflictingeyewitness testimony. Add to that the almost unbearably arrogant andself-assured tone of Trevor-Roper's report—based on research that was conductedover the space of only six weeks and included testimony from prisoners of warwith every motivation imaginable to deceive, embellish, and create out of wholecloth—and you are left with exactly the report that was intended: a piece ofpsychological warfare, an artfully-created and stylistically elegant propagandadevice.Trevor-Roper glides over the various inconsistent testimonies of Nazi officerswith the blithe air of someone too busy with weightier concerns to concentrateon the minutiae. He ridicules those who disagree with him, even as he admitsthat eyewitness testimony is the least reliable of all sources of evidence. Hereveals that the motive behind his report was an intelligence agenda, set byMI67 [part0005.html#ft7]: to counteract the effects of the Soviet insistencethat Hitler was still alive and being protected by…British intelligence.With all of that in hand, and admitted as such in writing by its author, how isit possible to come to any other conclusion than the report was a work offiction—a cover story—camouflaged as fact?Yet, there the report would stand, a Maginot Line erected against all otherinterpretations of the events of April 30, 1945. One criticized or objected atone's peril, for certainly the insidious might of British Intelligence was itsfoundation and its champion. Dick White, the MI6 officer who had commissionedTrevor-Roper in September of 1945 to write the report, later became head of MI6itself and was knighted in the process. As far as the British (and, to a largeextent, the Americans) were concerned, Trevor-Roper had put paid to anyspeculation about the survival of the twentieth century's most notoriouspolitical leader. Trevor-Roper himself admits that British Intelligence not onlyapproved his writing of The Last Days of Hitler, but that they supported it aswell.8 [part0005.html#ft8] It is a revealing admission, for it proves beyond anyreasonable doubt that the Trevor-Roper narrative is a work of art—the “craft ofintelligence”—and not history. There is certainly no science in his text, nopretense towards establishing the facts of the case by anything other thancomparing testimonies of various Nazis and coming up with the distillation ofthese interrogations that best serves the cause. It was, after all, this sameapproach to intelligence that presented the world with the “weapons of massdestruction” in Iraq.In order for us to gaze, calmly and without prejudice, on the data that suggestsHitler may have escaped Berlin before its capture by the Russians and may havesurvived in another country, on another continent, we should examine certainelements of Trevor-Roper's work of imagination in order to address—and dispensewith—the “facts” that he insists are the critical issues. We begin with theintelligence agenda itself, the one that MI6 called (appropriately enough)“Operation Nursery.”Operation NurseryFor my book was written, in the first place, for exactly the same reason whichmade the Russians frown upon it: to prevent (as far as such means can prevent)the rebirth of the Hitler myth.—Hugh Trevor-Roper9 [part0005.html#ft9]A British intelligence officer, Hugh Trevor-Roper (1914-2003) crafted thenarrative concerning Hitler's ultimate fate, beginning in September 1945 on amission—called Operation Nursery—from the Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6.This intelligence operation is the source of the story we have all been toldsince then. It is the authoritative version. It is based on a handful ofinterviews with former members of Hitler's personal staff, only some of whomserved in the bunker up until the fall of Berlin in May,1945. This eventuallybecame Trevor-Roper's best-selling book entitled The Last Days of Hitler. Itstands today as the definitive account of Hitler's alleged suicide, even thoughthere are barely thirty-five pages in the original edition that deal directlywith the death itself. The reason for this is simple: there was no forensicevidence to work from. There were only statements of eyewitnesses, all of whomwere Nazis and most of whom were in the SS. And, according to Trevor-Roperhimself, eyewitness testimony is ultimately unreliable.Such is the value of unchecked human testimony, on which, however, much ofwritten history is based.—Hugh Trevor-Roper10 [part0005.html#ft10]If one were to take all the testimony of all of the witnesses who have sincewritten books or who have left behind transcripts of their interrogations byBritish, American and Russian intelligence officers, and compared them to eachother we would soon begin to realize that there is virtually no consensus oncritical points of the story. Some of this we can put down to the chaos andtrauma of the last days of the war and the fact that the witnesses were notmembers of the victorious Allied forces but were the losers in that conflict,running in fear for their lives when they were captured and imprisoned. Germanyhad been completely overrun. Entire cities had been reduced to rubble, includingBerlin. There was widespread hunger, disease, and reportedly terrible abuse atthe hands of the Soviet forces who raped and killed, seemingly withoutrestraint.Thus, that there would be discrepancies in these stories is understandable. Butthat leaves us with a problem. Whom to believe? Which version is reallyauthoritative?That depends on the agenda you wish to promote. History was being written by thevictors to satisfy intelligence objectives and not to illuminate this darkmatter of defeat and violent death. This was war, and the Allied forces werethemselves about to discover that their respective agendas did not match. TheSoviets had one set of goals in mind at the end of the conflict, and theAmericans another.And the British, another still. Hugh Trevor-Roper admitted he did not speak orread German. His experience in the war up to that point was limited to signalsintelligence and the code-breaking teams that were intent on decoding Abwehrradio communications. Prior to the war, Trevor-Roper had been an Oxford-educatedhistorian and had published a study of the life of William Laud, Archbishop ofCanterbury at the time of Charles I and the English Civil War of the seventeenthcentury. Trevor-Roper was an accomplished stylist with an acerbic wit who wrotehistory with an eye towards communicating the sweep of events and the stature(and idiosyncracies) of history's personalities…and in denigrating or ridiculingthe attempts of other historians who did not agree with him. The choice ofTrevor-Roper for the politically-sensitive task of determining Hitler's fatewould seem curious if not for the fact that his superior, Brigadier Dick White(later to become Director of MI6), intended that a narrative be crafted thatwould counter the effects of Soviet insistence that Hitler was still alive. Whatwas required was not the services of a lawyer or a scientist building a legalcase from evidence but the services of someone who could build a historical textfrom odd bits of documents and dubious testimony, hobbled together with an eyetowards presenting a single point of view. In other words, the mission objectiveof Trevor-Roper in Operation Nursery was a foregone one: to disprove Sovietstatements that Hitler was still alive. Thus, it had to begin with the premise(presented as fact) that Hitler was dead and had committed suicide in the bunkeron April 30, 1945, and then be worked backward from there. No otherinterpretation or presentation was acceptable. All he had to do was collectenough “eyewitness” testimony—in German, a language he did not understand—thatsupported (or at least did not contradict) this version of events, and compilethem into a neat story that tied together all the loose ends that then wouldstand as the official version. The official British version.At the same time as Trevor-Roper was conducting interviews of witnesses amongprisoners and informants under British control (and being provided with writtenaccounts from prisoners under American control, some of whom he was notpermitted to interview personally), the Soviets were doing the same withwitnesses they had in their prison camps and interrogation cells. The methodsmay have been somewhat dissimilar. The Soviets had no problem with torture andwhat the Americans now call “enhanced interrogation” techniques, especially whenit came to the Germans. After all, the Russians lost millions of their peopledue to Nazi aggression against the homeland. The hatred they had for theNazis—and for Germans in general—was deep and extensive.There were several Nazi prisoners whose testimony was deemed of utmostimportance to the task of coming to a final evaluation of Hitler's whereabouts,and their testimony was not made available either to Trevor-Roper or to anyoneelse in British or American intelligence. In fact, no access to these prisonerswas provided at all until ten years after the war's end. One might say that theCold War began with the isolation of these important witnesses from the Britishand American forces in Germany in 1945. The aura of distrust between the westand the east was already evident in this development of competing narrativesconcerning the disposition of their mutual enemy, Adolf Hitler.Operation MythAt the end of 1945 new interrogations were carried out to establish thebackground to Hitler's suicide. His former chief pilot Hans Baur had beenquestioned. Beria wanted to be sure above all that the dictator was actuallydead…The interrogations of Linge and Günsche…led the NKVD leadership toinstigate the operation codenamed Myth at the beginning of 1946. The goal of theoperation was to conduct an ‘accurate and strict investigation of all thefactors' involved in Hitler's suicide on 30 April 1945.11 [part0005.html#ft11]Two of the more important witnesses in question were SS Sturmbannführer HeinzLinge and SS Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche, both prisoners of the Soviets.According to the report on Hitler prepared for Stalin by Soviet intelligence andpublished in 2005 as The Hitler Book, Günsche was standing outside the door tothe antechamber in front of Hitler's study when Linge walked up to him and saidhe smelled gunpowder coming from the room.12 [part0005.html#ft12] This was a fewminutes before four o'clock the afternoon of April 30, 1945.Linge went to get Bormann and the two entered the study to find that both Hitlerand Eva Braun were dead. Hitler, they said, had committed suicide with a pistoland Eva Braun had taken a cyanide capsule. (It is useful to remember that therehas been tremendous confusion over these circumstances, with some accountssaying that Hitler had taken cyanide and then shot himself…a situation that isextremely unlikely as the potassium cyanide capsules in use were veryfast-acting and, if other reports are to be believed, Hitler was suffering fromParkinson's Disease and the tremor in his hands would have made it virtuallyimpossible to place a gun in his mouth or aim it at his temple and pull thetrigger as he was in the throes of cyanide poisoning.)It is important to point out that there was no report of anyone having heard agunshot, at least not according to the Soviet report. Other witnesses present inthe bunker that day have given contradictory statements, and some (those inBritish and American custody) have insisted they heard a shot fired. As recenttests have shown,13 [part0005.html#ft13] this would have been impossible due tothe heavy construction of the bunker's walls and reinforced steel doors. No oneat any distance from the antechamber would have been able to hear a pistol shotcoming from Hitler's study and, indeed, the Soviet report makes no mention ofany such sound. On the contrary, the Soviet report has guards standing in frontof the antechamber door unaware that a shot has been fired. It was only thesmell of smoke coming from the thick fireproof door that alerted Linge to thepossibility that a shooting had occurred.That means that either the prisoners in American and British custody were lyingwhen they said they heard shots fired, or that the prisoners in Soviet custodywere lying when they said it was the smell of gunpowder that was the only cluethat someone had used a firearm. That all the prisoners being interrogated onthis point were Nazis devoted to Hitler—most of whom were also SS officers—wouldindicate that lying and dissembling over what really happened to their leaderwould have been (or should have been) expected, not to mention any desire theymay have had to put themselves in the most favorable light with their captors.Yet, this is not the only contradiction between the two versions, as we shallsee.The last surviving member of the Führerbunker—Rochus Misch—has himself changedhis story several times over the years. Misch, a member of Hitler's elite SSbodyguard (Liebstandarte SS Adolf Hitler) as well as a courier and telephoneoperator in the bunker, initially said that he heard the gunshot; he laterchanged his story and said that he did not hear it, but that someoneelse—probably Linge—heard it and spread the alarm. Interviewed for thetelevision series Mystery Quest in 2010, he said that he did not hear anygunshot but that he entered the study once the word had spread and saw Hitler'sbody slumped on the couch and Eva Braun's body next to his. In another, earlier,interview published on Salon.com [http://www.Salon.com], he said that he couldhave been mistaken about the gunshot because “any loud noise echoing through theconcrete sounded like a gunshot.”14 [part0005.html#ft14] More importantly, hedoesn't remember how he entered the study where Hitler's body lay: was it withLinge? Or with Günsche? He says he doesn't remember, but according to Linge noneother than Martin Bormann opened the door to the study. How could Misch haveforgotten the sinister presence of Bormann?Although both Misch and Linge were in Russian custody for ten years after thewar—until 1954 and 1955 respectively—no record of their interrogations by Sovietintelligence has yet to be published, which is exceedingly odd. A brieftranscript of one of Günsche's interrogations was made available in Hitler'sDeath: Russia's Last Great Secret from the Files of the KGB, published the sameyear as The Hitler Book. Linge's testimony is referred to several times in thatbook but is never quoted directly and no transcripts of any of the (presumablynumerous and certainly violent) sessions are provided. One is forced tospeculate about the reasons for this omission, and it may simply be that theoriginal transcripts were lost or, for those of a more suspicious inclination,that details provided by Linge (and Misch) were at odds with the officialversion. This should not have been a problem for the NKVD and later the KGB,however, who obviously edited the transcripts anyway and could have made Lingeand Misch “say” whatever they wanted them to say. So, the omission of theinterrogations remains a mystery, albeit only one of many.One of the Soviet prisoners, SS Brigadeführer Hans Rattenhuber, went evenfurther in his description of what occurred that afternoon. According to histestimony before Soviet interrogators, he claimed that Linge had shot Hitlerafter the latter had taken poison.15 [part0005.html#ft15] According toRattenhuber, Hitler was worried that the cyanide would not work since he hadbeen taking so many other drugs per the ministrations of the nefarious DrMorrell (about whom more later). This reasoning, of course, is nonsense but itdoes go towards Hugh Thomas's speculation that it was, indeed, Linge who killedHitler although neither with a pistol nor with poison (see below).It was Günsche and Linge who, according to some accounts (including the Sovietversion), were the ones charged with burning the bodies of Hitler and Eva Braun.They first took Hitler—in some versions wrapped completely in a blanket, inothers without—outside the bunker and then returned with Eva's body without anyblanket or other covering over her blue dress. They poured gasoline over thebodies and set them aflame. This story has been examined and criticized onnumerous grounds and we won't get into all of them here but will only highlightsignificant problems.One of the leading critics of the Hugh Trevor-Roper account is Hugh Thomas,whose The Murder of Adolf Hitler16 [part0005.html#ft16] is a good source formany of the inconsistencies between the various eyewitness testimonies (most ofwhich were by SS officers devoted to Hitler, men who could be expected to lieegregiously to the Allies). Thomas published his book in 1995, fully ten yearsbefore the Soviet archives on Hitler would be (at least partially) revealed andeven further inconsistencies came to light. However, some important andpotentially devastating material did surface when Linge was released by theSoviets and was interviewed by the press.Both Linge's account—and that of Hans Baur, Hitler's personal pilot, releasedfrom Soviet custody at the same time—conflicted with Trevor-Roper's narrative insubstantial ways. For instance, according to Baur both Hitler and Eva Braun shotthemselves; there was no mention of cyanide capsules. Bizarrely, however, theSoviets did not believe that Baur had any useful information and in the end hewas placed in a separate facility, away from Günsche and Linge who were chargedwith writing the document that would become The Hitler Book. Even thatarrangement was problematic, according to the Russians, for Günsche and Lingefought over what had actually taken place in the bunker on that fateful day.Günsche was characterized as a fervent Nazi who had no desire to be truthful inhis account; Linge, however, greeted the task of writing the definitive text onHitler's death as his “salvation” and was ready to write whatever the Sovietsdesired.17 [part0005.html#ft17] That doesn't mean, however, that he was trustedentirely by the Soviets who planted an informer in his prison cell.18[part0005.html#ft18]Thus, we have Günsche who is not afraid of lying outright to the Russians andLinge who will tell the truth…unless, of course, the truth is not what theRussians want to hear, in which case he will amend the story accordingly. Bothwere SS men. Both were devoted to the Führer. Both presumably had been torturedand subjected to the harshest interrogation methods available to the Sovietsecret police who were desperate to learn the fate of Hitler. And this is thesource of the Russian version of events.None of this fazed Trevor-Roper, however, who insisted that the newly obtainedaccess to Linge's version did nothing to contradict his original story. This isperhaps evidence of a particular form of arrogance among certain academics: HughTrevor-Roper was considered (and considered himself) an authority on NaziGermany and specifically on Hitler and Hitler's inner circle. He had no academicbackground in German history or politics; he did not even speak or read German.Today, that would have been considered grounds for dismissing his claims toexpertise in the field. Certainly no thesis or dissertation would have beenaccepted from a graduate student in history or international affairs under thesecircumstances. Then why was he chosen for this delicate task? The onlyconclusion one can draw is that MI6—which created Operation Nursery—was notinterested in an honest, full-blown investigation but only in a story that wouldsound plausible and which would undermine Soviet propaganda.We must add to this the evidence of Trevor-Roper's own characterizations of theGerman psyche as prone to fantasy and hysteria:For mythopoeia is a far more common characteristic of the human race (andperhaps especially of the German race) than veracity; and the evidence for thisstatement has increased formidably since these incidents made it obvious tome.19 [part0005.html#ft19]And later on he references “…the immature Teutonic mind.”20 [part0005.html#ft20]This type of (unconscious?) stereotyping had to have influenced the finalproduct of his investigation. Virtually nowhere in his book does he treat thesubject matter dispassionately. His distaste for his material is evident onevery line. It is no mystery to him that Hitler would have committed suicide,for it is consistent with Trevor-Roper's own point of view. He finds witnesseswho support this point of view and, when he doesn't, he ignores them ordismisses their inconsistencies with one argument or another. On the one hand hediscusses the propensity of the “German race” for myth-making; on the otherhand, he accepts the testimony of these same mythopoetic Germans as fact (whenit suits him).Take, for instance, his acceptance of the death scene.As Linge and Bormann—according to his version—burst into Hitler's study, theyfind Hitler on one side of the couch and Eva Braun on the other side. Hitler hasshot himself through the mouth. Eva has taken cyanide and she is curled up onthe sofa.21 [part0005.html#ft21] According to Artur Axmann, the Hitler Youthleader who was one of the last to leave the bunker, Eva's head was restinggently on Hitler's shoulder.22 [part0005.html#ft22]One aspect of this scene in particular attracted Hugh Thomas's contempt: theidea that Eva Braun, after taking potassium cyanide, would have been peacefullysitting on the sofa next to Hitler. The effects of potassium cyanide poisoningare far more dramatic than this tableau would have us believe. There would havebeen seizures, for one thing. No one takes a poison capsule of that nature andrests calmly, waiting for death to arrive. Indeed, this fact—among severalothers—lead Thomas to believe that Eva Braun not only did not die in the bunkerat all but that she was enabled to escape and a double planted in her place.23[part0005.html#ft23]Before the readers throw up their hands in dismay at this outlandish suggestion,I beg them to recall that there were, indeed, doubles in use in the entouragearound Hitler. One of these Gustav Veler was even interrogated by the Soviets24[part0005.html#ft24] and another was photographed as a corpse by the RussianArmy who evidently believed the body was that of Hitler.25 [part0005.html#ft25]Videos of this moment have been preserved for posterity, and can be seen on theInternet. British intelligence knew of these doubles as well, as revealed in adeclassified memo detailing the interrogation of a German prisoner of war, oneSS Schütze Obernigg who was captured in France July 19, 1944. An Austrian, theprisoner had served at the Obersalzberg area from August 1943 to May 1944 whereHitler had his country home. According to the prisoner, there were at least twodoubles in evidence at the time. One of these worked at the Chancellery inBerlin and wore the same uniform as Hitler. His name was unknown to theprisoner, but was identified as a “ministerial aide.” Another double wasidentified as one Brillmeyer, a “work master” who bore an astonishingresemblance to Hitler except for the way he combed his hair.26[part0005.html#ft26]The existence of some of these various doubles has been verified and accepted bySoviet intelligence and Veler was referred to by them in Hitler's Death.Additionally, as Thomas cannot accept either the poisoning theory or the pistolshot theory as the cause of Hitler's death, he suggests that the Fuhrer wasstrangled to death by his adjutant, Heinz Linge.27 [part0005.html#ft27] ThatLinge might have been responsible for Hitler's death would go a long way towardsunderstanding why Linge was so cooperative with the Soviets in coming up withthe “smell of gunpowder” story and the shocked entry by himself and Bormann intoHitler's study where both the dictator and his newly-wedded wife were laid outconveniently on the allegedly bloody sofa.An important point to be made here is that Thomas believes that Hitler did,indeed, die in the bunker but that he did so because he was murdered. Hisreasoning for this is based on the evidence that was available to him at thetime and is the only scenario that accommodated the existing forensic data. Hesuccessfully, in my view, obliterates the case for Hitler having poisonedhimself, as well as the case that he shot himself with a Walther. What he wasleft with, then, was the homicide theory.However, there is one other theory, a theory that Thomas is ready to entertainin the case of Eva Braun and Martin Bormann but not in Hitler's case: and thatis the escape theory.As outlandish as this theory may seem to many, if not most, readers the authorprays for a little indulgence at this time as he lays out the possible scenario,one which also satisfies the forensic data (particularly the newly-discovereddata brought to light by Dr Nick Bellantoni in 2009). One should also keep inmind the fact that MI6—the British intelligence organ responsible forTrevor-Roper's mission to prove the suicide of Hitler—was involved in their ownfabrication of death, in this instance the case of Gestapo HauptsturmführerHorst Kopkow, a man responsible for the murder of approximately 300 Alliedagents during the war. Kopkow's knowledge of both German and Russianintelligence nets made him invaluable to MI6 even as the British war crimesinvestigators wanted him for prosecution. In order to save Kopkow from theircolleagues in War Crimes, MI6 faked Kopkow's death and even provided a fakedeath certificate. Thus MI6 perpetrated a fraud upon their own people,protecting a man who was a major war criminal who sent hundreds to their deathsin the concentration camps. If they were capable of this type of perfidy whywould they not collaborate in developing another fraudulent tale, that ofHitler's suicide, especially as Kopkow was being used in the fight against theSoviets and the Hitler narrative was developed with the same purpose in mind?Kopkow, by the way, lived to a ripe old age before dying of pneumonia in 1996.28[part0005.html#ft28]The BunkerBy all accounts the situation in the Führerbunker on April 30, 1945 wasdesperate. Hitler had been advised that his most trusted colleagues were alltrying to cut separate deals with the Allies. Air Marshall Goring, the bizarreand corpulent figure in charge of the Luftwaffe, had betrayed his Fuhrer bynotifying him that he was now in charge of the Third Reich due to the possibleincapacitation of Hitler. Heinrich Himmler, head of the dreaded SS, as well asthe Gestapo and the Secret Service, was trying to arrange a surrender with theAllies with Count Bernadotte of Sweden as the go-between; word of it leaked backto Hitler, who was apopleptic with fury. Himmler, after all, had been withHitler during the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 and was a devoted follower of theFührer for many years. The Army General Staff was in disarray anyway, due to thefamous attempt on Hitler's life in July of 1944: from that moment on, Hitlerknew he could not trust his own generals.He retired to Berlin and eventually to the Bunker in January of 1945. As thebombs and shelling came closer, he was reduced to working and living undergroundin rather squalid circumstances. Trevor-Roper devotes most of his book to theperiod before April of 1945, trying to set the stage for what he will claimoccurred on April 30. By weaving a dense and elaborate web of stories, memories,and speculations about the last months of the war he hopes to walk the readerthrough to his own conclusions in the expectation that one will have been sowar-weary by this time that one would accept Trevor-Roper's version of eventswithout question. There can be little doubt as to the facts of the war: themilitary campaigns, the battles lost and won, the number of bombs dropped, thenumber of casualties…and this accumulation of facts lulls the reader into afalse sense of security, believing that the rest of the tale will be equallyfactual. It is a clever, but time worn, technique. By the time Trevor-Roperactually gets to the details of April 30 itself, he has only a few more pagesleft to go. Remember that the purpose of this exercise was to “prove” Hitler'sdeath in the Bunker…yet a scant thirty-five pages is devoted to the actualcircumstances of the death itself.This extends to his characterization of the thoughts, feelings and psyches ofthe persons left behind in the Bunker as everyone starts to leave: some toassume new, and virtually imaginary, posts in the defense of Berlin and othersto save themselves by heading south towards Berchtesgaden, Hitler's mountainretreat in the Bavarian Alps, where there is a rumor that there will be arear-guard action against the Allies with the expectation that Germany will beable to retain—or regain—some of its lost glory.29 [part0005.html#ft29]To Trevor-Roper, Hitler is already insane; Eva Braun is ditzy and shallow,little more than a Nazi party girl with barely a thought in her head; Bormann isscheming and insincere; Josef Goebbels, the Minister of Propaganda, remainsfanatical to the end and will sacrifice not only himself but his wife and sixsmall children as well: their bodies would be found and photographed by theRussian Army. Artur Axmann, the head of Hitler Youth, whose testimony concerningthe escape of Martin Bormann was so crucial…and yet so inconsistent from day today, providing half-a-dozen different versions to the Nuremberg tribunalalone…was still regarded as a good source by Trevor-Roper.There is Bormann himself, of course, and members of his entourage. There isAmbassador Walther Hevel, about whom more later as he leads us directly toIndonesia in astonishing fashion. There are the secretaries: Frau Junge, FrauChristian, Fräulein Krüger.There are the faithful SS officers and guards. Linge, Günsche, Misch,Schwägermann, Mengershausen, Rattenhuber; a few others. Hans Baur, Hitler'spersonal pilot. Erich Kempka, Hitler's chauffeur and transport officer.Ah, Erich Kempka: the man upon whom so much of the suicide story as presented inThe Last Days of Hitler was based, as Trevor-Roper had no access to Linge orGünsche in 1945. The man who, it was said, carried the lifeless body of EvaBraun up the steps to the Reich Chancellery garden to be cremated.The man who later claimed he made it up.Kempka was the single most important source for Trevor-Roper's account of thedeath of Hitler since Kempka insisted he was there at the time. Kempka toldinvestigators that he was in the corridor outside the bunker when Hitler shothimself. He later changed that story considerably, and told other investigatorsthat he was upstairs and outside the bunker at the time. This was a criticaleyewitness, and his testimony was complete deception.30 [part0005.html#ft30]Then there was Hans Baur.In October of 1955, upon his release from Soviet custody, Hans Baur, Hitler'spersonal pilot, told journalists that he saw Hitler shoot himself and that EvaBraun shot herself “at the same time”.31 [part0005.html#ft31] This wasconsidered outlandish testimony, of course, for it contradicted everything thatTrevor-Roper wrote about the case and even had Eva Braun shooting herself whenevery other “eyewitness” said she took cyanide.If Kempka and Baur were lying—and they both changed their stories in criticalways over time—then who was telling the truth? Were there any eyewitnesses tothe death of Hitler and Braun?What really happened in the bunker?SS-man Harry Mengershausen (also spelled Mengerhausen in some sources) was amember of the Reich Chancellery guard. In his May 18, 1945 statement to theSoviets while a prisoner he claimed that he was informed that Hitler had shothimself, but did not believe the story until he saw Linge and Günsche carry outthe bodies of Hitler and Eva Braun for cremation.32 [part0005.html#ft32] Hestated that Hitler had been shot through the temple. He further claimed that,aside from Linge and Günsche, no one else witnessed the cremation of the bodies.Later, when he was released from the gulag in October, 1955, he changed hisstory. Linge's story had the greatest currency at the time, and differed fromMengershausen's considerably. Linge—once released from Soviet captivity—claimedHitler had shot himself through the mouth.33 [part0005.html#ft33] Thus,Mengershausen changed his story once he, too, was released by the Soviets inorder to match more closely Linge's account. The Soviets had placed greatreliance on Mengershausen's testimony, as is evident from Hitler's Death34[part0005.html#ft34] However, the report prepared for Stalin by Linge andGünsche and entitled The Hitler Book contains no mention at all ofMengershausen! In fact, according to The Hitler Book, the Führer shot himselfthrough the temple and the famous scene of Eva Braun sitting on the sofa next tohim, with her legs curled beneath her and “her lips pressed firmly together”,was presented as fact.35 [part0005.html#ft35] Although the Soviets insisted thatMengershausen was a credible witness because, they claimed, he led them straightto where the bodies had been burned and buried (including those of Hitler's dog,Blondi, and the Goebbels family) when it came to writing the report for Stalinthey omitted his testimony and his presence at the scene completely. This isespecially important considering that Mengershausen insisted he was the only oneto witness the cremation of the bodies, aside from Linge and Günsche, but TheHitler Book has a veritable funeral cortege present at the scene: Bormann,Günsche, Linge, Kempka, SS men Ewald Lindloff and Hans Reisser, SSSturmbannführer Schädle, Goebbels, Axmann, General Krebs, Werner Naumann (anassistant of Goebbels who will later become involved in a notorious ODESSA-likeoperation after the war, as we will see), and General Burgdorf36[part0005.html#ft36]…but no Mengershausen.This episode alone, with all of its variations, is an example of thedisinformation and misinformation that has surrounded all historical narrativesof the last days of Hitler. Remember that both The Hitler Book and Hitler'sDeath are Soviet records of the testimony of the Nazi eyewitnesses in theirprisons…and they differ from each other considerably. There is virtually noconsensus among the witnesses as to what actually transpired. Did Hitler killhimself with a gun, with cyanide, or both? Did he shoot himself through themouth or the temple? Or, as Rattenhuber claimed, did Linge give Hitler the coupde-grâce himself? Did Eva Braun shoot herself? Did she take cyanide? If she tookcyanide, why did her corpse appear to be so peaceful rather than ravaged by theeffects of the poison, effects that include seizures, vomiting, etc.? Who burnedthe bodies? Who were the first to see the bodies in Hitler's study? Was theresmoke, or the sound of a gunshot or gunshots? Was there a smell of cyanide…thefamous “bitter almonds” odor…or was there no smell at all in the study? WasHitler wearing new socks or socks that had been darned in several places? (Thislast goes to the question of a possible Hitler double.) Who witnessed thecremations? When did the cremations occur?This mass of lies and deception allowed historians to pick and choose their waythrough the various testimonies and come up with a narrative they liked. Nosingle version could include all the discrepancies, of course, so they dismissedthe ones that didn't fit depending on their agenda.But what of the forensic evidence?The only ones who had access to the bodies after the remaining survivors fledthe Bunker were the Soviets. They seized the Reich Chancellery and began asystematic exploration of the Bunker and of the surrounding grounds. A unit ofSoviet counter-intelligence— the infamous SMERSH—was put in charge of takingpossession of Hitler's body (if it could be found) and proving to Stalin thatHitler was, indeed, dead. They found bodies aplenty, but none that could bepositively identified as Hitler.In the Bunker itself, photographs were taken of the sofa where Hitler waspresumed to have committed suicide by shooting himself (either through thetemple or through the mouth had yet to be determined). It was insisted that thesofa was covered in Hitler's blood, but a problem arises: one very clearphotograph of the sofa shows little or no blood at all.37 [part0005.html#ft37]However, SMERSH got a break on May 5, 1945 with the discovery of bodies believedto be those of Hitler and Braun, buried close to the entrance to the Bunker inthe Reich Chancellery garden and only partially burned. Strangely, the existenceof these bodies was not revealed at the time: not to Allied intelligence, themedia, or to anyone else. It remained a closely-guarded secret of Sovietintelligence for decades, and when the remains of what was claimed to beHitler's skull was made available for testing the whole house of cards that hadbeen built by Hugh Trevor-Roper and MI6 came tumbling down.According to the Soviet narrative, SMERSH officials discovered the two bodies ofHitler and Braun on May 5, and a week later their prisoner Mengershausen tookthem to the precise site where the bodies had been found. This, according toHitler's Death, gave Mengershausen increased credibility and value as a witness.These bodies were taken and subjected to some form of forensic analysis. Ofgreatest importance was the state of Hitler's teeth. This would providevirtually the only forensic evidence in the case (DNA testing was unknown at thetime). The problem was: who had X-rays of Hitler's teeth for comparison?This is the beginning of another evidentiary nightmare. In what should have beena simple matter of identification we once again are left with conflictingtestimonies, bizarre claims, and hidden agendas.The Dental CaseWe begin with Eva Braun.According to the Soviet pathologists who examined what they believed to be EvaBraun's corpse there had been extensive damage to the body due to shrapnelpiercing the torso in several places. Because there was evidence ofhaemorrhaging taking place at the sites of these wounds, the body had to havebeen alive at the time it was struck. Dead bodies do not haemorrhage. Once theheart has stopped beating, blood stops flowing. There could have beenpost-mortem wounds, but these would not have shown signs of haemorrhaging. Thisbody, however, did show such signs. The body was alive at the time it was struckby shrapnel. Therefore it could not have been Eva Braun's body.To make matters worse, there was evidence of cyanide poisoning in the mouth ofthe corpse, extending even to glass splinters from the cyanide capsule. Yet,toxicological tests of the inner organs showed no presence of cyanide in thebody. In other words, the only conclusion that could be drawn is that a glassampoule or capsule containing cyanide had been broken in the mouth of the corpseby…someone else. Someone living.Recourse, then, was had to the teeth.The corpse had an expensive bridge made and this was removed for examination. Sofar, so good. According to the examination of Fritz Echtmann—a dentaltechnician—by Soviet intelligence Major Vaindorf on July 24, 1947 in a reportmarked “Top Secret”38 [part0005.html#ft38] an unusual gold bridge was createdfor the right side of Eva Braun's lower jaw to connect two false teeth to twogood teeth, and in such a way that the bridge would not show. This was completedin 1944. The following year—in April, 1945 and thus only weeks before her“death”—Echtmann was asked to make another bridge, this time for Eva's upperright jaw. This bridge was completed on April 19, 1945 and delivered to Hitler'sdentist, Professor Hugo Blaschke in the Reich Chancellery.This same bridge was discovered in the burned body with the shrapnel damage andthe slivers of broken cyanide ampoule.However, the bridge could not have possibly been made for the real Eva Braun.A dental chart prepared by Blaschke after his capture in May of 1945 shows thatEva Braun had remarkably good teeth. In fact, Blaschke's chart bears noresemblance at all to the diagrams of Eva Braun's teeth presented by Echtmann tothe Soviets. Further, there is no evidence that the bridge supplied by Echtmannon April 19, 1945 was ever used because there is no record that dental work wasbeing carried out in the Bunker that late in the war with only ten days leftbefore the collapse of the Reich and all hell breaking loose.Considering the fact that the “Eva Braun” corpse in Soviet possession had dieddue to extensive shrapnel wounds and not cyanide poisoning, coupled with thefact that the Echtmann bridge was discovered in the mouth of this corpse, canonly mean that someone wanted the Russians to believe that the body they had wasBraun's…even though it was not. A paper trail of dental records was prepared toestablish a satisfactory identification of an unknown corpse as that of Hitler'slong-time mistress.The Soviets went looking for Blaschke but could not find him. Instead, theyfound his dental assistant, one Fräulein Käthe Heusemann, who claimed to be ableto draw from memory Hitler's dental records. Amazingly (or perhaps not soamazingly!), this drawing matched perfectly the dental remains found in theputative Hitler corpse; in addition, Heusemann also identified the bridge workfor Eva Braun.39 [part0005.html#ft39] All of this the Soviets kept in a boxalong with an Iron Cross and a Nazi Party badge, which certainly would have gonesome way towards convincing Heusemann of what she should say.For her cooperation, Heusemann was taken prisoner by the Soviet Union anddisappeared into the gulag for years. Echtmann fared no better, and was releasedafter ten years (during which time he once shared a cell with Mengershausen) andlater became one of those (along with Linge and Günsche) who gave evidencebefore the Bavarian court in the hearing that would declare Hitler officiallydead. Later, Heusemann would give explicit written testimony that Blaschke “hadnever placed any bridgework in the mouth of Eva Braun”.40 [part0005.html#ft40]Heusemann's testimony before the Soviets was given in a state of terribledistress; when she was released, she was able to give a more reasoned andconsistent story to investigators. But by that time no one was really listening.So what of Hitler's teeth?Actually, Hitler had very few of them. According to all accounts, he had onlyfive natural teeth left by April of 1945. All the rest were metal and in somecases faced with porcelain. His upper jaw was entirely false and was composed ofa bridge. His lower jaw had the five natural teeth and the rest were false. Thismeant that he had substantial bridgework done, and all by Blaschke and Echtmann.What was not so well known was the fact that Blaschke always had Echtmann makeduplicate bridges, in case of emergency or if something went wrong duringinsertion.41 [part0005.html#ft41]Thus, all of the analysis of Hitler's teeth used to confirm the identificationof the corpse that was found buried in the Reich Chancellery garden was reallyonly analysis of the bridgework. In other words, the Soviet forensic technicianswere comparing the bridgework they found in the corpse's mouth with the drawingsof the bridgework created by the hapless Heusemann; later, in 1972, X-rays werefound in the National Archives in Washington, DC that purported to be those ofHitler's mouth and which matched the bridgework.42 [part0005.html#ft42] AsHitler's mouth no longer exists, all that is left is the bridgework; but sincewe know that duplicates were made, we are left to conjecture whether or not thecorpse that was seized by SMERSH was really that of Hitler, or that of a man whohad Hitler's duplicate bridge inserted—loosely, as it turns out—into his mouthafter death.Perhaps none of this would have mattered very much had the Soviets not claimedto have possession of a piece of Hitler's skull, a claim that was successfullyrefuted in 2009.Operation HeelIt was not only the British and the Russians who had intelligence agendas whereHitler was concerned, however.In another bizarre revelation concurrent with the declassification of Americanintelligence files from the war, we find a tantalizing reference to somethingcalled “Operation Heel.” Like Operations Nursery and Myth, this one had to dowith Hitler's final days and his possible escape at the end of the war.Strangely, though, it was created almost two full years before April 30, 1945.It is to be found in a once-secret OSS memorandum dated September 6, 1943 withthe subject line: “Heel” Campaign. The memo was written by Donald V. McGranahan,an expert in sociology and psychology who had written peer-reviewed articlesboth before and after the war. It was addressed to a “Lt. Dolan”, who can benone other than Lieutenant Brooke Dolan, the OSS officer who led severalexpeditions to Tibet in the 1930s including one with future SS officerErnst Schäfer years before the war began. It was Dolan who— during thewar—eventually made it as far as an audience with the present Dalai Lama and wholed him to believe that the United States had recognized Tibetan nationhood(which, in fact, it had not). While Dolan's field was Asia, he was nonethelessaddressed in this particular memo on a “MO” or “Morale Operations” mission todiscredit Hitler in the eyes of the German people by spreading specific types ofrumors, gossip, and planting news stories.In it, suggestions are made to portray Hitler as insane. Some of thedescriptions come fairly close to the mark and describe with eerie presciencewhat Trevor-Roper would say occurred in the bunker in April of 1945. Theydescribe a Hitler increasingly isolated from Germany, the world, and realityitself, who refuses “to see anyone but his personal body guards, lives in a roomwithout windows, and has his food tested before eating it.”43[part0005.html#ft43] The memo was written in 1943, before Hitler had retiredpermanently to the Berlin bunker that was, of course, a “room without windows”and which was soaked in the kind of paranoia and fantasy that the authors of thememo suggested. The purpose of the memorandum was, in the words of its author,“to undermine German respect for Hitler and to widen the cleavage between himand other power elements in Germany.” The methodology was “to spread these ideasthrough rumors and through other concrete operations…“In order to be successful,it was recommended” To destroy the Hitler myth and bring der Fuhrer down to thelevel of an ordinary party leader.” The destruction of the Hitler myth wasidentical to the stated goal of Operation Nursery and Trevor-Roper's report.The second section of the memo contained suggestions “To picture Hitler asutterly unsympathetic toward the loss of life and the suffering of theindividual German.” One of these suggestions was to promote the story that“Hitler has declared, ‘I will not stop fighting until 10,000,000 Germans havedied.' 4 million have gone 6 million to go.” The number of 6 million in thiscontext is momentarily arresting as it is, of course, the estimate of the totalnumber of Jewish victims of the Holocaust. In 1943 this number was not knownand, indeed, there was controversy in the world's capitals as to the veryexistence of the Holocaust itself. To find it here is startling, to say theleast, even though it is otherwise irrelevant.One of the more fanciful suggestions was to spread the rumor that Hitler wasmaking all of his military decisions based on “stargazing and occultism” as wellas “two Jewish-Gypsy soothsayers.”Another, more apt suggestion, has Hitler refusing “to involve Spain in the warbecause he has a promise of sanctuary there when Germany is defeated.” Spain wasone of the destinations bruited about as a possible place to which Hitler wouldhave escaped after the fall of Berlin. It makes sense, as Franco was a fascistand notoriously sympathetic to the Nazi cause. In addition, the Spanish coastwas used by Germany during the war for logistical support in an operation knownas Etappendienst. This was a secret naval supply system that had beenestablished during the first World War and which was then reactivated forservice during World War II, in particular as a way of supporting and supplyingGerman U-boats (a program we will come to later on).In addition the “Heel” memorandum suggests spreading the rumor that “Planes arekept ready at both Munich and Berlin airports for Hitler to flee the country. Aspecial gasoline-carrying plane will allow the fugitives to make only one stopbefore reaching Japan.” Again, this “rumor” would find itself reactivated at thewar's end. The persistent story that Hitler had escaped via plane to eitherSpain or Denmark or some other location while on his way to an ultimate SouthAmerican destination remained as a possibility for years. That he had escapedvia U-boat to either Argentina or Antarctica is another legend that persists tothis day in some circles. The idea that Hitler may have wanted to flee to Japan,however, is probably unique to this memo. There is little evidence that Japanwould have welcomed Hitler to its shores and, in any event, by the end of thewar Japan was having enough of its own problems.The reason for this digression is to demonstrate that the situation that existedat the end of the war was imagined by intelligence officers years earlier. Nowthat we know—in Trevor-Roper's own words— that the motivation behind thehastily-assembled report on Hitler's death that he compiled was the intelligencegoal of countering Soviet statements that Hitler was alive and in Britishcustody, we can begin to see how this agenda colored the final result: the bookthat became The Last Days of Hitler. But was this final report also the resultof a propaganda effort initiated by American intelligence nine months beforeD-Day, and nearly two years before the fall of Berlin?How much of that OSS report would reflect the reality of Hitler's “last days”?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------6 [part0005.html#fn6] Hugh Trevor-Roper, The Last Days of Hitler, Chicago: TheUniversity of Chicago Press, 1987 edition, p. 127 [part0005.html#fn7] MI6 is also known as the Secret Intelligence Service orSIS, England's equivalent to America's CIA.

This was the mission of SMERSH—the Sovietcounter-intelligence group whose acronym stands for “Death to Spies”—to securethe bodies of Hitler and Braun (and, indeed, those of the entire Goebbelsfamily, plus their dogs, plus General Krebs) and then…well…wander around Germanywith them piled in the back of a truck while they figured out what to do.We have seen that the forensic evidence provided to the Soviets in the form ofthe putative corpses of both Hitler and Braun was the product of a deliberatefraud. Had the Russians merely found some bodies they believed to be the onesthey sought and then later discovered their mistake, this story would not be ascompelling. Instead, they found bodies that were deliberately altered in such away as to prove that they were, indeed, those of Hitler and Braun. Had theymerely mistaken some anonymous corpses for those of the Fuhrer and his mistressthere would still be the possibility that the real bodies would be found oneday. Instead, they were presented with corpses into which Hitler's and Eva'sbridges had been carelessly inserted and this meant the goal of the perpetratorswas a deliberate attempt to call off any further search for the two Nazis. Aclever diversion had been created, one that made the Soviets waste their timeand resources. What, then, was the real purpose behind the hoax?There are two possibilities. Either the real bodies had been buried in somesecret place by the Nazis and the fake bodies offered up so that the Russianswould call off their search; or, and this seems more likely, Hitler and Braunwere not dead at all.The Nazis would not have simply left two look-alikes behind, as-is, becauseeventually someone would recognize the deception. Instead, the two bodies had tobe burned so as to remove any potential for precise visual identification, andthen the duplicate bridgework inserted to “prove” their identities. We have seenthis before in instances of insurance fraud and in homicide cases where a bodyis burned beyond recognition in a car—for instance—so that investigators willmake the assumption that the corpse is that of the owner of the car while thereal owner and perpetrator makes his getaway. Today, however, we have access tomeans of identification that did not exist in 1945, and this is what eventuallyexposed the most elaborate and cruel hoax of the twentieth century.WandervögelAccording to declassified Soviet intelligence files, SMERSH took possession ofthe bodies and then drove around Germany with them, burying them and thendigging them up, burying them again in some other location and then digging themup again, uncertain of what to do with the bodies until they finally settled onthe historic city of Magdeburg where SMERSH had a facility.In the words of the “Report on the Burial of the Corpses of Hitler, Goebbels andOther Persons”, and classified Top Secret, dated June 4, 1945:In a further search on 5 May, 1945, several metres from the place where thecorpses of Goebbels and his wife had been discovered, two badly-burnt bodieswere discovered in a bomb crater; these were the corpse of the Reichschanceller[sic] of Germany Adolf Hitler and the corpse of his wife Braun, Eva. These twocorpses were also taken to the ‘Smersh’ Counter-Espionage Section of the 3rdAssault Army—the city of Buh (Berlin) …Because of the relocation of the ‘Smersh’Counter-Espionage Section of the Army, the corpses were exhumed and moved firstto the region of the city of Finov, and later, on 3 June, 1945, to the region ofthe city of Rathenau, where they were finally buried.45 [part0006.html#ft45]Then, in the same dated report, special attention is given to the means ofburial and the identification of the grave:The corpses were in wooden coffins in a 1.7 metre deep grave, laid out in thefollowing order:From east to west: Hitler, Eva Braun, Goebbels, Magda Goebbels, Krebs, andGoebbels' children.At the western end of the grave there is also a basket containing the bodies oftwo dogs, one of which belonged to Hitler personally and the other to Braun,Eva.The location of the burnt bodies: Germany, province of Brandenburg, the vicinityof the city of Rathenau, forest to the east off the city of Rathenau, along theroad from Rathenau to Scheetow…325 metres from a railway bridge, along a forestroad, from a milestone numbered 111 northeastwards 4-side marker bearing thesame number 111…The grave was filled in and smoothed over and small pine treeswere planted on it forming the number 111.46 [part0006.html#ft46]A number of points beg our attention. In the first place, the care taken to keepthe corpses of the dogs and carry them around Germany along with the otherbodies is somewhat unusual and inexplicable unless it demonstrates the anxietyof the SMERSH operatives lest the dogs one day prove to be invaluable asevidence and no one wanted to be the one to tell Stalin that they disposed ofthem in a ditch somewhere.In the second place, the almost ritualistic burial arrangement attracts ourattention, including the mysterious use of the number 111. While this may justhave been for the ease of locating the specific graves at a later date (whichthey did, in fact, do) one is still struck by the possibility of meaning orsignificance of the number.When looking for significance beyond that available to the normal avenues ofhistorical research, one is sometimes tempted to look in obscure andotherworldly places…at least, until something more concrete comes along. In thiscase recourse to a book on Kabbalah proved unexpectedly helpful in this regard,for the number 111 can mean anything from “Ruin, destruction, sudden death” to“Common holocaust,”47 [part0006.html#ft47] which seems oddly appropriate,especially when coming from a Jewish source! The scene also calls to mind thepicture in the Rider-Waite tarot deck of the “Three of Wands” card, which showsthree trees standing upright and a man between them, gazing out to sea. Themeaning usually attached to this card is “a journey.” The author, however, doesnot imply that the Soviet spies were aware of these associations but only that,sometimes, coincidence has its own contribution to make.This, however, was not the end of the wandering of the corpses for less than ayear later it was decided to dig them up again.From the SMERSH report entitled “Concerning the Re-Burial of the Remains” datedFebruary 21 and 23, 1946:…on this day, according to orders of the Chief of the ‘Smersh’ Counter-EspionageDepartment of the Group of the Soviet Occupational Forces inGermany—Lieutenant-General Comrade Zelenin, we opened up the grave containingthe corpses in the vicinity of the city of Rathenau:of Reichschanceller [sic] of Germany Adolf Hitlerof his wife Braun, Evaof the Minister of Propaganda of Germany—Dr Josef Goebbels, his wife MagdaGoebbels and their children— son Helmut and daughters Hilde, Helga, Hedda, Holdeand [Heide]of the Chief of the German General Staff—General KrebsAll the corpses mentioned are in a state of partial decay in wooden coffins andwere delivered in this condition to the city of Magdeburg, to the headquartersof the ‘Smersh’ Counter-Espionage Section of the Army and again buried in agrave 2 metres deep in the yard of a building at no. 36 Westendstrasse, near thesouthern stone wall of the yard, 24 metres due east of the wall of the garage ofthe house.The grave was filled in and smoothed over, blending in with the surroundingterrain.48 [part0006.html#ft48]This was to be only a temporary resting place as well, but at least these bodieswould stay buried for the next twenty-four years. The wandering of thecorpses—from the Reich Chancellery garden, to the suburb of Buch, then to Finow,then to Rathenow, and finally to Magdeburg—had come to an end. A total of fiveburial sites in nine months. To an outside observer, this peripatetic approachto body disposal makes little or no sense at all.And all this time, Stalin was insisting to anyone who would listen that Hitlerwas still alive.TotenkopfA portion of Hitler's body that was not buried with him was a part of his skull.This evidence, which consisted of his cranium with a bullet hole in it, wasfound by SMERSH near where the bodies were discovered in the Reich Chancellerygarden. It was immediately assumed that this was a piece of Hitler's skull (justas they had assumed that the body in their possession was Hitler's body). Thisforensic material was transported to Moscow where it was kept in a cardboard boxalong with Hitler's famous bridgework. Photographs of this skull fragment can beseen in Hitler's Death49 [part0006.html#ft49] and they have been reproducedsince then in many other places. The photos clearly show what seems to be abullet hole, and this satisfied Soviet intelligence that it was Hitler's (as ifa skull with a bullet hole in it was an anomaly in Berlin in 1945!).If SMERSH was convinced that they had the corpse of Adolf Hitler, and had hisskull (or a good piece of it) then why did Stalin keep insisting that Hitler wasstill alive? In fact, why did the Americans also claim that there was noevidence to prove that Hitler had died in the bunker?Why do declassified FBI and CIA files indicate that reports of Hitler sightingsin Latin America were taken seriously and followed up as late as the 1960s?Was it even remotely possible that Hitler had escaped?To answer that question we have to ask two more: was Hitler healthy enough toleave the bunker, and if so was it possible for anyone to leave Berlin in Aprilof 1945?Hitler's HealthIt has been widely reported that Hitler was suffering from an advanced stage ofParkinson's Disease. However, this was a condition that was never officiallydiagnosed by a physician at the time. All we have to go on are reports ofHitler's symptoms and erratic medical records kept by various doctors who cameand left Hitler's employ over the years and which do little to help clear up anycontroversy. One of the worst medical professionals attending the Führer was Dr.Theodor Morell, a specialist in patent medicines and general all-aroundquackery. It was Morell who kept Hitler drugged on a variety of poisons,pain-killers and placebos, and who most likely exacerbated whatever conditionHitler actually had.Although rumors of Hitler's Parkinsonism were rampant among Bunker insiders dueto the perceived symptoms—trembling hands, stooped posture, fixed stare,difficulty in getting up from a chair or walking very far—there were otherfactors at work that influenced Hitler's state of being. It is difficult at thisremove to state categorically that Hitler's apparently degenerating physicalcondition was strictly the result of Parkinson's Disease. We would have tosubtract the effects of the various drugs he was taking, the 1944 assassinationattempt, the stress of the constant bombardments at the end, the realizationthat the war was being lost, the treachery of his trusted colleagues such asHimmler and Göring, and so much else besides. There was also the question ofsyphillis.Another rumor around the Bunker and among insiders such as Himmler was the ideathat Hitler had contracted syphillis during his days in Vienna as animpoverished artist. Syphillis is the type of disease that can remain dormantfor decades and then suddenly appear. Himmler was eager to get his hands on anydocumentation that would prove this story, if only to ensure that it was buriedas deeply as possible…or to use it for blackmail purposes should it ever come tothat. It seems that no blood test results are available, however, even thoughHitler's first visit to Dr. Morell (in 1936) was in the latter's role as a“venereal specialist.” It is entirely possible, then, that Hitler believed hehad syphillis regardless of any medical evidence, and that Morell might haveused that belief to bolster his own position in the Fuhrer's inner circle.Hitler would have been forced to trust Morell with this secret, and Morell wouldhave made as much use of that trust as possible…short of getting himself killed,for Hitler was known to order the deaths of those he felt were a threat to hisimage. But if he believed he had syphillis, he would have been loath to take thechance of trusting another doctor with this information which may be why Morelllasted as long as he did. This is probably the only reason we can entertain forthe complete faith Hitler seemed to have in this quack, even when other—moretraditional and experienced—physicians were available and were occasionallycalled upon for their specialties; physicians who sized up Morell quite quicklyand who were troubled by the influence this man had over the leader of Germany.A brief description of the more than seventy different medicines Morell wasadministering to Hitler includes atropine, strychnine, and methamphetamines, aswell as various pseudo-medicines as “Septo-Iodine” and “Tonophospan” as well assomething called “Testoviron” which was presumably used for erectiledysfunction.50 [part0006.html#ft50]Atropine and strychnine are, of course, poisonous in the right doses. Atropine,a derivative of the Deadly Nightshade plant, can cause hallucinations,dizziness, extreme confusion, and loss of balance. Some of these symptoms areidentical to those of Parkinson's. Morell was using atropine in the form ofeyedrops for Hitler, since the latter was suffering from impaired vision. If thedrops were used continuously over a long period of time—and if the drops were ofan incorrect dosage—then the possibility of toxicity cannot be overlooked.Strychnine comes from the Nux Vomica plant, and is highly toxic. In lethal dosesit causes convulsions and rigidity of the abdominal muscles, among othersymptoms, and death results from respiratory failure, as the lungs are unable tocontract and expand, thus leading to asphyxiation. It appears that strychninewas used to treat Hitler's flatulence in a concoction called Doktor Koster'sAntigaspills, in a compound with Belladonna extract.51 [part0006.html#ft51]These drugs can cause severe cases of constipation…something from which thedictator suffered in those last years of his life, which caused Morell toprescribe still other medicines, and so on.The effects of methylamphetamines are widely known today, and could also havecontributed to Hitler's perceived psychotic behavior, including hallucinations,trembling, paranoia, etc. The constant dosing and the length of time (years)that Morell gave Hitler amphetamines suggest a serious addiction; yet, in Aprilof 1945 Hitler grew angry with Morell and even threatened to have himexecuted.52 [part0006.html#ft52]Thus, we can only safely diagnose Parkinson's Disease in Hitler— long-distance,as it were—if we are able to isolate his symptoms from those of the other drugshe was taking. One thing is known, however, and that is that Morell flew out ofBerlin on April 22, eight days before the end…which indicates that perhapsHitler was no longer taking Morell's prescriptions at the time of his presumeddeath, even though a supply of some of the drugs was left behind and these werepresumably—but not definitively—administered by Linge.In retrospect, Morell's flight from the Bunker just might have saved theFührer's life.GötterdammerungSeveral important Nazis have discussed the possibility of Hitler's flight fromBerlin. One of these was Hitler's favorite commando, Otto Skorzeny.Skorzeny was the man who rescued Italian dictator Benito Mussolini when thelatter had been kidnapped by men loyal to the Italian king. It was a daringrescue attempt, with Skorzeny using gliders and parachutes to rescue the Fascistfrom the top of a mountain in a surprise attack. He was a man who understoodmilitary operations and commando action, and knew what was possible and what wasnot.Just as importantly, it would be Skorzeny himself who would play a pivotal rolein the creation and maintenance of the Nazi underground after the war.Interviewed by author Glenn B. Infield, Skorzeny had this to say about Hitler'spossible escape:“It was entirely possible for the Fuhrer to leave the bunker by a subterraneanpassage under the Reich Chancellery…climb to street level on the Hermann GoringStrasse, cut across the Tiergarten at the Zoo Station area near the Adolf HitlerPlatz and follow the railway lines to the Reichssportfeld. He could then havecrossed the Scharndorfestrasse, traversed the Piechelsdorf Bridge, and walked tothe Havel. He then could have been picked up by a seaplane that would havelanded on the river.”53 [part0006.html#ft53]The fact that a seaplane did, indeed, land on the River Havel the night of April29 or April 30 before taking off a few minutes later, only adds some credibilityto Skorzeny's educated guess.54 [part0006.html#ft54] Further, no one knows whereSkorzeny was on April 30, 1945 for he is next seen on May 2 sitting in hispersonal train on a siding in Austria. This is important for another reason, forone of his visitors on that train was SS Oberführer Josef Spacil, the SS officerin charge of finances.55 [part0006.html#ft55] Spacil is a name to conjure with,for he told Allied investigators essentially the same story after his capture:that Hitler had escaped Berlin:Spacil claimed that Hitler had not died in his bunker. Under cover of darkness,disguised as a civilian, he was secretly transported out of Berlin in a smallplane. A partially cremated body double had been left behind to fool theRussians.56 [part0006.html#ft56]This story is important for several reasons. In the first place, it corroboratesSkorzeny's version (but that could have been because Spacil and Skorzeny had metonly days before Spacil's capture by Allied forces and thus had time tocoordinate their stories). In the second place, the story of Hitler's partiallycremated remains was not general knowledge outside a small circle of insiderswhich include either the Bunker inhabitants themselves who were complicit inthis hoax, or the Soviet agents who found the planted body. Also, the presenceof Skorzeny in Austria might possibly indicate complicity in Hitler's presumedescape for, as we shall see, Austria was one of the stops on the Ratline and apossible transit point for the subject of this book.In the third place, Spacil was one of those faceless bureaucrats whonevertheless knew where all the other bodies were buried. Spacil's job wasoverseeing the financial arrangements that emanated from the death camps. Allthose gold rings, jewelry, confiscated art, and confiscated currency from thevictims of the Holocaust were under his supervision and disbursement. He was animportant person to know in the last days of the Reich, and traveled tirelesslybetween various locations in Germany and Austria to ensure that the vast Naziwealth would not fall to the Allies. It would be Spacil who, once captured,would eventually lead the Allies to some of the treasure that was hidden by theNazis in the last months of the war. It would also be Spacil who was well awareof the vast counterfeiting operation undertaken by the Nazis, with a view todestabilizing the British Pound and other currencies.This trafficking in illicitly-obtained funds was one of the cornerstones of whatwould become the Ratline: the escape route used by the Nazis (and mostespecially the SS) to the Middle East, North America, Latin America, Australiaand…as the author discovered by accident one warm tropical evening…Asia.ODESSAOne of the problems facing any responsible historian or investigative journalistattempting to present a coherent narrative of the wholesale escape-and-rescueoperation of Nazis after the war is the looming spectre of ODESSA. Promoted byprofessional Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal as a fact, ODESSA was most likely aterm that covered a wide range of various mechanisms and independent operatorsand not the single, monolithic organization popularized by the FrederickForsythe novel, The ODESSA File. The idea of ODESSA as a powerful internationalbrotherhood of former SS officers has been exploded, which means that anyoneresearching and writing about the Ratline has to confront the fiction in orderto uncover the facts.However, that does not mean that underground networks created specifically tohelp the Nazis escape did not exist. In fact, the truth is much more shockingthan the fiction.In the last days of the war, as the Russians advanced inexorably on theReichstag and eventually the Reich Chancellery itself, the rats began desertingthe sinking ship. Notable escapees from the Bunker included Martin Bormann,Artur Axmann, and the SS officers Linge and Günsche, among many others. Theywere able to make it successfully to various points in Berlin, and Axmann madeit as far as southern Bavaria. Linge and Günsche were captured by the Soviets,as we have seen, as were Baur and Mengershausen. Bormann's fate remainedsomething of a mystery, however, and rumors of his survival were legion; a storywe will get to later on in this investigation.Throughout Germany, high-ranking SS officers were seeking ways to avoid captureand almost certain incarceration, if not execution. The SS had been declared a“criminal organization” and many of them had, indeed, committed what can only beconsidered war crimes or crimes against humanity. As early as 1944—after theD-Day invasion of June, 1944 when it became obvious that the war waslost—pragmatic Nazis such as Bormann were quickly and efficiently creating anexit strategy. This strategy involved the movement of gold and other currenciesout of Germany and eventually out of Europe.The number of Nazi personnel who were involved in this project, as well as thebewildering array of Nazi organizations they represented, was impressive. Whilemuch attention has been focused on recognizable names such as Martin Bormannthere were other individuals and groups with a vested interest in making surethat enough money was expatriated from Germany and its wartime possessions toenable a flow of war criminals relatively unimpeded by considerations ofpolitics, visa documentation, or arrest warrants.Some of these individuals included those that were well known to Alliedintelligence but who were not household names to the rest of the world. One ofthese, identified by Argentine investigator Uki Goñi, was Carlos Fuldner.57[part0006.html#ft57] Fuldner was a native of Argentina of German heritage whobecame an SS officer and who, later, wound up working for the SD(Sicherheitsdienst or Foreign Intelligence) department of the SS, presumablyunder SD chief Walter Schellenberg. Without delving too deeply into Fuldner'slong and chequered career we can focus on one or two aspects of his involvementin the story of the Ratline.Fuldner was a con man, and in the last months of the war a con man is preciselywhat the Reich needed. With dual Argentine and German citizenship, he was ableto cross borders almost effortlessly. As someone who had committed fraud in thepast and who even went so far as to embezzle SS funds at one point, Fuldner hadabilities that the Nazis would eventually find quite useful as their governmentdegenerated into a criminal or rogue state. It is worthwhile to point out thatArgentina stayed neutral during most of the war, but that did not mean thatArgentina was truly neutral in any ordinary sense of the word. The large andinfluential German community in Argentina made sure that political andgovernment sentiments and policies (especially immigration) were staunchlypro-Nazi and anti-Semitic. Some of the most virulent anti-Semitic tracts everpublished came out of Argentina in the 1940s and, indeed, many Argentines feltthemselves to be more European than “Latin American”, a phrase they viewed as apejorative.58 [part0006.html#ft58] By staying out of the conflict, Argentina wasactually more useful to the Third Reich. Its shipping was not vulnerable toattack from either side in the war and thus Argentina was able to sell its beefand other products abroad with relative impunity. It was also able to conductdialogue with both sides, enabling the Reich to use its influence to ensure thatArgentina would remain a useful partner in the war and also its aftermath.Fuldner's brief was to help ensure that relations between Argentina and theReich remained solid and that networks were formed and maintained that wouldenable the movement of men and money to Argentina via Italy and Spain. Franco'sSpain was an essential element in the early days of the Ratline, for Francohimself was a Nazi-sympathizer who had gone so far as to send a division of20,000 troops— the famous “Blue Division”—to help Hitler fight the Russians onthe Eastern front. The Nazis used Spanish ports as support bases for theirU-boat traffic, the Etappendienst or “Stages Service”. Established by the futureAdmiral Dönitz during the First World War, the Etappendienst was brought back tolife in the Second World War as a vital part of the Nazis' U-boat strategy. Whenthe war was over, the men who were involved in the Etappendienst remained behindto serve as a kind of fifth column to support the flight of their fellow Germansout of Europe and to safer harbors.Fuldner's role in Spain was murky. Allied intelligence could not completelyunderstand what he was up to in Germany and Spain, but suspected that he wasworking for German intelligence in some capacity involving finances and themovement of money. He is said to have served with Franco's Blue Division on theRussian front, and also to have obtained a position with Sofindus (short forSociedad Financiera Industrial), a Spanish-German conglomerate that at its peakcontrolled more than 50 ships and 10 agricultural enterprises, and which was runfrom Berlin by SS Oberführer Johannes Bernhardt. Bernhardt himself wore a blackSS uniform replete with the Spanish Falange insignia, explicit testimony to hisinvolvement with Franco's regime. This also implies a discrete connection withthe Etappendienst and, with the war coming to an end in the spring of 1945, wefind Fuldner arriving in Madrid in March of that year to start working on hisreal career achievement: the establishment of the Ratline's Spanish component.It is worthwhile to note that the Allies had computed the amount of gold cominginto Spain from Nazi Germany during the period of the war as more than 122 tons(conservatively; other estimates put it at more than 200 tons). Thesecalculations were based on records obtained from Sofindus and from truckingmanifests out of Germany to Spain. The final disposition of this gold isunknown, but it would have been worth more than US$100 million in 1945dollars.59 [part0006.html#ft59]By December of 1947, then in Genoa and with credentials provided by PresidentJuan Perón of Argentina, Fuldner was able to create a complex but efficientmachinery for the movement of SS officers and other war criminals out of Europeand to Argentina, including the architect of the Final Solution: Adolf Eichmann.While Nazis already had been on the run by mid-1945, it would not be untilPerón's election to the Argentine presidency in 1946 that the large-scale escapeof war criminals to South America would begin in earnest.The first documented case of a war criminal fleeing to Argentina was that of theFrench aeronautics engineer Emil Dewoitine. Dewoitine designed jet aircraft forGermany and Japan as well as for Spain during the war, and was wanted by theFrench authorities. Using a Spanish passport, he was able to flee Europe for thesafety of Argentina in May of 1946. By the following August, he had alreadydeveloped a jet plane prototype for the Perónist regime, to much fanfare. Theperson who helped him escape was Cardinal Antonio Caggiano, an Argentineclergyman who helped set up the Spanish end of the Ratline along with assistancefrom French and Belgian Nazis.60 [part0006.html#ft60]Knowing all this, would it have been possible for Hitler to have escaped and, ifso, how and when and where?If we accept the idea that he escaped Berlin by plane (a theory that is by nomeans certain), where did he wind up in the immediate days after the fall ofBerlin?One of the scenarios that has been suggested 61 [part0006.html#ft61] is that thesmall seaplane that landed in Berlin on April 29 or April 30 then took off forDenmark. The passenger(s) was then taken aboard a U-Boat and made for the opensea. While we know that planes did take off and land in Berlin at the very endof April—famed pilot Hanna Reitsch's plane did just that—it was an extremelydangerous undertaking. Soviet batteries were constantly sweeping the skies overBerlin and although Hanna Reitsch did make it out of Berlin it is doubtful(although possible) that she had Hitler on board.A more likely escape route would have been to the south, to the area aroundBerchtesgaden where, indeed, Artur Axmann eventually did appear, safe and sound.This escape route would still have been physically arduous not to mentiondangerous. It was also a target for Allied forces who were aware of theimportance of the region to the Nazi high command, many of whom—like Göring—hadhouses in the vicinity. It was also the location of the legendary NationalRedoubt, where it was believed the Nazis would organize a post-war operationagainst the Allies. Had Hitler repaired to his famous retreat it would have beenonly a matter of time before the most wanted man in Europe was apprehended.The one place that remained relatively secure for the Nazis, however, was theAlpine region between Austria and Italy known as the Tyrol.62[part0006.html#ft62] Accessible from southern Bavaria in a straight line southof Munich, it was a notorious link on the Ratline from Germany and Austria tothe Italian port city of Genoa. This area was known for its smugglers and for amulticultural environment that was both German and Italian; the Tyroleans wereused to the trafficking of humans as well as of goods. It would have beenpossible for Hitler to have remained in the Tyrol for years before finding itnecessary to move along the line to Genoa. Indeed, several Nazis on the Allies'most wanted list did just that.The families of Martin Bormann, Heinrich Himmler and Josef Mengele—among manyothers—found refuge for a while in the South Tyrol. Others—war criminals likeErich Priebke, the SS officer implicated in the massacre at the Adreatine Caves63 [part0006.html#ft63] in Italy—wound up in hiding there for quite some timebefore fleeing to South America. Many French collaborators fled to the regionafter the collapse of the Vichy regime, some with entire families and theirpossessions on wagons. Eastern European fascists and Nazis also used the SouthTyrol as a convenient—and congenial—way-station on their escape route.The area was well-known to Bormann and Hitler and, indeed, Hitler himself was anAustrian by birth who came from the town of Branau-am-Inn. There had been rumorsthat the Fuhrer had established some sort of Alpine redoubt in the Tyrol, butthat was never proven although recently declassified documents make it clearthat such a Redoubt was at least in the planning stages by the end of the war.However, the close association of the Tyrol with Hitler had been made and theAllies were aware of the possibility that Hitler would manage to find refuge inan area he knew well.From the South Tyrol there were several possible avenues of escape out ofEurope. One of these led to Genoa, the seaport on Italy's northwestern coast,but this was not used immediately after the war due to the large Allied presencein the region. Another route led to the southern coast of Italy, to Bari on theAdriatic, a port popular with traders, fishermen and smugglers from Greece andWest Asia.64 [part0006.html#ft64] These were logical points of egress and, oncethe Allies stopped looking aggressively for war criminals in 1947, it becamefairly easy for former SS officers and their families to mix with the huge rushof displaced persons and other emigrants trying to find a home or safe havenabroad. Indeed, there was even a Jewish Displaced Persons (DP) camp in Bari atthe end of the war.While more focus has been directed at the port of Genoa—for that was the exitpoint for ships traveling to the Americas—the eastern coast of Italy was usefulfor anyone traveling to the eastern Mediterranean or the Middle East. In thosedays of tremendous confusion in the immediate post-war period, it would not haverequired the organizational capabilities of an ODESSA in order to effect ananonymous flight abroad, especially if money was no object and especially if thecurrency in question was gold (since Reichsmarks would have been worthless, andother currencies—such as the British pound—had been famously counterfeited bythe Nazis).Thus, there were several routes available to the Nazis and it is only a matterof conjecture at this point, which one would have been used by Hitler. Thepossibility of a flight to Denmark (or to another country with a sea coast, suchas Spain) cannot be discounted, even though the Denmark story has beenjustifiably criticized. Hitler would have had to travel in tremendous secrecy,in such a way that there was no possibility of capture. Many of his associatesand henchmen did manage to escape that way, of course, but Hitler had to havebeen the most easily recognizable person on the planet by that time. He wouldhave had to change his appearance considerably. As he was most famous for hisCharlie Chaplin-style moustache, that would have had to go. Without it, there isa good chance that he would not have been immediately recognized…especially ifno one had been looking for him after the widely disseminated report byTrevor-Roper in September of 1945 confirming his death.If he was indeed, as sick as has been suggested then there would have been stepstaken to accommodate his illness while simultaneously maintaining his cover.Would anyone have seriously challenged an old man in a wheelchair? Perhaps beingaccompanied by a nurse or a doctor? All that was necessary was that the ruse bemaintained at least until the “patient” was safely aboard a plane or a vesselthat would take him to sanctuary.At a time when there were so many casualties of the war, so many persons withwounds, or crippled, or missing eyes or limbs, one more hospital case would nothave been challenged very deeply particularly if the “victim” in question werean old man in a wheelchair. By the end of the war Hitler was only fifty-sixyears old, but according to those who knew him in the Bunker he had agedconsiderably since the July, 1944 assassination attempt. Add to that thesymptoms so suggestive of Parkinson's Disease (and it is important to rememberthat his condition was a state secret and not known to the general public) andyou have an excellent candidate for pity and mercy. Such a stateless person,with no identity documents, would have been an ideal candidate for theInternational Red Cross passport as well: a travel document that was beingissued with somewhat reckless abandon and with little or no supportingidentification documentation required…except, in certain cases, identificationprovided courtesy of the Roman Catholic Church.Such a stateless person would have been able to find another home, anywhere onthe planet, particularly if they had the blessing of the Vatican itself.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------44 [part0006.html#fn44] Anna Dolgov, “Hitler's Skull Fragment Displayed,”Associated Press, April 26, 2000.

Intriguingly, Hollywood actor Sterling Hayden—as OSSofficer “Jack Hamilton”—used Bari as his base for undercover operations againstthe Nazis and the Ustashe in Yugoslavia during the war, operations that wereseverely hindered by British forces who considered Yugoslavia their own theaterof operations. See the declassified OSS file on Sterling Hayden."},{"pageContent":"Chapter ThreeThe Monastery RouteI had no idea how one went about finding a bishop at the Vatican.…‘Are you onthe way to see Hudal?’ I said yes, but that I didn't know where to find him.…The Bishop came into the room where I was waiting and he held out both hishands and said, ‘You must be Franz Stangl. I was expecting you.’65[part0007.html#ft65]Bishop Alois Hudal (1885–1963) was a central figure in the escape route used bythe Nazis, and a devoted National Socialist who wrote a book defending Nazismand praising it as an ideological adversary to Communism. He was an Austrian,born in Graz.Franz Stangl (1908–1971), also an Austrian, was the commander of theextermination camps at Sobibor and Treblinka, responsible for the deaths of900,000 people. Bishop Hudal personally arranged his International Red Crosstravel documents66 [part0007.html#ft66] and his escape to Syria, from whereStangl eventually made it to South America before being arrested and extraditedto West Germany to stand trial. Decades after the war's end he was found guiltyof mass murder, and died six months later of a heart attack.Hudal also arranged the escapes of Gustav Wagner (1911–1980), Stangl's deputycommander at Sobibor who later died in Brazil, as well as SS-HauptsturmführerAlois Brunner (1912–1996?) responsible for the deaths of nearly 150,000 Jewishprisoners in the gas chambers and who some believe is still living in Syria, aswell as Brunner's immediate superior SS-Obersturmbannführer and architect of theFinal Solution, Adolf Eichmann (1906–1962) and so many others…with theassistance of Msgr. Krunoslav Draganovic.The name Krunoslav Draganovic in the Indonesian diary was the most significantdiscovery of the entire investigation. In 1970, very few individuals were awareof who Draganovic was, or of his connection to the Vatican and the escape routeused by the Nazis called by military intelligence the “ratlines.”Draganovic was a monsignor in the Roman Catholic Church, and a Croat who was asupporter of the vicious Ustashe regime led by Ante Pavelic (1889–1959) and,indeed, helped Pavelic obtain the Red Cross passport he would need to escape toArgentina. The Ustashe were fascists and Nazis, extremely anti-Semitic,anti-Communist and also anti-Eastern Orthodox. They were Catholic, and numberedCatholic clergy not only among their membership but also in the violenceassociated with the Croatian concentration camps. These crimes did not matter tomen like Bishop Hudal or Draganovic, or to a number of other Catholic clergy whoformed an important element of the ratlines known as the “monastery route.”In July of 1946, American intelligence became aware of the monastery route and aU.S. State Department official wrote a memo (only declassified in 1985)identifying the major players and associating it directly with the Croat Ustashemovement. Dated 12 July 1946, the subject line is: “Alleged Vatican Protectionof Jugoslav War Criminals.”It reads, in part:1. At No. 7 Via Carlo Alberto, Rome, in a building under extraterritorialVatican jurisdiction, are located the COLLEGIUM ILLIRICUM and the COLLEGIUMORIENTALIS.2. The Ustasche of PAVELIC'S Independent Croat State formerly championed thetheory that the Croats are not Slavs, but are of Gothic origin. Subsequent tothe fall of Nazism this theory was repudiated, and [censored] the COLLEGIUMORIENTALIS is engaged in advancing the theory that the Croats are of Persianorigin.3. Both theories, that of the Gothic and that of the Persian origin of theCroats, are supported by the Vatican which wishes to strengthen Croat separatisttendencies and to assure their support of the Vatican-inspired “Catholic State”which is projected to include CROATIA, BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA, DALMATIA, SLOVENIA,CARINTHIA, ISTRIA and the JULIAN MARCH linked to AUSTRIA.4. This same separatist tendency, is evident among the Slovenians, too, and the“Strazar” Party supported by the Jesuit Academy at No. 6 Via Borgia, Rome, isits principal propaganda organ. The Academy is headed by Father PRESEREN himselfof Slovenian origin, a member of the Supreme Directorate of the JesuitInstitutions. Hesitation of Slovenian People's Party leader Dr. Mih KREK to jointhe Jugoslav Central Committee in London, despite his strongly maintainedposition regarding the necessity for the creation of a democratic JugoslavFederation, is surely to a great extent based on a knowledge of what is takingplace in the Croat San Girolamo degli Illirici Foundation in Rome and in theJesuit Academy.5. In Austria, following their withdrawal from Jugoslavia with the Germans, themembers of the NEDIC and the Dimitrijo LJOTIC Quisling organizations, and theMontenegrin Separatists proceeded to draw up a deed with Croatian Ustaschaorgans by means of which they hoped to obtain Vatican sponsorship with a view toescaping possible war-criminal prosecution. Such Vatican sponsorship wasaccorded the Ustascha, chiefly in order to assure their silence regarding theatrocities committed by Clergy-led Croats who had indulged in a ruthless programof extermination of Jews and Orthodox Serbs.The Collegium Orientalis, mentioned above, was the headquarters of Bishop AloisHudal in Rome. It was at the Collegium Orientalis that Franz Stangl met BishopHudal. The San Girolamo degli Illirici Foundation was the Roman headquarters ofFather Krunoslav Draganovic.It is evident in the State Department memo that there was considerablerationalization among these clergymen concerning the racial identity of theCroats, since the Nazis had deemed the Slavs to be an inferior race. If theCroats were Slavs, then they were but a half-step above the Jews and the Gypsiesand suitable only for slave labor at best; but if they were Persian, then theywere Aryan. (After all, the word Iran means “Aryan”).The Croats were largely Catholic, and the idea of a Catholic bulwark againstCommunism was something that had wide appeal. This concept was mirrored inArgentine fascism, which saw itself and its role in the world in identicalterms. Thus it should come as no surprise that there was a natural alliancebetween the Croats and the Argentines, through the intermediary of churchmenlike Draganovic and Hudal. They saw their enemy as Communism, and their naturalallies in the fight against the Communists were the Nazis.Hudal had written a book on National Socialism67 [part0007.html#ft67] that waswell received by the Nazi high command. Although the Third Reich was suspiciousof the Church—and, indeed, were intent on eventually replacing Christianity withtheir own form of neo-Paganism—they understood that it was better to have theChurch on their side, at least for the duration of the war. Politically it meantthat the Church would not officially condemn the Third Reich, thus assuring acertain degree of cooperation from both the clergy and the laity. Militarily, itmeant that Catholics would have no qualms about joining the German army and thatthey would be less likely to offer resistance to the Nazis, at least not onideological grounds. In addition, the Reichsconcordat signed on July 20, 1933 byCardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli with Franz von Papen on behalf ofHindenburg essentially left the German Catholics at the mercy of the Reich at atime when Hitler had just been named Chancellor and was on his way to becomingGermany's dictator. While ostensibly designed to safeguard German Catholics,what it did in essence was acknowledge the Reich's authority vis-à-vis theChurch in Germany. It reduced the ability of the German church to criticize theReich and effectively neutralized the opposition.It was within this tense atmosphere of 1930s Europe that bishops like Hudal andclergy like Draganovic could openly support the Nazi regime. The Concordat gavetheir praise of the Nazi Party a degree of legitimacy they might not otherwisehave enjoyed, and it freed them to focus their attention on resisting anddefeating Communism, seen as the true enemy of both the Church and the State.There was no official censure of pro-Nazi bishops or priests by the Holy See;had there been, the plight of Catholics living under the Third Reich would havebeen imperiled. So it was the “lesser” of two evils: turn a blind eye to thehorrors of the Holocaust so that the Catholics of Germany would remain safe andout of danger. Meanwhile, some Catholic clergy and laypeople did their best tosave as many Jews as possible; but it was not official policy and had to be donequietly.The man who signed the Reichsconcordat with Germany—Cardinal EugenioPacelli—became Pope Pius XII: the wartime pontiff who did not raise his voiceagainst the Nazis but who did, once the war was over, turn his energy andattention to the defeat of Communism, a strategy that fit well with that of thepro-Nazi clergy under his administration and which contributed mightily to theobscene scenario of clergymen helping war criminals accused of the most hideousatrocities to escape justice.Much has been written about Pope Pius XII and what is perceived as hissupport—tacit or implicit—of the Nazi regime. The Catholic Church has beencriticized for this by any number of historians and observers, and the Vaticanhas usually fought back, insisting that the allegations are without merit. Thefact remains, however, that the Nazi war criminals most famous, most wanted,most notorious were protected and aided in their escape by a series of Catholicpriests, bishops, and cardinals throughout Europe and North and South America.Whether or not this was “official” policy, it most definitely took place andthere was no policy—official or otherwise—to stop it.While many high-ranking clergy were pro-Nazi—and not just in their sentimentsbut in the actions they took to promote Nazism and to defend itsperpetrators—that does not mean that the Vatican itself was pro-Nazi; but fromthe point of view of the laity, of the people who filled the pews on Sunday andwho looked up to their priests as men of God, it could only appear as officialpolicy. A churchgoer in Zagreb or Sarajevo would come away with the clearperception that the Church supported Nazism in all its manifestations.Photographs of Roman Catholic priests, bishops and cardinals standing shoulderto shoulder with men in the uniforms of the SS or the Ustashe, giving the “HeilHitler” salute, could only be construed as evidence of tacit approval.It is a luxury for historians to parse the documents and deconstruct thespeeches and analyze the treaties and the wars in an effort to identify trends,affiliations, and responsibilities; but the history of the world from the pointof view of those who suffer is fundamentally different from the point of view ofthe comfortable and the powerful. The suffering deal with the experience ofhistory—the blood. The powerful deal with the data of history—the documents. Thetruth, if it can be discovered, lies somewhere between the two.This is especially true when documents are released piecemeal due toclassification, “national security” concerns, etc. The story slowly unfolds,over the course of years and decades, and as it does it changes. If one diesbefore the whole story is revealed, one has lived one's whole life with a lieand under the illusion that what one knows is true.This issue is central to this book, this research. There is no doubt that lieswere told about the death of Hitler; there is no doubt that lies were told aboutthe culpability of persons in the Allied governments concerning the flight andprotection of criminals such as Eichmann and Barbie, Rauff and Stangl. But thisinformation has only been coming to light since the mid-1980s, long after theend of the war when we thought we already knew the “truth.” These deceptionsextend to those perpetrated by the Catholic Church at the same time, concerningthese same criminals, and for the same reasons. As the governments of the UnitedStates, the United Kingdom, and Russia begin to come clean regarding whatactually took place in the weeks and months after the end of the war in Europe,the role of the Church is similarly exposed.One of the most revealing statements concerning American intelligencecooperation with the monastery route is contained in a document dated July 12,1948 from Paul E. Lyon and Charles Crawford, both Special Agents of the CIC430th Detachment in Vienna. The subject line reads; “Rat Line from Austria toSouth America” and contains unequivocal proof of the involvement of the USmilitary in Draganovic's operation. Declassified in the 1980s, it can be seen asthe “smoking gun” in the wider implementation of the monastery route to includeU.S. military and intelligence personnel.It is worthwhile to quote the memo in length in order that the reader realizethe scope of the project:2. Through the Vatican connections of Father Draganovic, Croat, DP ResettlementChief of the Vatican circle, a tentative agreement was reached to assist in thisoperation. The agreement consists of simply mutual assistance, i.e., theseagents assist persons of interest to Father Draganovic to leave Germany and, inturn, Father Draganovic will assist these agents in obtaining the necessaryvisas to Argentina, South America, for persons of interest to this Command.3. It may be stated that some of the persons of interest to Father Draganovicmay be of interest to the Denazification policy of the Allies; however, thepersons assisted by Father Draganovic are also of interest to our Russian ally.Therefore, this operation cannot receive any official approval and must behandled with minimum amount of delay and with a minimum amount of generalknowledge.4. On 3 July 1948, these agents contacted the Austrian representative of FatherDraganovic in Salzburg, as prearranged. Through the assistance of CIC Salzburg,transportation was obtained and the representative was escorted to BadReichenhall, Germany, where he was to meet the German representative of FatherDraganovic's organization. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the Germanrepresentative did not appear. The Austrian representative was escorted back toSalzburg to await developments.5. On 4 July 48 these agents received a telegram from the U.S. contact in Rome(Fred Martin) that the German representative was arrested while crossing theGerman/Austrian border on or about 1 July 48. It was the desire of the agents togo to Bad Reichenhall, Germany to make the necessary investigation, however dueto transportation difficulties, this was not deemed advisable.6. The status of subject rat line is not settled at this time, however it isfelt that with CIC connections in Germany, these agents can assist the Germanrepresentative and continue their progress as outlined above.NOTE: It is suggested to the Chief, 430th CIC Detachment, USFA, that areassignment of jeeps be made, and that two detachment jeeps be assigned toheadquarters. These jeeps could be stationed and utilized by Land Salzburg andLand Upper Austria but be prepared to move upon call from representatives of CICheadquarters. In this manner most of the difficulties in obtainingtransportations for such operations can be avoided. Also the responsibilitiesfor incorrect use of said vehicles, i.e., police violations, utilizingGovernment vehicles for pleasure, will be the responsibility of the driver andnot the Land Section to which the jeep is originally assigned.It is believed that in this manner considerable time, personal difficulties, andpersonality differences could be avoided and assist in the speedy completion ofsimilar missions.A number of things can be discerned from this memo. In the first place, thedecision to assist Draganovic was made as early as July of 1948, even though CICmemos from 1946 and 1947 expressed a certain degree of alarm over his operation.Further, CIC placed transportation and other services at the disposal of theRatline. And finally CIC kept the entire operation secret from the Russians, whowere looking for many of these individuals for war crimes in the Soviet zoneand, indeed, the entire operation would not receive “official approval” andwould be handled with a “minimum amount of delay and a minimum amount of generalknowledge.” It was a black op, an intelligence operation conducted withoutofficial approval.The pact had been made. American military intelligence colluded with the Vaticanto assist Nazi and Ustashe war criminals in their escape to South America. TheRatline ran from Austria (and specifically Salzburg, where we will find the Pöchcouple at this time) to South America, with the American military providinglogistical support.Some of the clergy involved at one time or another in the “monastery route”include, in addition to Hudal and Draganovic, Msgr. Don Giuseppe Bicchierai, thesecretary to Archbishop (later Cardinal) Ildefonso Schuster of Milan, andArchbishop Siri of Genoa. According to Simon Wiesenthal, Msgr. Bicchieraiarranged for SS Standartenführer Walter Rauff (and others) to “stay covertly inthe convents of the Holy See”68 [part0007.html#ft68] prior to their escape fromEurope. During the 1948 election campaign in Italy—in which there was a dangerof a Communist takeover—Bicchierai worked with the CIA to frustrate attempts bythe Italian Communist party to seize control of the government, an effort whichpossibly involved Walter Rauff as well.Rauff—the SS chief in Milan during the last years of the war—had been workingwith future CIA Director Allen Dulles in the well-documented Operation Sunrisewhile Dulles was chief of the OSS in Berne, Switzerland. Operation Sunrise wasan arrangement between Dulles, the SS and the Wehrmacht that ensured that theGerman surrender to the Allies in Italy would take place in a gentlemanlyfashion. It was a strange agreement, one that afforded the SS in particularspecial treatment at the hands of Dulles and the OSS. Dulles had understoodearly on that the “real enemy” was Soviet communism, and by enlisting the aid ofSS officers as well as the generals of the Wehrmacht he felt he could containthat threat more successfully. Walter Rauff was one of the beneficiaries of thisarrangement, regardless of the fact that it was Rauff who invented theEinsatzgruppen's mobile gas chambers—specially fitted vans that had the carbonmonoxide exhaust piped directly into the back of the van holding thevictims—that were used to kill more than 100,000 Jewish prisoners before the gaschambers and crematoria at the camps were built.Walter Rauff was a war criminal by every known metric, yet both the Church andAmerican intelligence collaborated in his escape from justice. Rauff eventuallywound up in Chile, where the mass murderer lived out the remainder of his daysin peace and with the moral support of the significant German community in thatcountry as well as the dictator Augusto Pinochet, and former Chilean AmbassadorMiguel Serrano who conducted a Nazi-style funeral service for Rauff in Santiagowhen the latter died there in 1984. He was not the first war criminal to use themonastery route of the Ratline, nor would he be the last.The total number of war criminals who used the monastery route remains unknown,but there is ample evidence for some of the most notorious. We also havedocumentation concerning the flight of many other persons for whom the Alliesmay not have had accurate dossiers in the months and years after the war, suchas the Ustashe officers who fled en masse to South America, courtesy ofDraganovic, or the thousands of Ukrainian Waffen-SS who wound up in both Northand South America after the war. Many of these men may have been minorfunctionaries, lowly guards or bureaucrats, pushing the paper that would sendhundreds if not thousands to their deaths; others were merely following ordersin the Nazi structure of Führerprinzip: the Führer Principle in which every manhad a leader—a Führer—above him whose orders had to be followed immediately andwithout question. The fact that they had to flee, however, does indicate acertain level of culpability in war crimes.Take the Ustashe for example.The Independent State of Croatia was formed as a puppet government of the ThirdReich. In 1929 the Ustashe (a form of the Croatian verb “to rise up”) had beenconceived as a Croatian liberation movement against the Yugoslav state which wasseen as heavily biased in favor of the Serbian population, but by 1941 itincluded not only present-day Croatia but parts of Bosnia as well. The Kingdomof Yugoslavia itself had come into existence after World War One, comprisingseveral different ethnic groups including the Serbs, Croats, Slovenes andMontenegrins in much the same way Czechoslovakia was formed out of two disparateethnic groups, the Czechs and the Slovaks69 [part0007.html#ft69]. As in the caseof Czechoslovakia (not to mention Iraq, with Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish groupsall in a single, artifically-created, country designed by academics and spiesafter World War One) the various ethnicities did not always relate in harmoniousfashion. In the case of Yugoslavia, there were ancient disputes anddisagreements. The Croats were largely Catholic and Muslim; the Serbs wereEastern Orthodox. Thus the Ustashe was formed to emphasize a homogenous racialidentity— Croat—with both Catholic and Muslim manifestations.Its undisputed leader was Ante Pavelic, a vicious fanatic and politicalassassin, who counted among his foremost supporters priests and bishops of theRoman Catholic Church. One of these, Archbishop Stepinac, was beatified by PopeJohn Paul II and is on his way to becoming a saint of the Church even though hiswartime record is spotty and his support for the Ustashe and for Croatianindependence was never in doubt.70 [part0007.html#ft70] Jewish groups havepraised Stepinac for having saved some Jews from the Holocaust, and for bravelystanding up to the Ustashe regime when it came to the atrocities being committedagainst the Serbs and the Jews; yet it seems the real interest of the Church incanonizing Archbishop Stepinac is in the clergyman's reputation as ananti-Communist who was arrested, convicted and imprisoned for war crimes by theYugoslav government. This is evidence of another kind of problem when it comesto understanding history.If one is a supporter of Stepinac's canonization, one is automaticallyconsidered pro-Fascist (or a dupe of Fascists) by the Left. If one criticizeshis canonization, then one is automatically considered a Communist (or aCommunist dupe) by the Right. Skepticism is fine for analyzing historicalevents; cynicism, though, is an obstacle and colors the results, especially whena simplistic, dualistic approach is taken.For instance, the Ustashe believed in a Catholic and Muslim Croatia, oddlyenough by today's either/or standards. The Ustashe saw Croatian Muslims asessentially pure-blooded Croats who converted to Islam in order to preserve thestate under Ottoman rule. Serbs, however, as well as Jews and Gypsies (both Romaand Sinti) were seen as inferior races only deserving of extermination, and theSerbian Orthodox Church as a tool of the oppressive Yugoslav regime.71[part0007.html#ft71] To that end, the Ustashe created its own death camps, amongthem the notorious Jasenovac concentration camp.Jasenovac had been created as a forced labor and death camp by the Ustashe formostly Serbian prisoners as well as Jews and Gypsies. There is controversy overthe total number of victims slaughtered at Jasenovac, but most authorities agreethat between 65,000 and 100,000 Serbs and others met their fate at that camp,with hundreds of thousands of others sent from Jasenovac to the death camps atAuschwitz and elsewhere. During most of the period of Ustashe rule overJasenovac, the camp was run by a Franciscan priest, Fr. Miroslav Filipovic(1915–1946).Filipovic, like his colleague Draganovic, was interested in the conversion ofSerbian Orthodox Christians to Roman Catholicism…by force. In addition, hesubscribed to Ante Pavelic's dictum that one third of all Serbs should bedeported, one third forcibly converted, and one third killed. He participated inmassacres of the Serbian population—men, women and children—along with his closeassociate, Fr, Zvonimir Brekalo, another priest. He and Brekalo would engage incontests of killing Serbian children with their bare hands72[part0007.html#ft72]…the same hands with which they would consecrate bread andwine into the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. They saw themselves as Crusaders,with all the impious slaughter that term has acquired over the centuries.Filipovic was eventually executed for his crimes, hanged while wearing hisFranciscan habit. But it would be hasty to conclude that this was an isolatedincident of one or two psychotic priests.The Golden PriestWe need not speculate about Draganovic, or the connection between the CatholicChurch and the Ratline, because the details of this arrangement are detailedclearly in a number of declassified American intelligence documents that datefrom 1946 to 1956, and later. Thus, there can be no ambiguity concerning thisunsavory situation.It began with the realization—by the US Army intelligence group known as theCounter Intelligence Corps or CIC—as early as 1946 that there was a network ofCroatian priests assisting the leaders of the Ustashe movement in their escapefrom Europe. The priests were not merely individual clergymen engaged in thisnetwork on their own accord. These were men who were connected directly toarchbishops, cardinals, and the Vatican itself. They drove around Rome inlimousines with CD—corps diplomatique—license plates, and as such wereuntouchable. They had audiences with the Pope. And they were in direct contactwith the government of Argentina and most especially with the newly electedPresident of Argentina, Juan Domingo Perón.But the main operator of the monastery route at this time was Draganovichimself, who seemed to have been placed in that position even before the end ofthe war. The declassified intelligence files contain a lot of backgroundinformation on Draganovic, beginning with his childhood in Croatia and extendingthrough his association with church hierarchy as well as the Ustashe movement.These documents conclude with revelations concerning Draganovic's work forAmerican intelligence and in particular with the CIA. It would be well to beginwith a brief analysis of the information contained in these documents, for theywill help us to understand their relevance to the Pöch material.Krunoslav Draganovic was born and raised in the town of Travnik. He had twobrothers, one of whom became a member of the Croatian Embassy in Berlin duringthe war, the other who was involved with a business enterprise in Zagreb.Draganovic himself was attracted to the priesthood and went to Sarajevo tocomplete his education in theology and philosophy. While there, he came to theattention of Archbishop Ivan Saric who saw great potential in Draganovic,sending him off to Rome courtesy of his Vatican connections.73[part0007.html#ft73]Archbishop Saric (1871-1960) was a zealous Croatian nationalist who consideredSerbs and Jews as vermin worthy only of slaughter. To that end, once theIndependent State of Croatia was formed, he wholeheartedly supported the forcedmass conversions of Serbs to Roman Catholicism and the murder of those whoresisted or refused. It was alleged, though not proven at the time, that Saricwas also involved in the seizure of property from the Sephardic Jews of Sarajevoin collusion with the local police and Ustashe forces. He praised Croatianleader and war criminal Ante Pavelic repeatedly in print and, when the war wasover, fled with Pavelic to Spain. This was Father Draganovic's mentor in theChurch.In 1943, Saric sent Draganovic to Rome with the archives of the IndependentState of Croatia to the Monastery of San Girolamo as the Croatian legationescaped to northern Italy. While there, Draganovic established something calledthe Bratovatina Relief Association: an organization designed to aid in theescape of Ustashe war criminals. He set up an operation that issued identitycards under false names and arranged for travel out of Europe…tickets that werepaid for by the International Relief Organization (I.R.O.), the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross (I.C.R.C.), etc. At the same time, he ran what canonly be called an intelligence network that extended from the POW camps whereUstashe were held prisoner, from sources still active in Yugoslavia, fromsources in Trieste and Rome, and throughout the Croatian communities of Europe,passing the information back to the “Central Direction” of the Ustashe in BuenosAires, Argentina. In a 1952 memo that was only declassified by the CIA inFebruary, 1998, Draganovic is classed as a “dangerous and uncompromisingextremist.”To quote from a memo written by C.I.C. Special Agent Robert Clayton Mudd onFebruary 12, 1947:Many of the more prominent Ustashi war criminals and Quislings are living inROME illegally, many of them under false names. Their cells are stillmaintained, their papers still published, and their intelligence agencies stillin operation. All this activity seems to stem from the Vatican, through theMonastery of San Geronimo [sic] to Fermo, the chief Croat Camp in Italy. Chiefamong the intelligence operatives in the Monastery of San Geronimo [sic] appearsto be Dr. DRAGANOVIC and Monsignor MADJARAC.74 [part0007.html#ft74]As if to emphasize the danger of this operation, Mudd goes on to name dozens ofCroatian Ustashe officials living in the monastery at the time (1947). Theseofficials include the Croatian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Ministerof the Croat State Treasury, the Corporations Minister, the Minister ofEducation, a general of the Ustashe Air Force and the Commander-in-Chief of theAir Force. Virtually the entire Ustashe government made its way to Draganovic'smonastery safe house in Rome while they waited for the false papers and thetickets they would need to leave Europe and head for Argentina. Some, likeArchbishop Saric and Ante Pavelic, would head for Spain first, where they wereguaranteed a measure of safety by the Franco regime as well as the support ofthe Nazi spy network that was left behind after the end of the war, a networkrun by SS officer Carlos Fuldner, among others. But Pavelic is known to haveleft Europe from Genoa aboard the SS Sestriere which arrived in Buenos Aires onNovember 6, 1948, according to a declassified US Army intelligence report datedDecember 2, 1948. The same memo reports that Pavelic traveled under an assumedname and with International Red Cross documents, after having stayed at themonastery run by Draganovic.Mudd's memo goes on to analyze the reasons why the Vatican would support sonoxious a regime as the Ustashe, even after the war:DRAGANOVIC's sponsorship of these Croat Quislings definitely links him up withthe plan of the Vatican to shield these ex-Ustashi nationalists until such timeas they are able to procure for them the proper documents to enable them to goto South America. The Vatican, undoubtedly banking on the strong anti-Communistfeelings of these men, is endeavoring to infiltrate them into South America inany way possible to counteract the spread of Red doctrine. It has been reliablyreported, for example that Dr. VRANCIC has already gone to South America, andthat Ante PAVELIC and General KREN are scheduled for an early departure to SouthAmerica through Spain. All these operations are said to have been negotiated byDRAGANOVIC because of his influence in the Vatican.Draganovic appears in many intelligence memos dating from about 1946 to the1960s. His operation was successful and deep: it had functionaries in Austria,Italy, Spain, Yugoslavia, Germany, and of course in Argentina. In the beginning,he was only interested in helping Ustashe war criminals escape justice, whetherthey were major war criminals with the blood of hundreds or thousands on theirhands, or minor figures who aided and abetted, and collaborated, with theUstashe and the Nazis. In later years, he was approached by Americanintelligence and use was made of his networks by the newly-formed CIA toinfiltrate Communist-bloc espionage networks and to help specific Nazis toescape to South America: Nazis that were of use to intelligence operations orwho had to be protected from arrest and possible public exposure.Eventually, even the CIA had had enough of Draganovic and he was “burned” in spyparlance: he was cut off from the Agency and made persona non grata. There weresuspicions that he was a double agent for the Soviets, and there was irritationat his constant demands for money and privileges. Finally, the CIA calculatedthat Draganovic cost more than he was worth.The “Golden Priest” as he was known then, inexplicably defected to Yugoslaviawhere he lived out the rest of his life. To this day, no one knows for sure whythis fanatic Nazi, anti-Semite and anti-Communist, would willingly go over tothe enemy. There has been speculation that he was kidnapped by agents of theYugoslav regime; others insist that his “conversion” was genuine. The only thingfor sure is that we will never know or understand what motivates men like FatherKrunoslav Draganovic.The number of Catholic clergymen involved in this operation is bewildering. Acomplete list is impossible to obtain, but there are literally hundreds of namesalready available. This was well known to American intelligence at least asearly as 1946, before the major elements of the monastery route were even inplace. These were not merely men who felt a pang of conscience and were willingto help Nazis and Ustashe who might have been wrongfully accused of war crimes;this list also includes men who were directly involved in the atrocitiesthemselves, such as the Franciscan friars running the death camp at Jasenovac,or the priests forcing Serbs to convert to Catholicism or die. It also includesthe men who blessed these operations, and who urged their followers on togreater and greater levels of depravity and hatred, men like Archbishop Saric orArchbishop Hudal.One possible scenario has been put forward as the reason why Pius XII looked theother way when the monastery route was in full operation under his nose, andthat is that he did not want the Ustashe in particular to be arrested and triedin open court for it would reveal the mortal sins committed by his clergy in thename of Jesus Christ. It would erode the Church's credibility in the world andgive the Communists a heavier weapon to use against it. So the atrocities wereswept under the rug, and the torturers and murderers were allowed to go free.In addition, many Nazis—including SS officers—were invited to convert toCatholicism in order that they might be able to make use of the escape networks.This was considered a great accomplishment, having these butchers piously queueup before the baptismal font in order to save their lives. The Church believedit saved souls during that process, and that was more important than what themen had done in their “previous” lives. The Church was merely being merciful.As Archbishop Alois Hudal wrote, in a book published in 1976: “I felt duty boundafter 1945 to devote my whole charitable work mainly to former NationalSocialists and Fascists, especially the so-called “war criminals.”75[part0007.html#ft75]And a protégé of Archbishop Saric—Father Franjo Kralik—wrote the following in1941:Love has its limits. The movement for freeing the world from Jews is a movementfor the renaissance of human dignity. The all wise and Almighty God is behindthis movement.76 [part0007.html#ft76]Love has its limits, but evidently not when it came to rescuing Eichmann, JosefMengele, Ante Pavelic, Franz Stangl, Klaus Barbie and so many others who werethe beneficiaries of the Church's love.77 [part0007.html#ft77]And this network—this notorious underground ecclesiastical system of safe housesand escape routes—was the one used by a mysterious “German doctor” in his flightto Indonesia. The implication is obvious: Dr. Georg Anton Poch and his wife werepeople who would have been arrested and imprisoned by the Allies. They were warcriminals. Father Draganovic arranged their papers and the money necessary forthem to flee Europe.But there is no record of the couple's war record, they were not Ustashe, theirnames appear on no list, and they sought the most remote area of the world fromEurope they could find. Even Argentina was not safe, even though Mengele,Eichmann, Barbie, Stangl, and Rauff all made it to Argentina in the first yearsafter the war. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that this couple was ingreater danger than even the “architect of the Final Solution”, the “Angel ofDeath of Auschwitz,” and the “Butcher of Lyons.”So who were they? And how was their escape across multiple continents and timezones financed?And why did the address of the German Archaeological Institute appear in thePöch diary?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------65 [part0007.html#fn65] Gitta Sereny, Into that Darkness: From Mercy Killing toMass Murder, London: Pimlico, 1995, p. 28966 [part0007.html#fn66] Gerald Steinacher, Nazis on the Run: How Hitler'sHenchmen Fled Justice, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011, p. 25167 [part0007.html#fn67] Alois Hudal, Die Grundlagen des Nationsozialismus (“TheFoundation of National Socialism”), Leipzig: Günther, 1936.

Thisgold was moved to banks in Switzerland, Sweden, Portugal, or Argentina. Japanused the same techniques, moving gold through Swiss banks in Tokyo, Portuguesebanks in Macao, and banks in Chile and Argentina. When gold was physically movedto those countries it was carried by large cargo submarines.78[part0008.html#ft78]One of the least reported of all the individuals who were with Hitler in theBunker on April 30, 1945 was Walther Hewel (1904–1945?). Although historyremembers Bormann, Goebbels, Eva Braun, General Krebs, and even Linge andGunsche, Hewel is rarely mentioned except occasionally and in passing .79[part0008.html#ft79] It is an odd omission, particularly since Hewel seemed tohave been one of Hitler's closest friends and associates from the earliest daysof the Nazi Party. In fact, Hewel's own membership number in the NSDAP was evenearlier than Hitler's.Hewel was only eighteen at the time of the Beer Hall Putsch: Hitler's failedattempt to take control of the state in Munich in 1923. Hewel marched withHeinrich Himmler under the swastika banner, and was later arrested with Hitlerfor treason and served time in Landsberg Prison, the same prison where Hitlerwould write Mein Kampf. Hewel was an intimate of Himmler, Rudolf Hess, and allthe old comrades around the Fuhrer since the beginning of the Nazi experiment.And he was present in the Bunker in the last days, as well.Yet, few historians speak about him.The reason for this strange omission is unknown, but it does lead us into someinteresting territory for after his release from Landsberg Prison Walter Hewelwent on to establish Asia's only real Nazi Party organization…in Indonesia.Hewel was born on January 2, 1904 in Cologne. His father was the owner of afactory that made cocoa, but he died when Hewel was only nine years old. Hismother was the Baroness von Lindenfels. At the age of eighteen, Walther enteredthe Technical University of Munich to study mechanical and industrialengineering, but it was a short-lived education due to his participation in theBeer Hall Putsch.By 1925, however, Hewel—released from Landsberg where he functioned as a kind ofvalet for Hitler—began working for a Hamburg firm involved in import-export anda year later wound up in England where he eventually got a job with a companycalled Anglo Dutch Plantations of Java Ltd.Beginning with his sojourn in England, Hewel—a committed Nazi and truebeliever—was active in promoting Nazi ideals. Encouraged by Rudolf Hess to formalliances with British fascists, he then went on to create an active Nazi Partyin Indonesia starting in March of 1927 and remained in Java until called back byHitler at the end of 1935 to serve as an ambassador to Spain and then as aspecial advisor to Nazi Foreign Minister Ribbentrop (who was hanged atNuremberg). The positions in Spain and in Indonesia are suggestive, since theywould form an important—but largely unrecognized—leg of the Ratline.While in Indonesia, Hewel formed Nazi Party units throughout Java: in Jakarta(then known as Batavia), Bandung, Medan, Padang 80 [part0008.html#ft80],Semarang, Makassar…and Surabaya. In fact, Hewel was known to the Bunkerinhabitants as “Surabaya Wally.”81 [part0008.html#ft81] That there was a NaziParty in Surabaya is interesting, because it leads us eventually to the deepermystery of Hitler's possible escape.Hewel would remain in Dutch-controlled Indonesia for nine years, during whichtime he saw the Nazi Party in that country grow and expand, largely among theex-patriate German and Dutch communities in those cities. It may come as asurprise that the Netherlands provided the largest number of volunteers for theWaffen-SS out of all other countries in Europe. Even Prince Bernhard—the fatherof Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands—was briefly a member of the Nazi Party inthe 1930s as well as of the SA. (the “Brown Shirts” paramilitary wing of theParty) while at university, although he later fought against the Nazi invasionof his country during the war. In Indonesia, the Dutch Vaderlandsche(Fatherland) Club of Medan helped to financially support the Nazi Party thereusing money raised from plantation sources, and its membership was eventuallysubsumed into the Dutch Nazi Party. 82 [part0008.html#ft82] This would have beenexactly the type of activity for which Walther Hewel was responsible.There was a small Nazi Party in the Netherlands itself for years before theinvasion, and it held only a few seats in the Dutch parliament. After theinvasion, there was a power struggle between the Germans (who wanted to annexthe country) and the Dutch Nazis who wanted autonomy. The Dutch lost their bid,and the Netherlands became an outpost of the Third Reich, with the murderousSeyss-Inquart as its Governor-General. While student demonstrations against theinvasion and against the Nazis were famous—and brutally suppressed—many in theDutch intelligentsia were sympathetic to Hitler and to the ideals of the Naziregime (as was Prince Bernhard, briefly). Therefore it would not be surprisingto learn that elements of the Dutch expatriate community in Indonesia would haveflirted with the idea of joining the Nazi Party there.Once Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, he began to take steps to form hisown government, and to do that he surrounded himself with people who did notnecessarily have the requisite experience in political matters but who werereliable from an ideological point of view. One of these was Joachim vonRibbentrop, a man roundly despised by most who knew him but who was trustedcompletely by Hitler since Ribbentrop studied the Fuhrer obsessively and knewwhat buttons to push, and when. Ribbentrop held various posts under Hitler, allconcerning foreign affairs. He created various institutions, some of which weredesigned ostensibly to improve Anglo-German and French-German relations, butwhich were used by Hitler to manipulate foreign affairs in a somewhat morecynical manner.One of the men called upon by Hitler to work with Ribbentrop in these endeavorswas Walther Hewel. Hewel had, by that time, spent nearly a decade in Indonesia,was also familiar with China and Japan as well as the United States, and wasrecalled personally by Hitler to work in Spain and, later, to assist in theAnglo-German projects (since Hewel had a good command of English and had spenttime in England, unlike Ribbentrop). We have very little information as to whatHewel was doing in his position with Ribbentrop, and he is usually dismissed asa kind of clownish personality—a characterization that is at odds with hisbackground, his education and experience, and his devotion to the Nazi ideal. Asone of the last men to leave the Bunker, he is believed to have committedsuicide a few days after Hitler by simultaneously biting down on a cyanidecapsule and shooting himself in the head (the same improbable fiction promotedas Hitler's means of death).One historian83 [part0008.html#ft83] believes that Hewel worked for the Abwehr(Germany's military intelligence operation, under the command of Admiral Canarisuntil 1944) while in Spain, and this connection with Spain is tantalizing.Canaris, like Dönitz, had been a U-Boat commander during the first World War. Hespoke fluent Spanish and was instrumental in developing a close workingrelationship between Franco and Hitler. His admiration for Hitler soured earlyon, however, and he began to conspire against the Fuhrer and was eventuallyarrested for treason and hanged by the Nazis in the last days of the war.This meant that the Abwehr would come under new management in the form of WalterSchellenberg when the Abwehr was merged with the SD in 1944. Canaris's networkof agents in Spain (those considered above reproach and not tainted by theirrelationship with the presumed traitor) would have taken orders then fromSchellenberg's group. This meant that Germany's military intelligence operationwas removed from military control and placed under Schellenberg, and thus underHimmler and the SS, thereby effectively becoming an arm of an ideological entityrather than the Wehrmacht. This is important, for it means that the work of theagent network in Spain could be diverted to matters that were non-military innature: such as creating escape routes for the SS or finding ways to transportgold and other valuables out of Europe. We have already seen that theEtappendienst was established by Admiral Donitz to supply the U-Boats out ofSpanish ports, and that money-men such as Carlos Fuldner were active in Spain inthe last days of the war with only one purpose in mind: to create an escapechannel for men and money out of Europe and to safe havens around the world.What is perhaps not so well known is the fact that Nazi U-boats were seen notonly in Europe and along the coasts of North and South America both during andafter the war, but also as far away as Indonesia.The Nazis and the Japanese had formed a political alliance against their commonenemy, the United States. However, that alliance was formed only after muchresistance by the German military and members of the foreign policyestablishment who saw China as their natural ally in Asia in a relationship thatdated back to the First World War. It was only after tremendous effort by menlike Ribbentrop—and Hitler's inspiration for ideas like lebensraum, thegeo-politician Karl Ernst Haushofer (1869–1946)—that a more aggressive approachto Nazi-Japanese relations bore fruit.While Japan extended its authority over most of East Asia from Korea and Chinato the Philippines, Singapore, Malaya, Indochina and Indonesia, it had virtuallyno direct contact with the armed forces of Germany. It did, however, controlimportant natural resources in those territories—like rubber, tin and othercommodities—that were essential to the war effort in Europe. Rubber, inparticular, was necessary for the production of tires and other components oftanks, trucks, jeeps and aircraft parts, and rubber was abundant in Malaya andIndonesia, areas under Japanese control.Thus, a system was established whereby the Germans would transport jet enginetechnology, machine tools and raw materials the Japanese did not have—such asuranium84 [part0008.html#ft84]—in exchange for rubber, tin, tungsten, andwhatever else was needed by the German war machine. The method of transport wasthe U-boat. The port of call was Penang on the western coast of Malaya, with thefirst such shipment arriving on July 15, 1943 via German U-boat U-511. Thesubmarine was actually a gift to the Japanese Navy by Adolf Hitler himself, inreturn for a Japanese submarine shipment of desperately-needed war materiel onJapanese sub I-30. Thus we have the rather bizarre image of Nazi U-boats bearingthe swastika on their conning towers sailing into Asian ports halfway around theworld from Germany.The Asian U-boat bases represented the only occasion in the entire war when theGermans and the Japanese actively cooperated militarily. German U-boats wouldrefuel in the Indian Ocean on their way to and from Malaya, out of range ofBritish bombers, in an operation that was conducted quickly and efficiently. Thesubmarines themselves had been outfitted more as cargo ships than as engines ofdestruction, and towards the end of the war they were carrying V-2 rocketcomponents to the Japanese. There has been much speculation that the Japanesewere working on their own version of the atomic bomb at the time and, had theymanaged to build the V-2 rocket using German blueprints and parts, they wouldhave had not only the bomb but also an effective delivery system.As the British grew in strength in Asia in 1944, and using India as a base, theybegan to bomb Penang in order to disrupt the U-boat traffic from Europe and alsoto deny the Japanese that important port that controlled the sea lanes in theMelaka Straits. At that time the decision was made to move the base toIndonesia, to Batavia (now Jakarta), as well as Surabaya, and the shipmentscarried on as before.Aside from the Nazi U-boat presence, in 1943 a Gestapo team arrived in Indonesiato coordinate their activities with the Japanese and against whatever Dutchresistance there was in the archipelago. The Netherlands had been invaded in1940, and the Dutch in Indonesia were cut off and without any support orresources from their homeland. The Japanese had promised Indonesians theirindependence from Holland if they would support Japan in its project of wipingout Dutch resistance, and future Indonesian leaders like Sukarno werecooperating with the Japanese for that oldest of reasons: “The enemy of my enemyis my friend.”The Gestapo then began rounding up whatever Jews they could find, for arrest andimprisonment. This is an important part of the historical record, for it showsthat the zeal with which the Nazis persecuted the Jews was not confined to aEuropean or even a Western context but extended to the Jews wherever in theworld they could be found. They were hardly a threat to the Third Reich inJapanese occupied Indonesia, but nevertheless the Gestapo felt it necessary toconduct their own Holocaust in that tropical, Asian country thousands of milesfrom the concentration camps of Poland. The Japanese themselves did notunderstand this attitude towards the Jews—saying that they were at war withcountries and not with races85 [part0008.html#ft85]—but tried to cooperate thebest way they could, essentially humoring their German colleagues. Jewish menwere separated from Jewish women and put into separate camps for the duration ofthe war. This occurred most notably in Surabaya, which had a large Jewishpopulation86 [part0008.html#ft86] as well as a Nazi Party branch.Thus, we have a documented Nazi presence in Indonesia going back to the 1920s(long before Hitler came to power in Germany) and which does not disappear untilthe end of the war in the Pacific, for the Nazi U-boats that were stranded inIndonesia after the German surrender were commandeered by the Japanese for theirown use. That meant that U-boat crews were also stranded in Indonesia and manyfound themselves unable—or unwilling—to return to Germany.Many U-boat crewmen discovered Indonesia to be a relatively congenial berthafter the rigors of submarine warfare on the losing side. Although they weretaken prisoner by the Allies once Japan surrendered, some managed to escape andothers were charged with guarding the Dutch against the Indonesian rebels. Somebecame active in the Indonesian revolt against the Dutch, who returned toIndonesia in force after the Japanese surrender. Several died in Indonesia andare buried in what has to be one of the strangest cemeteries in the world, EightHundred Statues.Known as Arca Domas, which translated from the Sanskrit means “eight hundredstatues”, this cemetery is located south of Jakarta in the region of Bogor, nearthe village of Cikopo. It had been part of a tea plantation owned by two Germanbrothers, Emil and Theodor Helfferich…and therein lies a tale.Emil Helfferich (1878–1972) was a Nazi Party member and an intimate ofhigh-ranking Nazi officials, including Heinrich Himmler. Emil had spent decadesin Java as a pepper trader in the first years of the twentieth century, from1899 to 1928. He returned to Germany at the age of 51 to take up importantpositions in the Weimar Republic, including becoming chairman of theHamburg-Amerika shipping company (which became HAPAG and then HAPAG-Lloyd) aswell as chairman of Esso Oil (of which 94% at that time was owned by StandardOil of New Jersey). In November of 1932, he was one of the co-sponsors of theIndustrialists Petition to President Paul von Hindenburg insisting that AdolfHitler be made Chancellor of Germany. Much against Hindenburg's wishes, Hitlerwas made Chancellor in January of 1933, only two months later, with theall-important backing of German bankers and industrialists like Helfferich.He was one of the members of the Freundeskreis Himmler (or “the FriendshipCircle of Himmler”) along with Oswald Pohl (the SS general in charge of theconcentration camps and also of Himmler's mystical castle, Wewelsburg; hanged atNuremberg), Hjalmar Shacht, Ernst Schafer (of the SS-Ahnenerbe and the leader ofthe SS-Tibet Expedition), Otto Ohlendorf (mass murderer of Jews in the Ukraine,who was hanged at Nuremberg), Wolfram Sievers (chief of the SS-Ahnenerbe who washanged at Nuremberg), and many others.87 [part0008.html#ft87] As one can see, itwas an organization composed of wealthy industrialists as well as high-rankingSS officers…and men later accused of some of the worst crimes of the war.Hjalmar Schacht (1877–1970) for instance, was the main organizer of theIndustrialists Petition to Hindenburg to name Hitler as Chancellor. He was alsoPresident of the Reichsbank and chief economist for the Third Reich. He grewdisillusioned with Hitler in the late 1930s, and repudiated anti-Semitism, TheFuhrer eventually dismissed him in 1943 and, after he was believed to have beeninvolved in the assassination plot against Hitler in July, 1944, he wasimprisoned at Flossenberg Concentration Camp and then at Dachau. Eventuallyde-nazified by the Nuremberg tribunal, he went on to form his own bank andbecame an economic advisor to…the Government of Indonesia.For his own part, Helfferich managed to convince the Allies that he was not awar criminal, even though he was one of those who helped put Hitler in power andwho maintained a long relationship with Himmler. His brother, Theodor(1872–1924), was Vice Chancellor of Germany and Secretary of the Interior duringWorld War I, and was responsible for the development and construction of thefirst German submarines. He was killed in a train wreck in Switzerland in 1924at the age of 52.Thus, the two Helfferich brothers were important figures in German politics,industry and finance with Emil Helfferich, an intimate of Himmler, Schacht, andHitler as well as a chairman of Esso Oil and the Hamburg-Amerika shippingcompany. These were the brothers that owned the tea plantation at Bogor that wasturned into a cemetery for the Nazi U-boat crew. It was Emil Helfferich whobuilt the monument at the cemetery to the famed Admiral Graf von Spee, who diedin the Battle of the Falkland Islands on December 8, 1914 and who dedicated thecemetery:DEM TAPFEREN DEUTSCH-OSTASIATISCHEN GESCH-WADER 1914(“To the Brave German East-Asian Squadron 1914”)And:ERICHTED VON EMIL UND THEODOR HELFFERICH 1926(“Erected by Emil and Theodor Helferrich 1926”)The German East-Asian Squadron was the armada commanded by Admiral Graf von Speein a battle with the British Navy, in which he lost his life and those ofthousands of his fellow sailors. Although the monument says Emil and his brotherTheodor erected it, Theodor was already dead by this time. The monument isdesigned in a Javanese style, and boasts a statue of Ganesha on one side and ofBuddha on the other.During World War II, the tea plantation—then under the ownership of one AlbertVehring—became a logistics support area for the U-boats, supplying food andother materials for the more than forty German submarines that were operating inthe area. Once Germany surrendered, some of the crew members—notably under thecommand of U-219 commander Walter Burghagen—fled to the plantation and becamecivilians…at least until they were captured by the British and then placed inprison camps run by the Dutch. Some escaped, and others died of disease or fromattacks by Indonesian guerrillas who mistook the Germans for their Dutchopponents.Later, the monument and its surrounding grounds became the DeutscherSoldatenfriedhof or German Soldiers Cemetery. Ten U-boat crew members are buriedthere, with headstones in the shape of Iron Crosses. To this day, the Germangovernment quietly finances the maintenance of the cemetery is and occasionally,surviving crew members make the pilgrimmage to Arca Domas to visit the graves oftheir old comrades. In fact, one of these “old comrades”—Hans-Joachim Krug,first officer of U-219 under Walter Burghagen—was the technical advisor to thefilm Das Boot (1981).The reason for taking so much time with these seemingly disparate personalitiesand events is to demonstrate the extent to which Indonesia and Nazi Germany werelinked…at the highest political and military levels. While much attention hasbeen paid to the role South America and the Middle East played in the escape ofNazi war criminals known as the Ratline, this aspect of the project—the Asiantheater—has been largely, if not completely, ignored. But we have clear andunequivocal evidence that (a) the passage to Southeast Asia by U-boat was notonly possible, but an integral part of the Nazi effort to source important warmateriel, (b) that those closest to Hitler's inner circle—men like WaltherHewel, Hjalmar Schacht and Emil Helfferich—had close connections to Indonesia,in some cases lasting for a decade or more, and (c) since so many war criminalsdid manage to escape, it stands to reason that some would have made it as far asthe former Dutch colony whose raw materials were so vital to continuing the war,and where European and Asian armed forces met both in combat and cooperation.With the end of Dutch hegemony in the region, it would be seen that Indonesianrevolutionaries like future president Sukarno had demonstrable pro-Nazisympathies. But was Indonesia an environment conducive to the type ofanti-Semitism so typical of the devoted Nazi? Had there ever been any Jews inIndonesia? Was Indonesia a fertile ground for anti-Jewish conspiracy theories,such as the Jewish-Masonic global conspiracy to rule the world made famous bythe Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the legendary turn-of-the-century hoax thatso influenced Hitler and the Nazis?Would Indonesia have offered a congenial sanctuary for a rabid Nazi warcriminal?To understand how Indonesia might have become a haven for a Nazi war criminal,it is helpful to see how another country (far removed from the conflict of WorldWar II) became identified as a “safe house” for evil men. One of the reasonsArgentina became so famous as a sanctuary for Nazis after the war was theattitude of the Argentine government towards immigration. Argentina had longconsidered itself more European than Latin American, and looked across theAtlantic for its cultural roots. A visit to Buenos Aires in the 1990s, forinstance, made one think of Paris or Vienna in the 1930s. Surnames were oftenItalian, French or German, and it is a fact of history that future presidentJuan Domingo Peron had trained with Italian fascists during the Mussolini eraand had developed a fondness for fascist ideology. Peron was a populist leader,in many ways like both Mussolini and Hitler, who had an obsession for militarydress and the machismo of the career soldier. The Perónist regime also railedagainst foreign influences, particularly from North America, and saw itself as abulwark against Communism. In the native Catholicism of Argentina there was apolitical rapport with the Vatican as well: and the dream of some Argentines wasto create a kind of fascist-Catholic nation, purged of “other elements” and asafe haven for anti-Communist fighters and sympathizers. There was a stronganti-Semitic movement in Argentina which came into its own once Peron waselected; prior to that time there had been Jewish migration to Argentina fromEurope, but by the mid-1940s this had slowed to a trickle as Nazis and former SSofficers found themselves in control of the Immigration Department and theimmigration policies of Argentina, with Peron's blessing and support.A further comparison could be had with Croatia which also combined ardentCatholicism with a hatred of Communism and Jews. As Croatia fell to theCommunists under Tito, Argentina became the de facto leader of the Catholicanti-Communist alliance…aided and abetted by a large contingent of CroatianUstashe refugees.We have some parallels, then, with Indonesia during the same period. WhileIndonesians as a rule never identified with Europe the way Argentina did, theyhad a similar political position vis-à-vis capitalism and the superpowers,especially the United States. There was also a nascent fascist movement inIndonesia that sought to recover the ancient glory of the Majapahit empire.88[part0008.html#ft88] The Japanese, however, enraged them with their insistencethat Muslims face Tokyo when they prayed instead of Mecca,89[part0008.html#ft89] thereby alienating the religious leaders whose support wasnecessary in order to bring the population in line with Japanese military andeconomic goals.As World War II came to an end in the Pacific with the surrender of the Japanesein August of 1945, the Dutch attempted to retake their colony in the EastIndies. The Japanese had quickly given the Indonesians their independence ontheir way out of Indonesia, but the Dutch did not accept this development. Arevolutionary struggle began between the Indonesians and their former Dutchcolonizers that went on for nearly five years (with the Dutch constantlybreaking treaties and truces and ignoring international agreements to which theyhad been signatories) before Indonesia formally won its independence.One of the leaders of the revolt against the Dutch became the first president ofIndonesia, Sukarno (1901-1970). As with many revolutionary leaders of thetwentieth century, Sukarno was basically a populist. He strove to unite the manydisparate peoples living on the thousands of islands in the archipelago into asingle nation with a single language, flag, and central government.Sukarno, however, also had a pragmatic approach to politics. While he had beenactively pro-Japanese (and moderately pro-Nazi) during the war, as hisadministration progressed he was seen to identify more and more withCommunism—particularly Chinese Communism but also accepting military and otheraid from the Soviet Union—a position that made the West nervous especially asthe French were being defeated by Communist forces in Indochina, and India,Malaya and Singapore had won their independence from Great Britain. By 1948China had become a Communist nation under Mao, and the Korean War had started in1950, which would split that country into a Communist North and a capitalistSouth. The colonial powers were losing their territories in Asia, and it seemedas if it was only a matter of time before the entire continent—with the possibleexception of Japan— became Communist.But Indonesia is a predominantly Muslim nation. While the Chinese presence inthat country was blamed, often unfairly, for being pro-Communist andcontributing to the development of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), andwhile Sukarno was blamed for conspiring with the Communists during the famous“Year of Living Dangerously” in 1965, the idea that Indonesian Muslims wouldembrace completely the atheistic ideology of Communism was unrealistic. Sukarnowanted Indonesia to become a secular state, however, and was more afraid of thecolonial powers returning to invade and subjugate Indonesia than he was of anyimplications of atheism. To Sukarno—as well as to many populist leaders of thepost-World War II era—Communist revolution meant resistance to what theyperceived to be the excesses and basic unfairness of capitalism, especially ascapitalism had been visited upon the developing nations as a form of repressionand enslavement and not as a means of development.This position was not too far removed from that of the Nazi Party, which alsosaw capitalism in negative terms, associating it with Jewish bankers and theirperceived attempt to control the world through economic imperialism. The leftwing of the Nazi Party was decidedly more socialist than nationalist, but in theend the Nazis saw Communism as another ploy by the “Jewish-Masonic conspiracy”to control the world (reiterating the fact that Karl Marx himself was Jewish),and the left wing of the Party was effectively silenced through brutal purges bythe time the war started.A revolutionary in Southeast Asia could see the Nazis in a some what moresympathetic light than would a European. For leaders like Sukarno, the Nazis(and the Japanese) represented the enemy of the superpowers: Russia, GreatBritain, and the United States as well as their old colonizers, the Dutch. Whilethe Aryanism of the Nazis would never gain ground in a country like Indonesiawith so many different cultures and indigenous languages and religions (arguablynone of which would have been identified as “Aryan” by the Nazi ideologues), theanti-Semitism of the Nazis played on the paranoia of a people just coming intotheir own after centuries of European dominance.90 [part0008.html#ft90]Thus, the situation in Indonesia in the 1940s and 1950s must be seen in thelight of the local political environment rather than as an extension of theEuropean and Western conflicts of the same time period. Communism was seen as amovement that repudiated all the existing power structures of state, church,banks, and culture. It reflected a desperate desire to break free of the rule ofan elite class “by any means necessary” and to re-establish indigenous rule andcustom in all areas of life. As Sukarno matured in office, he would condemn hisown support of the Japanese invaders, particularly in the use they made ofIndonesian slave labor and the rape of the raw materials of that country to fuelthe Japanese war effort. But during the war he was flown to Tokyo where he wasfeted as the country's natural leader, and where he made his famous statement:Amerika kita setrika, Inggris kita linggis (“Let's iron91 [part0008.html#ft91]America, let's bludgeon the British”) as a call to arms for his compatriots tosupport Japan and work in its service.He had always flirted with Communism, even before the war broke out, but heanticipated and welcomed the Japanese entry into the war as a means ofdislodging the European powers from Southeast Asia. While the Cold War seemed tomany Westerners a black-and-white situation with good guys in America andWestern Europe and bad guys in Russia, China and the “East”, to the developingnations the choices were not so simple. They were forced to resist the influenceof the Western powers as a source of exploitation and repression in the coloniesthat now declared their independence, and so they turned to the dubious embraceof the revolutionary governments of China, Cuba and the Soviet Union.In the 1950s, Sukarno was struggling to keep his country in one piece whilefending off attempts by fundamentalist Islamic parties as well as the armyitself to fracture the delicate balance of powers. In 1953, there were rebelgroups and anti-government forces forming in West Java and in Aceh, such asDarul Islam which agitated for an Islamic state. The first free elections wouldbe not be held until 2 years later.It was into this chaotic political environment that a mysterious European manand his wife landed at Jakarta, on January 6, 1954.They had been on the run since April 30, 1945.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------78 [part0008.html#fn78] Sterling and Peggy Seagrave, Gold Warriors: America'sSecret Recovery of Yamashita's Gold, New York: Verso, 2005, p.52.

There is some controversyover whether this uranium would have been used to create a bomb, or would havebeen used in the development of aviation fuel. In 1946 claims were made (by aformer US Army investigator) that a primitive atomic device was exploded byJapanese scientists at or near the Korean city of Konan in August 1945, butthese claims have been dismissed by historians. Had the US believed that Japanwas imminently capable of producing an atomic bomb, however, this might havegone some way towards justifying President Truman's authorization of the attackson Hiroshima and Nagasaki, particularly in light of the V2 rocket technology andparts shipped to Japan in the last days of the war.85 [part0008.html#fn85] Jeffrey Hadler, “Translations of Antisemitism,” p. 30386 [part0008.html#fn86] As an interesting aside, Xaviera Hollander—the author ofthe best-selling The Happy Hooker— was born in 1943 in Surabaya to German andJewish parents.

A copy of the man's immigration document shows his name to be Pöch, aGerman citizen with passport number 2624/51 issued in Rome on September 28, 1951and valid until September 27, 1956. His place of birth was listed as Przemysl,and his year of birth was 1895. His parents were Josef and Emma Pöch, bothdeceased. 93 [part0009.html#ft93]His Indonesian citizenship paper—issued on December 20, 1967—gives his full nameas “Dr. Med. Georg Anton Pöch” with a birthday of November 1, 1895, in Przemysl,Austria.94 [part0009.html#ft94]The author of a book on Pöch entitled Hitler Mati di Indonesia (or “Hitler Diedin Indonesia”) claims that the mention of Przemysl as being in Austria is anindication that Pöch was lying about his identity since that city is inPoland.95 [part0009.html#ft95] Actually, in the year 1895 (when Pöch states hewas born) Przemysl was indeed part of Austria and remained so until after theFirst World War when the Austro-Hungarian Empire was dissolved.96[part0009.html#ft96] However, it would seem that Pöch could not have claimedGerman citizenship in any case; that was definitely a deception, unless he hadbeen a member of the SS or of the Nazi Party, in which case, under the rules ofthe Third Reich, his German citizenship would have been automatic…and he wouldhave been subject to arrest, interrogation, and possible prosecution.Further, based on the evidence of one Dr. Sosro Husodo, Pöch did not havemedical training at all, yet he is listed as a Doctor of Medicine in hiscitizenship document. In fact, by the time Dr. Sosro met him in 1960 on theremote island of Sumbawa, Pöch was running the largest hospital on the island.Famous as “the German doctor”, he was considered strange: a no-nonsense person,who seemed to have military background or training, he was energetic,domineering, and impatient. Dressed always in the white coat of his profession,he had no qualms about making house calls or even, at times, dispensing medicinefor free for those in need.97 [part0009.html#ft97]Yet, he was close to no one and stayed away from general social visits. While hewould attend formal functions connected to the hospital, he avoided closecontact with the Indonesians themselves.It is this same Georg Anton Pöch—the “German doctor”—who, many claim, was inreality Adolf Hitler.The research for this story was exhausting and often unrewarding. That is notbecause the information on Pöch in Indonesia was thin, but because there isalmost no record of the real Pöch's activities in Europe during the War andnothing for the period immediately after. As the author began to trace the nameand the background of this mysterious individual he came up against brick wallsof silence. If Pöch was truly Pöch and not—as Sosro and others have claimed—Hitler, then Pöch was still someone who should have been arrested and brought totrial for war crimes.For the original Georg Anton Pöch was a Nazi medical officer who asked to workon Jewish prisoners in the concentration camps of the Netherlands.The CampsThe Jews are not Dutch for us. They are an enemy with whom we cannot agree uponcease-fire or peace…We will hit the Jews wherever we find them, and those whoside with them shall have to bear the consequences.—Reichskommissar Arthur Seyss-Inquart, March 12, 194198 [part0009.html#ft98]Holland was host to four specific camps: Amersfoort, Vught, Westerbork andOmmen. Amersfoort began as a transit camp but evolved into a work and prisoncamp. Vught—although generally known as Kamp Vught—was officially calledHerzogenbusch Camp and was also generally a transit camp for those Belgian andDutch prisoners on their way to the death camps such as Ravensbrück. Westerborkwas another—perhaps the most famous—of the transit camps. Originally built byDutch Jews to house German Jews fleeing from the Nazis, after the invasion itwas commandeered by the Nazis as a transit camp for Dutch Jews and Gypsies(Roma) who were being sent to Auschwitz, Sobibor, and Treblinka (among otherdestinations). In all, more than 100,000 Dutch Jews, 5,000 German Jews and morethan 400 Roma passed through Westerbork on their way to the Polish concentrationcamps. Anne Frank was one of the Dutch Jews held prisoner at Westerbork beforeshe was sent to Auschwitz on September 3, 1944 on one of the last trains toleave the camp.Ommen, the last of the four Dutch camps, had an unusual pedigree. Before thewar, it had served as a cult center for the group around Krishnamurti: the guru“discovered” by Bishop Leadbeater of the Theosophical Society. Their lastmeeting was held at Ommen in September of 1939, only months before the Germanoccupation. Once the Nazis invaded the following year, it was decided to use theexisting facilities at Ommen as a detention center for Dutch Jews and other“undesirables.”One of the Dutch SS guards—Herbertus Bikker , known as “the Butcher ofOmmen”—was sentenced to death by a Dutch court, but the sentence was commuted tolife in prison. On December 26, 1952 Bikker and several of his SS comrades(including the infamous Klaas Carel Faber, one of the most wanted Nazi warcriminals and another member of the Dutch SS as well as of a Sonderkommando unitcharged with the assassination of prominent Dutch citizens who opposed the Naziregime; his brother Peiter Johan Faber was executed for war crimes in 1948)escaped prison in the Netherlands and went over the border to Germany. AlthoughBikker and Faber were Dutch according to the Fuhrer Edict of May, 1943 anyonewho was a member of the Nazi Party or of the SS was automatically considered aGerman citizen, and thus both Bikker and Faber escaped extradition since theircrimes were committed in the Netherlands and not in Germany. Using thisloophole, Bikker managed to live peacefully in Germany for the next 50 yearsuntil he—like Erich Priebke, among others—boasted to a reporter of his exploitsin the camps and particularly of his execution in cold blood of a Dutchresistance fighter. At that point, it was impossible not to arrest Bikker and hewent to trial—in Germany—in 2004. However, due to Bikker's alleged ill health,the trial did not proceed. Bikker died peacefully at home four years later, in2008. Faber's case is still pending, but it is believed that he, too, will dieof old age before there is any criminal proceeding against him.It is important to note that many of the guards and Waffen-SS assigned to thecamps were Dutch nationals: persons (men and women) who were supporters of theNazi regime and its racist ideology. It is an episode in the history of theNetherlands that many Dutch citizens are confronting only now. Until a few yearsago, the iconic image of non-Jews protecting Jews from the Nazis—such as in thecase of Anne Frank—was the operative narrative. In fact, many non-Jewish Dutchcitizens did speak out against the Nazis and did assist in hiding Jewishfamilies from the occupiers. Yet, the Netherlands had the highest proportion ofany European country of its Jewish population deported to the death camps duringthe war, and the highest proportion of its citizens who became members of theWaffen-SS and other Nazi organizations.The AnthropologistsFebruary 28, 1944Dear Party Comrade Bormann,We have cleaned up the Jewish question in the Netherlands, insofar as now weonly have to carry out decisions that have already been formulated. The Jewshave been eliminated from the body of the Dutch people and, insofar as they havenot been transported to the East for labor, they are enclosed in a camp.Reichskommissar Arthur Seyss-InquartOn September 29, 1943 the last Jews were found and brought to the Dutch camps.After that date there were no Jews left in the Netherlands except for thosealready in prison or in hiding. There were constant raids on homes andbusinesses by the SS until 1944, as the last remaining vestiges of Dutch Jewrywere identified and shipped to Auschwitz.However, until that date there was much work to be done. Measurements to betaken. Blood and other biologicals obtained. Photographs processed. Datacollected. The prison camps and transit camps were gold mines of anthropologicalmaterial. For anyone conducting a study of the differences between Ashkenazicand Sephardic Jews, places like Westerbork and Ommen were ideal. The addedbenefit of a captive population of Roma would only make the prospect of studyingthe prisoners even more attractive.Along with the predominantly Ashkenazic Jews of the Netherlands there was asizeable population of Portuguese, or Sephardic, Jews in Amsterdam. With both ofthese “racial types” so easily available, it was an opportunity that Georg Antonand Hella Pöch could not pass up. As friends of the Reichskommissar for theNetherlands—fellow Austrian Arthur Seyss-Inquart—they had unfettered access tothe Jewish prisoners.Hella Pöch was easily the more famous—and more experienced— of the two. She hadbeen married to the father of modern Viennese anthropology, Rudolf Pöch(1870—1921), who made use of prisoners of war for his anthropometric researchduring World War One. Rudolf Pöch was also one of the first anthropologists tomake use of the modern inventions of the motion picture camera and audiorecording equipment in the field. Some of his films and recordings—especially ofthe Bushmen of Southern Africa—have survived to this day. He also visitedIndonesia and Australia, from 1904—1906. But there is much more to this storythan this simple recitation of facts would suggest.The Pöch AllianceIn May of 2008 there was a flurry of controversy during a workshop in Viennaconcerning the legacy of Rudolf Pöch. Organized by Maria Teschler-Nicola,Director of Anthropology at the Natural History Museum in Vienna, the workshopwas acutely nomenclatured “Archival Horizons: Landscapes of knowledge andborders of perspective within the multimedia estate of anthropologist andexplorer Rudolf Pöch.” It was intended to be a celebration of Pöch'scontribution to the field of anthropology, but it quickly turned into acondemnation of his bizarre practices in the field; practices that includedgrave-robbing and the mutilation of corpses. In what would become an eerieprecedent for Nazi Rassenkunde (“race science”), Pöch had begun a collection ofhuman bodies and skeletal material for exhibits in Europe, exhibits that wouldreflect the growing preoccupation of German and Austrian anthropologists withthe idea of racial “purity.”The authors of a book on the rapacious practices of European anthropologists inAfrica were invited to participate in the workshop. Ciraj Rassool and MartinLegassick had written Skeletons in the Cupboard: South African museums and thetrade in human remains, 1907—191799 [part0009.html#ft99]. It is a soberingaccount of the way in which anthropologists literally stole corpses from theirgraves, in some cases fresh graves, in order to expand or deepen museumcollections in South Africa and abroad. These were bodies of indigenousAfricans—notably the Khoisan of Southern Africa, composed of the Khoe and Santribes, the latter often referred to as “Bushmen”—and in Pöch's case inparticular, they were collected illegally and transported in barrels or drums,in some cases after their heads had been severed from their bodies and theirlimbs mutilated in other ways to make it easier to fit in the barrels (packed insalt) and ship them out of the country and back to Austria.This was not the end of the story, however, for these corpses were thensubjected to further indignities. In some cases, plaster casts were made of thebodies and these were then painted and hair and animal skin applied, to serve asmodels in museum dioramas. As the bodies decayed and became less amenable tostudy, they were macerated— the flesh removed from the skeletons—and theskeletons retained for further investigation and display.According to workshop organizer Teschler-Nicola, Pöch had collected “80skeletons, 150 skulls and made 50 casts. He saw 1000 Bushmen who spoke 10different languages, and measured the bodies of 300.” 100 [part0009.html#ft100]Teschler-Nicola then located two of these remains in the private collection ofEmil Breitinger (1904-2004), an anthropologist who had pro-Nazi sympathiesduring the war.When Rassool and Legassick introduced this evidence at the workshop there wasgeneral shock and dismay. What had begun as a celebration of the accomplishmentsof the man generally considered the founder of the “Vienna School” ofanthropology, ethnology, morphology and anthropometrics was cast in the light ofa racist who looked upon the bodies of dead Africans as just so much “material”for his research. That Pöch had conducted these disinternments without any kindof official permit from the South African government only further reinforced theidea that he was some kind of ghoulish graverobber.This would not be the end of Pöch's outrages, however. When World War I began,he had the idea that the prisoner of war camps would be an excellent source of“material” for his racial studies, for these prisoners came from all parts ofEurope and even the East. Like a young boy in a candy factory, Pöch ran amok inthe camps, taking measurements and photographing candidates for his racestudies.To understand the rationale behind this, one has to become familiar with theideas on race current in the German-speaking academic world at the time. Thebasic concept was that there were only a handful of “pure” races. Other ethnicgroups represented admixtures of these “pure” races. Take the example of theprimary colors: red, blue and yellow. Mix red and blue together and you getpurple. Mix red and yellow together, and you get orange, etc. Thus, secondarycolors are created from mixtures of the primary colors. The idea of race wasquite similar. One had to examine a subject and attempt to discern the mixtureof races present in their anatomical structures, etc. extending even to thegenetic. This same approach would be taken by the Third Reich when it came toidentifying the Mischlinge: the mixed Jewish and Aryan persons. Just as thecolor orange implies the presence of red and yellow, certain anatomicalcharacteristics would imply the presence of “tainted” Jewish blood.Rudolf Pöch died in 1921 at the age of 51, leaving the chair of anthropologythat he created at the University of Vienna vacant. By that time, however, hehad married Hella Schürer von Waldheim, a young, 28-year old assistant 23 yearshis junior. Hella Pöch (1893-1976?) became involved in creating paternity tests,ostensibly for determining paternity in general civil cases in the courts. Thistype of research, however, would have other applications once the Reich had beenestablished. Until then, however, Hella Pöch devoted herself to a wide range ofrace studies, including her well-known survey of the Volhynian population ofUkraine.This was an attempt to isolate an ethnic group from a region that had beenheavily populated by German immigrants. Her focus was on the “pure” Volhynians,i.e., those who were not German, Jewish, or Ukrainian. Her methodology includedfamily surveys, a system taught to her by her late husband. Parenthetically,after the German invasion of Ukraine in June of 1941, there were massacres ofthe local Jewish and other populations in order that Germans from the Reich, aspart of the Lebensraum program, could colonize the region. One wonders what partHella Pöch's fieldwork in Volhynia contributed to the identification of theethnic groups to be exterminated, for her perspective was on determining thatthe Volhynians were members of an “Asiatic” race, and thus not Aryan.The Journal of the American Medical Association for June, 1934 has a briefarticle in which Hella Pöch is mentioned as one of the presenters at a jointsession of the Gesellschaft fur Rassenkunde (the Society for Race Science) andthe Anthropologische Gesellschaft (Anthropology Society) of Austria, in aprogram entitled “Composition of the Jewish Population in Vienna, from theStandpoint of Anthropology.”101 [part0009.html#ft101] Pöch based much of herreport on the methods devised by her late husband and used during his Bushmenresearch in Africa as well as his work in the prisoner of war camps during WorldWar One. The thrust of the conference was to present the findings of theparticipating anthropologists that the Jews seemed to represent “at least sevendistinct racial types, and possibly three more”. This conference took place in1934, a year after Hitler came to power in Germany but still long beforeAnschluss made Austria part of the Greater German Reich. This political climategave rise to an unintentionally sardonic remark in the JAMA report that “Sincescientific research may still be carried on in Austria unhampered by politics,which is an impediment in Germany, the results of such a discussion should beinteresting.” How a study of Vienna's 200,000 Jews in terms of racial“types”—based on Rudolf Pöch's blatantly racist method of collecting Africancorpses, robbing graves of their bodies—could be seen as “unhampered bypolitics” is perhaps a greater characterization of the place and time thananything that could be said in its defence.Although Hella Pöch was still a little careful in pre-Anschluss Austria, she wasnot so careful when it came to the Reich. According to historian Brigitte Füchs,Hella Pöch was deeply involved in questions of race science since the 1920s,when she conducted an anthropological survey of 850 people in order to prove the“Nordic” character of the Austrian population.102 [part0009.html#ft102]The years 1934-1938 saw Hella Pöch traveling frequently to Germany where shenurtured good relations with the Rassenpolitischen Amt der NSDAP (The RacePolicy Office of the Nazi Party). By the time Anschluss made Austria part of theReich, Hella Pöch was already well established in her field as a bona fide racescientist.At some point she married Georg Anton Pöch (date unknown) and moved with him toSalzburg. The strange coincidence of her marrying two men named Pöch would nothave escaped the reader; but the author must confess he has no explanation forthis. The two men do not appear to have been related, but until furtherinvestigation is completed we must assume that they were simply two men namedPöch.Georg Anton Pöch was a physician rather than a pure anthropologist like hiswife, but he accompanied her to the Netherlands and together they applied totheir friend Seyss-Inquart for permission to use the camps as the raw materialfor their dubious study of Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jewish prisoners.Prior to the war, both Georg Anton and Hella Pöch had published articles inpeer-reviewed journals (some of them in English) concerning the epidemiology ofdisease, and inherited racial traits, among other things. For instance, Georg A.Pöch published—with the American Charles N. Leach of the RockefellerFoundation—”A Diphtheria Immunization Campaign in Austria” in The AmericanJournal of Public Health (February, 1935), while Hella Pöch delivered “AContribution to the Muscular Anatomy and Certain Racial Distinctions of BushNatives” to the Anthropological Society of Vienna, in Salzburg, in September of1926.By 1940, however, the situation had changed considerably. Germany had invadedthe Netherlands, the war was on, and anthropologists had to make a livingsomehow. The Pöch couple went to Seyss-Inquart and asked to be allowed toexamine the Sephardic Jews then at the Ommen transit camp. The idea was to takeblood and other biological samples from the imprisoned Jews to conduct racialcomparison studies with samples from the more numerous Ashkenazic populations ofCentral and Eastern Europe. The Reich Ministry of Education approved the projectby March, 1941 and 6,000 Reichsmarks earmarked for the study, with morefinancial aid coming from Seyss-Inquart himself.103 [part0009.html#ft103]The Pöch couple was excited about the potential for determining racialcharacteristics specific to Sephardic Jews. It would become a useful tool forextending the reach of the Nazi bureaucracy to encompass another sub-set of theJewish “racial type.” If there were considerable differences between theAshkenazic and Sephardic types, that meant that the racial profiling that hadbeen taking place to date throughout the Greater German Reich and its occupiedterritories was missing some important variables.The Nazis were determined to do whatever they had to do to eliminate the Jewfrom Europe (as Seyss-Inquart's own statements to that effect make very clear)as well as from the rest of the world (as revealed by the Gestapo action inIndonesia as well as the determined efforts of the Argentine immigrationauthorities to forbid Jewish immigrants from landing in their country). To thosewho would deny the Holocaust, it is a simple matter of reading what the Nazisthemselves had to say about their intentions towards the Jews (and the Gypsies,homosexuals, etc.) and the actions they took to eliminate the Jewish people fromsociety, government, culture, and science and not only in Europe but around theworld, in as much as they were able to do so. In order to be effective in thisprogram, it was necessary to isolate as many ethnographic and anthropologicalvariables as possible for racial markers. Heretofore, all the emphasis had beenon the Ashkenazic Jew, which was the type most familiar to those living inGermany and Austria. The Sephardic Jew, with origins in Spain, Portugal and theMiddle East, was less well known and thus it was important to identify them asquickly as possible for isolation from society and eventual elimination fromEurope.Unfotunately for the Pöch couple, the deportation of the Jews from Ommen tookprecedence over their research project. It was evidently more important to killthe “material” than to study it. That did not deter them, however, for they hadother—even more ambitious— projects in mind, such as asking leave to inspect allthe large German prison camps for suitable research “material.” Again, theyapproached their friend Seyss-Inquart for support and again he gave hisblessing, but by that time the war was making increasing demands on both thecamps and the Wehrmacht itself.If it seems strange that anthropologists—scientists, after all, and in the caseof Hella Pöch one of the most celebrated in her field— should be working for thegovernment, one only needs to remember one of the twentieth century's mostpopular fictional academics: Indiana Jones.In the first Indiana Jones film, the rugged archaeologist is approached by USmilitary intelligence in the years leading up to World War II to find the Ark ofthe Covenant before the Nazis do. The idea that an academic, and anarchaeologist (not a specialist in armaments or aerospace technology), wouldwillingly work for the military never bothered the general viewing public whomade Raiders of the Lost Ark one of the highest grossing films of its time. Yet,this is an issue that is controversial today for the Pentagon does have such aprogram currently in place. Known as Project Minerva, it is a program wherebythe US military gives grants in the millions of dollars to Americananthropologists to study terrorism. Minerva has come under fire from theAmerican Anthropological Association who sees it as a dangerous mingling ofmilitary and academic agendas. After all, one tends to tell the person writingthe checks what that person wants to hear. At best, it results in bad scienceand tainted research; at worst, it contributes to a skewed perspective on one ofthe world's most serious—yet least understood—modern problems: that ofinternational terrorism. It is a conundrum looking for a practical as well as anethical solution.Failing in their efforts to use the concentration camp system as their personalanthropometric laboratory, it is not clear what the Pöch couple did next, orwhere they spent the rest of the war years (in the Netherlands? Back in Austria?Elsewhere in the occupied territories?) but the next time we run across them itis in Austria and it is 1946.The Mysterious Dr. PöchDr. Sosro Husodo is an Indonesian medical professional. In the year 1960 he waspart of a famous enterprise known as “Project Hope.” This fact is almostcasually mentioned in the few available articles on Sosro—all in BahasaIndonesia, the official language of the archipelago—but no clarification is everoffered. As it was the pivotal role of Hope that led to the discovery of Pöch,we shall look at it briefly here.Project Hope was a highly touted American medical mission that took the form ofan ocean-going vessel that called at Southeast Asian ports in the 1960s. Theauthor clearly remembers Project Hope from grade school classroom discussionsand presentations at the time (the author even remembers making a donation tothe Project Hope fund, as did his classmates, after the presentation). A film onthe project won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject in 1961,and can be viewed on Project Hope's website today.The first voyage of the SS Hope began on September 22, 1960, leaving the port ofSan Francisco bound for Indonesia. It carried a staff of medical professionals(doctors, nurses, and technicians) as well as much-needed equipment and medicalsupplies. It opened an orthopaedic clinic in Indonesia, and treated thousands ofpeople for cancer, leprosy, and various infections as well as malnutrition, allwithout charge of any kind. It called on Indonesian ports and invited hundredsof local medical personnel on board for training as well as to formcross-cultural links that would enable the American doctors to more effectivelyinteract with local customs and practices.One of these local medical professionals was Dr. Sosro Husodo.104[part0009.html#ft104] A graduate of the Faculty of Medicine at the University ofIndonesia, he worked in the towns of Bima (on the island of Sumbawa) and Kupang(a town on West Timor) before visiting the city of Sumbawa Besar with the SSHope on its 1960 maiden voyage.Sumbawa is an island to the east of Bali and Lombok. Aside from Sumbawa Besar,its biggest towns are Bima and Dompu. The native population of Sumbawa isdivided into two distinct ethnic groups with their own languages but these daysBahasa Indonesia (the official state language of Indonesia) is widely spoken.The Sultan of Bima ruled the island until the Japanese occupation, and there istoday an Heir Apparent to the throne of the Sultan who has not yet beeninstalled. Both Islam and Hinduism contributed to the culture of Sumbawa, andthere was a significant Roman Catholic presence on the island as well.Sumbawa Besar is not Jakarta. It is not even Bandung, or Kuta in Bali. And in1960, the isolation of Sumbawa island from the center of political and economicpower in the nation's capital was even greater than it is today. Communicationswith Java and with the world at large would have been difficult; transportationeven more so. Today, most visitors pass through Sumbawa from the relaxedtropical paradise of Bali to the west on their way to the unspoiled beauty ofFlores island to the east, stopping only briefly in Sumbawa waiting for either aboat or a ferry to take them the rest of the way to see the fabled Komodo dragonin its natural habitat on Flores and nearby Komodo island. Balinese looking forwork on Timor may also pass through Sumbawa. The point to be made is that, tothe outside world, Sumbawa is a transit point and not a destination.Yet, when Dr. Sosro Husodo landed in Sumbawa Besar in October of 1970 as part ofProject Hope's mission to bring modern medical care and technology to thisIndonesian backwater, he found to his surprise a “German” doctor in residence atthe island's largest hospital.Dr. Sosro and several of his colleagues visited the doctor, intrigued by theappearance of this foreigner in such a remote locale. After all, according tothe statistics current at the time and mentioned in the Project Hope documentaryfilm, there was only one doctor per every 100,000 people in Indonesia in 1960and in some areas only one doctor for every 500,000 people. Therefore a doctor,and a foreign one at that, merited some attention.He was introduced as Doctor Pöch, and the impression that Dr Sosro had was thatthe man was German, and with an equally German wife; but Sosro had anotherimpression as well: that the man knew very little about medicine and yet wasrunning the largest hospital in Sumbawa Besar.Pöch appeared to be a man in his sixties. He had trouble with his left leg,which dragged, and a tremor in his left hand. Sosro assumed it might beParkinson's Disease, which would not have been unusual for a man of his age,although he argeed the symptoms could reflect another disorder entirely.Sosro visited Pöch several times over the next few years. In October of 1960, heseemed to be living with a woman and a small boy of about 7 years of age. Thewoman was called “Gerda” and the boy's name was given in Sosro's memoires quitespecifically as “Frank G. Spisak.”There is no indication as to why this boy's name should have been given soprecisely. In fact, there is no more information in Sosro's account of the boyexcept to say that he and “Gerda” left for the United States shortly thereafter,i.e., in October or November. Then, the following month—November of 1960—”Gerda”is replaced by another woman, here named “Helena”105 [part0009.html#ft105] whocan thus be identified with Hella or Helena Pöch.The reason this is important is that there was a real Frank G. Spisak, and hewas a convicted serial killer in Cleveland, Ohio charged with killing threepersons and wounding others in a spree lasting several months in 1982. Therewould be no point in mentioning this fact, except for the strange coincidencethat Spisak was a neo-Nazi who committed his crimes in order to spark a race warbetween Blacks, Jews and Whites, and who quoted Hitler and wore a Hitlermustache during his trial in 1983. A strange, seemingly demented cross-dresserand Hitler-worshipper, Spisak was finally executed in 2011 after serving thelongest time of any American prisoner on death row.How could there be two individuals with the exact same name and middle initial,both associated with Hitler, on opposite sides of the world? According toSosro's account, the boy in Sumbawa Besar was about seven years old at the time(1960). That meant that he would have been born roughly 1953. The convictedserial killer Frank G. Spisak was born on June 6, 1951. They were thuscontemporaries.Did Sosro see the future Hitler devotee and murderer in a small house on anIndonesian island in 1960?Later, Sosro would write of discussions between the mystery woman and Pöch;another woman—Sulaesih—would add considerably more detail. According to Sosro,Pöch defended Hitler and the Nazi Party. He denied the reports of mass murder atAuschwitz. When Sosro was asked to give his opinion about Pöch's trembling lefthand, Sosro said it might be Parkinson's to which Pöch vehemently objected. Themystery woman—in this case Helena—offered the explanation that he had banged hishand on a table in a violent manner when hearing of the defeat of the GermanArmy outside Moscow, and that his hand had never been the same since then.A few years later, Sosro learns that Helena Pöch has also left Sumbawa. GeorgAnton Pöch winds up converting to Islam and taking the name Abdul Kohar.And takes another wife, the Sundanese woman Sulaesih.The Pöch DiaryIt is thanks to Sulaesih (known as “Esih” for short) that we have more detailconcerning the mysterious “German doctor,” for she not only shared herexperiences with Dr. Sosro, she also provided him with some papers that wereleft behind when Pöch died in 1970. Among them was a kind of diary, some ofwhich was in an obscure form of German shorthand which Sosro went to somelengths to get translated. It contained information concerning a network ofpersons around the world who were involved in helping Nazi war criminals escapejustice.It contained information on the Ratline.It is important to note that this diary was written no later than January, 1970for that is when the enigmatic Dr. Pöch died. While this story did not make theIndonesian press until 1983 at the latest, when Dr Sosro wrote an article onPöch voicing his suspicions about him, the specific condition of the diary makesit doubtful that it was a later forgery. Written in the old Gabelsberger form ofshorthand (that had to be translated by specialists in Germany) it containeddetails that no one except a beneficiary of the Ratline would have known asearly as 1970. It was this diary—and the name Draganovic written in itspages—that got the author involved in the investigation. Had it not been forthat written record, he would have never given the fanciful tale of Adolf Hitlerescaping to Indonesia a second thought.Further, we are well aware of the existence of forged Hitler diaries. Theself-proclaimed expert on Adolf Hitler—Hugh Trevor-Roper himself—was famouslyconned by an individual who claimed to have such diaries, diaries that werelater proved to be forgeries. But the important thing to remember about the Pöchdiary is that it does not pretend to be a Hitler diary at all; it is, rather, arecord of an escape from Germany to Italy and from there eventually toIndonesia. It is not signed “Hitler” nor does it in any way offer specificevidence that its author is indeed the Fuhrer. The reasons behind the conclusionby Sosro and others as to the real author of the Pöch diary will be made clearas we proceed.The diary—or notebook—is a small, 9 cm (about 4 inches) x 16 cm (about 6 inches)brown book about 44 mm (an inch and a half) thick. Inside the front cover thereis the legend “JR KepaD No. 35 637” and “35 638”, each number marked with abiological symbol for Male and Female, respectively. The author has not beenable to decipher the legend “JR KepaD” but the numbers are presumably a means ofidentification for both Pöch and his wife.A clearer statement is found inside the book which, when translated, reads:“Escape Organization. Mr. and Mrs. Oppenheim replacement. Krüger. Sardegna Roma79 A/1. Expenses for travel to South America (Argentina).”This gives us somewhat more to work with. In particular, the name of Kruger issuggestive of an Argentine-Nazi network that was revealed recently byinvestigator Uki Goñi. Known as Vianord, this travel agency—which never handledany tourists—was set up by Carlos Fuldner, already mentioned as the SS officerassigned to Spain in 1945 to set up one leg of the Ratline. Vianord was based inBuenos Aires, but had “offices” in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe. Itsmission was to provide the necessary documentation and bookings for Nazisfleeing prosecution.One of Vianord's most infamous clients was SS officer Josef Schwammberger.Responsible for the atrocities committed at a concentration camp in the town ofPrzemysl in Poland—the same Przemysl that was stated as his birthplace on Pöch'simmigration documents—Schwammberger was high on the list of most-wanted Nazis.It was Vianord who came to the rescue, and the man running Vianord in BuenosAires was former Swedish SS officer Hans-Caspar Krüger.106 [part0009.html#ft106]It is not known whether the Krüger in the Pöch notebook is the same as the oneat Vianord, but the specific mention of his name in association with travel toArgentina would imply that they were the same person, and Vianord was inoperation at the time of the Pöch flight to Argentina (which would take place in1951). Further, the name Oppenheim recalls one Clemens Oppenheimer, also inBuenos Aires, who provided immigration documents for Arthur Wiederkehr, a Swisslawyer involved in extorting huge sums of money from Jews wishing to escape NaziGermany during the war. Wiederkehr and his Nazi colleagues ran this operationthrough Spanish and Argentine embassies and consulates in the Netherlands (wherePöch had been working) and Spain. Indeed, one of Wiederkehr's contacts in theThird Reich was none other than the “architect of the Final Solution,” AdolfEichmann.107 [part0009.html#ft107] In his escape at the end of the war, Eichmannwould later benefit from the services of Krunoslav Draganovic and the CatholicChurch, as we shall see presently.The address given above—Sardegna Roma 79 A/1—is a little startling, for it isthe address of the building that houses the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut,the German Archaeological Institute, and the building at Via Sardegna 79 in Romeis one of the oldest archaeological organizations in the world which was foundedin the early nineteenth century in Rome. It would make perfect sense thatsomeone like Pöch (and especially his famous anthropologist wife) would havecontacts there stemming from his wartime and pre-wartime activities. Referenceto the Institute's own website shows that there is no mention of theorganization's activities during and immediately after the war, an omission onewill come across again and again when researching the escape routes used by theNazis. In this case, the presence of this address in the Pöch diary lends itfurther credibility as a legitimate German document rather than a later forgery,for this address and its associated Institute would not be general knowledgeoutside a very small circle of academic experts and would not have beensomething Dr Sosro would have known; certainly, in the unlikely event he hadheard of the Institute, he most certainly would not have had its address in Romenor thought to include it in the diary if he had. In fact, the Institute willlead us to another—far more notorious—organization, the SS-Ahnenerbe, as wellshall see in a later chapter [part0014.html].This was not the only address, however, for on another page one comes across twoof the most infamous addresses on that part of the Ratline known as the“monastery route”: Via Albaro 38 in Genoa, and Via Tomacelli 132 in Rome. Bothaddresses are specifically linked in the diary to the name of KrunoslavDraganovic, the Roman Catholic monsignor who was the administrator of one of themost sinister operations of post-war Europe.As we have seen in Chapter Three [part0007.html], Draganovic—a Croatian priestof the Catholic Church—was part of a larger group of Catholic clergy thatincluded bishops and cardinals who were instrumental in assisting hundreds (ifnot thousands) of Nazi SS officers and other indictable war criminals to escape.In fact, underneath the Genoa address in Pöch's diary is the one word “Vatican.”In the antique Gabelsberger shorthand, there is found the following intriguingtestimony:“Short Description of the Individual Pursuit by the Allies and the LocalAuthority in the year 1946 in Salzburg. We both, my wife and I, in 1945 inSalzburg.”This is consistent with information that Georg Anton Pöch was the medicalofficer of the Salzburg Gau. Hella Pöch was on the board of the ViennaAnthropological Society throughout the war until 1945, so it is possiblethat—after their Netherlands adventures—the Pöch couple wound up back in Austriaif, indeed, they ever left. In Salzburg when the war ended they were eventuallyquestioned by the CIC (the Counter Intelligence Corps of the US Army which was,at the time, the only military agency involved in actively hunting Nazi warcriminals).But the question remains: why? Why did the Pöch couple find it necessary toevade the Allied authorities in Salzburg and eventually flee to Italy and escapeEurope altogether? The author has been unable to find their names on any of thelists of wanted Nazis, war criminals, Nazi scientists, etc. that were in thehands of the CIC. Recourse to recently declassified CIA and FBI files from thewar years similarly was fruitless. There is virtually no record at all of thesetwo individuals, except in the annals of the Viennese anthropologists and “racescientists.” Among all their colleagues, the Pöchs were “unwanted.” Yet, thereseems to be a wall of silence surrounding them in Europe. Even the Rudolf PöchInstitute in Vienna claims to know nothing more about his wife, Hella Pöch, eventhough she was a prominent member of the Vienna Anthropological Society andstill bore her husband's familiar and unmistakable surname, and even though theyhave it on record when she died (possibly for legal reasons; as the widow ofRudolf Pöch it is possible she had an interest in his estate; proving her deathmight have released her assets as well as those of Rudolf Pöch, but since theInstitute does not respond to repeated inquiries we may never know the truth).And Georg Anton Pöch? If we trust the available records and archives, he mightas well have never existed after April, 1945. In fact, he barely existed beforethen. It seems his only claim to fame in those days was his marriage to theindefatigable Hella.A tantalizing clue follows in the next few sentences of the Pöch diary:“My wife had to deal with the CIC a total of five times, sometimes at home andsometimes at CIC offices…. I was accused of falsifying information and of warcrimes, concerning the death of Jews in Camp Macorr.”Unfortunately, there is no record of a “Camp Macorr” anywhere in Europe and,indeed, the name appears to be a corruption of another name, the corruptionperhaps due to the Glasberger shorthand that might have not been up to the taskof recording foreign names. If the camp in question was in Poland or in one ofthe occupied territories there is every reason to believe that its name wasgarbled in translation. There were thousands of camps and sub-camps during thewar, so it is entirely possible that further research will reveal the identityof this place.108 [part0009.html#ft108]Why would the Pöchs be accused of war crimes and specifically of the death ofJews in a concentration or extermination camp? If they were anthropologists, howwould they have been culpable of mass murder? Unfortunately, as we will see,many of their anthropologist colleagues were capable of just such activities andseveral of them were arrested, charged, convicted and in some cases executed forthem.Further along in the diary we read:“The thing that damned me and my wife were documents revealed by the governmentChancellery office according to a report by Mr. Von Kruz, a despicable humanbeing.”It is impossible to tell to what documents Pöch refers, but they were enough toimplicate both Georg Anton and Hella Pöch in the murder of Jews in the camps.The name “von Kruz” is an unlikely one. There is no record of a von Kruz or avon Kurz or even a Kruze or Kruise with either the CIC or in any other capacity.Von Kruz means, literally, “of the Cross” and often is used in conjunction withJohann von Kruz or “John of the Cross,” a famous Catholic saint. The author hastried several different variations of the name and still comes up empty. It isentirely possible that the name was a kind of inside joke at someone else'sexpense, perhaps a way of designating a particularly religious interrogator. Itis also possible—and difficult to establish at this remove—that the “von Kruz”was not one of the Allied interrogators but someone who wrote a report for theReich during the war, complaining about the Pöch couple. We will not be able toidentify this person until more records are forthcoming from the ViennaAnthropological Society, the Rudolf Pöch Institute, and/ or the wartime files ofthe German government itself.According to the diary, the Pöch couple survive the five CIC interrogations andeventually make their way to Graz where they wait for six weeks before going onto a place identified only as “J”. There is no indication as to how long theyspent in Salzburg, except that it was from 1945 to—at least—1946.The letter “J” is not the only enigmatic reference in the diary. The completelist of letter designations runs: BSGJBSR Dr Sosro believed that these letters stood for Berlin, Salzburg, Graz,Jugoslavia, Belgrade, Sarajevo and Rome, respectively. This is not entirely afanciful conclusion, as it is clear from the diary that the Pöchs were first inSalzburg and then in Graz109 [part0009.html#ft109], and that they eventuallywound up in Rome. That accounts for three of the seven letters in the properorder of the escape route. We may be tempted to assign the first “B” to Berlinor even Berchtesgaden (although there is no evidence that the Pöch couple wasever in either place), in which case we only have to identify the remainingthree letters, and this is where the difficulty lies.Jugoslavia (or Yugoslavia) was Communist-controlled territory in those days.Belgrade and Sarajevo both would have been deep within that zone. It sounds asif it would have been suicidal for any Nazi—let alone Hitler—to enterYugoslavian territory at that time. Yet, even the notorious “Angel of Death” ofAuschwitz, Josef Mengele, ventured into the Soviet zone for several weeks duringhis escape from the Allies “in the late summer and early fall of 1945” asdescribed in the official OSI report on Mengele,110 [part0009.html#ft110] anadventure that would have lead to certain death if he had been captured by theRussians, for it was the Russian Army that liberated Auschwitz and was witnessto the horrors that were perpetrated there.Strangely, however, a letter appeared in the declassified FBI files on Hitlerthat insists that the Fuhrer himself was in the same region as the Pöch couple,if we are to believe Dr. Sosro's account.The letter is dated “At the end of May, 1948” from Cavalesso (i.e., Cavalese),Italy.111 [part0009.html#ft111] In it, the writer claims that Hitler was livingin a small hamlet called Bobovo, which was located in the Ponikva region ofLower Styria (today, east central Slovenia), about 47 kilometers southwest ofMaribor (Marburg). The directions in the letter for reaching the hamlet werequite specific, allowing for differences in spelling (“Ponikva pri Žalcu” wasspelled “Ponikva pri Jelsah”, for instance). The writer claimed that Hitler wasliving there quietly, and that there was some rumor about him traveling to orfrom South America.What makes the letter compelling is the fact that it was written in German butsent from Cavalese, Italy, which immediately brings the Ratline to mind.Cavalese is only a few kilometers south of Bolzano in the Italian Tyrol wheremajor elements of the Ratline were located and through which many war criminalswould pass.The letter was originally addressed to the CIA, but it was forwarded for somereason to J. Edgar Hoover. It was translated into English, but the Germanoriginal was also attached to the file. The unnamed forwarder of the letterremarked that the writer was either not German or not an uneducated German dueto several spelling errors; further, the fact that “Stati Uniti” was used for“United States” made the forwarder believe that the author was an Italian.This was a case of over-analyzing the data. A person living in northern Italy inthat particular place might well have been an Italian of German ancestry or anAustrian or even some other nationality who had a good working knowledge ofGerman. It actually goes to support the provenance of the letter as having comefrom someone with an insider's knowledge of the Ratline.The letter does not seem to have been followed up, but for some reason theauthor of the letter did not think it strange that the most wanted man inGermany would have been hiding in Slovenia, in Communist-controlled Yugoslavia.This random letter from the FBI file may actually go a long way towardssupporting Dr. Sosro's contention that Pöch wound up in Yugoslavia for a while.The author can only conjecture as to the reasons for the Pöchs to go toYugoslavia (if, in fact, that is what the letters represent). Belgrade (alsoknown as Beograd) is in Serbia and Sarajevo in Bosnia. There seems no logicalreason for a Nazi fleeing from the frying pan to dive into the fire, for Serbiawas the enemy of Croatia; the former were largely Eastern Orthodox and theCroatians were Catholics who— when they were in a position of power during thewar—forced many Serbians to convert to Catholicism before shipping them to thedeath camps or actually slaughtering them outside the very churches where theyhad been forced to convert. Fr. Draganovic would have been no help to the Nazisin Serbia, unless he had underground contacts there from the war (which, ofcourse, he claimed he did to the CIC)…but why would they go to such hostileterritory in the Communist East when Italy was much safer and so close, acrossthe Tyrolean Alps where the rest of the fleeing Nazis would find themselves?Yet, the evidence does seem to point in that direction. To go from Salzburg toGraz was definitely counter-intuitive for someone escaping the Allied forces.Graz was close to the border of Slovenia, one of the states that made up theformer Yugoslavia, and far to the east of the Tyrol where most of the escapingcriminals were hiding, waiting for their false identity papers. The mysteriousletter to the CIA concerning a Hitler sighting in the Ponikva region of Sloveniareinforces this idea. The Pöchs were going in the opposite direction from safetyand if they did, indeed, wind up in Belgrad and Sarajevo they were headed nottowards Genoa and a boat to Argentina, but towards Greece, Turkey and the MiddleEast. The hard way, through Communist controlled Serbia and Bosnia.Bosnia is at least partly understandable, as during the war it was part of theCroatian Independent State, which was a Nazi puppet regime. Draganovic was aCroatian priest and was helping many of his countrymen escape the Communists bysending them to South America. And there was a large Muslim presence in Bosnia,which, due to the recruiting efforts of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, hadfielded a Muslim SS Division during the war, the famous Handschar Division alsoknown as the 13th Waffen Mountain Division-SS and the 1st Croatian Division-SS.But after the war, the directionality of flight for the Nazis was from Bosniaand Croatia to the west; not the other way around. Had the Pöchs continued ontheir way south and east, they would have had a much longer and much moredangerous excursion ahead of them before they reached sanctuary somewhere inSyria, Palestine or Egypt. They would have had to deal first with Yugoslavpartisans who were fierce opponents of the Nazi regime; then, as Yugoslavia wasdeclared a Socialist Republic in January of 1946, they would have had to dealwith a government that was similarly hostile. While the Allies in the west—theBritish, French and Americans—were just as eager to imprison Nazi war criminals,the general consensus among the Nazis themselves was that it was far better tobe captured by those enemies than by the Soviets who would show them no mercywhatsoever.There would have had to have been a compelling reason for the Pöchs to decide onthe eastern route to safety rather than follow their compatriots to the west, tothe Tyrolean Alps and from there to Verona and on to Bari or Genoa. Thesituation on the Italian border was ridiculous: in some towns, Nazi troops andeven SS officers still wore their uniforms in the street and in some cases werecharged with keeping order. There was a huge influx of displaced persons tonorthern Italy from Austria, and the prison camps and DP camps could notaccommodate the large numbers of refugees. It was easy to escape these makeshiftcamps once apprehended, and there was a flourishing market in the border townsin forged identification papers…made even easier for the SS who had contacts inan underground network of safe houses and sympathetic ethnic Germans.However, things were not that easy for the Pöchs in Salzburg. Pöch writes thatthings were relatively quiet for most of 1945 and 1946, until a “Jew” insultedhis wife by coming to their apartment and telling her that they should have leftSalzburg long ago, that there was an article in the local Communist newspaper112[part0009.html#ft112] that attracted the attention of the CIC to their case. Itwas then that the CIC accused Pöch of lying about his Nazi Party membership.What is intriguing is the question of how there came to be an article in a localnewspaper that would have implicated the Pöchs in anything, particularlyexposing their possible membership in the Party. Further, if the article was ina “Communist” newspaper, then it makes even less sense for the Pöchs to escapeto Communist-controlled Yugoslavia, of all places.In any event, and leaving aside the question of whether the J, B and S reallyrefer to Jugoslavia, Belgrade and Sarajevo (or to other towns in Slovenia),years later the Pöchs eventually make it to Rome. The Pöch diary states, “On thefirst day of December, we had to go to R to receive a letter and a passport thatenabled us to leave Europe.” Pöch is not specific as to the year, but it musthave been December 1, 1950 for he will receive passport number 2624/51 in Rome,dated September 28, 1951.113 [part0009.html#ft113]As he had the address of the Draganovic safe house in Genoa in his notebook, wecan surmise that the Pöchs then made the trip from Rome to Genoa sometime afterSeptember 28, 1951 and boarded a ship bound for Argentina. Genoa was animportant link not only in the ratlines but also for a wide variety of refugeesand displaced persons seeking a better life in the New World. The undergroundnetwork of Nazi supporters, however, usually managed to mix Nazi escapees amongthe regular refugees on the ships and to provide them with the all-importantentry visas for Argentina, without which they would have not been able todisembark in Buenos Aires.Pöch had the name of Kruger in his notebook, as well as the information that hewas going to Argentina, so the author tentatively assumes that Vianord, the Nazifront organization booked his passage. They would have disembarked in Argentinasometime in late 1951 or early 1952, depending on how quickly they were able toget a berth.But something went wrong in Argentina.It is impossible to know at this remove what prompted Pöch to leave Argentinawhere there were so many other Nazis—famous Nazis, wanted war criminals—leadingrelatively peaceful lives there and in other countries in South America. Why didthe Pöchs feel they could not stay anywhere on the continent?Why did they choose the absolute furthest destination available to them?Why was Argentina not safe enough?Along with the brief account of the escape from Austria and—via Yugoslavia?—toRome and then to Genoa and Argentina, there is almost nothing else that can tellus where the Pöch couple was located between the years 1951 and 1954 when theyfinally arrived in Indonesia. However, there are indications that they were incontact with a far-flung network of fellow travelers. The diary was also anaddress book (and one that is being withheld from publication by its currentowner) containing—according to Dr Sosro—the names and addresses of hundreds of“foreigners” living in countries around the world. Some of those countriesinclude Pakistan, Argentina, Italy, South Africa…and Tibet.Tibet, of course, attracted the attention of a generation of Europeans (andespecially Germans and Scandinavians) in the first half of the twentiethcentury. The SS mounted an expedition to Tibet in 1938, as recounted in theauthor's Unholy Alliance. Photographs and videotapes of this expedition havebeen made available recently by the Bundesarchiv and can be found online.Heinrich Harrer—author of Seven Years in Tibet, which became a film starringBrad Pitt—was an SS officer who fled a British POW camp at the outset of the warand found himself across the border in the Forbidden Kingdom, befriending theyoung Dalai Lama. Tibet was a siren song for the German archaeologists workingfor the SS-Deutsches Ahnenerbe, the “Ancestral Heritage Research Foundation” ofthe SS, which accommodated many crank academics and mystics in the employ ofHeinrich Himmler. Wolfram Sievers—the chief of the SS-Ahnenerbe—would beexecuted at Nuremberg; some of the “academics” under his command were involvedin heinous experimentation on living prisoners in the concentration camps,including at least one anthropologist—Bruno Beger—who was a member of theSS-Tibet Expedition and who later was involved in the selection of human skullsfrom camp prisoners for a museum of anthropology. Beger himself was arrested andimprisoned for a short time, but managed to live out his days peacefully inGermany, dying only two years ago as this is being written. He consideredhimself a friend of Tibet—and of the Dalai Lama—until the end of his days.In fact, there was a direct connection between the SS-Ahnenerbe and the GermanArchaeological Institute which has only recently come to light,114[part0009.html#ft114] a connection that leads us back to the Pöch diary and itsenigmatic reference to the Institute's address as part of the “escapeorganization.”Thus we have to ask ourselves, in light of all the foregoing information, howdid the Ratline work? What was it? What were its components?And whom did it serve?Most importantly…could the Ratline have managed to save the most wanted warcriminal of the twentieth century?images [../images/00003.jpeg]ABOVE: Adolf Hitler.

The elaborate Vatican-OSS escape mechanism costmoney. Papers had to be forged, fugitives moved across borders, housed and fed,officials paid off, overseas ocean travel arranged. While the Nazi priests likeDraganovic, Saric and Hudal were true believers, committed to the cause, therest of the operation required the services of hundreds of support personnel inmore than a dozen countries116 [part0010.html#chap6_fn116] whose loyalty wasmeasured in dollars and pounds rather than slogans.Often, these funds were in the form of gold bars, various internationalcurrencies, diamonds, and artwork—paintings, manuscripts, rare books, furniture,and sculpture—stolen from museums and private collections all over Europe. Aconsiderable amount of these resources was stored at various churches andmonasteries along the escape route. Some of them were even stored at thecathedral of Archbishop Stepinac, as well as in churches and monasteries inItaly, Austria, Germany and Spain.Some of these funds went to fill the coffers of Perón in Argentina. While theArgentine president was pro-Nazi in sentiment, he was not above taking as muchas he could from the Nazi loot to help finance the Ratline on his end. It was upto Draganovic (and SS officer Carlos Fuldner) to ensure that the money flowed aseasily to Buenos Aires as did the war criminals themselves.Again, none of this is speculation. Documents declassified since the mid-1980s(the time of the Klaus Barbie revelations, the hunt for Josef Mengele, and thefamous “Hitler Diaries” hoax) show in some detail how this operation worked. Infact, it was the Barbie episode that more than anything else brought themonastery route—and the complicity of US intelligence—to world attention.Barbie had been chief of the Gestapo in the French city of Lyon, where he wasknown as the “Butcher of Lyon” for his cruelty in the interrogation andexecution of Jews and French partisans (resistance fighters). Draganovicarranged his escape and, indeed, Draganovic himself, signed his forgedInternational Red Cross papers—in the false name of “Klaus Altmann.” But beforeBarbie left Europe for South America and his eventual sanctuary in Bolivia, heworked for the CIC as an intelligence agent. In fact, American intelligenceadmitted that Barbie is the only Nazi war criminal whose escape it aided.Although intelligence agents insist that they had nothing to do with him afterhe arrived in South America, the documents tell a different story. Barbie was sowell protected in Bolivia that he eventually became head of that country'ssecret service, at the same time that he was running arms117[part0010.html#chap6_fn117] throughout Latin America and financing assassinationsquads, in concert with Nazi forger and convicted murderer Freddy Schwend (seebelow). Indeed, more than anything else the Barbie case demonstrates that theneed to pursue Nazi war criminals transcends motives of revenge and justice forthe unspeakable atrocities of the Second World War: rather, it is clearly a veryreal and pragmatic need to isolate these unprincipled actors from the stage ofglobal politics. One historian has even suggested that Klaus Barbie had a rolein the creation of the Joe McCarthy phenomenon in the United States in the1950s: that secret American intelligence reports were leaked by Barbie to theanti-Communist Senator and firebrand.118 [part0010.html#chap6_fn118]The above-mentioned Eizenstat Report prepared by the Under Secretary ofCommerce, Stuart E. Eizenstat and released in May, 1997 seemed to exonerate theCIA from charges of actively aiding or abetting the escape of Nazi warcriminals, but it was an exercise in semantics and as such it was blasted byvarious members of the US government as well as by historians and journalistswho had lived with the material for decades. A General Accounting Officeinvestigation on Nazis and their collaborators working with Allied intelligenceadmitted that the difficulties inherent in conducting this type of investigationat CIA made their conclusions rather open-ended. According to the GAO Report,while the investigators were “not denied access to any documentsrequested…intelligence agencies often assign projects innocuous names which donot reflect the projects' purposes and, therefore, we cannot assure that werequested all relevant projects' files…. we cannot be completely sure that wehave obtained all relevant information or that we have identified all Nazis andAxis collaborators assisted by US agencies to immigrate to the UnitedStates.”119 [part0010.html#chap6_fn119]Between the GAO Report and the Eizenstat Report, much was revealed but much moreremained concealed. They show that the actions of the so-called “neutral”countries were critical in supporting the Nazi regime, both during and after thewar. That meant that Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Turkey and Argentina—amongother nations—were financially involved with Nazi swag even after 1945. WhileSwitzerland is, perhaps, the most famous culprit in the case of the missing Nazigold, other countries were enthusiastically hording and transporting the Reich'sill-gotten gains across borders and across oceans.According to the Eizenstat Report:In considering the actions of the neutrals, three phases can be identified:images [../images/00026.jpeg] During the first phase, from the outbreak of warin 1939 until the battle of Stalingrad in early 1943, German military prowesswas such that there was a legitimate fear of imminent invasion.images [../images/00026.jpeg] In the second phase, the tide of battle shifted inthe Allies' favor and culminated in victory. Beginning in mid-1943 with theAllied invasion of Italy, the D-Day invasion in June, 1944 and the diversion ofGerman forces to halt the Soviet Army's advance, the Nazi occupation of Europewas rolled back and the threat to the neutrals greatly diminished, althoughthere were still fears of other forms of reprisal. Commerce with Germany,however, continued. German assets in neutral countries were not frozen, despiteAllied requests and warnings. The neutrals continued to profit from theirtrading links with Germany and thus contributed to prolonging one of thebloodiest conflicts in history. During this period, the Allies suffered hundredsof thousands of casualties and millions of innocent civilians were killed.(emphasis added)images [../images/00026.jpeg] In the third phase, the immediate postwar period,the neutrals disputed the legality of the Allied request to control Germanassets; often denied they had any looted Nazi gold; defended their commercialinterests; dragged out negotiations with the Allies; and eventually pressedtheir own claims for restitution against Germany. In contrast to the otherwartime neutrals, Sweden was relatively forthcoming in terms of the extent andpace of its cooperation in transferring Nazi gold and other assets to the Alliedpowers. Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Turkey and others continued to resistcooperation even though the War was over.120 [part0010.html#chap6_fn120](emphasis added)Safe Haven, Stay Behind, and SalzburgOne of the Allied operations designed to ferret out Nazi bank accounts and othersources of Nazi wealth was called Operation Safehaven. This was an OSS projectrun by Allen Dulles out of his Berne, Switzerland office. Ostensibly, the ideabehind Safehaven was to deny the Nazis “safe haven” for their ill-gotten gains.It was designed to discover hidden sources of wealth and identify theirprovenance. The rationale behind Safehaven was to ensure that financialresources would not be available to enable a resurgence of the Third Reich,something that evidently worried Allied intelligence. This was connected totheir concerns about the National Redoubt: an almost-mythical undergroundfortress where dedicated Nazis would hide and conduct a rear-guard actionagainst the Allies. Declassified OSS and MI6 files show that details of this“Stay Behind” operation as it was known kept surfacing through informants andprisoners of war who were being interrogated about its existence.There was already something in place known as the Werewolves. These were loneNazi loyalists believed to have been left behind to conduct guerrilla operationsagainst the Allies. While considered largely a myth perpetrated by Goebbels andother Nazi propagandists, there was still the danger that something likeWerewolf could exist. The Ustashe had a similar program in place, a group knownas the Krizari or “Crusaders” that actually was active in anti-Communistpartisan activity in Yugoslavia after the war. If they (or the Werewolves) hadaccess to millions of dollars in Nazi gold, then there was a very realpossibility of a protracted guerrilla campaign in Europe. Hitler himself hadpersonally authorized the evacuation of the Berlin Reichsbank reserves to asecret location in the Alps in 1945 specifically in order to finance a FourthReich. These reserves were never fully recovered.121 [part0010.html#chap6_fn121]The center of all of this clandestine activity was not Berlin or Hamburg, butlower Bavaria, the Tyrol, and Austria. This is where we find the Pöch couple atthe war's end. It's also where the Ustashe had its headquarters at the sametime; where Father Draganovic was active; and where so many Nazi war criminalsmade their way in the last days of the war and for months thereafter. It is thisregion of the disputed Tyrolean Alps—sometimes Italian, sometimes German—thatwas a hotbed of Nazi intrigue, Soviet espionage, and militant Catholic activismin 1945-1947. It deserves a closer look.Hitler was a native of Austria, not Germany. In fact, he came from a region tothe north of the city of Salzburg. Salzburg figures prominently in our story,for it is where we first find the Pöch couple after the war.The US Army intelligence unit known as the CIC had an office in Salzburg, and itwas this office that gave the Pöch couple problems in 1945-1946, according tothe diary found in Indonesia. Long before the CIC arrived in Salzburg, however,the region was famous for a variety of reasons.Known to music lovers as the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and the siteof an annual music festival devoted to him and other classical composers, and asthe setting for The Sound of Music (based on the real life story of a Salzburgnun), it nonetheless has other, less savory, associations. Austria had a largeNazi presence even before it was formally annexed to the Greater German Reich.Although the Nazis were banned in Austria in the days before the Anschluss,underground elements of the SS and the SD were active there and included suchnotorious figures as Ernst Kaltenbrunner and Artur Seyss-Inquart. Once the warwas underway and Germany seemed unstoppable, the leaders of the Third Reichbuilt country homes in the region. Hitler's fortress hideaway—the Eagle'sNest—is in Obersalzberg, not far from Salzburg itself in a region of lowerBavaria and close to the town known as Berchtesgaden. Goring had a home in theneighborhood, as did Martin Bormann. According to recently declassified OSSfiles, Salzburg was also believed to be the location of the headquarters of theUstashi by 1944.122 [part0010.html#chap6_fn122] Even more arresting, Salzburgwas also believed to be the center of the mysterious “Nazi Redoubt”: a vastunderground complex where the Nazis would regroup and continue to fight the warlong after the formal surrender.The Reich's Last StandAs soldiers of the Reich…it is our holy duty to exhaust every possibility. Thisis the only chance of success that remains. It is your duty and mine to takeit.—Adolf Hitler to Hanna Reitsch on mustering all remaining Luftwaffe aircraftto assist in the defence of Berlin.123 [part0010.html#chap6_fn123]A recent reliable report of an eyewitness gives evidence of the construction ofan “inner fortress” position within the reduit area…; the construction offortifications is reported on a line running around the mountain massif to theSW of Salzburg…This line of fortifications includes Berchtesgaden, but omitsSalzburg and Hallein which lie to the NE and E. There is a slight puzzleinvolved in the recent reports of large quantities of material being unloaded tothe east of this fortress position…for storage in the endless caverns which lieto the SE of Salzburg…124 [part0010.html#chap6_fn124]In the last months of the war, great credence was given to French intelligencereports and other sources that claimed that the Nazis had created a vastunderground fortress in order to continue the fight against the Allies. Theregion around Salzburg was riddled with salt mines and quarries, excellenthiding places, and the Mauthausen concentration camp itself had createdunderground complexes for the manufacture of parts for the Messerschmit aircraftas well as the V-2 rockets. If one were to create an underground city, one couldthink of worse places especially as so many tunnels, caves and mines had alreadybeen dug in the region.125 [part0010.html#chap6_fn125]Estimates of the size of this mysterious fortress varied widely, from theability to support 25,000 men for one year up to 60,000 men for a period of twoyears!126 [part0010.html#chap6_fn126] It was believed that this fortress—calledvariously a Redoubt or a Reduit—would be the center “for directing theactivities of the pro-Nazi and Fascist elements in all European countries, andparticularly Germany…The chief aim will be division of the Western Allies andliberated countries from Russia in the hope of reasserting Nazi doctrine andinfluence.”127 [part0010.html#chap6_fn127]This is, of course, exactly what happened. The Western Allies did, indeed,separate from the Soviet Union by 1947 when the Cold War began. At the sametime, Germany began a slow recovery using former Nazis in positions of influenceand power in industry, economics and politics. The activities of pro-Nazielements throughout Europe continued long after the war's end, and theseelements spread out from Europe to infect Latin America and the Middle East aswell. Nazi doctrine and influence was reasserted in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile,Paraguay, Egypt and Syria as well as among the displaced persons in NorthAmerica who owed their allegiance to any anti-Communist organization thatpromised them a return to their homelands once the Soviet Union was destroyed.Historians dismiss the wild stories about the Nazi Redoubt as so much propagandacreated by Goebbels and his department. There may be much truth to thisassertion since, indeed, no physical Redoubt was ever discovered. However, theflight of Nazi personnel and capital from Europe to Latin America and elsewhereafter the war via a network of safe houses, banks, political organizations andreligious groups implies that at least a “virtual Redoubt” did, indeed, existfor the aims of that mission were largely accomplished.128[part0010.html#chap6_fn128] And the center of this Redoubt was in the areaaround Salzburg in a circle that extended to the Austrian Tyrol…exactly wherethe Ratline originated. It is where many Nazi war criminals fled as Berlin fell,including Hitler Youth leader, Artur Axmann, as well as Mengele, Rauff,Eichmann, and so many others. It is also where Hitler's favorite test pilot, theenigmatic and energetic Hanna Reitsch, flew when she left Berlin with the newlyappointed head of the Luftwaffe, General von Greim.Hanna Reitsch, the True BelieverMein Fuehrer, why do you stay? Why do you deprive Germany of your life? When thenews was released that you would remain in Berlin to the last, the people wereamazed with horror. ‘The Fuehrer must live so that Germany can live,' the peoplesaid. Save yourself, Mein Fuehrer, that is the will of every German.129[part0010.html#chap6_fn129]—Hanna ReitschAfter the war, the celebrated Nazi test pilot, Hanna Reitsch, would wind up inSalzburg, as did her commander General Robert Ritter von Greim (who committedsuicide shortly thereafter while in American custody in that city). Many assumedReitsch had flown Hitler out of Berlin but it was Reitsch herself who dismissedthe idea that Hitler had escaped; yet, at the same time, it was Reitsch who haddestroyed valuable communications in the form of letters from Walter Hewel,Martin Bormann and even Eva Braun on her own volition, regardless of thehistorical or intelligence importance of the letters or the fact that they mighthave supported certain elements of her story of the last days in the Berlinbunker.Hanna Reitsch (1912-1979) was Germany's most famous test pilot, having beenawarded the Iron Cross with diamonds by Hitler himself, a medal she wore proudlyto the end of her days. While there is no evidence that she was ever a member ofthe Nazi Party, she was certainly a true believer. She had flown into and out ofbeleaguered Berlin in the last days of the war when such a feat was thoughtimpossible; but since her Fuhrer had requested it, she had no thought but toobey. Like Otto Skorzeny, she was a daredevil and an expert pilot. Also likeSkorzeny, she was a devoted Nazi.Much has been made of her report of Hitler's last days. Trevor-Roper madesubstantial use of her “testimony” in his report, something that Reitsch herselfhas criticized heavily, claiming that she never said or did the thingsTrevor-Roper claims she said and did. The summary of her interrogation by herAmerican captors has been declassified—all but one mysterious paragraph, number87, which was redacted—and it is more a lens into the mind of Hanna Reitsch thanit is a history of the last days of the war. She has since published a number ofbooks about her experiences, but there are several elements of her story thatresist logical analysis.As mentioned, she has been often identified as one of Hitler's possible escaperoutes out of Berlin. She certainly had the skills to fly Hitler anywhere inEurope. But when she was questioned about the possibility that Hitler was stillalive in the Tyrol and that she had flown him there:…she appears deeply upset that such opinions are even entertained. She saysonly, “Hitler is dead! The man I saw in the shelter could not have lived. He hadno reason to live and the tragedy was that he knew it well, knew it perhapsbetter than anyone else did.”130 [part0010.html#chap6_fn130]This is what is known as a “non-denial denial” among Watergate aficionados. Shespecifically does not deny that she flew him out of Berlin, only insists thatHitler is dead because he “had no reason to live.”According to her interrogation, she last saw Hitler on April 28 when he askedher and the newly promoted von Greim to organize the last-ditch aerial defenseof Berlin as well as the arrest of Heinrich Himmler for treason.131[part0010.html#chap6_fn131] It had been discovered that Himmler had attempted tocontact the Allies in order to arrange surrender, an attempt that was rebuffed.Hitler had already fired Goring as head of the Luftwaffe since he had received atelegram from the corpulent Air Marshall saying that he considered himself thenew leader of the German government absent any information that Hitler was stillalive or at liberty. Hitler therefore saw himself as abandoned and betrayed byhis closest comrades.Reitsch flew out of Berlin with von Greim and a package of letters on April 28,escaping through a fierce Soviet anti-aircraft barrage and, after several stopsto shore up resistance against the Russians and make contact with whatever wasleft of the Wehrmacht, eventually making it as far as Kitzbühel, about sixtykilometers south of Salzburg in the Austrian Tyrol. Von Greim had just been madehead of the Luftwaffe. Goring—apparently a morphine addict, among other colorfultraits—had remained in Berchtesgaden as Berlin fell, surrounded by the opulentfurnishings he had stolen from public and private collections throughout Europe,refusing to believe that Germany was lost. He eventually committed suicide whilea prisoner at Nuremberg.Reitsch, however, read the letters she had been entrusted to carry and decidedthat she would destroy some and simply not deliver the others. A letter from EvaBraun to her sister was destroyed as Reitsch felt it was too melodramatic andself-serving. Letters from Walter Hewel to the Foreign Office and from MartinBormann were also destroyed. We have only Reitsch's word as to the contents ofall of these documents. Her assumption of the authority to dispose of theseletters as she wished truly is astounding.Reitsch and von Greim were taken to Salzburg by the American authorities andReitsch spent eighteen months as a prisoner before being released. After a longand somewhat illustrious postwar career, she died—apparently a suicide—in 1979and was buried in Salzburg, an unrepentant Nazi to the end.An interesting aside to her interrogation by the American authorities relatesdirectly to the theme of the Nazi Redoubt. According to Reitsch, the plan wasstill being discussed as late as April 15, 1945132 [part0010.html#chap6_fn132]but it soon became obvious that it was too late to put it into effect at thatstage due to the deterioration of the military situation. In other words,according to Reitsch, the Nazi Redoubt actually did exist. It had been inpreparation, and meetings were still being held in the bunker as to the state ofits construction and organization as late as two weeks before the war's end. Theimplication is that the inhabitants of the bunker would not have been able toreach it due to the encirclement of Berlin by the Allies, but that it alreadyhad been in development for some time. This is in contradiction to otherintelligence reports, which cast doubt on the whole idea of an “inner fortress”in the Salzburg region. Either Hanna Reitsch was lying about the Nazi Redoubt,or she was telling the truth. If she was lying, why was she lying and what elsewas she lying about? If she was telling the truth, then the Allies were mistakenin their assumption that the Redoubt was nothing more than a propaganda ployconcocted by Goebbels. According to Reitsch, the Redoubt was at least “partiallycompleted” by April 15, 1945.Thus, in Salzburg we have a confluence of personalities and plots. The Ustashi,whose most famous Ratline member was Father Draganovic, the creator of themonastery route; the mysterious Nazi Redoubt, a virtual fortress for thepreservation of Nazis and Nazism after the war; the magnificent homes of theleaders of the Third Reich; the headquarters of the American forces in Austria;the CIC office responsible for the region; and the Pöch couple. In addition,there is one more aspect to the Salzburg region that requires mentioning for itbears directly on our case.Ernst Schäfer and the Inner Asia Research InstituteOne of the most peculiar departments of the SS was the Ahnenerbe, or “AncestralHeritage” research division. It was a hothouse of racial theories, crankanthropologists and eccentric archaeologists, mystics, rune scholars, anddevelopers of pseudo-scientific concepts concerning the nature of the cosmos,alternative energy sources, and the story of Atlantis. The SS-Ahnenerbe was thesoul of Nazism, for within its ranks could be found every type of academicdevoted to the core values of the Party. Scientific theories were made to fitthe ideological mold of race science, or Rassenkunde. As history wouldeventually reveal, some of the worst atrocities of the Third Reich took placeunder the aegis of the SS-Ahnenerbe and its leader—Wolfram Sievers—would beexecuted for war crimes.One of the strangest gaggle of academics within the organization was the groupdevoted to Tibetan research. Led by Ernst Schäfer, a small party of SS officerswho were also anthropologists mounted a historic expedition to Tibet in 1938.Various reasons were given as the mission of the expedition, but survivingdocumentation—including film footage—shows that Rassenkunde was certainly one ofits more important goals. Expedition member Bruno Beger, for instance, conductedanthropometric studies in Tibet, measuring the skulls of living Tibetans withcalipers and recording the data. Schäfer himself collected all manner of floraand fauna to take back to Germany, and also made a detailed study of thereligious rituals of the Tibetans. (He returned to Germany with a complete setof the Kangschur, the 108-volume sacred Tibetan scripture, as well as silentfilm footage of Tibetan rituals.)The idea of conducting anthropometric research in the field while simultaneouslyrecording the research on still and motion picture cameras owes a great deal tothe pioneering efforts of Rudolf Pöch, Hella Pöch's first husband. Yet, at thistime, there is no evidence that Schäfer and Pöch ever met although Schäfer wouldalmost certainly have been familiar with her work, and the work of her latehusband. The overall mission of the SS-Ahnenerbe was to discover evidence toprove Nazi race ideology through various means. One of its contributions to theReich was the development of race tests that would identify people who were Jewsas well as Mischlinge, or “half breeds”: those with mixed Jewish ancestry. Thiswas one of the research goals of the Pöch couple in the Netherlands, as well asof the SS-Ahnenerbe in general and of Ernst Schäfer in particular during anexpedition to the Caucausus to ascertain whether or not the “Mountain Jews”133[part0010.html#chap6_fn133] were Aryan or in reality descendants of Jews whowere in diaspora from the time of the destruction of the First Temple.Bruno Beger, the anthropologist who conducted surveys in Tibet with Schäfer,would later go on to participate in the selection of human prisoners from thecamps for the creation of a skeleton museum. This macabre, mad-scientistendeavor was intended to demonstrate the anatomical differences between Aryansand Jews, and in order to be successful one had to have unblemished Jewishskeletal material at one's disposal. In order to accomplish this, Beger wouldselect those prisoners he felt best represented stereotypical Jewish traits.These prisoners would then be executed in such a way as to ensure there was nodamage to their crania or other skeletal structures. The bodies would then bemacerated—a process requiring several weeks of “de-fleshing” the bones—and theresulting skeletons would then be prepared for display.These activities were disrupted by the fast approach of Allied forces, and stepswere taken to hastily remove whatever traces of this hideous process there were;however, the Nazis were not entirely successful in covering their tracks formany bodies remained, at least one with its concentration camp tattoo intact.Eventually a trail of documentation would lead straight back to the Ahnenerbeand to Bruno Beger, a man who had met the Panchen Lama of Tibet and who hadspent months among the Tibetan Buddhists.Beger was eventually indicted for these crimes, but the charges were never ableto stick. He spent very little time in prison, and the rest of his life was amodel of academic repose. He remained on good terms with the Tibetans, and thereare extent photographs of Beger in audience with the current Dalai Lama. Forawhile, he even published a brief account of his admiration for the Tibetanpeople that was carried on the official Tibetan Government-in-Exile website,until taken down at the insistence of those who knew very well who Beger was andwhat he had done during the war.As the war progressed and it became obvious that the Allies would take hugechunks of Germany's empire—if not the whole thing— Himmler decided that theresearch of the SS-Ahnenerbe would have to take place in safer quarters. Themain office of the organization was moved out of Berlin, and Ernst Schäfer's ownoperation moved to Mittersill, a town in the state of Salzburg that was oncealso the site of a sub-camp of the infamous Mauthausen concentration camp. Itwas there that Schäfer continued his research in relative peace and quiet, abouttwo hours' drive from the home and office of Georg Anton Pöch in Salzburg.Archaeology was one of the main interests of the SS-Ahnenerbe. Naziarchaeologists were sent to the far corners of the globe in an effort todiscover traces of Aryan civilization. In the occupied territories,archaeologists working for the Ahnenerbe would simply seize those artifactsdeemed valuable to this research and they would wind up either at Ahnenerbeheadquarters or at Wewelsburg Castle, Himmler's sacred retreat. We know that theGerman Archaeological Institute was involved in some way with these activitiesbut until more work is done at the Institute's archives in Rome we will not knowthe whole story.Like his colleague Bruno Beger, Ernst Schäfer managed to escape any seriouspunishment for his role in the Ahnenerbe and lived to a ripe old age after moreexpeditions after the war in South America—principally Venezuela—beforereturning to Europe. Did the Pöch couple know Schäfer, especially after his moveto Mittersill? Was Schäfer (or another member of the Ahnenerbe) their connectionto the Deutsches Archaeologische Institut in Rome? Schäfer was successfullydenazified long before he left for Venezuela in 1950. What was the status of thePöchs?While the expected Werewolf guerrilla war never materialized, and the exactlocation of the legendary National Redoubt never identified, the money stolen bythe Nazis was used to help fugitives escape and also to prop up the Perónistregime in Argentina. Rather than finance a Nazi guerrilla war in Europe, Nazigold helped finance fascist dictatorships throughout Latin America and theMiddle East: regimes that utilized not only the stolen gold and other financialinstruments but also the expertise of the Nazi criminals themselves.We can take the case of Freddy Schwend as an example.Friedrich “Freddy” Schwend (1906-1980) claimed the rank of SS-Sturmbannführer(although he was probably not a genuine SS officer and held the rank as a kindof cover) but his real job was as the manager of something called OperationBernhard. Bernhard was the ambitious currency-forging project of the SS thatmanaged to create beautifully-crafted British pound notes as well as othercurrencies. The original mission of Operation Bernhard was the destabilizing ofthe world's currencies as part of the overall war effort, but in the end itfunctioned as a kind of slush fund for secret operations, using the forgedcurrencies rather than genuine money to pay off spies and bribe officials. Theforged currencies were also used to buy much needed raw material for the wareffort from neutral countries. Schwend conducted this operation from a villa inthe Tyrol that was surrounded by SS men, and which oversaw transport of theforged currencies by the truckload and trainload to other countries in Europe.The forgers themselves were Jews: concentration camp prisoners chosen for theirability as printers and engravers.By all accounts this was a very successful operation, and at the end of the warSchwend gave himself up to the CIC which “turned” him and used him as a doubleagent: first, in the location of stolen gold, currencies and artwork in a seriesof hiding places, mine shafts and safe houses throughout Austria and other partsof Europe, and then for counter-intelligence work under the code name “MajorKlemp,” and as code name “Flush” (for an operation created to “flush out” otherslike him in Italy). There is also evidence that Schwend was involved in Dulles'sOperation Sunrise, which ensured the peaceful surrender of SS and Wehrmachtforces in Italy.134 [part0010.html#chap6_fn134]Schwend's network of wartime safe houses was then used for the Ratline. The sameagents he had used to pass forged pounds sterling he now used to move SS men outof Europe. Operation Sunrise had presented the OSS with a considerable number ofSS officers who had cooperated with them in the orderly surrender, and who nowexpected special treatment in return. Dulles himself was notoriouslyanti-Communist and relatively relaxed when it came to Nazism; like the Vaticanand especially Pope Pius XII and his Secretary of State and future Pope PaulVI—Cardinal Pacelli—he saw the Nazis as a potential bulwark against theRussians.An underground network of SS officers, working for the Allies rather thanagainst them, would provide American intelligence with a ready-made spy networkin Eastern Europe. This would eventually become the infamous GehlenOrganization, run by Reinhard Gehlen who had seduced his captors with promisesof being able to penetrate Soviet intelligence and run operations behind Russianlines.In the meantime, Schwend proved his worth over almost two years of work with theCIC and the OSS, and several of these files are still classified to this day.Eventually, however, Schwend would realize that Europe was getting too hot forhim and he wound up using his own network to leave Europe and sail to SouthAmerica . He used the false identity of a Croatian national, with InternationalRed Cross documents courtesy of Father Draganovic, and fled with his wife toPeru in 1946. By the 1970s, however, Schwend found himself a wanted man again.The Italian government had demanded his extradition from Peru for the murder ofa man who had been trying to steal a quantity of the forged notes Schwend hadcreated: Schwend had shot him on the orders of SS strongman Ernst Kaltenbrunner.Schwend was eventually released from custody and spent the remaining months ofhis life in Peru, where he died in 1980…taking many secrets with him to thegrave. Reportedly, Schwend was deeply involved with Klaus Barbie and withBarbie's network of fascist murderers and arms dealers in South America andEurope who conducted assassinations as part of Operation Condor: thequasi-official agreement between the governments of Chile, Argentina, Bolivia,and Paraguay to seek out leftists and communist leaders and neutralize them“with extreme prejudice.” Agents of Operation Condor were responsible forassassinations and assassination attempts in Italy and Spain as well as in SouthAmerica, and in addition there were connections to the Italian Masonic lodge,Propaganda Due, or P2: the heavily-connected renegade Masonic association withmembers in the military, government, finance, media and the Church that wasinvolved in assassinations and money laundering in Europe with a view towardsresurrecting a Catholic, fascist dictatorship a la the Ustashe of Croatia.135[part0010.html#chap6_fn135]Schwend was not the only source of funds for the Ratline, of course. In additionto the gold and other valuables stolen by the Ustashe, there was a surgingunderground market in stolen art and artifacts from other parts of Europe.During the war, Hitler had decided to “repatriate” many of these artworks, whilehaving others stored in hidden places in cities like Nuremberg where the famousHapsburg Crown Jewels were taken from a museum in Vienna. But it is the strangestory of the German Archaeological Institute that brings us back to Georg AntonPöch.In 1946, the Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) of the OSS compiled a list ofpersons of interest who were implicated in the sack of public and private artcollections that took place under the orders of the Third Reich. This list hasgenerally not been consulted by those studying the ratlines as it is considereda separate issue entirely; however, the author's discovery of the Roman addressof the German Archaeological Institute in the Pöch diary suggested a closer lookat this list would bear fruit.As it turns out, no fewer than ten individuals who were officials of the GermanArchaeological Institute or otherwise connected appear on the OSS list. To quotedirectly from the list, they are:Crous, Dr Jan W. Librarian of the German Archaeological Institute in Rome (79via Sardegna). In August 1942 confiscated goods of the Czechoslovakian Institutein Rome. In March 1944 went to Alt Aussee to arrange for storage in the saltmine of objects from Rome.Curtius, Prof Ludwig. Director of German Archaeological Institute in Rome (79via Sardegna). Reported to have assisted Prince Philipp von Hessen in hisacquisitions for Germany.Deichmann, Prof Dr Friedrich Wilhelm. Head of Christian Archaeology Section ofthe German Archaeological Institute in Rome.Fuchs, Dr Siegfried. Deputy Director of German Archaeological Institute, Rome.Reported responsible for seizure of Czechoslovakian Archaeological Institute in1942, and for transfer to Germany of the Archaeological Institute and theHerziana libraries. Assisted by Dr Hoppenstedt. Reported to be SS Gruppenfuehrerand to have remained in Rome attached to the SD.Fuehrmann, Dr Hans. Chief, Photographic Section, German ArchaeologicalInstitute, Rome.Fulnmann. Official of the German Archaeological Institute, Rome. Reported tohave seized Czechoslovakian archives.von Gerkan, Prof Arnim. Director, German Archaeological Institute, Rome.Haas, Dr. (Rome). Member, German Embassy staff. Reported to have assistedmembers of the German Archaeological Institute in the transfer of works of artfrom northern repositories to Rome.Kupers (possibly Kupper). Reported in charge of administration of the GermanArchaeological Institute in Rome; probably participated in the plan to transferthe German libraries from Rome.Moellhausen. German Consul in Rome, reported to have worked with members of theGerman Archaeological Institute to protect Italian art treasures.As one can see, the above list includes two directors, a deputy director, andother officials of the Institute as well as a member of the German Embassy staffin Rome and the German Consul in Rome. This indicates that the Institute itselfwas involved deeply in the operation and that it was not merely one or two “badapples” trying to make extra money or win points with the Reich. Indeed, as wesee from the above OSS file Director Dr Siegfried Fuchs was himself believed tobe an SS Obergruppenführer and was also a member of the SD (Sicherheitsdienst,or Secret Service) in Rome. (He was also summoned to join the Waffen-SS by 1943when it appeared as if Rome were about to fall to the Allies who had landed inSicily.) Fuchs had been insisting that the archives and artifacts at theInstitute in Rome be evacuated; it seems his colleagues did not agree, but inthe end (by December 21, 1943) the evacuation of the Institute's holdings hadbegun and the property of the German Archaeological Institute in Rome had beentransferred to a salt mine at Bad Aussee,136 [part0010.html#chap6_fn136] about100 kilometers southeast of Salzburg. (The area around Bad Aussee and itsneighboring town, Alt Aussee, was where the Nazis had hidden a huge cache ofstolen art in the salt mines, including priceless Michaelangelo and Vermeerworks.) The Institute itself had strong links to the Ahnenerbe, and the twoorganizations had joined forces in order to compete with Alfred Rosenberg(1893-1946), one of the architects of the Reich's racial policies, who wantedhis own archaeological and anthropological institute.137[part0010.html#chap6_fn137]This is a tantalizing lead, courtesy of the Pöch diary. It adds anotherdimension to what we already know of the Ratline, for in addition to theUstashe, the SS, the CIC, the OSS, the Red Cross, and the Catholic Church we nowhave German academia in the form of the Archaeological Institute as another verypossible link in the underground network of escaping fugitives, moreoverfugitives with access to nearly unlimited funds in the form of priceless artobjects and archaeological artifacts. If we remember the looting of the BaghdadMuseum at the time of the second Gulf War, and of how many Sumerian, Babylonianand Akkadian artifacts made their way into the international market at thattime, we can imagine how easy it would have been in the days before computersand the Internet to hide, ship, and sell valuable paintings, sculptures, andancient religious objects to interested parties who had no scruples aboutprovenance in those unsettled and chaotic post-war days.In addition to the men listed above, there were many SS officers and artspecialists who were active in Austria and the Netherlands: the regions wherePöch and his wife were operating and, indeed, the Nazi thieves who wereresponsible for looting art from the Netherlands worked for Seyss-Inquart, thefriend of the Pöch couple from their days in Austria and later as they attemptedto work the Dutch camps over which Seyss-Inquart was the Reich's Commissioner.Amsterdam was a major European art center, and the Nazis lost no time inransacking both the museums and the private collections in Jewish hands forprecious objects to enhance the Reich's horde.One of those in charge of seizing Jewish property in the Netherlands was SSofficer Hans Fischböck, an aide to Adolf Eichmann and the Reich's financeminister in Holland under Seyss-Inquart. He was also a member of theFreundeskreis Himmler, along with Wolfram Sievers, Hjalmar Shacht, etc. and wasthus a close confidant of the SS leader. After the war, it was the indispensableFather Draganovic who signed his fraudulent Red Cross passport application.138[part0010.html#chap6_fn138] Fischböck assumed the name of Jakob Schramm and fledto Buenos Aires in 1951. This was the same year that the Pöch couple left Europefor the same destination. Fischböck arrived in Argentina in February, 1951, andthe Pöch couple at the end of that year.As noted in the previous chapter [part0009.html], the entry in the diary thatmentions the address of the German Archaeological Institute reads:Escape Organization. Mr. and Mrs. Oppenheim replacement. Krüger. Sardegna Roma79A/1. Expenses for travel to South America.This directly implicates the Institute as the “Escape Organization” and wouldseem to link two names—Oppenheim and Krüger—directly with it. Unfortunately, wedo not have the archives of the Institute at our disposal, something about whichother historians have complained.139 [part0010.html#chap6_fn139] However, thenames Oppenheim and Krüger do appear on the OSS list of “Red Flag” namesassociated with stolen art.The name Oppenheim appears as “Oppenheim, Jean. Paris, rue du Fbg St Honore.Small dealer. Dealt only with Bornheim.”140 [part0010.html#chap6_fn140] The nameKrüger appears several times, in different versions:Krueger, Oberst. Commander of 71st Infantry Regiment and member of GermanKunstschutz in Italy. Reported responsible for return of Oliveto deposit toFlorence and connected with attempted theft of the Cranach Adam and Eve.Krueger, Wolfgang. Berlin, Nikolassee, an der Rehwiese 4 Koelpinsee, InselUsedom, Pommern. Former director of Lepke auction house, Berlin who became anindependent dealer. Active as buyer in Paris. Used Schenker Co as shipper.Krüger, Mme. Paris, 53 ave Foch. Sister-in-law of Petrides.141[part0010.html#chap6_fn141] Reported to have hidden pictures he obtained fromthe Germans.As you can see, the three Krügers represent Italy, Germany and France and noneof them is linked directly to the Institute although all three could have usedthe services of the Institute to evaluate their thefts or to store them untilthey could be hidden in some other location. The first Krüger was a Wehrmachtofficer, but he was also a member of the German Kunstschutz, or “ArtConservation” group in Italy. He would have been the most logical of the threeKrügers to have been involved with the German Archaeological Institute duringthe war, and to have been involved in the underground networks after the war.As we noted in Chapter Five [part0009.html], there was also a Krüger working forthe mysterious Vianord travel agency in Buenos Aires, which arranged immigrationdocuments for fleeing Nazis. While Krüger is a relatively common German name, tohave come across it in two important locations—at the Institute whose addressappears in the diary, and at the other end of the Ratline in BuenosAires—suggests that we are on the right track with at least one of them. The onein Vianord is linked directly to SS officer Carlos Fuldner's leg of the Ratline.Both the Fuldner and the Draganovic links in the chain were operative in 1951,the year of the Pöch escape.The more one investigates the scraps of information contained in the Pöch diary,the more one is lead to a stunning conclusion: the couple identified as GeorgAnton and Hella Pöch were in the middle of a heretofore unknown andunacknowledged link in the escape system of Nazi war criminals, one thatincluded not only former SS officers and their supporters in the Catholic Churchand the intelligence communities of several nations—including the UnitedStates—but the governments of unaligned and “neutral” countries such asArgentina, Peru, Bolivia and Chile as well as the Arab nations of the MiddleEast. The threat of Soviet Communism was considered so dire and so immediatethat roughly half the world signed a pact with the Devil in order to thwart it.The cabal of SS officers, Ustashe war criminals, Latin American fascists andCatholic prelates was convinced that a third world war was imminent, and thatthey would be in a perfect position to exploit that opportunity to create anew—Fourth—Reich. The Nazis had lost their country and their Third Reich, but inanother sense they had won the war of ideas. They had convinced not onlydictators like Perón of Argentina and Stroessner of Paraguay of their usefulnessin this coming conflict, but could number seasoned American intelligenceofficials like Allen Dulles among the converted, as well as the generals runningOperation Paperclip. It was due to this unholy alliance that a vast network ofevil geniuses was allowed to expand throughout the world, poisoning everypolitical system with which they came into contact with the venom of fear.There is only one more link in this heavy chain of evidence, and that is therelationship between the fugitive Nazi networks and their collaborators in theMiddle East. It is a link that will further validate the information representedby the Pöch diary, if in a most unsettling way.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------115 [part0010.html#chap6_ft115] Dr. Milan Bulajic, “Jasenovac—work camp or thesystem of Ustasha camps of genocide?” in the Second International Conference ofJasenovac—System of the Croatian Ustashe genocide camps (1941-1945), Banja Luka(Bosnia and Herzegovina): 2000, p. 47116 [part0010.html#chap6_ft116] These countries included (but were not limitedto) Austria, Germany, Yugoslavia, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, Portugal,Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Syria, Egypt, and Turkey, as well as the UnitedStates, Canada and Mexico.117 [part0010.html#chap6_ft117] Barbie's involvement with the German munitionsfirm Merex AG—a firm wholly-owned by the Gehlen Organization which was itselfpart of the West German BND (secret service) and a collaborative effort withCIA—is well-documented.

Between the two of them theyarranged deals with the governments of Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia and Peru, attimes using Hans Rudel as a go-between. With Skorzeny, they also sold arms toSpain.

Allahu Akbar!—The first words of the daily call to prayer As the author writes these words, the Muslim call to prayer is reverberating outof a half-dozen loudspeakers on as many mosques. Preparations are being made totravel to Surabaya, the site of the last remaining synagogue in Indonesia aswell as the Islamic cemetery where Pöch is buried. The call to prayer tells usthat God is great, that there is no God but God, and that Mohammed is hisprophet. This happens five times a day, beginning in the early morning hourswhen the sky is still dark and the air is still cool. Islam is the faith of morethan one billion of the world's population, and Indonesia has the largestpopulation of any Muslim nation with roughly two hundred million of the faithfulon more than 17,000 islands, with the majority on Sumatra and Java.One of the dirty secrets concerning the flight of Nazi war criminals out ofEurope is the welcome they received by some of the governments of the MiddleEast who valued their expertise in military and intelligence matters, as well astheir ideological “purity” when it came to anti-Semitism142[part0011.html#ft142] and especially anti-Zionism, for the State of Israel wascreated in 1948: only three years after the end of the war, and with apopulation that was expanded considerably by Holocaust survivors. Thus, the“human terrain” of Nazis and Jews had shifted from the cities and ghettos ofEurope to the cities and villages of the Middle East. The Warsaw Ghetto was, ina sense, being recreated and re-erected in Palestine, only this time with wallsmade of tanks and cannons and with defenders who had already experienced theworst that humanity could throw at them and who were prepared to resist withbrute force.In the west, and particularly in post-9/11 America, this conflict is seenthrough a monochromatic lens. There is only black and white, us and them. Thisis further compounded by a general lack of knowledge concerning Middle Easternhistory and the critical role that the western powers played in the creation ofthe Arab states as we know them today. It was this involvement by the west thatled to the current political and military situation and contributed to the riseand growth of movements commonly referred to as Islamic fundamentalist. If theyare understood instead as anti-colonial movements they may be better understood.Perhaps. Although, now the time is long past when anyone can afford to makethese distinctions as life swiftly imitates artifice and all the players succumbto their own stereotypes and begin believing their own propaganda.The author has often declared that we are still fighting World War One. This isnowhere as obvious and as heart-breaking as in the Middle East. From the BalfourDeclaration to the Sykes-Picot Agreement, from the drawing of the boundaries ofIraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria to the British Mandate inPalestine…the major conflicts began with the first World War and the addleddecisions made by the victors in that conflict, already stunned by the hideousexcesses of the war and drunk on the fumes of blood and blinded by the glitterof treasure. It was World War One that gave Europe Adolf Hitler and the NaziParty. World War Two would bequeath that legacy to the Middle East.Arab nationalists and Islamic fundamentalists—including the groups associatedwith Al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiyyah and others— often point to the Crusades as anexample of western, Christian hostility against the Arab Middle East and againstIslam in particular. Normally, the historical precedent of Arab aggressiontowards Europe beginning in the eighth century CE (and thus three hundred yearsbefore the first Crusade) is often overlooked or ignored. The establishment ofthe Caliphate in what is now Spain and Portugal in the eighth century would lastfor more than seven hundred years until the last Islamic administration wasexpelled by King Ferdinand of Spain in 1492. Thus, the history of the Arab,Islamic Middle East and the history of Europe—western and eastern—is far morecomplex than jingoistic, shake-and-bake commentators and instant experts fromeither side would have us believe. It is a history of mutual hostility but alsoof cultural cross-fertilization. Islam gave the west much of ancient Greekscience and philosophy, for instance. It gave the west algebra and alchemy: bothwords themselves borrowed from the original Arabic.It is too easy to characterize Islam in terms of the Middle East alone. What isnot normally considered is the fact that North Africa and the Levant are soclose to Europe as to be neighbors, and that there is a long history ofinteractions between the two regions going back to before Solomon's Temple wasbuilt. There was Greek trade and cultural contacts in the Middle East longbefore Moses was born. Caesar's legions had traveled to Gaul and to Briton atthe time of Jesus, and there is an old tradition of Joseph of Arimathea takingthe child Jesus with him on a sales trip to what is now Cornwall in the BritishIsles. Whether true or not, the fact that such a tale could be believed is anindication of how deeply Europe and the Middle East were—and continue tobe—involved with each other.When it comes to Southeast Asia, however, the relationship changes considerably.The region was much too far away to be vulnerable to the type of militaryassault that typified the “missionary” activities of the Prophet and hisdescendants. Instead, the first contact many Asians had with Islam was in theform of trade.While Muslim armies conquered much of India, having spread east from Babylon andPersia, by the time they reached China and Indochina their resources were spreadvery thin. It was far preferable to conquer by persuasion than force. And thus,gradually, areas like Sumatra and Java began to consider Islam as another beliefsystem among the ones already in place, such as Hinduism and Buddhism as well astheir indigenous religions. Islam became dominant in what is now Indonesia aboutthe fifteenth century CE, at the time that the last Caliph on the throne ofGrenada in Spain was being ousted by Ferdinand. Today, native Indonesian Islamicgroups such as Jemaah Islamiyyah talk of establishing a Caliphate in the regionthat would extend from southern Thailand through all of Malaysia and Indonesiaand including the southern Philippine island of Mindanao. For the most part,however, this is a pipe dream of the fanatics for most of the Islamic world inSoutheast Asia has no interest in religious violence, in establishing shariyah,or in creating a Muslim state. Indonesia, for instance, is an example of amoderate, secular democracy that just happens to be predominantly Muslim.In 1945, however, the situation—both in the Middle East and in SoutheastAsia—was in danger of going another way altogether.The development and growth of what is usually called Islamic fundamentalism143[part0011.html#ft143] in the west is believed to have begun with the writings oftwo important ideologues, the first being Muhamad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab (1703-1792)and the second Sayyid Qutb (1906-1966). Abd-al-Wahhab is usually identified withthe movement that bears his name, Wahhabism, which became the official sect ofthe rulers of Saudi Arabia beginning in the nineteenth century and continuing tothe present day. Most Islamic scholars see Wahhabism as heretical for it insistson a strict interpretation of the Qur'an and the Hadith that is inconsistentwith generations of Islamic thought and practice. However, due to thepre-eminence of the Saudi kingdom in the Islamic world as the land of the twoshrines of Mecca and Medina and to the enormous financial contributions made bythe Saudis to Islamic communities all over the world, Wahhabism (sometimescharacterized as “petro-Islam”) and its intolerant ideology have become familiarto Muslims everywhere, if not actually embraced.Often confused with Wahhabism is the movement most identified with the Egyptianthinker Sayyid Qutb. Although not the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, Qutbwas this radical group's most prominent and outspoken member, a writer with akeen sense of the differences between western and Islamic thought and practice.A visitor to the United States in the 1940s, he was appalled by what heconsidered the crass materialism and loose morals of the American population. Hecriticized jazz as so much “noise”, looked in dismay upon the “indecent”awareness of the American woman of her physical beauty and natural powers ofseduction, and the “bestiality” of the “Negro.”One may say that both Abd-al-Wahhab and Qutb perceived that the Islamic worldhad lost its dominance in the world and even within its own territories. TheOttoman Empire had conquered much of the Middle East and North Africa and thecaliphates had all but disappeared from the face of the earth. In Wahhab's time,the enemy was the Turkish state; in Qutb's time, it was the secular Egyptianstate and its collusion with western countries and its relationship with westernideas. If Islam was not the dominant ideology in the Arab world, then it was thefault of Muslims who had become degenerate, complacent, and spiritually pollutedby foreign ideas and customs. In a sense, both Wahhab and Qutb were IslamicJeremiahs, pointing to the decay of their civilization and assigning the blameto the lack of piety and faith among their own people. This is not a newphenomenon, and it has been repeated in many countries over many centuries, withChristian fundamentalist preacher Pat Robertson blaming Hurricane Katrina onGod's wrath against homosexuals in New Orleans, and the earthquake in Haiti onvoodoo practitioners and their “satanic pacts,” as only two of many recentexamples.But before there was a Sayyid Qutb—executed by the Egyptian government in 1966for treason—there was a Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini(1897?-1974).Having begun his career working for the British during the first World War,al-Husseini became embroiled in the Arab nationalist cause during a riot in 1920in Jerusalem against the Balfour Declaration: the statement by a Britishstatesman guaranteeing a Jewish homeland in what was then known as Palestine.Once the Turks had been driven out of Arabia by the combined British and Arabarmies, the Arab leaders found themselves at the mercy of agreements andtreaties that had been negotiated between the European allies with virtually noArab representation or input and certainly no agreement by the Arabs themselves.The Balfour Declaration was one; the Sykes-Picot agreement was another.Signed in secret in 1916, this agreement between the British and the Frenchgovernments—with Tsarist Russia as a minor partner— carved up the Ottoman Empirebetween the two European powers. This was in addition to promises made by theBritish government to the Arab leaders that they would have independence oncethe Ottoman Turks were defeated. There were, in fact, so many conflictingpromises made that it is impossible to separate them and qualify theirrespective legal standings. In one case, the Arabs were promised the land ofPalestine and what is now Syria and Jordan144 [part0011.html#ft144]; in another,the Balfour Declaration, the Zionists were assured of their right to a homelandin Palestine so long as the rights of the non-Jewish population were protected.These two, both issued by the British government, are obviouslymutually-exclusive. With the addition of the secret Sykes-Picot agreement, thechaotic status of present-day Palestine and Israel was assured.It was within this heavily-charged atmosphere that Arab nationalism was born. Ithad begun with the revolt of the Arab tribes against the Turks during the FirstWorld War and extended to their rejection of the European treaties andagreements that decided their boundaries, their independence (or lack of it),and their political futures. It was the last gasp of European colonialism in theMiddle East: an attempt to create “independent” colonies that were nonethelesssubservient to European influence. The British and the French were in theposition of king-makers, with the rulers of the newly-created nations of Iraq,Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, etc. as mere puppets of foreign powers, ruling atthe pleasure of European politicians. This was nowhere more obvious than in the“British Mandate” of Palestine: the land promised by the British to EuropeanJews as their homeland.That there was anger directed towards the Europeans—and by extension, to thewest in general—due to this perceived betrayal of the Arab revolt is beyonddoubt. That this anger turned violent almost immediately was predictable. Andthe most tangible target of this violence was the proposed Jewish state inPalestine. In this way, Arab nationalism and anti-Zionism became closelyidentified in the minds of many people including the Arabs themselves. As thenotorious forgery known as the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion came tobe published in many languages at the end of World War One, this “proof” of aninternational conspiracy of Jews, bankers and Freemasons to control the worldironically found its best evidence in the Balfour Declaration and the BritishMandate in Palestine. It was the same Protocols that would convince Hitler andother Nazis of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy. As Hitler came out of the trenchesof World War One to find Germany decimated, “betrayed” by the bankers and theoligarchs, Haj Amin al-Husseini came out of the same war to find the Arab revoltsimilarly betrayed, and the lands of the Arabs similarly decimated, and by thesame Allied governments of England and France.It was probably inevitable then that these two men would meet. It would be 1941,and by that time Hitler had become the leader of the Greater German Reich, andal-Husseini would be the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. They would join common causeagainst the Allies and most particularly against the Jews. This would eventuallyresult in the establishment of another link in the Ratline, the Middle Easternsegment that saw the flight of SS and other Nazi specialists to Egypt, Syria,and Iraq where they would help prop up dictatorial regimes in the region bytraining the secret police in torture and interrogation techniques and indeveloping weapons of mass destruction such as ballistic missles and chemicaland biological agents.The relationship was curious, since the Nazis were true “anti-Semites”: that is,to the Nazi purists, both Arabs and Jews were members of an inferior race, theSemites, and were slated for destruction. Iranians might possibly be spared,since they were not Semitic peoples and were, by definition, “Aryan”. But, as inthe case of the Croats who were most assuredly Slavs and not much higher thanSemites in the opinion of the Nazi leadership, there was a pragmatic argument tobe made in their favor. By enlisting the Arab world in the struggle against theBritish and the other Allies, Germany could be assured of a warm welcome in theregion once they had been successful in crossing the Suez Canal and would nothave to worry about subduing the local populations who would, presumably,welcome them with open arms.Indeed, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem raised an army to support the Nazi wareffort. Called the SS-Handschar Division, it was composed entirely ofMuslims—mainly, but not exclusively, Bosnian Muslims—who were violently opposedboth to Communism and the Jews, and who conducted operations in Yugoslaviaagainst the partisans and the Communists. Thus, the circle became complete: froma shared hatred of the Allies to a shared hatred of the Jews, to raisingmilitary forces to combat both the Jews and the Communists, both the Nazis andthe Arab nationalists under al-usseini saw their fortunes rise dramatically andthen fall just as precipitously. With the end of the war, al-Husseini fled fromBerlin and made his way to Egypt along his own Ratline.He had a lot of company.According to declassified CIA files145 [part0011.html#ft145], there were anumber of high-ranking Nazi officers who made it to the Middle East and greaterglory in various capacities, including the intelligence services. Among thesewere the following:Franz Rademacher (1906-1973)—From 1937 to 1940, Rademacher served as a diplomatfor the German Foreign Office in Montevideo, Uruguay until recalled byRibbentrop to take charge of the Jewish question. It was Rademacher who came upwith the Madagascar Plan, which was a proposed project to deport all of Europe'sJews to the island of Madagascar…a plan which never materialized. Instead, hewas responsible for the executions of Serbian Jews as well as the deportation ofJews from France and the Low Countries to concentration camps in Poland. Afterthe war, he was arrested for war crimes against the Serbian Jews but escaped toSyria in 1952. At the time of the creation of the CIA document in 1958 thatmentions his name, he was living in Damascus as a businessman. He eventuallyreturned to Germany and died there in 1973.Paul Leverkühn (1893–1960)—a lifelong diplomat, spy, and banker, Leverkühn wasalso a devoted Nazi who joined the Party before the war began and who heldvarious important posts in Germany during both World Wars. He had an extensivebackground running Abwehr operations in Turkey, and according to the CIA reportreferenced above he also ran a spy network after the war “based on Lebanon andextending into the Middle East.” Leverkühn, for the benefit of those with aconspiratorial frame of mind, was also in attendance at the very firstBilderberger meeting in 1954, as president of the European Union.146[part0011.html#ft146] It should be pointed out that this meeting took place fouryears before the CIA report was written claiming that Leverkühn was runningagents in the Middle East.Johannes von Leers (1902–1965)—A nasty piece of work, von Leers was a rabid andunrepentant Nazi starting with his involvement in the Freikorps of post-WorldWar One Germany and extending to his membership in the Nazi Party beginning in1929. He was a propagandist who worked for Goebbels, and who eventually foundhimself working for Peron in Argentina before finally getting a job in Egyptwith the Nasser regime. He had a proficiency in five languages, and could speakand write both Hebrew and Japanese fluently. His seminal tract—”Judaism andIslam as Opposites”—provided the theoretical framework for a union between theNazis and their Muslim counterparts in anti-Semitism:As a religion, Islam indeed performed an eternal service to the world: itprevented the threatened conquest of Arabia by the Jews and vanquished thehorrible teaching of Jehovah by a pure religion, which at that time opened theway to a higher culture for numerous peoples…147 [part0011.html#ft147]He fled Germany for Italy and in 1950 went to Argentina where he worked for thepro-Nazi newspaper Der Weg. After a few years in Argentina, he went instead toEgypt circa 1954. A close associate of the Grand Mufti, al-Husseini, von Leerseventually converted to Islam and took the name Omar Amin. According to the CIAreport, he worked as a translator and language instructor for the EgyptianInformation Department. He died in Cairo—successfully fighting extradition forwar crimes—in 1965.One of the major war criminals to have made the Middle East a link in his ownescape was SS-Standartenführer Walter Rauff. We encountered Rauff earlier as theinventor of the mobile gas vans that were used to exterminate thousands of Jewsin Poland and elsewhere during the war. Although Rauff eventually wound up inChile, where he died peacefully after having successfully fought everyextradition attempt, his first port of call after the war was Syria.Rauff already had experience in the Arab world. During the war, he made a tripto Nazi-occupied Tunisia where he oversaw the liquidation of more than 2,000 ofthat country's Jewish population. He then flew to Egypt to negotiate theannihilation of Cairo's Jewish population as well as Palestine's Jewishcommunity—known as the Yishuv— with Field Marshall Erwin Rommel who opposed theproject. The plan was to take effect once the Nazis had seized the Suez Canaland occupied Palestine, and seems to have been the result of a deal reachedbetween the Mufti al-Husseini and Hitler. It is important to point out that—justas we saw with regard to the Gestapo in Java—the Nazis were intent onexterminating the Jews wherever in the world they could be found. This extendedto the Jews of North Africa and Palestine as well as to the Jews of SoutheastAsia. Holocaust deniers who claim that the concentration camps were not intendedto kill Jews and that the Jews who died there were victims of illness, etc. haveyet to respond to the mountain of documentation detailing the earnest efforts ofSS commanders to exterminate the Jews of other countries and even of othercontinents. They have also not responded to the fact of Rauff's mobile gas vansand the only possible purpose they served: mass murder.In the last years of the war, Rauff was stationed in Northern Italy where he wasin charge of Gestapo and SD operations in Turin, Genoa and Milan. He managed toescape the Rimini prisoner of war camp in December of 1946, and wound up inDamascus working for Captain Akram Tabara (alias Dr John Homsi) of the Syrianintelligence service. He worked in that capacity in Syria during the 1948Arab-Israeli war, and in 1949 he was hired as an “advisor” to newly-electedSyrian President Husni Za'im, but lost his job when a coup against Za'imsucceeded a few months later.Oddly, newly-declassified CIA documents show another side of Rauff (and of theRatline). It seems that while Rauff was employed by the Syrians he was alsoworking for British intelligence. He was sending copies of sensitive Syrianintel reports and organization charts to MI6 at the same time he was spying onJews for the Syrians. To make matters even more complicated, Rauff was alsoemployed by a mysterious agent known as Ted Cross (alias David Magen) who was anofficer of Israeli intelligence! Cross wanted to use Rauff to penetrate Egyptianintelligence circles, essentially following the CIA's use of former Nazis to spyon the Soviets. That Rauff did work for Cross and thus for the Israelis at thesame time he was working for the Syrians and the British, seems beyond doubt,and is partly based on a 1993 interview148 [part0011.html#ft148] with a branchdirector for the Israeli Foreign Ministry's Political Department, ShalhevetFreier, who admitted that he did, indeed, hire Walter Rauff to spy on Syrianmilitary and intelligence operations.When Rauff had to leave Syria in a hurry after the coup that ousted Za'im, hewound up first in Lebanon and then in Italy where he was sheltered by theChurch, specifically Bishop Hudal according to CIA reports149[part0011.html#ft149] and by the Archbishop of Milan Ildefonso Schuster150[part0011.html#ft150], and by the Israelis who helped him get the necessarytravel documents for South America as well.This was not the only instance of a known war criminal under protection of bothAmerican intelligence and the Israelis, however.In 1982, at a time when all hell was about to break loose concerning KlausBarbie and the Ratline, a seventy-two-year old man died of natural causes in ahospital in Sacramento, California. He had just surrendered his US citizenshipthe year before, over revelations of his role in the Holocaust. He appeared tobe a businessman with excellent credentials in Europe and Latin America. He wasa friend of American politicians and business tycoons, and one of the companieshe worked for—Trans-International Computer Investment Corporation—was said tohave done work for the Pentagon.But Baron Otto von Bolschwing had a past. He had been an SS officer, and was theman who encouraged a young Adolf Eichmann to become an expert in the “Jewishproblem.” He had enriched himself with money and other valuables confiscatedfrom the Jews, according to systems he himself had developed.He joined the Nazi Party in 1932 and almost immediately became an intelligenceoperative for the Third Reich. He served as a spy in Jerusalem until 1939,posing as a businessman and cultivating excellent contacts among both Arabs andJews. One of those contacts was Fieval Polkes, a commander of the Haganah: theJewish defense organization in the British Mandate of Palestine. Von Bolschwingarranged meetings between Eichmann and Polkes, as it was believed that therewere some common issues. The Nazis wanted the Jews out of Europe, and the Jewswanted the British out of Palestine. Polkes then agreed to provide the SS withintelligence on the British situation in Palestine in return for money as wellas cooperation in encouraging as many young Jewish men and women as possible toemigrate to Palestine.151 [part0011.html#ft151]Von Bolschwing was busy with other matters as well, such as his involvement withthe Romanian Iron Guard: the pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic paramilitary organizationthat was responsible for its own atrocities during the war. But it was thepost-war period that was kindest to the Baron, for he almost immediately—in thespring of 1945— began working for the CIC in Salzburg. As the Cold Warintensified, former SS-Hauptsturmführer von Bolschwing found himself workingfirst for the Gehlen Organization and then directly for the CIA, and it was theCIA that helped him emigrate to the United States in 1954 by disguising his Nazipast and his membership in the SS. Once in the US, he became involved in variousbusiness enterprises—including one with the Trans-International ComputerInvestment Corporation, which ended in a financial scandal in 1971.There is no question about von Bolschwing's role in developing the mechanisms bywhich the Jews lost first their property and then their lives. He was adedicated anti-Semite and a committed Nazi; but he was cultivated and protectedby American intelligence as one of its soldiers in the fight against SovietCommunism. Even his role as go-between for Adolf Eichmann and the Haganah raisesmany more questions than answers, but it is an educational and cautionary tale.This is a revealing example of how realpolitik created the Ratline. If even theIsraelis could knowingly and willingly employ a mass murderer like Walter Rauffwho was responsible for the extermination of upwards of two hundred thousandJews or more, or negotiate with a von Bolschwing or an Eichmann, then there canbe no wondering or surprise at the role of American and Britishintelligence—among others—in collaborating in the escape of men like Barbie,Mengele, Priebke, Eichmann, Stangl and so many, many others. If even Israelcould sign a secret pact with a devil like Walter Rauff, should anyone besurprised if one of the Allied governments (having proved themselves to behardly Jewish sympathizers or supporters) had arranged the escape of, say,Martin Bormann, equally as secretly, on pragmatic—if not entirelycynical—grounds?Or concealed—or even enabled—the escape of Adolf Hitler?In addition to Rauff in Syria, there were many other Nazis—some scientists, someSS-men with specialties in interrogation and torture—who wound up in Egypt.There were some eighty of these specialists working for the Egyptian Ministry ofWar in the late 1940s, busy developing the Egyptian war machine in order toprepare for the conflict with Israel.152 [part0011.html#ft152] In some cases,these were rocket scientists busy developing modifications of the V-2, designedto be used against Israel.153 [part0011.html#ft153]The flight of Nazis to the Middle East should be seen in the context of thetimes. Israel had been officially created on May 14, 1948 and immediately warwas declared on the new nation by all of its Arab neighbors. In 1948, theRatline was still very much in operation and Nazis were still escaping to SouthAmerica and elsewhere from safe houses—sometimes called “rat houses”—in Austriaand Italy. The war with Israel provided excellent opportunities for Nazimilitary and intelligence specialists who could combine their hatred of Jewswith their training of an enthusiastic population equally determined to destroytheir common enemy. It was less of an escape from justice than it was a lateralmove; a simple relocation from Europe to North Africa and the Middle East, butwith the same basic job description. For these men in particular, the war hadnot ended in April or May of 1945 but had simply moved a few miles south and, ifanything, had become more focused. The anti-Semitic project of the Nazi Partywas still in full swing; had the Arab nations been successful in theirdestruction of the State of Israel, the surviving SS officers would have countedthemselves redeemed. While Hitler's grand plan called for lebensraum and theensuing subjugation of Eastern as well as Western Europe to the forces of theThird Reich, the Final Solution was still an important (if irrational andmystically-grounded) goal. The Arab nations could not get Germany's territoriesback or restore the Reich; indeed, they had no interest in doing so. But theycould carry on the most cherished goal of the Nazis and most especially of theSS: the utter annihilation of the race they deemed to be humanity's greatestenemy.While the governments of Latin America were more interested in incorporating theNazis into their anti-Communist programs, the Arab nations saw the Nazis in adifferent light. The Nazis and the Catholic Church cooperated because theircommon, post-war enemy was the Soviet Union and her satellites; the Nazis andthe Arabs cooperated because they were ideologically similar on a much deeperlevel.Communism knows no race or national boundary; it is an international movement ofclass against class, of workers against the bosses regardless of ethnicity ornational origin. It is purely political, economic, materialistic and atheistic.Anti-Semitism, however, is based on the irrational, the unscientific, themystical. It is a war of race against race. Of blood against blood. The Nazisextended that conflict to other races: the Slavs, the Africans, the Asians, theNative American populations. All were inferior to the Aryan, represented by theGreater German Reich as well as by Scandinavia and, to a certain extent, GreatBritain. Nazism is not international, it is not materialistic in the same waythat Communism and Capitalism are materialistic. And it is definitely notatheistic.For all these reasons and more, the Nazis could make common cause with the Arabswho were largely Muslim and who had at least a theoretical basis foranti-Semitism. Citing a few inflammatory verses from the Qur'an concerning theJews, a new generation of Wahhabis and their fellow travelers—inspired by theGrand Mufti himself, al-Husseini—could see themselves fighting alongside themost famous anti-Semites in the world, men motivated by the same mysticalimpulses as they were; men who identified their movement with something larger,more transcendent, than the dictatorship of the proletariat or a workers'paradise. The Nazis were believers, and while their belief system did not matchthose of their Muslim collaborators, there were similarities.The Muslims believe in submission to God; the word “Islam” means “submission.”The Nazis believed in the Fuhrer Principle: complete obedience to the Fuhrer andto his representatives. The Nazis never placed the rights of the individualabove that of the community, and certainly not above that of the Fuhrer, God'srepresentative on earth. Both the Muslims and the Nazis yearned for the past:the Muslims, for the glories of the Caliphates that had ruled the Middle East,India and even parts of Europe for centuries; the Nazis, for a glorious past inthe distant mists of ancient history, when Teutons fought the armies of theCaesar and even further back, when the pagan gods were still worshipped withfire and sword. The Nazis saw the Jews as both an ancient enemy and a currentone; so did the Arabs, and for almost the same reasons. To both, the Jews werean alien race bent on world domination. To the Nazis, the Jews represented thefaith of a demonic god who masqueraded as the Creator of the universe. More thanthis, their very blood was a poison. It was not simply a matter of a beliefsystem that was wrong or hateful in some way: it was the very existence ofJewish blood, of Jewish genetics, that threatened the spiritual as well as thephysical life of the world. A Jew could conceivably convert to Islam and bespared; but a Jew could not convert to Aryanism and be spared by the Reich.So men like Walter Rauff and SS-Haupsturmführer Alois Brunner (1912-1996?) couldfind sanctuary in the Middle East. Brunner had been in charge of massdeportations of Jews in various European countries as the personal emissary ofAdolf Eichmann. After the war, Brunner claimed that he worked for awhile for theUS military (possibly with the Gehlen Organization, the espionage facilitycreated by the CIA out of former Nazis to spy on the Soviet Union) and then fledfirst to Rome, using the same Catholic Church connections as his colleagues, andthen to Egypt where he worked as an arms dealer and finally to Syria where hefound employment with the regime as an interrogation (i.e., torture) expert.Brunner was so confident in his status that he gave interviews to magazines andnewspapers from his home in Damascus as lat as 1985 154 [part0011.html#ft154]and 1987 155 [part0011.html#ft155]. The fact that the various Syrian regimesfrom 1954 to the present—including the Assad regimes—would protect him for solong is an indication that he had proved his usefulness in some way thatpermitted him to outlast the various political storms that beset that countryover the last fifty years. This was either due to his particular expertise invarious military and intelligence areas, his connections with the worldwide Nazinetwork, or possibly also to an infusion of Nazi gold to bribe his way intosecurity. Unfortunately, the German government has destroyed its files on AloisBrunner and unless something surfaces from the current political turmoil inSyria (or from US intelligence files, particularly those of Allen Dulles and theOSS) we may never know the truth.The entire history of Nazi-Arab collusion is too long and complex to go intodetail here. We have seen the basic elements, however, and understand that therewas a natural alliance between the Nazis and the Arab nationalists both duringand for many years after the war. This alliance is still nurtured. Hitler'sautobiography and political manifesto, Mein Kampf, is always in Arabictranslation and easily available everywhere in the Arab world, as is theProtocols of the Learned Elders of Zion (a notorious hoax which is nonethelessaccepted as fact by many readers). There are close connections between neo-Nazimovements in Europe—particularly in Austria—and terrorist groups such asAl-Qaeda. While these groups could conceivably turn on each other eventually,for now the immediate threat is the existence of the state of Israel and theperceived “global Jewish conspiracy.” This is a theme that has been picked up asfar away from the battlegrounds of World War Two as present-day Southeast AsiaWhen the Asian Economic Crisis occurred in 1997—the crash of Asian currenciesthat contributed to the fall of Indonesia's dictator Soeharto in 1998 during theReformasi movement—Malaysia's then Prime Minister, Mahathir Muhammad, blamed iton George Soros and a cabal of international Jewish bankers considered to bepartners in a conspiracy to destroy the developing economies of Southeast Asia.That a national leader and Muslim statesman in 1997 could make such a claimdemonstrates that the theory of “a global Jewish conspiracy” is still very muchwith us, regardless of how often that theory is exploded by reference to thefacts. Later, Indonesia's Soeharto would make the same claim when asked abouthis fall from power in 1998.This is a charge that sits well with the more radical Muslims of Southeast Asiawho, like their Arab counterparts, seek a scapegoat to blame for their lack ofpower and economic parity with the west. However, Malaysia could hardly beconsidered an economic backwater and young Malaysian Muslims have opportunitiesand access to power and resources that far exceed those of their co-religionistsin the Arab world. Indeed, Mahathir had called for Malaysia to become acompletely developed nation by the year 2020, putting it on par with itsneighbor, Singapore. He had invested billions of dollars in major infrastructureprojects, such as the new Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the Kuala LumpurCity Center (with the tallest buildings in the world at that time), and theCyberjaya and Putrajaya projects which promised a complete high-speedfiber-optic network in the capital city. Malaysia was hardly a “third world”country in 1997, yet Mahathir felt justified in blaming the crash of hiscountry's currency on the Jews. Indonesia, while not as economically advanced asMalaysia at the time was still in a relative position of strength when thecrisis began with a large trade surplus. Unfortunately this led toover-borrowing by Indonesian corporations in US dollars and as the Indonesiancurrency slid the debt position of these corporations rose considerably, leavingIndonesia to suffer as the rupiah lost more than 80% of its value (compared withthe Malaysian ringgit which lost 39% of its value). This put Soeharto's thirtyyear regime in danger. People took to the streets in revolt against the risingprices, the corruption and impotent yet dictatorial powers of their government.The International Monetary Fund made humiliating demands on Indonesia in returnfor aid in propping up the econony, and this (among many other issues) inspiredthe Reform movement that toppled Soeharto and ushered in an era of democracy,pluralism, and free elections. Yet, Soeharto could still blame an internationalJewish conspiracy for his country's problems.We have seen that there is a precedent for this reaction in Southeast Asia. Theexistence of a Nazi Party in Indonesia and the collusion of rebel leaders likefuture Indonesian president Sukarno with the Japanese invaders and their Germanpartners would seem to indicate that there was already a degree of anti-Semitismin that country. This would be a mistake, however. The Nazi Party recruited itsmembers from among the European expatriate community and not from the localIndonesians themselves. Sukarno is acknowledged to have cooperated with theJapanese for purely pragmatic reasons: they would help him ensure that the Dutchwould finally lose their Indonesian colony after 350 years of dominance in theregion. Sukarno made several speeches during the war that praised Japan and theAxis powers, but there is no evidence to show that he harbored genuine pro-Nazior anti-Semitic sentiments.In recent years, however, attempts have been made to show parallels betweenSukarno and Hitler. Both were dictators; both had delivered their respectivecountries from oppressive circumstances and both had challenged the Europeanpowers of Great Britain and the Netherlands, as well as of the United States.Both were skillful orators who understood the power of the spoken word and thetheatrical gesture. Both saw the Japanese as their allies. And neither man wasafraid to stand up to the entire world in order to raise his country's profileon the global stage.In 1945, with the surrender of the Japanese forces in the region, theopportunity came for Sukarno to force the hand of the Dutch. The Japanese hadpromised Indonesia its independence, and declared it on their way out of thecountry. Sukarno raised his forces to begin the struggle against the Dutch whowere coming back to reclaim their “territory.” Thus would begin years of armedstruggle until finally Indonesia was recognized by the world as an independentcountry.During that immediate post-war period, however, Sukarno had problems not onlywith the Dutch but with violent political parties in Sumatra and Java that had adifferent agenda. While Sukarno saw Indonesia as a secular state—and was accusedof flirting with Communism as well—there were those in his country who wanted tocreate an Islamic government. This tension between secular and sacred agendascontinues to this day and there will always be those in Indonesia who desire thecreation of a khalifa or Caliphate in the region. In some cases—such as theJemaah Islamiyyah organization of fundamentalist firebrand Abu BakrBa'ashir—this Islamic struggle takes on pronounced anti-Semitic contours.As in the Arab world, Mein Kampf is available in Indonesia in local translationas well as a number of conspiracy-oriented books that emphasize the idea of aglobal Jewish conspiracy. Many of these books would be familiar to anyone whohad read similar conspiracy literature in the United States, or in the MiddleEast. Henry Ford's International Jew is also readily available (usually pairedwith an Indonesian language translation of The Protocols of the Learned Eldersof Zion), and the prestige associated with the name of Ford lends additionalcredibility to the famous American inventor's anti-Semitic ravings.But in 1954, the year the mysterious Georg Anton Pöch and his equally enigmaticwife Hella arrived in Indonesia, the country was still in the grip of sectarianstruggles, political intrigues, violent confrontations, and the constantlylooming threat of either a Communist or an Islamicist takeover. Of one thing thecouple could be sure, however: there were virtually no Jews at all in Indonesia.More than Argentina—which had a sizeable Jewish population—or any other countryin the western hemisphere, for a Nazi war criminal in 1954, Indonesia could beconsidered one of the safest places on earth.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------142 [part0011.html#fn142] The author would like to point out, unnecessarilyperhaps, that the term “anti-Semitic” is problematic for the word “Semite” canapply equally to Jews and Arabs (although not to Iranians). However, in commonusage the term “anti-Semite” refers to bias and prejudice concerning Jews and israrely, if ever, used to describe anti-Arab sentiments.143 [part0011.html#fn143] The author is aware of the inadequacy of this term.There is a tendency to equate fundamentalism with fanaticism or even terrorism;however, most Christian fundamentalists (who consider themselvesfundamentalists) would strongly deny that they are fanatics or terrorists, andwith reason. Thus, the linkage between Islamic “fundamentalism” and terrorism iscontrived and counter-productive, even it serves as a kind of journalisticshorthand. Some authors have suggested the use of “scripturalist” to replace“fundamentalist”, but this author finds that term awkward and equally misleadingin this case.144 [part0011.html#fn144] A letter dated October 24, 1915 (only declassified in1964) by Sir Henry McMahon of the British Foreign Office to Sherif Hussein ofthe Arab revolt, guaranteeing that Palestine was within the boundaries of theindependent Arab state that was being promised in return for the Sherif'sassistance against the Turks.145 [part0011.html#fn145] See the recently (2000, 2005) declassified CIA fileEGMA-32934, dated March 19, 1958 regarding “UPSWING Near Eastern Connections”.UPSWING was the code name given by the CIA to the West German intelligenceservice, the BND, which at the time was being run by former Nazi intelligenceofficer Reinhard Gehlen.146 [part0011.html#fn146] It should be noted that the first Bilderberger meetingwas organized by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands who (as we have seen) hasbeen accused of harboring Nazi sympathies.

Declassified documents reveal that there was noconsensus among the Allies as to the fate of the century's most infamousdictator, even after Hugh Trevor-Roper's report and insistence that the Führerdied an ignominious death in Berlin.157 [part0012.html#ft157] Stalinconsistently declared his belief that Hitler was still alive, and possibly beingharbored by the Allies to use as some kind of weapon against the Soviet Union.Historians usually take Stalin's statements to be a propaganda move, an attemptto discredit the capitalists in the eyes of the world or to make theirintelligence services waste valuable time and resources on a wild goose chase;but as we have seen there is no forensic evidence at all to prove that Hitlerdied in the bunker and the Nazi prisoners in Russia gave so many conflictingstories about the “last days” of Hitler that it was impossible to take any oneof them seriously. Thus, it is entirely possible that Stalin was sincere in hisbelief that Hitler survived or could have survived. He was sincere enough tohave convinced General (and later U.S. President) Eisenhower of thepossibility.158 [part0012.html#ft158]Stalin suggested that Hitler had either wound up in Spain or in Argentina, orpossibly had gone to Argentina from Spain. As we have seen, so many Nazis wereusing that particular escape route as to make Stalin's theory entirely plausibleon its face. That Stalin would have known about—or suspected—the Ratlineestablished by Carlos Fuldner in Spain, or had somehow divined that the Naziswould make use of their U-boat facilities, the Etappendienst, for this purposeindicates that at least Soviet intelligence was onto the Nazi escape plans.Stalin also suggested that the Allies had Hitler in their possession and thatthey were waiting to use him to rally Germany against the Soviet Union. Again,as we have seen, the Allies most assuredly did have numerous Nazis on theirpayroll or kept “on ice” in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America so as tomake that theory equally plausible. The fact that the American FBI, the CIC, theOSS and eventually the CIA would all take these rumors and scenarios seriouslyindicates that no one was especially secure in the Trevor-Roper fiction.159[part0012.html#ft159] Of course, there was no corpus delecti and thatcontributed to everyone's unease about the fate of Hitler. This is especially sodue to the inescapable fact that the entire Goebbels family was found withrelative ease in the craters outside the Berlin bunker. Why, then, did thebodies of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun escape discovery?A review of declassified FBI files on Hitler's escape reveal some extremelydetailed reports of Führer sightings in Latin America, from Colombia toArgentina. Some are rather convincing, while others seem fanciful. We shouldremember that sightings of Elvis Presley are also plentiful, and that peoplereport the oddest things to the authorities…and to the tabloid press. However, alook at some of these sightings will prove educational, particularly as Americanintelligence agents as well as the mainstream media at the time took some ofthem seriously.The rumor that Hitler had not died in the bunker began with a remark made byStalin on May 26, 1945 in a meeting with Averell Harriman, Russian languageinterpreter Charles Bohlen and U.S. presidential advisor Harry Hopkins at theKremlin. During this meeting, Stalin stated that he believed Hitler was stillalive and had escaped Berlin entirely and was living “somewhere in the West.”The official CIA version of this story160 [part0012.html#ft160] claims that itwas the beginning of a Soviet disinformation campaign, but the CIA has no proofof this.At the Potsdam Conference—attended by Churchill, Stalin and Truman on July 18,1945—Stalin once again made the statement that Hitler was still alive andprobably in Spain or Argentina. This insistence by Stalin on Hitler's fate wasbeing made at the same time that SMERSH was busy burying and digging up whatthey believed was Hitler's corpse no less than four times, and during whichSoviet intelligence had numerous Nazis in custody whom they were subjecting tomerciless torture and “enhanced interrogation” techniques to determine Hitler'swhereabouts.As part of the FBI file on Hitler, there are numerous newspaper clippings (mostsadly undated and without further publication data) which demonstrate the depthof public skepticism concerning reports of Hitler's death in the bunker. Theyoften contain interesting information on matters tangential to Hitler's fate andare worth considering here.One such article, entitled “Hitler Mystery Deepens as Other Nazi Leaders MakePleas to Live” by John F. Sembower dates from a time before the Nuremberg trialshad begun in November, 1945. It contains the prophetic sentence:…the chances are that for years to come there will be persons all over the worldwho will report that they saw him alive after the fall of Berlin, that he gotaway and lived out his natural life.Concerning the burning of Hitler's body, Sembower goes on to write:Many of the world's greatest criminologists are on the hunt. They doubt thestory of Hitler's chauffeur who contends that he burned the bodies of Hitler andhis mistress Eva Braun, with a can of gasoline in a shallow trench outside thechancellery.…Ninety-two charred and broken bodies were removed from a mass gravenear Hitler's bunker…They were subjected to much worse destruction than burningwith gasoline, yet the remains were sufficiently identifiable to convinceexperts that none were those of Hitler and Eva Braun.Speculating as to how Hitler may have escaped, Sembower quotes an un-named“Japanese navy staff officer” who:…told details of a plan to evacuate Hitler and Eva Braun to Japan after the fallof Germany, and that a large Japanese submarine embarked on the enterprise.Nothing further was heard of the submarine, according to the Jap. [sic] At thesame time, some of the huge German U-boats are still unaccounted for.…That there may have been considerable submarine traffic between Germany andJapan was indicated by the interception last July of a Nazi U-boat Japan-boundwith a $5,000,000 cache of mercury and other valuables sorely needed by the Japsfor a last-ditch stand.161 [part0012.html#ft161]Thus, we have all the elements here that we have been researching since the bookbegan. We have rumors of Hitler's disappearance and survival elsewhere in theworld; the lack of credibility afforded stories of the cremation of Hitler'sbody; and the connection with U-boat traffic to Japan. In fact, Sembower alsomentions the rumor “…to the effect that the Russians have Bormann in secretcustody, and that they know the manner of Hitler's death, perhaps evenpossessing his corpse.” 162 [part0012.html#ft162]Thus, John Sembower presents in mid-1945 the entire range of the theories as toHitler's disappearance that have persisted—as he predicted—to this day. He evengoes on to state that the US Army is “carefully checking the approximately threethousand Germans gathered in the remote mountain district of Ashinoyou [sic],whose tall peaks resemble those of Hitler's beloved Bavaria.” Ashinoyu is inJapan, south of Tokyo and to the west of Yokohama, and if this story is truethen the U.S. military was still looking for Hitler months after April 30, 1945and, in fact, after August 28, 1945, which is the day the American occupationbegan. There was thus an impression that Hitler could have escaped—not toArgentina—but as far away as Japan. This was considered credible enough toenlist U.S. Army intelligence personnel in occupied Japan on a search throughthe local German population.If this was credible then how much more so is Hitler's possible escape to aneven more likely and much safer Asian locale?Item: October 27, 1945. Otto Abetz, the Third Reich's ambassador to the Vichygovernment of Occupied France, told an interviewer for the French newspaper,France-Soir, that Adolf Hitler “is certainly not dead.”Item: October 17, 1955. Ten years after the above article appeared. A CIAreport163 [part0012.html#ft163] marked “Secret” and not declassified until afterthe Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act was signed into law by President BillClinton, begins:With reference to the information submitted by Station [CIA/LA] concerning thealleged report that Adolf HITLER is still alive, the files of the [CIA/LA]contain similar information received from the same source, who resides in[redacted].The memorandum goes on to give information received from a February, 1954 memodetailing a conversation between a CIA agent and one Phillip Citroen (a co-ownerof the Maracaibo Times newspaper of Venezuela) that he met someone who resembledHitler in Tunja, Colombia (a region known to be heavily populated by formerNazis, according to the source). What is interesting in the present context isthe fact, noted in the CIA report, that Phillip Citroen “is reported to beemployed with a Dutch steamship company.” He and his brother Francois Citroenwent into partnership with one Alexander van Dobben “the Dutch Consul inMaracaibo” to establish the Maracaibo Times. Parts of this file are stillclassified to this day, marked “Access Restricted” with no explanation given.Another report—dated fifteen days earlier—gives additional informationconcerning Phillip Citroen. Evidently, Citroen was a “former German SS trooper”who claimed to an unidentified friend that Hitler was still alive and that he,Citroen, visited him about once a month in Tunja, Colombia while Citroen wasemployed by the Royal Dutch Shipping Company. Citroen went on to tell his friendthat Hitler had left Colombia “around January 1955” for Argentina.More strikingly, a photograph was attached to this file showing Citroen sittingnext to a man who very closely resembles Hitler. The legend on the back of thephoto states “Adolf Schüttelmayer, Columbia, Tunja, America del Sur 1954”. It isto be noted immediately that there is a misspelling of the word “Colombia” whichmay be due to a foreigner's error, but if Citroen was traveling regularlybetween Colombia and Venezuela it is unlikely that he would have made thissimple mistake. The handwriting, however, is unmistakably that of a European orsomeone trained in European penmanship.The cover page to this report—signed off by a number of unidentified CIAemployees—bears a handwritten notation on the lower right hand corner: “Havefun.”To which someone added the note: “May not be so funny.”An SS-man with Dutch connections in South America. A CIA report that is stillredacted and pages of which are still restricted. A report to the CIA datedFebruary, 1954 (which we still have not seen) on Hitler's presence in Colombia.His subsequent disappearance from that country at the same time that Georg AntonPöch arrives in Jakarta, Indonesia, the former Dutch colony.No, indeed. This “may not be so funny” at all.On November 4, 1955, CIA employee J.C. King wrote:…it is felt that enormous efforts could be expended on this matter with remotepossibilities of establishing anything concrete. Therefore, we suggest that thismatter be dropped.164 [part0012.html#ft164]And so it was.The Federal Bureau of Investigation, however, continued following up Hitlersightings for decades after the CIA seemed to have lost interest. The Bureau wasnominally in charge of espionage and intelligence matters in Latin America, atleast until the creation of the CIA in 1947 when a turf war began between Hooverand CIA over who would control intelligence gathering in the western hemisphere.As we know, the CIA eventually won, but that did not stop Hoover or the FBI fromkeeping files on Hitler sightings in South America and elsewhere for decadeslonger.One of the earliest sightings was reported to Hoover on November 13, 1945 andreflects an OSS report that was dated a month earlier and which wound up onHoover's desk. The FBI report is in the form of a letter to a member of the USEmbassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina (whose name is still redacted, even after 65years) and is entitled “Hitler Hideout in Argentina.” The information itcontains is solid where the pro-Nazi sentiments of a certain area of Argentinaare concerned, and is very revealing of the type of environment that the Naziscould expect to find there.It concerns a Mrs. Eichorn who at the time ran a spa in the town of La Falda,Argentina. Eichorn claimed that she heavily supported— financially—the NaziParty and in particular the propaganda efforts of Goebbels. She further claimedthat she had made the necessary preparations to host the Führer should he be sokind as to come to Argentina. She claimed that when she and her family used tovisit Germany, that they stayed with Hitler.165 [part0012.html#ft165]At first glance, this may appear to be the ravings of a dotty old lady in someremote South American village. However, news reports of the time reported thatLa Falda, Argentina in particular was a major center of pro-Nazi sentiment andpro-Nazi activity before, during and after the war. According to an article bythe respected journalist Johannes Steel,166 [part0012.html#ft166] and includedin the FBI dossier on Hitler, the Argentine chief of the German Labor Front “isnow believed to be in Calamuchita in Cordoba province. This town and La Faldaare considered important centers of clandestine Nazi cells.”He goes on to write that “[German Labor Front chief] Schroeder is reported tohave arrived in Argentina with full instructions to prepare hiding places forother Nazis in that country. The vast territories of Entre Rios, Chaco andMisiones are said to be ideal for harboring sought-for Nazis and to be,actually, the headquarters of clandestine Nazi organizations.” He writes thatone of the financiers of this operation is none other than Admiral Karl Dönitz,along with Nazi Finance Minister Count Lutz Schwerin von Krosigk and thenotorious Robert Ley, head of the German Labor Front and Schroeder's boss, whocommitted suicide rather than face the Nuremberg tribunals.More recent research has revealed that the “spa” mentioned in the FBI/OSS reportwas in reality a famous hotel and resort that had been visited—among others—byAlbert Einstein in 1925. Known as the Eden Hotel, it had been in operation since1897 and was bought by Walter and Ida Eichorn in 1912. The Eichorns were membersof the Nazi Party and did, in fact, raise considerable funds for the Party overthe years. According to one source, the amount raised was in excess of thirtymillion Reichsmarks in 1944. There is documentation to prove that Hitler waspersonally acquainted with the Eichorn couple, including letters to and from theFührer praising their devotion to the Party. Indeed, Hitler himself received theEichorns at the Reichs Chancellery on May 15, 1935, at which time it is believedthat the couple offered their resort to the Führer as a sanctuary whenever heneeded it. This offer of a refuge to the leader of the Third Reich is whatfinally appeared in the OSS report mentioned above and gave Hoover enough causefor concern that he forwarded the information to an embassy official in BuenosAires.The town of La Falda grew up around the famous resort, which was decorated in aEuropean style and surrounded by Bavarian-style chalets that catered to agrowing German population and which had a room especially reserved for Hitler.The hotel had its own movie theater, a dining room that could seat 250, and aradio tower for communicating directly with Germany.There is a persistent rumor that Hitler himself visited the Eden Hotel after thewar and there are two photographs at the hotel that seem to show a blurred imageof the Führer. Former employees of the hotel insist that they saw and in somecases served Hitler there after the war. The rumors were so persistent thatErnesto Guevara Lynch— the father of Che Guevara—used to spy on the Eichornsduring the war. As if to prove these rumors had some foundation, more than onethousand Germans in the area around La Falda filed for Argentine citizenship inthe final months of the war: that is, before April 1945.After the war, the Japanese ambassador would be interned at the Eden Hotel formonths, along with his entire diplomatic corps. Ownership of the hotel was murkyat the time, since it had been appropriated by the Argentine government as“enemy property” once Argentina formally and rather cynically declared war onGermany in the weeks before the end of the war. One does not know what happenedto the Eichorns, but the legacy of their spa and resort lingered. Adolf Eichmannwas known to have visited La Falda and its famous hotel during his exile; hisson Adolfo would marry the daughter of a former gardener of the hotel, a mannamed Pummer. In addition, Erich Müller—a former sailor with the famous Germanbattleship Graf Spee that was scuttled in the waters off Montevideo, Uruguayafter the Battle of River Plate in December,1939—married a former maid of theEden Hotel.167 [part0012.html#ft167] Thus, it can be shown that this hotel,situated 450 miles northwest of Buenos Aires in an area surrounded by hills andlakes, was a major nerve center for the Nazis for decades spanning the pre-war,war and post-war years. We are thus presented with a well-documented scenario:trustworthy and fanatic Nazis in Argentina managing a large resort in a remotearea of the country which was made available to Adolf Hitler should he need toescape. It was an area populated heavily by Germans who were pro-Nazi, and wasfrequented by Nazis—including Adolf Eichmann—for decades. It was run by Naziswho had come to the attention of not only the OSS but also of the FBI. Put thattogether with the well-reported appearance of Nazi U-boats along Argentina'scoast in the months after the war's end, and you have a scenario that is notonly possible but also probable. Hitler knew he had a bolthole already preparedfor him in pro-Nazi Argentina, a country accessible by U-boat and which had alarge population of admirers prepared to hide him and to repel all outsiders.What is more, he knew the owners of the property personally; they had been majorcontributors to the Party, and had been decorated by the Führer himself for thatreason.In addition, and perhaps apocryphally, there is a tantalizing reference inMichael Bar-Zohar's book The Avengers concerning a remark made by Admiral KarlDönitz. It is to be remembered that Hitler trusted Dönitz to the end, making himhis successor as leader of the German government after his own disappearancefrom the scene. The reference reads as follows:In 1943 Admiral Doenitz had declared: ‘The German U-boat fleet is proud to havemade an earthly paradise, an impregnable fortress for the Führer, somewhere inthe world.' He did not say in what part of the world it existed, but fairlyobviously it was in South America.168 [part0012.html#ft168]The author would like to point out the curious symmetry between Dönitz's remarkconcerning an earthly “paradise” and the name of the Eichorn hotel, Eden.Oddly, a man known variously as Mattern Friedrich and Willibald Mattern haswritten a book concerning UFOs as Nazi secret weapons. He is said to be a Germanliving in Chile, and has written that Admiral Dönitz told a graduating class ofnaval cadets in 1944 that “The German Navy knows all hiding places for the Navyto take the Führer to, should the need arise.” 169 [part0012.html#ft169] Theauthor has no way of knowing if the Admiral actually said this, but it is worthmentioning in light of the other evidence.As the anonymous wag noted on the CIA file, “May not be so funny.”Another lengthy file170 [part0012.html#ft170] contains a detailed description ofevents in and around two south Brazilian towns: Rio Grande and Casino. RioGrande was settled by German immigrants in the mid-nineteenth century as part ofBrazil's efforts to populate the area to keep it from being encroached upon byneighboring countries. Later, Italian immigrants followed to bolster thepopulation and to begin wine production. Casino is about fifteen miles from RioGrande and close to the Uruguayan border, and that is where most of the actionin the BUFile takes place.The report is sober, cautious, and painstaking in its meticulous account of whatappeared to have been a Hitler sighting in that country. The report was writtenby the SAC (Special Agent in Charge) of Los Angeles, addressed to Hoover, and isdated June 5, 1947 and still is heavily redacted (sixty-five years after theevents in question!). The SAC is recounting a meeting he had with someone whosecredibility he seems to vouch for, and who claims to have met both Hitler andEva Braun in the Grande Hotel de Casino in March of 1947. There was supportingdocumentation in the form of passports, visas, etc. which proved that theinformant had indeed been to the countries in question on the dates mentioned.The hotel had its own radio antenna, which was remarkable in that it wasinstalled parallel to the ground rather than in a tower, and was fenced off. Theowner of the hotel, according to the file, also had an interest in amanufacturing plant in the area that made woolen products.171[part0012.html#ft171]The informant claimed he had worked for the French Underground during the warand recognized immediately one of the patrons of the hotel, a German officer bythe name of Weissman who was involved in the Propaganda Department. He thenrecognized at the same table a woman he thought resembled Eva Braun, and finallya man he was certain was Adolf Hitler.His description of Hitler is interesting:“This man was described as having the same general build and age of HITLER, wasclean-shaven, and had a very short German crew haircut. This man was ratheremaciated…”The report goes on to describe a few evenings in which the Hitler/Braun couplewas observed closely, as well as a young seventeen-year-old woman who was theniece of the “Eva Braun” figure who was observed giving the “Heil Hitler” saluteone day. The informant subsequently learned from the niece that they were fromChile; however, they did not speak Spanish but only German the entire time,which made the informant doubt the Chile story. When the informant discussed thepossibility of doing a travel piece about the picturesque hotel and thesurrounding towns, the hotel owner became hostile immediately and the informantthen discovered that there were no more rooms available to him and he had toleave the area. Upon his return to Rio de Janeiro he narrowly avoided whatseemed to be two murder attempts.The FBI then interviewed the informant and several others who were hiscolleagues. They were checked out, and everything seemed above-board. Oneinteresting fact emerged, and that is that the informant—after the fall ofParis—had somehow and for an unexplained (or possibly redacted) reason, visitedTibet.Tibet comes up again in our story, which is why the author points this out.Tibet is one of the countries mentioned in the Pöch diary along with the namesand places of other contacts around the world. It also appears in what seems tobe an incoherent letter to Hoover about Hitler's possible whereabouts, as quotedat the beginning of this chapter. It is jarring to find this country in thiscontext, to say the least, and we will have more to say about it as we goforward in our investigation.The Bureau evidently felt that it was possible that the informant was aCommunist or perhaps a Russian spy. They based this on the fact that he was amember of the French Resistance during the war, and while there were Socialistsand Communists who belonged to the Resistance it was by no means a given that apartisan was automatically a Communist.On August 6, 1947, Hoover received a reply from an unidentified agent in Rio deJaneiro, Brazil, who confirmed that Casino and Rio Grande had large Germanpopulations and that “it could be expected that a Nazi refugee would seek asylumor assistance in the Casino area because of the existence of the predominantlyGerman element.”Then, a large part of the memorandum is heavily redacted. Following theredaction there is a list of correspondence between two important individuals onthis matter: Frederick D. Hunt, the American Consul in the island nation ofMartinique, and US Ambassador to Brazil William Pawley. Unfortunately, copies ofthis correspondence are not included in the declassified FBI files, but there isenough known—particularly about Pawley—that can lead us to some interestingconclusions.In context, the political atmosphere at the time was poisonous when it came topursuing Nazis in South America. There was a much-publicized struggle going onbetween two US government representatives over the fact of pro-Nazi sentimentsin Argentina. On one side was US Ambassador to Argentina, Spruille Braden, whowas insisting that Argentina live up to its promise to stamp out Nazism in thatcountry; on the other side was William Pawley, a co-founder of the Flying Tigersand a man later deeply involved in the Bay of Pigs invasion, who was an enemy ofBraden and who tried to have him destroyed.Running InterferenceWilliam Douglas Pawley (1896–1977) was an American businessman whose father wasbased in Cuba where young Pawley went to school. In 1927, Pawley began workingfor the Curtiss-Wright Corporation that manufactured aircraft. A year laterwould find Pawley back in Cuba as president of the Nacional Cubana Aviación deCurtiss, the local Curtiss-Wright affiliate. This relationship with Cuba wouldcontinue his entire life.The Curtiss-Wright company was sold to Pan American Airways in 1932, and afterthat Pawley would go to China where he built aircraft manufacturing facilitiesfor the Chinese Nationalist leader, Chiang Kai-Shek. Pawley was also friendlywith Claire Chennault, the man most closely identified with what would becomethe Flying Tigers.Pawley wound up selling 100 P-40 fighter planes to the Flying Tigers. This wasnot patriotism at work, but profit. The P-40s were considered obsolete by theRoyal Air Force, among others, but Pawley—using his connections with his oldcompany—managed to arrange a sale to China and the Tigers. They would be used inthe war against the Japanese in a project that had the blessing of AmericanPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt. Pawley even went so far as to get Walt Disneyto design the Flying Tigers logo.The Flying Tigers was a romantic and effective air force composed largely ofAmerican volunteers. It was created in 1941, long before the United Statesofficially entered World War Two. It was essentially a secret war against theJapanese begun eight months before the attack on Pearl Harbor. It wouldprefigure groups like the CIA airline Air America of the 1960s.After the war, Pawley went on to a number of other airline companies around theworld before eventually becoming President Harry S. Truman's ambassador to Peru,and in 1948 became ambassador to Brazil. At this time he began a smear campaignagainst Spruille Braden, insisting that he was a Communist stooge because of hisstrong stand against the presence of Nazis in Argentina. Braden was himself aRepublican and a conservative, but Pawley could be considered a proto-neocon.Pawley began running interference for Perón and other Latin Americandictators—such as Batista in Cuba—while ignoring the Ratline and the steadystream of war criminals that flooded the continent. His political stand wasunabashedly anti-Communist and he typified the mentality of certain Americanpoliticians who— like those in the Vatican—saw Communism as a greater threatthan Nazism and who had no moral scruples about giving covert assistance to warcriminals.This would become clear with Pawley's later involvement in the CIA's Bay of Pigsoperation and other covert action adventures around the globe. In January, 1977he was found dead of a gunshot wound which was characterized by his family asthe result of a debilitating case of shingles which caused Pawley considerablepain; however, to observers it seemed curious that Pawley would have killedhimself at the time of the House Select Committee on Assassinationsinvestigations which might have revealed Pawley's involvement in the Bay of Pigsas well as his close association with Allen Dulles and Ted Shackley of the CIAand most especially of the infamous JMWAVE station in Miami (the largest CIAstation in the world at the time).Spruille Braden, Pawley's nemesis in the Republican Party, was an open opponentof fascism and this, to Pawley, smacked of a socialist mindset. He did what hecould to get Braden out of Latin America since he was fouling the pond foreveryone by insisting that the Argentine government live up to its commitment tofind and deport Nazi war criminals…something Argentina was not about to do. ANew York Times story dated February 20, 1961172 [part0012.html#ft172] shows thatBraden had been successful in keeping Pawley out of the Argentineambassadorship; while Braden admitted that he blocked Pawley's ambassadorship toArgentina, he did not elaborate on his reasons why. Pawley, however, as late as1961 was still trying to smear Braden over events that took place almost fifteenyears earlier. He gave secret testimony to Congress asserting that Braden hadbeen dismissed by President Truman due to Pawley's revelations concerningBraden's alleged Communist sympathies, a charge that Braden (and Truman) denied.In fact, Braden was awarded the Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilianhonor.To Pawley, Braden was jousting at windmills in Argentina: he was looking fornon-existent Nazis and creating a firestorm of animosity where Pawley needed itleast. Pawley supported Batista and Peró n unequivocally and wanted to insurethat Latin America remained free of Communist influence. In order to do that, heneeded the Nazis in place. Thus it transpired that an American ambassador raninterference for the Ratline and aided in the escape and sanctuary of hundredsof war criminals. As the CIA was also involved to some extent in this operation,and as Pawley's relationship with Dulles was secure, it can come as no surprisethat Braden's voice was shouted down and Argentina could conduct its business asusual.Frederick D. Hunt, a correspondent with Pawley in the memoranda mentioned above,was a Foreign Service officer who was based in Shanghai in 1941173[part0012.html#ft173] and who presumably had dealings with Pawley since thoseearly days in China with the Flying Tigers. Hunt's name appears sporadically—butquietly—in a number of suggestive places, and his wife was a member of the AAFSW(American Association of Foreign Service Wives), an association that was invitedto a lunch at the Nixon White House in 1973.174 [part0012.html#ft174] What hewas doing in Martinique in 1947 is anyone's guess. However, it seemed it wasHunt who provided Pawley with all the ammunition he needed to shoot down thisstory. According to Hunt, the Martinique authorities were suspicious of theinformant and stated that he and an accomplice had been indicted for passing abad check in France in 1946 and were wanted by the French authorities. TheMartinique governor could not arrest them until the evidence had arrived fromParis, thus allowing the two men sufficient time to get off the island. Itseems—according to the story as outlined in a memo dated August 29, 1947 fromthe SAC Los Angeles to Hoover—that the two men had arrived in Martiniqueintending to shoot a historical documentary on and about the island. The storyof the bad check was enough to discredit the detailed testimony of theinformants.The upshot of this correspondence is that a potentially vital piece ofinformation from a known French resistance fighter concerning the escape ofAdolf Hitler was devalued and then ignored completely because of a rumorconcerning a bad check in Paris in 1946. This occurred even though theinformation concerning the German community of Casino and Rio Grande wasverified by a redacted memorandum from Rio de Janeiro to Hoover. Once again,Pawley had run interference for the Ratline. The flight of war criminals—toLatin America and to Asia, both areas of the world with which Pawley and hiscolleagues were intimately familiar—was assured. Pawley allowed no informationconcerning Nazis in Latin America to be entertained seriously. He ridiculedBraden—who was himself a staunch anti-Communist—for suggesting otherwise; he raninterference on the Casino story; he openly and aggressively supportedright-wing dictatorships in Asia and Latin America. This is a case of moralitytaking a back seat to ideology, and of the ends justifying the means. It is aposition that runs neatly parallel to the Nazis' own methodology.Braden—whatever his faults might have been as a lobbyist for United Fruit and asupporter of the Somoza regime in Nicaragua as well—was responsible for theoverthrow of Arbenz in Guatemala, among many other charges that could be madeagainst him. He was an anti-Communist who nevertheless wanted Nazi war criminalsidentified and brought to justice. To Pawley (and to so many like him), this wasan absurd position to take, a political oxymoron.Ironically, Braden died of heart disease in January,1978: almost exactly a yearto the day after Pawley's own suicide.As we can see, this article and the others contained within the FBI filesconsist of detailed information not otherwise available to the general readerbut which was current at the time: the immediate post-war period. Uki Goñi'sdefinitive text on the Argentine end of the Ratline— The Real Odessa—does notmention the Dönitz and Schwerin von Krosigk connection, and does not describe LaFalda, Casino or the other Nazi enclaves mentioned in the Steel article or theBUFiles. The subject is too vast, rather than too narrow, and the documentation(when available, when not shredded by the authorities: in this case, theArgentine or US governments) is damning. A complete study of the ratlines wouldhave to be encyclopedic and run to many thousands of pages. All we can do hereis to point to wherever the facts as we know them will lead us in our particularquest.What is important to realize is that the networks were global, werewell-financed from a variety of sources, and included covert assistance from theInternational Red Cross, the Vatican, European and Latin American and MiddleEastern and Asian governments, Allied military intelligence, and their laterincarnations as the CIA, the BND, etc. The world went from a hot war to a coldwar, and in that change of temperature decisions were made that were morallybankrupt, regardless of concerns for national security. It was as if thereexisted no one person, no one group, that could defend the United States and theWest in general from the perceived Soviet menace than the most hateful, mosticonic butchers of the twentieth century. It was this failure of nerve more thananything else, this loss of faith in our own institutions and their capabilityof defending us, that led US and Allied intelligence services—and the RomanCatholic Church, an institution dedicated to the highest forms of morality—intothis heinous contract. Like the grimoires of Dark Age sorcerers, each page ofthe FBI files, the OSS and CIA files, the CIC files, and the files of MI6,contain signatures of the demons with whom pacts were made in the naive beliefthat they could be controlled by men whose capacity for evil action was actuallyfar less than that of the demons they evoked to visible appearance. The men ofthe intelligence services were not sorcerers: they were sorcerers' apprentices,and like Mephistopheles in Goethe's Faust, the demons soon came to take over anddemand the payment of their collective souls.The FBI files go on to record every rumor, every piece of gossip, every lead inthe search for Adolf Hitler. The story of a Hitler sighting in Colombia—that wasreported heavily in the Colombian press—is exhaustively recorded, translated,and analyzed. Now Hitler is seen washing dishes in Miami; now he is on arailroad car in St Louis. These leads are professionally followed-up, eventhough the agents in charge know in their hearts that the information is bogus.But Hoover, like Stalin, suspects the worst: that somehow, Hitler has escaped.There is far too much smoke to doubt there's fire.U-boats in Argentina and Japan. Sightings in Colombia and Argentina and Brazil.Mysterious operatives coming out of the woodwork and relaying information toAmerican agents before disappearing again. And the background to all of this isthe very real operation taking place under everyone's nose: the escape of menlike Mengele and Eichmann and Rauff. Considering what we now know of theRatline, and about the mistaken nature of the Russian forensic evidence, it isabout time to go back over all these cold leads and begin to re-evaluate them.We know that the Eden Hotel in La Falda, Argentina was offered to Hitler byserious Nazi Party supporters who knew Hitler personally. We know that regionslike Casino in Brazil were hotbeds of Nazi intrigue before and after the war. Weknow that American politicians in authority took great pains to cover up thisinformation. Knowing what we know now, it is time to take another look at thedisappearance of Adolf Hitler and his possible escape to the one country in theworld where he would have been the most secure from Allied and Israeli capture,and where the German Navy and the Nazi Party had a documented presence: a Muslimnation on the other side of the world.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------156 [part0012.html#fn156] FBI BUfile 65-53615-4, letter dated October 28,1945from unidentified source.157 [part0012.html#fn157] The fact that the Allies took seriously reports ofHitler sightings in South America is an indication as to the degree ofskepticism with which they greeted the Trevor-Roper analysis.158 [part0012.html#fn158] See, for instance, the article by Henry Wales,“Hitler's Fate Still Mystery to Army Says Ike's Aid,” n.p., September 9,1945 andcontained within the declassified FBI file on Hitler.159 [part0012.html#fn159] See as evidence an undated radiogram contained in thedeclassified FBI file on Hitler, page 343, from the FBI to the US Embassy inBuenos Aires, which reads “Bureau intensely interested in all rumors concerningwhereabouts of Hitler, particularly rumors he and Eva Braun may be in Argentina.Advise daily by radiogram for the present results of all investigation based onrumors and leads on whereabouts Hitler.” This indicates a very high level ofinterest by Hoover in the possibility of a Hitler escape. This was followed by aflurry of reports to Hoover on the famous landing of German U-Boat U-530 inArgentina and rumors that several persons were off-loaded by the submarinebefore it was surrendered to the authorities.160 [part0012.html#fn160] Benjamin Fischer, CIA History Staff, “Hitler, Stalinand ‘operation Myth’”, n.d., n.p.

Less than three months later, in April of 1970, a Sovietintelligence squad rushed to an unmarked grave at a secret police station inMagdeburg, East Germany, dug up a body and cremated it, throwing its ashes intoa tributary of the Elbe river. This was on the orders of KGB chief—and futureSoviet premier—Yuri Andropov himself.This juxtaposition of these two seemingly unrelated events in space and time isdeliberate, for in each case the dead man was believed to have been AdolfHitler.Did the death of the mysterious European man in Indonesia in January trigger theresponse of the KGB in East Germany in April? The author would like to suggestthat it did. Imagine for a moment this scenario: the real Adolf Hitler dies inrelative obscurity in a faraway land. Word reaches the KGB, and an embarrassedintelligence chief orders that “their” Hitler corpse be dug up and destroyed inorder to avoid one day having to tell the world that they buried the wrong guy.Then, twenty years later, the man who ordered this bizarre exhumation comesforward—this time as the Soviet premier—and tells the world that they hadHitler's body all along, confident that no one will be able to prove otherwisesince they cremated the body (again) and scattered its ashes into the river. Heis certain that the body in the Indonesian cemetery has completely disintegratedby this time in the tropical grave and that there would be no way to prove itsidentity.This scenario is not as far-fetched as it may seem, for if one were to visit thegravesite of the Indonesian “Hitler” today one will notice a stunning anomalyabout its headstone.Georg Anton Pöch is buried in a Muslim cemetery in the district of Ngagel Rejoin Surabaya, not far from the hospital where he died. The plot is in a farcorner of the cemetery, and the gravesite is designed in the Muslim fashion. Itconsists of a flat slab of stone with a shallow depression on its surface whereflower petals are strewn. On top of the slab are two markers—one at either endof the rectangular stone— upon one of which is usually inscribed the name anddates (birth and death) of the deceased. In the case of Pöch, his name and datedo not appear on the marker, but on the stone slab itself. This is not sounusual, for some of the other gravesites show the same method. What is jarring,however, is the fact that the stonecutter never carved the date of birth or thedate of death of Dr. Pöch. In fact, the date of his death was literallypencilled in more recently by someone using what appears to have been a MagicMarker. This is not only most unusual, it makes no sense at all. One couldunderstand that there might have been confusion over Pöch's birthdate; he was aforeigner and it is possible (though not likely) that no one had the informationat the time … but did the stonecutter creating Pöch's tombstone not know when hedied?In addition, the lower part of the plaque shows a mysterious legend: CC.258. Noother grave markers that the author could see during his visit to the cemeterybore anything similar. It is believed by some that this is a grid location forthe gravesite. If so, why does the Pöch stone have it prominently displayedwhereas no other tombstone in the cemetery does?No birth date. No death date. A mysterious legend, in more ways than one.Who is really buried in Pöch's tomb?One possible reason for the lack of a birth date, of course, is confusion overwho really died. Should they use the birth date for Pöch (which would beNovember 1,1895) or the birth date for … someone else? It seems no one wanted tocommit themselves to writing it “in stone,” not even at the time of the man'sdeath. The inscription was deferred to a later date, a date that never came. Itwas only sometime in the last few years that the death date was written withwhat appears to have been a felt-tipped pen, for there are photographs of thegravestone taken as late as 2007 that do not show the date at all. It seemsthere was no controversy over the date of death; the only controversy thatremained—and remains to this day—is the date of birth. Since Pöch's date ofbirth is well known from official Indonesian documents, there seems to be noreason to delay inscribing that date on his tombstone.Unless someone in power knows that the tomb is not that of the Salzburg medicalofficer at all, but of someone else entirely.The Sosro AffairAs we have seen, Dr. Sosro Husodo met Georg Anton Pöch on Sumbawa in October andNovember of 1960. It would be another twenty-one years before Sosro would thinkof him again. This time, his memories were triggered by an article in theIndonesian magazine Zaman, in their January 15, 1980 issue, which was brought tohim by a family member in 1981. The article was by Heinz Linge, as we have seenone of the SS guards at the Bunker who claimed to have known about Hitler'ssuicide, and was entitled “True Story: the Last Days of a Dictator.” It had beentranslated into Bahasa Indonesia, and Linge's description of Hitler's physicalstate—including the tremors, the dragging of the left foot, etc.—immediatelybrought to mind the old German doctor Sosro had met in Sumbawa Besar.Sosro began reading anything he could find about Hitler, and the more he readthe more he became convinced that the old man on Sumbawa was the former Nazidictator. Then, in October 1983, an article in the Indonesian magazine Intisaricontained the story of Klaus Barbie, the Nazi murderer who was discovered livingin Bolivia, and of how he escaped to Latin America. It was the first time mostpeople heard of the name Draganovic, and of the Ratline.According to Sosro, this is when all the pieces began to come together. Itstarted to seem likely that Hitler could have escaped using the same Ratline asBarbie. He began to make some calls.The first call he made was to Sumbawa Besar. He was eventually informed that theGerman doctor had left Sumbawa to go to Surabaya with a patient, and then diedhimself in that city in January of 1970. Further calls revealed that Pöch hadremarried, this time to a Sundanese woman named Sulaesih, who had herself,returned to her home town of Bandung.Sosro eventually tracked down Sulaesih, and she showed him the Pöch diary, withits references to Draganovic and the addresses of the monastery route safehouses in Rome and Genoa, as well as the unidentified address in Rome thatturned out to be that of the German Archaeological Institute.Dr. Sosro Husodo then wrote his own article on Pöch, setting out the evidencethat this strange German doctor could have been Adolf Hitler. In thearticle—published in the magazine Pikiran Rakyat in 1983—he referred to Sulaesihonly as “S”, in an effort to protect her identity. After all, who would want tobe known as the widow of Adolf Hitler?He found that some of the diary contents were written in shorthand, and he wentto some effort to have it translated in Germany. But his attempts to havehistorians acknowledge the possibility that the man buried in Surabaya wasactually Hitler were met with ridicule. One of the typical objections was madeby a researcher, Dr. Asvi Warman Adam, of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences,who expressed doubt that any Nazis at all had escaped to Indonesia.Of course it was counter-intuitive, since “everyone knew” that the Nazis hadgone to Argentina. (Actually, the Pöch diary does refer to Argentina as theirdestination.) But the objection was a valid one, and the insistence by Dr. Sosrothat at least one “Nazi” did make it as far as Indonesia seemed bizarre whenthis author first heard of it. It was only after considerable effort andinvestigation did this part of the story begin to make sense. Regardless of whoPöch really was—the Chief Medical Officer of the Salzburg Gau, or the leader ofthe Third Reich—he was definitely a Nazi who made it to Indonesia.One of the problems faced by this author in evaluating the Sosro narrative isthe fact that all of the action seems to take place in 1983 when the world waslearning of Klaus Barbie and the Ratline for the first time. It could be arguedthat Sosro had conflated the news current that year with his memories of Pöch in1960. It could also be argued that his reference to Frank G. Spisak wasmotivated by the same conflation, since the story of the multiple murderer witha Hitler complex made the headlines (at least, in the United States) the sameyear.However, as the author began to deconstruct and reconsruct the Sosro account itbecame clear that the Pöch diary was genuine. It contained references to peopleand places that Sosro could not have known about in the pre-Internet days of1983 and, indeed, could hardly have been discovered even now. Pöch was anunknown name to most people, but it has been demonstrated that he did exist andthat his wife did exist and that both lived in Salzburg in 1945. The Pöch diary,therefore, is genuine and should be taken seriously. Whether or not convictedkiller Frank Spisak ever lived in Sumbawa as a child, or whether or not Pöch wasHitler, are different matters entirely. Yet, what this Indonesian doctor fromProject Hope and his own research has done is open the door to a segment ofhistory that was heretofore either unknown or ignored. The contents of the Pöchdiary sent this author on a search that revealed a great deal about the role ofNazi anthropologists in the Holocaust, the involvement of the GermanArchaeological Institute in the Ratline, the existence of Nazi U-boats inSoutheast Asia, and the creation of the Nazi Party in Indonesia by Walter Hewel… none of which is common knowledge to the public at large and most of whichwill be new even to historians of the war. It also invokes the very real mysteryof what happened not only to Georg Anton Pöch, but to his rather more celebratedwife, Hella.The Pöch coupleIf it was really Georg Anton Pöch who arrived in Indonesia in January of 1954,then it is unusual that we have no further information about his famous wife,Hella (or Helena) Pöch, neé Schürer von Waldheim. After all, it was Hella Pöchwho held important positions in Viennese anthropological circles and institutes.It was Hella Pöch who married the man considered to be the father of modernethnology, Rudolf Pöch. It was Hella Pöch who conducted anthropometric and otherexperiments on prisoners of war in the camps. And it would have been Hella Pöchwho had the interest to travel to Indonesia since her previous husband , Rudolf,had done important work there, albeit forty years earlier. Yet, we know verylittle about Hella Pöch's life in Indonesia with Georg Anton.In fact, we know nothing.Attempts to obtain information from European institutes and universitiesconcerning Hella Pöch have proved strangely fruitless. We are told that she diedin 1976, and presumably in Europe…but there is no more information than that. Wehave no idea what she was doing from 1945 to 1976, a span of thirty years, orwhere she was doing it. Did she hide from the Allies once the Netherlands andGermany fell? Did she claim ownership over Rudolf Pöch's estate? What happenedto her research notes, artifacts, and field work?Did she really go into hiding, travel along the Ratline from Austria to Italy toSouth America and then to Indonesia? Why? Was she really wanted by the Allies?Aside from the snippets we have of her husband's diary, she might have droppedoff the face of the earth in 1945. This, for a celebrated anthropologist withher pedigree, is incredible. Many of her colleagues survived the 1940s andthrived afterwards, even those who demonstrably had committed crimes during thewar. It would have galled someone like Hella Pöch to see lesser lightsreinstalled in their previous posts, even honored for their contributions toscience, while she languished in some remote backwater, ignored and forgottenafter such a brilliant career.In short, she would have done this only if she (or her husband) had committedcrimes that were so heinous that there would have been no mercy shown to eitherof them.But … there is no indication that the Allies even knew who she was. She appearson no wanted list that the author has been able to find. She appears and thendisappears just as mysteriously as her second husband, Georg Anton Pöch.There is one possible explanation. Hella Pöch was not Hella Pöch at all, butsomeone who assumed her identity in order to flee along the Ratline. Someone forwhom the world was searching. Someone with a terrible secret.Heinrich Himmler himself, the head of the SS and one of the most wanted men inEurope after the war, shaved off his mustache and stole the identity of a realGerman police officer in order to avoid capture. This is what the Nazis (andparticularly the SS) were doing. Aside from the forged papers and assumed names,in the immediate aftermath of the war many of the hunted simply took theidentities of real persons as their own. In Himmler's case, the choice of apolice officer was not a wise one: the Allies were on the alert for policemenand had orders to arrest them on sight.But no one would have arrested an anthropologist on sight. Not unless they werealready on a list.There are no photographs of Hella Pöch among the effects left behind by herhusband, and yet Georg Anton was said to be an avid photographer. And, one day afew years after their arrival on the island of Sumbawa, she disappears again. Noquestions. No answers. No trace.Her husband then converts to Islam and takes a young Sundanese bride.Photographs of the couple show a man who fits an earlier description:This man was described as having the same general build and age of HITLER, wasclean-shaven, and had a very short German crew haircut. This man was ratheremaciated…We recall this description from the previous chapter [part0012.html], containedin a June, 1947 report to FBI director Hoover about a couple seen in Casino,Brazil. It fits existing photographs of Georg Anton Pöch rather well, except forthe fact that Pöch eventually sported a Hitleresque “Charlie Chaplin” mustache.But in Indonesia he appeared, indeed, rather emaciated with a very short Germancrew cut.It is important at this time to draw the reader's attention to photographs ofPöch and to do a simple comparison with known photographs of Hitler when he wasrather more emaciated-looking than later photos and newsreels show him to havebeen later in life. Special attention should be paid to the ears and the jawlineof both the young Hitler and the older Pöch. In terms ofanthropometrics—ironically, the field pioneered by Rudolf Pöch and championed byHella Pöch herself—these are important determinants of identity and difficult tomask with cosmetic surgery.The photo on the left is of Adolf Hitler as a young soldier in the trenches ofWorld War One. The photo on the right is of Georg Anton Pöch, taken in SumbawaBesar in 1965. In this photograph he is wearing glasses, which distorts theimage somewhat, but the ears and jawline seem virtually identical.images [../images/00027.jpeg]Adolf Hitler at left. Georg Anton Pöch on the right.So, what do we know about Georg Anton Pöch? How can details about his life inIndonesia help us to determine who he really was, and what he was really doingthere? For that, we have to consult two sources. One is the doctor who visitedPöch from the hospital ship Hope. The other is the collection of Pöch documentsthat have only appeared in one place: a small pamphlet written by an Indonesianprince who took a special interest in the story. Yet, neither of these sourceshelps us to understand who Hella Pöch was, or what she was doing there. If HellaPöch was not really Hella Pöch, then it is entirely possible—no, probable—thatGeorg Anton Pöch was not who he claimed to be either.The DocumentsThe first document at our disposal is a copy of Georg Anton Pöch's Indonesianentry permit, dated January 6, 1954. In this document, Pöch is described as ofGerman nationality, but his passport was issued in Rome and bears the dateSeptember 28, 1951, with passport number 2624/51. We can assume that this numbersystem indicates passport number 2624 that was issued in 1951. His place ofbirth is listed as Przemysl, November 1, 1895. His place of arrival is Jakarta.There are a number of problems with this document. In the first place, GeorgAnton Pöch was an Austrian and not a German. Przemysl was—at the time he wasborn—part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, even though today it is part ofPoland. Thus, he could have been Austrian or even, today, of Polish nationalitybut not German. This is reinforced by his namesake, Rudolf Pöch, who wasAustrian and by his wife, Hella Pöch who was also Austrian. We thus have anembarrassment of Pöchs, none of whom could be considered German nationals in1951, although they might have been considered citizens of the “Greater GermanReich” (which included Austria) in 1945. (There is another possibility, ofcourse, and that is that Pöch was a Nazi Party member and thus automatically acitizen of the German Reich, a state that was demolished anyway in 1945.)But what passport did he really have? The Indonesian immigration official wrotethe word “Djerman” which was the Indonesian spelling current at the time.“Djerman” could mean “Germany” the country as well as “German” the nationality.Did Pöch have a German passport?West Germany did not become an independent state, the BundesrepublikDeutschland, until 1949, when it was considered to encompass both West and EastGermany (even though East Germany at that time was under Soviet control and didnot recognize West German claims to the territory). Under the Grundgesetz or“Basic Law” Constitution of 1949, the boundaries of “Germany” were establishedas those that existed in 1937, i.e., before the Anschluss that annexed Austriato the Greater German Reich. If the Pöchs were living in Salzburg, and werenative Austrians, there does not seem to be any way in which they could haveclaimed “German” citizenship in 1951, unless they had been members of the NaziParty or the SS in which they would be German citizens under the laws of theReich, a technicality that helped some Nazis escape extradition to the countrieswhere they had committed war crimes. In addition, Austria was still occupied bythe Allies as late as 1955 when the occupation officially ended. Therefore,their legal status was confused, to say the least.Did West Germany issue only 2624 passports in the first nine months of 1951? Andwhy did Pöch have to go to Rome to get it? The obvious answer, of course, isthat the passport he held was not a German passport (which did not use thatnumbering system anyway) but one issued by the International Committee of theRed Cross (ICRC), which thoughtfully made Pöch a German rather than an Austriancitizen. We know from Pöch's diary that Draganovic was involved, which means aVatican identity document was used to generate the Red Cross passport.The problem with this scenario is that the numbering system used by the ICRC wasnot the same as the system used in the Pöch passport number. The ICRC numbersdid not end in a slash with the two-digit year following it. That system wasused for visas by many countries, such as the Argentine immigration documentsissued by Draganovic. What is further problematic, however, is that by 1950— theyear before the Pöch passport was created—the number system for the Argentinevisas had already reached 397954/50: that was the Argentine immigration numberfor Klaus Barbie, who got his paperwork started in Salzburg around the same timeas the Pöch couple. For comparison purposes, the immigration number for JosefMengele (as “Helmut Gregor”) was 211713/48. So the “passport number” 2624/51remains something of a mystery, unless it was not a passport number but anIndonesian immigration number, created especially for clients of MonsignorDraganovic.Draganovic caused thousands of Argentine immigration documents to be issued andthey rarely contained the real identities of the persons holding them. Thatwould have been counter-productive, to say the least. We can be relatively surethat if Draganovic had a hand in the generation of these travel documents, thenPöch's nationality was not German, and his name was possibly not even Pöch!Otherwise …why go through Draganovic at all?As we have seen, the names of Georg Anton Pöch and Hella Pöch do not appear onany lists of war criminals that the author has been able to locate so theirnames would have been safe to use for those whose real names were somewhat morenotorious. The necessity of going through the Vatican Ratline is questionableunless the two individuals in question were not the Pöchs at all. As an exampleBarbie, who left less than a year before the Pöch couple, used the name KlausAltmann. Adolf Eichmann (Argentine immigration number 231489/48) used RicardoKlement. Hans Fischböck (Argentine immigration number 238136/48) used JacobSchramm.There is no documentary evidence to show that the famous Viennese anthropologistHella Pöch was in Indonesia in 1954. All of the available documents are on GeorgAnton pöch. That there was someone with him—a European woman—in Sumbawa seemscertain, based on the testimony of Dr. Sosro Husodo as well as on that of pöch'ssecond wife, Sulaesih. We just don't know for sure who she was.Pöch's immigration form does not contain any information on a wife, but that isnot unusual. Hella pöch would have filled out her own immigration form but thisis not available, if it ever existed. It would have gone a long way toidentifying her, but we have no way of finding such paperwork. Instead, all thepaper we have is on Georg Anton and we will have to make do with that until moredetails come to light.Pöch's occupation is not noted on his immigration form. It is much later thatdocuments surface showing he is known as “Dr. Med. G.A. Pöch.” The real G.A.Pöch was a doctor or, at least, a researcher with a degree in medicine175[part0013.html#ft175] if not an actual surgeon or general practitioner.According to Dr Sosro's account, pöch had little knowledge of practical medicineand, indeed, his medical degrees or diplomas have not surfaced. Several pre-warpeer-reviewed articles by Pöch have appeared, and they bear the stamp of a manwho was more involved in research than the actual practice of medicine. A recentsource, Zur Geschichte der NS-Euthanasie in Wien: Von der Zwangssterilisationzur Ermordung (On the History of Nazi Euthanasia in Vienna: from CoercedSterilization to Murder), which was published in Vienna in 2002, long after thePöch story originally broke in the mid-1980s, only mentions Pöch twice, inpassing176 [part0013.html#ft176] but mentions Pöch as the “medical officer” ofthe Salzburg Gauleiter. This is important, as the Pöch diary begins in Salzburgafter the war.Brigitte Fuchs177 [part0013.html#ft177] gives a brief biographical sketch ofHella Pöch, in which her involvement in the studies of Jewish prisoners in theDutch camps is mentioned, as well as the fact that her project was interrupteddue to the deportation of her research “subjects” to the concentration and deathcamps in Poland. Again, Pöch (this time Hella) is mentioned as having gone toSumbawa in Indonesia “where she continued her biological research”, only toreturn to Vienna “some years” later, which is presumably where she died in 1976.One shudders to think what type of biological research she conducted on theisland of Sumbawa, but there is no further information available. There is alsono precise date of her return to Europe. However, in 1957 an article under hername appeared in the German anthropology journal Anthropologischer Anzeigerentitled “Uber die athiopide und die gondide Rasse und ihre Verbreitung, (“Onthe Athiopide and the Gondide Race and their Distribution)” which was a study ofAfrican language groups in the region of the Sudan and what is now the CentralAfrican Republic. This obviously had nothing to do with Indonesia, and onewonders how she was able to write this article when she had—presumably—not beento the Sudanese region since before the war. One wonders when the article wasactually written and if, indeed, she wrote it. Further, is it possible that thenotations in the Pöch diary mentioning Africa are relevant to this question? Ifso, then there are other tantalizing hints that the peripatetic Pöch couplemight have gone even farther afield before landing in Indonesia in 1954.Salzburg in Austria, just a few kilometers to the northeast of Berchtesgaden,Hitler's retreat, and down river from Branau-am-Inn, where Hitler was born, wasthe base of operations for Georg Anton Pöch. As the medical officer he wasnominally in charge of the euthanasia programs for the Salzburg Gau. (A “Gau” isa region within a country, and a “Gauleiter” is the Gau “leader” oradministrative head, similar to a governor; these were medieval terms that theNazis revived during the war and were positions held by Nazi Party members andwere typically SS or military roles.)As medical officer in Salzburg, Pöch's boss was Gustav Adolf Scheel (1907–1979).Scheel was himself a medical doctor as well as Gauleiter of Salzburg. A fanaticand devoted Nazi since long before Anschluss, Scheel had been involved with theunderground Nazi movement in Austria, joining the Nazi Party in 1930 andbringing with him other doctors and academics who would eventually wind upcommitting unspeakable atrocities in Eastern Europe. An SS-Brigadeführer, hebecame Gauleiter of Salzburg in 1941 and remained in that position until the endof the war. Scheel was himself arrested and interned several times after the waruntil his “denazification” was complete, after which he eventually wound upworking in hospitals as a doctor again as early as 1948. However, he wasarrested again—this time by the British—in 1953 for his involvement in theNaumann Circle. This was an ODESSA-like organization, a secret group of formerSS officers that was believed to be plotting a resurgence of the Third Reich.The Naumann Circle was run by a devoted Nazi—Dr Werner Naumann, who for severaldays in May of 1945 had been Goebbels's successor as Reich Minister ofPropaganda, and who was one of the last people to leave the Berlin bunker in1945—who felt that only the Nazis could stand up to the Soviet threat in EasternEurope. His contacts included numerous members of the Ratline, from Skorzeny andRudel to members of the Perón network. That the Naumann Circle was beingfinanced and supported by influential Nazis and former SS-men seems beyonddoubt, but when Naumann was arrested most observers felt that the British wereover-reacting. In hindsight, that does not seem to have been the case. TheNaumann Circle—had it survived—would have been another link in the Ratline, butits primary purpose was not to help Nazis flee Europe but to enable them to staybehind and reconstitute the Third Reich.Scheel (like Naumann) was eventually cleared of these charges, and he spent theremainder of his life running a medical clinic in Hamburg. All of this onceagain begs the question: why did Pöch and his wife feel the absolute need toleave Europe, when so many of their colleagues—most much more notorious andguilty of greater crimes than they, men like Gustav Scheel—had not? Even morecompelling: did Georg Anton Pöch's documented connection to Scheel provide himwith access to the element of the Ratline operated by Skorzeny and Rudel in theMiddle East and South America? Since Scheel was involved with the NaumannCircle, a pro-Nazi, anti-Communist cabal of former Reich dignitaries andofficials, was something of the sort expected of Pöch as well?CIC AustriaThe immediate post-war period was, as we have already noted, a confusing andchaotic mess of Communists, anti-Communists, fascists, Nazis, and Alliedmilitary and intelligence agendas and personalities. This was especially true ofAustria, and of Salzburg itself, until the Allied occupation of Austria ended in1955.Like Germany, Austria had been divided into four zones by the Allies: theRussian, British, French and American zones, with Vienna as a kind of Berlin,occupied by all four. Salzburg was squarely in the American zone. That did notmean that the Russians, for instance, stayed out of the American zone. Therewere spies from all the Allied services working in all the zones. If oneremembers the film The Third Man one has a good idea of the atmosphere inAustria in those days.The headquarters of 430th CIC (Counter Intelligence Corps) was in Vienna, butthe center of the American zone was in Salzburg, the city where the Pöch couplelived and where Georg Anton Pöch had been medical officer during the war. In1946, the head of CIC in Vienna—Lt. Col. James Milano—had created the militaryversion of the Ratline in order to spirit out of Austria those Allied agents whohad been operating behind enemy lines and who were in danger of being rolled upby the Soviets. He and his colleague—Paul Lyon—were in the process of developingthe false papers and covert transport systems that would enable their agents toleave Austria for safer destinations, out of reach of Soviet spies. At the sametime, there was pressure to locate and identify Nazi war criminals. Initially,there seemed to be no interest by American military intelligence in recruitingSS officers or other criminals. That, of course, would change.One of the most notorious Nazis believed to have escaped via Salzburg to LatinAmerica was Martin Bormann.Paul Manning, the journalist who bravely covered this story in the 1970s, citedseveral instances of persons who claimed to have specific knowledge concerningBormann's escape178 [part0013.html#ft178]. One of these was no less a personagethan Roman Catholic Bishop Johannes Neuhausler of Munich who claimed—in1972—that Bormann had escaped to Spain. Neuhausler (who had been a prisoner atDachau) made this claim based on Church documentation. Even more arresting wasNazi “expert” Hugh Trevor-Roper's own admission (in 1973) that Bormann mighthave escaped.179 [part0013.html#ft179]It is important to point out that the only real evidence of the Bormann “death”in Berlin of 1945 was, once again, dental records and these were, once again,identified from memory by the dentist who had identified the Hitler and EvaBraun dental work.180 [part0013.html#ft180]The theory of Bormann's escape is predicated on the idea that the Reichsleiterhad control over vast sums of Nazi assets that had been transferred from theReich to banks and corporations abroad. The Allies were nervous about thisactivity at least a year before the end of the war, as revealed by declassifiedAmerican and British intelligence records which indicate that money had beentransferred for safekeeping to Switzerland, Spain and Argentina (among otherlocales) in 1944 and 1945.From 1945–1947, the emphasis was on Nazi hunting. The CIC was deeply involved inthe search for war criminals and as such was often stepping on the toes ofBritish, French and Soviet intelligence operations taking place at the same timeand same place, sometimes involving the same wanted men. Beginning in 1947,however, there was a dramatic shift in focus away from Nazi war criminals andtowards defeating—or at least containing—the perceived Soviet threat. Suddenly,Nazis who were highest on the most-wanted list found themselves enlisted in thefight against Communism.There was an active Communist Party in Austria, being supported by the Sovietpresence there181 [part0013.html#ft181]. There was also a battle over the SouthTyrol, which the Allies were intent on delivering to Italy regardless of itslarge ethnic German population. The reason behind this policy was the danger ofItaly becoming Communist; American and British intelligence officers felt thatmoving a large German (and pro-Nazi, anti-Communist) population from Austria toItaly would help keep that country from voting for the Communist Party.Also during this time there were numerous representatives from various SouthAmerican countries combing through the prison camps and the displaced personcamps looking for skilled workers. Countries like Colombia, Peru, Bolivia andBrazil were in the market for electricians, plumbers, carpenters and othertradespeople who would become useful immigrants and help develop their owneconomies. Many of these persons had no identification papers or passports andwere considered “undocumented.” In order for them to leave Europe and immigrateto South America they would need some form of official governmentidentification. Some of this documentation would be provided on humanitariangrounds by the ICRC, with very little in the way of supporting paperwork, thusopening the door for the unscrupulous and the desperate to create a veritabledocument mill of identification papers, visas and passports. It would becomeeasy for those who had every reason to escape Allied justice to make use of thesame mechanisms to effect their disappearance.One of the CIC agents at the center of the storm was William Gowen. Only in histwenties at the time, Gowen found himself stationed in Austria and trying tokeep tabs not only on the Nazis but also on Allied interests where the Naziswere concerned. This was no easy task.Part of the problem arose from the fact that there were competing agendas, evenwithin the same government. Allen Dulles of the OSS had his agenda, as did hisassociate James Jesus Angleton (who would become counter-intelligence chief forthe newly-formed CIA). The military had its agenda, largely (but not entirely),determined by the civilians in Washington, DC.182 [part0013.html#ft182] Add tothat the Vatican's own anti-Communist “crusade,” as well as the Ustashenetwork—the Krizari or “Crusaders”—fighting behind Communist lines in Tito'sYugoslavia, and perhaps a dozen other networks, organizations, and spyoperations and one truly needed a scorecard to keep up.Gowen saw first-hand how the mission changed from one designed to ferret out andarrest Nazis to one designed to ferret out and recruit Nazis. Gowen inheritedFather Draganovic—variously known as the “Golden Priest” or the “Good Father”from Milano and Lyon, with all the trouble involved in trying to control afascist sympathizer within an American intelligence operation. But Draganovicwas eminently useful, for he was a master at running the Ratline: providing theright paperwork, with the impeccable Vatican identification papers, so that theICRC could issue the passports and groups like Vianord prepare the requisitevisas for Argentina and other South American locations. So what if Draganovicslipped a few of his own people down the line every once in awhile?By 1947, however, as the mission changed from prosecuting Nazis to recruitingthem, agents like Gowen found themselves on dangerous moral ground. Gowenresented his role to coddle the war criminals, and made his feelings known in aseries of memos that have become declassified in recent years183[part0013.html#ft183]. But the die was cast: the reason Klaus Barbie lasted solong in Europe after the war, only fleeing to Argentina in late 1950 or early1951, was because he was working for American intelligence all that time.Could this be the reason the Pöch couple lasted as long as they did beforetaking the same route out of Europe? So far, a search of relevant intelligencefiles does not result in their names appearing anywhere, but the author has torely upon declassified files. Considering, however, that most of the high-valueNazi targets had left Europe years before with only those remaining who had somerelationship with Allied intelligence, it seems possible that the Pöch couplewas similarly involved. CIC was evidently aware of the couple—according to thePöch diary—as early as 1946, yet did not arrest either of them. According to thesame diary it was a “Jew” who told them that the local Communist newspaper wouldpublish a story about them, exposing their role in the war, whatever that mayhave been. This is given as the reason for their sudden departure from Salzburgand their wandering around Europe trying to get papers to leave. If they leftSalzburg in 1946 or 1947, then they would have had to use the Ratline to laylow. They would have made for the Tyrol as the most logical choice. Theinsistence of Dr. Sosro Husodo that they went to Yugoslavia is problematic butnot impossible, as we have seen.They could have gone to Graz, as it was in the British zone of occupation at thetime that would have put them within striking distance of Maribor, in Slovenia(part of Yugoslavia at the time). Maribor was the site of a POW camp during thewar, and might have been the “Camp Macorr” Pöch refers to in his diary, for theNazis did regard Maribor (and Slovenia in general) as being German andestablished a German government in the city after the Nazi invasion of June 22,1941.Regardless, the “denazification” of Austria's Nazis had been completed by 1948so that the Pöch couple should have been out of trouble by then. There shouldhave been no earthly need for them to escape after 1948 unless they had othermotivations.Or unless they were not whom they claimed to be.Other motivationsErnst Schäfer of the SS-Ahnenerbe had survived the war and, in 1950, went toVenezuela to conduct ornithological research.184 [part0013.html#ft184] Hiscolleague from the Tibet expedition, Bruno Beger, similarly survived the war andwound up going on expeditions to the Middle East in 1954, 1958 and 1959, alongwith other colleagues from the Ahnenerbe. While reports of the hideousexperiments on human subjects conducted under the auspices of the Ahnenerberendered many of their members unemployable, at least at home, some did manageto eke out an existence and even to thrive. There was still work to be done,after all.As is evident from Beger's attitude towards the end of his life185[part0013.html#ft185] he never abandoned his racist beliefs or accepted anyresponsibility for the crimes he committed. None of the true believers—the realNazis, the committed SS men, the diehard Party members, the race scientists—everabandoned the faith. And a faith it was.A declassified OSS memo marked “Secret” and dated 19 January 1945 bore thesubject line “The Nazi Underground in Bavaria and Austria.” Its source wasFrench intelligence and concerned the organization of the Nazi movement afterthe war, with specific reference to the Tyrol and to Salzburg.Paragraph 5, however, is quite revealing in another way. It reads:However, the Nazi underground is based on a sect of a religious andpolitico-military nature. This movement is conceived as a politico-religiouscommunity of men, fighting to protect the intellectual heritage of NationalSocialism, which must be carefully nurtured until the establishment of ademocratic form of government in Germany will allow them to intervene and takeaction.Paragraph 6 expands the idea:In view of the evolution of the situation in Germany, the underground isconceived as a meeting ground for opposition groups with [radical?] tendencies.The disciples and priests of this movement will have learned, under greatpressure, to take up the work from the beginning, or any point whatsoever.This characterization of National Socialism as a “sect of a religious andpolitico-military nature” is a theme this author has developed in his earlierwork on the Nazi phenomenon186 [part0013.html#ft186]. One has the image of akind of satanic order of knights, meeting in torch-lit caverns and salt mines,taking the oath of loyalty to the Fuhrer. Considering how many of these ritualsactually did take place, especially within the SS, the scenario is not thatfar-fetched.It is important to understand this idea because it is what motivated men likeRauff, Barbie, Skorzeny and Rudel—among many others— to continue their workafter the war. While Rauff and Barbie were military and SS men whose jobdescription included mass murder—and who continued to be involved in military,assassination and espionage activities after the war—others, like Schäfer andBeger, continued the research they had been doing before the war's end. Thedreams of the SS-Ahnenerbe were not dead; their devotees simply—in the words ofthe OSS memo cited above—”will have learned, under great pressure, to take upthe work from the beginning, or any point whatsoever.” They would have wanted toprove themselves to the scientific community at large; they would have wanted tovindicate the principles of Rassenkunde through their expeditions, theirresearch reports, their whole attitude towards science, anthropology andarchaeology.If the couple that arrived in Jakarta in 1954 were in reality the Pöchs, thenthey would have picked up where they left off in 1945. Georg Anton Pöch wouldhave sought another medical administration position, and his wife Hella wouldhave tried to continue her fieldwork in race science. If Georg Pöch had beeninvolved in the euthanasia program in Salzburg, which is likely considering hisposition with the Salzburg Gau, then he must have been tempted to apply some ofthese same principles in Indonesia, at least insofar as he would have been ableto do so without arousing suspicion. Hella Pöch would have found a rich fieldfor anthropometric, ethnographic and other biological anthropology research.Indeed, as we have seen, Brigitte Fuchs claimed that Hella had continued her“biological research” in Indonesia.Indonesia was not Europe, and Sumbawa was far from the center of things. Thetemptation to engage in ethnographic research must have been great, consideringthe wealth of “material” at her disposal. Yet, there is no evidence that HellaPöch engaged in any of that: no evidence in Indonesia, and none in her Europeancircles. If there is any evidence at all, it is buried somewhere in a museum orinstitute in Vienna courtesy of her former colleagues.What if the travels of the Pöch couple were not so much to escape as to continuetheir work elsewhere, outside of Europe? They remained in Europe for six yearsafter the end of the war; did they, like Barbie and so many others in the samecircumstances, work for Allied intelligence in some capacity? Was that sightingof “Hitler” in Slovenia really a sighting of Georg A. Pöch, undercover in somemysterious mission for CIC or MI6? And, when they were no longer of service, didthey use the Ratline to disappear into South America first, and then toIndonesia? A man and wife team of mad scientists, a euthanasia doctor and a racespecialist, collecting specimens for a new collection of skulls and bodies insome more forgiving part of the world?And, perhaps just as importantly, did the arrival of that American hospitalship, the SS Hope, throw a monkey wrench into the system? Did the Pöch couplesuddenly realize that their little sanctuary, comfortably far from the oldEuropean theater of war, now was compromised?The Ratline: Asian DivisionOne of the countries mentioned as represented in the Pöch diary is Tibet. Theappearance of that name may seem outlandish in this context, but there is areason for it.As we have seen, Tibet was a valuable destination for the members of theSS-Ahnenerbe. It had political and military value as well as cultural and“racial.” India was divided in its allegiances at the time, for it was underBritish occupation and Indian nationalists like Subhas Chandra Bose were openlypro-Nazi and admirers of Hitler whom they viewed as a liberator and as an“avatar.” Hitler's symbol, after all, was the swastika: an ancient Indian signof auspiciousness.Tibet was in a similar situation. China had claimed sovreignty over Tibet, andthe Tibetan government wanted assurances from any foreign power that theirautonomy would be protected. It was a difficult situation for Nazi Germany, formost of its military leaders tended to support China against Japan, and wouldhave supported Chinese claims to Tibet as well. However, after a power strugglein Berlin, Nazi Germany came down on the side of Japan against China. That meantthat the Nazis and the Tibetans might be natural allies. Ernst Schafer and hisSS-Tibet Expedition had already formed contacts with the government of the DalaiLama in 1938, and brought back stories of magic and mysticism that titillatedtheir boss, Heinrich Himmler.As the war progressed, however, there was less and less focus on Tibet. The warwas a lot closer to home. But as the war in the Pacific ended in August of 1945,there was a fresh problem to be solved: that of the Chinese Communistrevolution, led by Mao Zedong.The political situation in Europe—the tug of war between the Americans, Britishand French on one hand and the Soviet Union on the other—was now mirrored inAsia. The goal of American intelligence was to do what it could to stop Sovietadvances in Europe; their goal in Asia was to stop the spread ofChinese-flavored Communism in the Pacific.Allen Dulles, now of the CIA, understood that it would be politically expedientto support the regime of the Dalai Lama but only if it could be done covertly.The United States was a staunch supporter of the Guomindang regime on Taiwanthat opposed Mao, but both Mao and Chiang Kai-Shek of the Republic of China(Taiwan) claimed Tibet as Chinese territory. Dulles decided that what he neededwas a properly-equipped and trained Tibetan militia. And to do that he neededguns.China had been flooded with German weapons for decades. Finding ammunition andspare parts for German guns would be no problem; finding the same for gunsmanufactured in the United States or Great Britain would be problematic. SoDulles asked a young CIA agent to scour Western Europe for caches of Germanweapons that could be sent to the Tibetan resistance movement.At the same time, there was a major problem of communication. The CIA had veryfew people who knew the country and the people and no one who was current on thepolitical situation in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. In short, Dulles knew of noone he could trust to carry messages back to the Dalai Lama. He would have topainstakingly develop new assets inside Tibet.By 1953, Dulles had become the director of the CIA and began to promote theTibetan resistance movement energetically. Thousands of Tibetans were trained inNepal and given crash courses in espionage, sabotage and cryptography as well asin the use of modern weapons. What eventually happened, of course, was thatTibet was lost to the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama escaped from thecountry, aided by the CIA.Between 1945 and 1953, when Dulles took complete charge of the Tibetan campaign,the history of the conflict is a little sketchy. Would the CIA have wanted touse Germans who had experience in Tibet, and moreover who had personalconnections to the Dalai Lama? It would seem logical to have hired Schafer andBeger, for example, as CIA agents in Tibet but there is no evidence for this atall. Yet, the CIA had no qualms about using Nazis in important espionagepositions in Eastern Europe to fight the Communists there. Why not in Asia?Skorzeny was already running agents in Egypt; Alois Brunner was in Syria. Somany others were half a world away in Latin America. It makes perfect sense—inthe context of the times, in the context of CIA and fears of a worldwideCommunist threat—to hire Nazis to assist in the anti-Chinese Communist Tibetanresistance movement.And wouldn't an anthropologist like Hella Pöch be a logical choice, if membersof the Ahnenerbe were too notorious to employ in such a sensitive mission?The reader may forgive some of this speculation. After all, we are fresh out ofdocuments where this moment in history is concerned. Ernst Schafer, the fellowrace scientist whose headquarters was in the Salzburg area in 1945, burned hisfiles and records when he knew the end was near. And he was not alone. So manydocuments were destroyed in that period, which may explain why we know so littleabout the Pöchs. We are left collecting and connecting dots where we can. If theman and woman who showed up in Jakarta and later in Sumbawa really were thePöchs, then we have to ask a lot of very uncomfortable questions. We have begunto realize that the Ratline was much more extensive, much more nuanced, andperhaps even better funded than we had been led to believe until now. We have torealize that the Pöchs were most likely war criminals of a very serious nature,with a record every bit as heinous as that of a Mengele or a Rauff or a Barbie.Remember that neither Ernst Schafer nor Bruno Beger needed the Ratline to getout of Europe. These were men with damning histories and sickening lists of sinsto their names. They were race scientists, like the Pöchs, and members of theAhnenerbe whose leader was executed at Nuremberg. They were SS officers, andclose to Heinrich Himmler. But they fared much better after the war than thePöchs. They lived out their lives in Germany, and died peacefully there in thelast few years.On the other hand, the Pöchs needed the Ratline. Even six years after the war'send. They needed the monastery route. They needed Father Draganovic. And theyleft Europe soon after Barbie's own escape, and from the same city in Austria.They either had sinister motivations for doing so, or they were not who theyclaimed to be.Other identitiesAs mentioned earlier, Dr. Sosro claimed that Pöch lived in Sumbawa with a womannamed “Gerda” and a small child of 7 years old named “Frank G. Spivak.” This hasto be a mistake, some conflation of details that Sosro read in the press atabout the same time he was reading about Klaus Barbie and Heinz Linge. Asmentioned in Chapter Five [part0009.html], Sosro's Frank G. Spivak would havebeen about the same age as the real Frank G. Spivak, a convicted serial killerand neo-Nazi. Did Sosro read an account of this killer's rampage in anIndonesian magazine in 1983 when he was apprehended, and then conflate thisstory with that of some other small boy he saw in Sumbawa Besar at the home ofthe “German doctor”? None of the author's efforts to identify where the Americankiller Frank Spivak spent his childhood has yielded a period in Indonesia. Theauthor cannot locate a copy of an Indonesian magazine or newspaper of the timethat carried the Spivak story, but the Indonesian press is a raucous industryand there is every possibility that the story was carried in any one of hundredsof newspapers and other media that the author has been unable to source.The Spivak story nearly thrust a monkey wrench into the investigation, for itseemed too contrived and invented, a detail created to cause a tabloid sensation(“Neo-Nazi serial killer lived with Hitler in Indonesia!”), except that there isno further mention of this boy in any context. Sosro never writes a word aboutthe adult Spivak as a Hitlerloving serial killer. He never banks on thisinformation, but only mentions it in passing. If he did not see a boy with thatname—that very specific name with the middle initial—then why did he mention itand then ignore it?And who was “Gerda”?To make matters more interesting, one of Eva Braun's sisters was namedMargarethe, or “Gretl” for short. It's possible the Indonesian doctor confusedthe two names, but since he got Frank Spivak's name correct one has to give himthe benefit of the doubt.However, “Gerda” is a common German diminutive form of the name Gertrud or, inEnglish, Gertrude. Martin Bormann's wife was named Gerda, but she died in 1946.Eva Braun's closest friend was her cousin, Gertraud Weisker, who spent time withEva at the Berghoff in the waning months of the war. In 1960, she would havebeen 37 years old. “Gertraud” is another German variant of the name Gertrude,and it is not beyond the realm of possibility that “Gerda” refers to Eva'scousin and best friend.Another—albeit remote—possibility is that Gertuud Seyss-Inquart is intended. Thewife of convicted and executed war criminal Artur Seyss-Inquart, the friend andpatron of the Pöch couple, Gertruud escaped from the Netherlands as it wasfalling to the Allies and was never heard from again. The last anyone knew, shewas on her way to Salzburg when she disappeared. Again, Salzburg comes up inthis story in unexpected ways.At this point, the mystery of Gerda and Frank Spivak must remain unsolved.As Sosro continued his investigation, he came into possession of Sulaesih'srecollections as well as of the Pöch documents. He managed to find Sulaesih andto question her about her life with the doctor, and of how she came to findherself in Sumbawa Besar.According to the account published in Hitler Mati di Indonesia, Sulaesih leftBandung for Sumbawa in search of a job. While there, she met and married thenephew of the Sultan of Sumbawa. A year into their marriage, her husbanddeveloped a mysterious disease which is not otherwise described or identified inthe account. She took him to the hospital in Sumbawa, where the Chief MedicalOfficer was Dr. Georg Anton Pöch.It is fascinating to learn that Pöch managed to obtain the same title in Sumbawaas he had in Salzburg. As Chief Medical Officer, it is entirely possible that hewas more of an administrator than a practitioner of medicine; however, themedical situation in Sumbawa was considerably less advanced than what he hadbeen used to in Austria and it is likely that he would have been pressed intoservice as a regular doctor.There is no indication anywhere that he was a surgeon or in any way participatedin operations. There is, however, anecdotal evidence that he diagnosed illnessand prescribed drugs as mentioned in Sosro's account. His wife is conspicuous byher absence in this narrative, and one wonders how she spent her time while herhusband was busy dispensing pharmaceuticals.Sulaesih's husband's condition did not improve. Thus, after several years ofthis chronic illness it was decided that Sulaesih should divorce her husband andseek another.Around this time—in 1964—Pöch's wife left Indonesia, presumably forever. Thereason given in the Sosro account is that she found the climate uncomfortable.However, she did manage to live there for ten years before leaving, which makesthe climate excuse rather less than compelling.The date is suggestive, however.Eva Braun's immediate family enjoyed tremendous longevity, from her mother toher two sisters, all of whom survived the war for decades. Her father, however,died in 1964: the same year that “Mrs Pöch” left Indonesia for Europe.This may be pure coincidence—like the KGB digging up “Hitler's” body less thanthree months after “Pöch's” death in Surabaya?— or it may suggest that Evaneeded to return home for her father's funeral or had been alerted to the factthat he was ill and near death. Whatever the reason, Georg Anton Pöch, the“German doctor”, was suddenly alone in Sumbawa.According to Sulaesih, she knew the doctor's wife and was told by her to “takecare of my husband.” Sulaesih took this to mean she should marry him, eventhough he was thirty years her senior. The reasoning seems rather slim. A moreappropriate explanation may be that Pöch needed a caretaker, someone to lookafter him and essentially function as a kind of maid, cook and nurse all rolledinto one. Another scenario may be that Sulaesih was already having an affairwith Pöch, and that there was pressure in the local community to formalize theirrelationship.In any event, by 1965 the two had married but not before Pöch converted toIslam, taking the name Abdul Kohar, i.e., “servant of the Conqueror”. There areseveral photos of Pöch and Sulaesih at their wedding, showing a ratherexpressionless and taciturn Pöch sitting or standing next to a much youngerSulaesih with a sweet—if somewhat bewildered—smile. There is not very muchinformation on their married life, except for the fact that Pöch would oftenrefer to himself as Hitler in her presence alone and tell his wife not tomention it to anyone. He also told her to avoid political discussions andpolitical activities of any kind with any of their friends or colleagues.According to a friend of Sulaesih, a Mrs. Omik Koswara, quoted in Hitler Mati diIndonesia, Pöch kept himself apart from social events and public gatheringswhenever possible. Her friend Sulaesih had very little to tell her of her lifewith Pöch and, in fact, it would be Sulaesih who often would show up alone whenthe couple was invited anywhere.There is another strange anecdote in Sosro's account that bears repeating here.Sosro states that Sulaesih told him that in 1964 or 1965 Pöch went to Bali tomeet with Konrad Adenauer, one of the more famous and controversial Chancellorsof West Germany. She was impressed with Pöch's ability to meet heads of state,and of the respect they showed him. This would have immediately been a cause forconcern in vetting Sosro's story, because how would it have been possible forAdolf Hitler to meet Konrad Adenauer on friendly terms, as if they were oldfriends and World War Two had never happened? Although Adenauer has been roundlycriticized for placing former Nazis in positions of influence in his governmentand for supporting their reinstatement in German industry, no one has suggestedthat the Chancellor was a Nazi himself. Fortunately, this story is a completefabrication for Konrad Adenauer was not Chancellor in 1964 or 1965, having leftthat post in 1963.And he never went to Bali. The author has this last fact directly from theIndonesian branch of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung in Jakarta, from which it isalso possible to view Adenauer's appointment book and schedule for the yearsafter he left office. It would appear that the German statesman had never setfoot on Bali in his life.Thus, was Pöch merely lying about Adenauer to impress Sulaesih? Did Sulaesihinvent this story, or simply get the name wrong?Or had Pöch been meeting with someone else on Bali?1965 was the famous “Year of Living Dangerously” in Indonesia. There was amilitary coup against the government of Sukarno— believed to have beeninstigated by western fears of Sukarno's connections to the Communist Party ofIndonesia (PKI) and a brutal crackdown by the armed forces took place everywherein the country, including Bali, beginning in October of that year. The massacresthat took place in Bali would have made traveling there—and meeting Germanstatesmen there—highly dangerous and rather unlikely as well. These werevolatile times in Indonesia, yet there is nothing in the Sosro or Sulaesihnarratives that refers to these events.This, unfortunately, is understandable. Few Indonesians will freely discuss whattranspired in those days. It is a very sensitive, very painful subject. It was atime when Indonesians brutally attacked and killed other Indonesians; when thearmy committed what can only be described as atrocities against its citizens;and when resistance groups were quickly and effectively suppressed. One talksabout that period of history at one's peril.What that means, however, is that there are glaring holes in the accounts ofthose days. If Pöch indeed had gone to Bali at this time and met with foreignersthere, they most likely would have been anti-communists of some type. Pöch hadbeen a ranking member of the Nazi establishment in Salzburg; his wife was acelebrated race scholar. They had both attempted to coerce the government ofReich Commissioner Seyss-Inquart to allow them to measure Jews in theconcentration camps. If Pöch had met with anyone on Bali in 1965, it very likelywould have been with other Nazis or their fellow travelers, not official Germanstatesmen.The threat of a Chinese Communist takeover in Indonesia would have worried Pöchconsiderably. If he had any political influence at all he would have put it tothe use of anti-Communist, “anti-Bolshevik” forces. If the reason he and hiswife spent so long in Salzburg after the war was because they were cooperatingwith Allied intelligence (as was Barbie), then it is also possible that the sameintelligence organs made use of Pöch's connections in Indonesia to provideinformation on the political situation there. It is widely understood that theCIA had been involved in the coup that toppled Sukarno. Did Langley reach out toan old friend, an anti-communist crusader like Pöch, in the weeks and monthsleading up to the coup?If this sounds a little surreal, remember that it is Sosro's account, andSulaesih's, that introduces the story that Pöch made a trip to Bali that yearand met with German officials. In the context of 1965, the scenario as presentedhere is the most probable.It also should be remembered that Hjalmar Schacht—Germany's former financeminister and a person of tremendous political and financial influence—made tripsto Indonesia beginning in the mid-1950s. There have been rumors thatSkorzeny—who was married to Schacht's niece—also made visits there. Skorzeny'sactivities in the post-war years were almost entirely devoted to supportingformer Nazis and to propping up anti-communist regimes wherever they could befound, from the Middle East to Latin America to Europe. Skorzeny would have seenin Sukarno a kindred spirit … at least, until the Indonesian dictator beganmaking advances to Communist regimes and flirting with Socialism at which pointSkorzeny would have felt betrayed and would have thrown his weight behind anyfaction able to stop Sukarno before Indonesia was handed over to China as asatellite. This was successfully accomplished in 1966 when General Suharto tookover the government and deposed Sukarno, becoming in the process a dictator forthe next thirty years.Was there a connection between Pöch's alleged visit to Bali in 1965 and themassacre of suspected Communists there the same year? Clearly more research hasto be done, but it is doubtful that any answers will be forthcoming due to thepurging of official records of that era and the reluctance of anyone to comeforward and give evidence against the military or the government. What is knownis that there was a significant Nazi presence in Indonesia from about 1927 tothe end of the war, and that members of the Dutch SS were sent to Indonesia inthe post-war period to suppress the independence movement, even establishing twoconcentration camps there in the process. Pöch arrived in Indonesia in 1954 andthere is every possibility that he made contact with existing members of theNazi underground at that time. After all, he was traveling along the Ratline andno one who used that route arrived in a foreign country without some sort oflocal welcoming network. It is highly unlikely that he would have gone toIndonesia without being assured that he would be accepted, (and not immediatelyarrested), by the government and assisted by local sympathizers or fellow warcriminals. This network would have enabled him to get the job on Sumbawa as a“medical officer,” even though it is probable he was not carrying theappropriate medical credentials (if he had, they have not shown up so far). Theother Nazis—those in Latin America and the Middle East—all had support serviceswaiting for them: temporary lodging, jobs, political connections and protection.Either the government of Indonesia offered this to Pöch, or there was anexisting clandestine network of supporters who did. In other words, the Ratline:Asian Division.Thus, while we are forced to take the story of Konrad Adenauer with a grain ofsalt, there is every likelihood that Pöch did go to Bali in 1965 and did makecontact with “German” officials of some type. While the Sosro/Sulaesih accountseems contradictory and contrived in places, a look beneath the surface of whatthey claim reveals deeper levels of connection, particularly if one understandsthe political context of the times. The Sosro and Sulaesih stories must be readas a kind of coded text, like the Pöch diary itself, which was encoded andintended for the “right” sort of audience.In 1966, Georg Anton Pöch renounced his German citizenship (if he ever had it)as attested by a certificate from the West German embassy in Jakarta that isreproduced in Hitler Mati di Indonesia. It gives Pöch's name and birthdate andbirthplace in Prezmysl (which was not German territory when Pöch was born there,nor was it German territory when the Third Reich was in charge). This adds tothe confusion, of course.In 1967, he is awarded Indonesian citizenship, and this document is alsoreproduced in Hitler Mati di Indonesia. It states that Pöch was born inPrezmysl, Austria.There is not much more to the tale of Sulaesih and her “German” husband. All weknow at this point is that they left for Surabaya in January of 1970 toaccompany a patient to a hospital there. Around midnight, Pöch himself suffereda heart attack. According to Sulaesih, he knew the end was near. By eight pmthat evening, he was dead. According again to Sulaesih, he died with the words“Allahu akbar” on his lips. Muslim custom demands that the body be buried withintwenty-four hours. It is assumed this is what happened. Sulaesih thendistributed all of her husband's books and other belongings to friends andcolleagues, and then retired for the rest of her life to Bandung. All she keptwas his diary, a few photos and some other (Indonesian) documents. There wasnothing left of his European paperwork at all. Georg Anton Pöch, if he truly wasGeorg Anton Pöch, never again saw his homeland. Never again set foot in Austriaor Germany. He died as a Muslim convert on Indonesian soil, with the phrase “Godis great” on his lips.His tombstone was carved with his European name and nothing else. There was aspace for his date of birth, and another for his date of death, but thestonecutter never filled in either. They remained blank for decades, until thestory about the mysterious German doctor made the news in 1983 with Sosro'spublished article that the old man had in reality been the leader of the ThirdReich…and then the story died again, until a few years ago when tests of a humanskull in the FSB (former KGB) archives in Moscow revealed that there was noforensic evidence to prove that Adolf Hitler had died in the bunker. At thatpoint, someone decided to pencil in the date of Pöch's death in 1970.But the date of birth still remains, to this day, suspiciously blank.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------175 [part0013.html#fn175] As mentioned in Chapter Five [part0009.html], one ofhis articles that has survived is “A Diptheria Immunization Campaign inAustria,” co-authored with Charles N. Leach, and published in the AmericanJournal of Public Health, Feb. 1935, p. 113–118. At that time, Pöch is listed as“Georg Pöch, Director, Local Health Department, Eisenstadt, Austria,” whereasCharles Leach is listed as representing the International Health Division of TheRockefeller Foundation. Another article, also coauthored with Leach, appears inthe Journal of Immunology, November 1935, p. 367–369 and is entitled “SchickReactions and Serum Antitoxin Titrations on Children Injected with DiptheriaFormol Toxoid”. These articles were published in the mid-1930s, before theAnschluss when Austria was annexed to Germany in 1938, yet research by BrigitteFuchs has shown that the Pöch couple were already completely “Nazified” as earlyas 1926, and Hella Pöch had published articles on Jewish “inferiority” as earlyas 1934. (See the Brigitte Fuchs article on Hella Pöch, cited below.)176 [part0013.html#fn176] Eberhard Gabriel, Wolfgang Neugebauer, Zur Geschichteder NS-Euthanasie in Wien: Von der Zwangssterilisation zur Ermordung, BöhlauVerlag, Vienna, 2002, p. 268, footnote (“Georg Pöch fled with his wife, theAnthropologist and Race-Consultant Hella Pöch, to Indonesia”) and p. 286(“Whether [Heinrich Wolfer] fled to Indonesia as did the medical officer of theSalzburg Gauleiter, Georg Pöch, is unclear.”) Heinrich Wolfer was an Austrianpsychiatrist attached to the State Hospital in Salzburg; responsible for forcedsterilizations and euthanasia as part of the notorious T4 program. It isbelieved he died during the battle for Berlin on May 2, 1945, but as shown bythis citation, there were lingering doubts. The use of the word “fled”(flüchtete) is suggestive, for it implies that the couple were wanted fugitivesand this is simply not apparent from available documentation. In any case, theydid not “flee” until 1951, fully 6 years after the war's end.177 [part0013.html#fn177] Brigitte Fuchs, “Hella Pöch,” in Ilse Erika Korotin,Wissenschafterinnen in und aus Österreich: Leben-Werk-Wirken, Böhlau Verlag,Vienna, 2002, p. 587–589.178 [part0013.html#fn178] Paul Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, SeacaucusNJ: Lyle Stuart, 1981, p. 15–16.179 [part0013.html#fn179] Paul Manning, p. 16.180 [part0013.html#fn180] Paul Manning, p. 16.181 [part0013.html#fn181] The extent of this support only became revealed whendocuments from the Moscow archives became available after the fall of the SovietUnion. They detail a deep relationship between the Austrian Communist Party andRussia, and the very real danger of a split of Austria into a “west” and an“east”, after the model of West Germany and East Germany. The AustrianCommunists were only able to win four seats in the parliamentary elections of1945, and this brought increased pressure to bear on the Austrian Communistsfrom the Soviet Union…to no avail.182 [part0013.html#fn182] The infamous Operation Paperclip was a US Army programbeing run counter to specific instructions from President Truman not to hireNazi war criminals, and was thus a military operation run without civiliancontrol or oversight.183 [part0013.html#fn183] In San Francisco in 1999 William Gowen appeared as aprosecution witness against the Vatican Bank, the Franciscan Order, the CroationLiberation Movement (the Ustashe) and several other defendants in a lawsuitseeking restitution and the declassification of CIA and other governmentdocuments concerning the Ratline.

Let's hope it all turns out well.—Eva Braun, diary entry dated February 15, 1935It is appropriate to begin this last chapter with a quote from Eva Braun, for itis Eva who most likely is the key to this whole mystery. As everyone searchedfor Hitler—alive or dead—in the last days of the war, no one was really lookingfor Eva Braun. In the first place, her very existence had been a state secretuntil the fall of Berlin. In the second place, those who knew of her consideredher an unimportant, empty-headed girl. While this characterization has beenchallenged of late187 [part0014.html#ft187], it was the operative image at thetime. Who cared about Eva Braun?But if she did survive the war…if she did escape Berlin as historians such asHugh Thomas have suggested…then she holds the answer to one of the twentiethcentury's most enduring puzzles. For where Eva was, there was Hitler. Or, at thevery least, knowledge of his survival and his whereabouts. Yet, she could haveshown up in Berlin in a red dress and dancing shoes, and no one would have knownwhom she was.Hella Pöch's life in Indonesia was also a cypher. Her husband got all theattention, all the glory. No one seemed to know very much about her. She hasleft no trace at all of her existence in Sumbawa. This is totally unlike thehistoric Hella Pöch who was a whirlwind of activity for decades and who heldimportant positions within the anthropological community…but that description isvery like the real Eva Braun. So when Hella disappeared from the scene entirely,no one seems to have missed her or gone looking for information about her. Allthe focus was on her husband, Georg Anton Pöch.The author has spent considerable time, money and effort in the search for thereal Hella Pöch. All he has to show for his trouble is her history up until 1945and even then it is spotty. We don't know how it was possible for her to marrytwo men named Pöch, for instance. Recourse to old phone books and addressregistries from Austria produce very few people with that patronymic. Onewonders if Rudolf Pöch and Georg Anton Pöch were related, but there is no proofof this relationship that the author has been able to find. It seems likely thatRudolf and Georg would have been siblings or cousins, but there is littlebiographical information on Rudolf and virtually nothing on Georg.Then there was Sulaesih, the second “Mrs. Pöch.”The author's attempts to locate and question Sulaesih were constantlyfrustrated. She still lives in Bandung, but she is housed in a very expensiveand fortified estate. How she is able to afford this lifestyle is anyone'sguess. There are what appear to be military personnel involved. She cannotanswer questions about her life with the “German doctor” without other,plainclothes persons present who monitor the conversation. On this subject, theauthor is unable to say more.The same is true of Dr. Sosro Husodo. He also lives in Bandung, in a house thatis difficult to find and set back from the street, with a kind of superintendentwho runs interference for him and who claims no one by that name lives there. Itis Dr. Sosro who still has—it is believed—the original documents concerningPöch's life that he received from Sulaesih, but these may now be in thepossession of the Solonese prince who wrote the book, Hitler Mati di Indonesia,which contains blurry copies of some of these. All efforts by the author tocontact the prince have been similarly frustrated. A curtain has dropped downover this story: an impenetrable fabric of disinformation, misdirection, andsuppressed documents. At least one group of investigators has blamed this on theIndonesian government itself188 [part0014.html#ft188], but at present there isno absolute proof of this.What we do have are bits and pieces of the story and tantalizing clues, againstthe background of the inescapable fact that everything we have been told aboutthe death of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun has been a lie. First it was OperationNursery. Then it was Operation Myth. Nursery and Myth: children, and the fairytales told to them.The intelligence agencies of the world knew of the existence of the Ratline,even before the end of the war. Memos detailing the efforts of the Nazis toexpatriate gold and currency were rife. Operation Safe-haven was designed tothwart those attempts, but as we have seen it failed miserably. Money andpersonnel were being moved abroad with swiftness and precision. Fairy tales wereinvented to discredit Hitler in the eyes of his followers and many of these samefairy tales became the operative narrative after the war.Neutral countries like Spain and Argentina were central to the efforts to saveNazis and their gold. SS officers were sent to these countries to ensure thatthese channels remained secure. And once the money was safely abroad, thepersonnel followed.There is no doubt about the escape of men like Mengele, Eichmann, Rauff,Roschmann, Priebke, Pavelic, Barbie, and so many other war criminals. Theirescape routes have now become a matter of public record. The files have beendeclassified. Most of these men have escaped justice as well. Eichmann wassnatched in a well-publicized raid in Argentina; Barbie was extradited toFrance. For the most part, however, the war criminals thrived in their newidentities, in their host countries. How could they not? They were supported intheir efforts by the Catholic Church, the International Red Cross, Americanintelligence, British intelligence, and the governments of so many countries ithas become impossible to keep it all straight. The program to rescue and hidethese vicious murderers—the Ratline—was practically universal. And these men didnot go quietly into the night; on the contrary, they became very activepolitically and militarily, in Latin America and the Middle East in particular.For them, the war—the real war, the war of ideas, of ideology, of race—was notover. It never ended.The Allies applauded themselves on the success of the Nuremberg trials, and whynot? So many of those responsible for heinous crimes were arrested, tried,convicted and either imprisoned or executed. But it was only a relative handfulof those responsible who faced the well-publicized Judgement at Nuremberg; thebiggest culprits never stood trial.Himmler escaped by taking poison before he could face justice. Bormann was neverfound. Mengele lived out his days in South America.And Hitler disappeared.We can only say with any degree of certainty that Hitler “disappeared.” We knowthat all the evidence we were told existed to prove his suicide in the Berlinbunker on April 30, 1945 was either non-existent or fabricated. The same is trueof Eva Braun. Both of these individuals disappeared. Their bodies did not turnup in Berlin as was claimed by the Russians. The skull they possess is notHitler's (or Eva's) skull. The bodies they burned in 1970 were not those ofHitler and Braun.We are thus left with the inescapable conclusion that both Hitler and Braundisappeared at the end of the war. We would like to believe otherwise. It wouldbe a lot easier to accept the conventional wisdom and “believe” that the twodied in Berlin in April of 1945. But, as we have shown, this story is the resultof something called—rather cynically—Operation Nursery.So, if Hitler and Eva Braun did not die in the bunker as has been claimed, thenwhat happened to them?Hitler's favorite commando—and one of the more prominent administrators of theRatline—Otto Skorzeny laid out one scenario, mapping how Hitler could haveescaped the bunker. The idea that a small private plane could have picked him upand spirited him away to Denmark or Spain was a rumor that had astonishinglongevity in the weeks and months after the war. Hanna Reitsch was specificallyasked about this during her interrogation by American army intelligence, and shedodged the issue by insisting that Hitler was dead. How dead could he have beenfor someone like Reitsch, who was an unrepentant Nazi to the end of her days, atrue believer who it is believed took cyanide herself in 1979?Whatever the actual method of escape from Berlin, there had to be a destination.Hitler knew that the Allies were aware of Berchtesgaden and the estates in LowerBavaria where he and his colleagues had their homes. The Allies were also awareof the possibility that the National Redoubt was a reality, somewhere in thearea between the Tyrol and Salzburg. These would have been dangerous places touse as sanctuary. But it is claimed that Hitler was deathly afraid of theSoviets, and suspected that his body would be mutilated and dragged through thestreets by the triumphant Russians. He also knew that nothing of the sort wouldhappen if he were to be captured by the Americans or the British. If he had tochoose, he would have made for the American or British sectors, to the west, andavoided the east like the proverbial plague.An alternative route would be via plane to Spain. So much gold had been movedthrough Spain and to prop up Franco, and so many preparations had been made inSpain to hide Nazi war criminals on their way to Argentina, that Hitler couldhave been assured of a warm welcome there by members of the German underground.Admiral Donitz, who was supremely loyal to Hitler and who became the head of thegovernment after Hitler's disappearance, boasted of the German Navy's ability tohide Hitler in an overseas sanctuary. Donitz, of course, had served with theU-boat fleet in Spain, as we have seen.Spain didn't lose much in the war. Spain once had colonies in North Africa andthe Philippines. While she lost the Philippines to the United States after theSpanish-American War, her influence in Asia was still very strong. There isevery indication that Spain expected to benefit from Japan's defeat of Americanforces in the Philippines, and the pro-Nazi Falangist groups in that countrywere very active in providing a fifth column to support the Japanese invasion in1941.When Japan's defeat was certain, Spain still had not declared war on eitherGermany or Japan. Franco remained in charge of the government for decades afterthe war, thus ensuring some continuity of the Ratline and of the “virtualRedoubt”. The relationship between Franco and Juan Perón of Argentina wasstrong; an indication of this relationship is the fact that Evita Perón's bodywas taken to Spain and hidden there for years after her death. Meetings wereheld in Spain as late as the 1970s to arrange assassinations of anti-fascistpolitical leaders in Europe and Latin America, all with the blessing of theFranco regime.Thus, while it can be argued that World War Two began in Spain with the CivilWar and the presence of German and Russian troops battling each other in thatcountry, it could also be said that World War Two continued there long after theend of formal hostilities in 1945. Stalin believed that Hitler had escaped toSpain and from there to Argentina; it is a theory that should be revisited now,in light of all the recent evidence demonstrating the weakness of the officialversion of events. While it may be inconceivable to an American—forinstance—that anyone would have protected Adolf Hitler, it is important torealize that there existed in many countries around the world a great deal ofsympathy for the Nazi leader and his ideology. With the Cold War, many otherwiseintelligent and thoughtful military and political leaders decided that thegreatest threat to world peace was “bolshevism”: the Communist bloc in Europeand in Asia, as well as in Latin America. The world became polarized betweenCommunists and anti-Communists, and Nazis were definitely anti-Communists.The nuanced position that Nazis were as much a threat to western democracy asCommunism was voiced by very few. Spruille Braden was one of these, and hiscampaign to rid Latin America of Nazi influence has been well-documented, iflittle appreciated. A committed anti-Communist and conservative Republican, henevertheless understood that Nazis were also the enemy, not a position that waseasy for the more single-minded of his colleagues to appreciate. Braden was theexception, however, and not the rule.When mass murderers were protected by America and other governments…, when theCatholic Church was demonstrably involved in the protection of these samemurderers…and when even the Israeli government decided to use some of these menin espionage activities against their Arab neighbors and to drop theirNazi-hunting activities in order to cultivate trade and military agreementsaround the world…why should any of us be shocked to learn that Hitler may have,indeed, escaped and done so with the cooperation, collaboration and complicityof one or more of the world's governments?The ScenarioHitler and Eva Braun escaped Berlin sometime during April 30, 1945. Other bodieswere burned in the Reich Chancellery garden and left there for the Russians tofind. Dentures were placed in the bodies to provide identification, and thefacial features of the two corpses were burned enough so that absolute visualidentification would be impossible. The bodies were not burned completely beyondrecognition, however. There had to be enough left of them to convince theRussians they had the real bodies.In the case of Eva Braun, a cyanide capsule was broken in the mouth of ananonymous female corpse that had shrapnel wounds. There was no trace of cyanidein the body's internal organs.The Goebbels family did commit suicide. That was an important element of theruse. Goebbels was a true believer and a fanatic; he knew that his death and thedeaths of his wife and children would further reinforce the idea that Hitleralso had committed suicide. The dead dogs were a nice touch. There was no wayHitler could have escaped with Blondi anyway.Hitler had not been seen in public since the July 1944 assassination attempt. Noone had any recent photographs of him at the time. In addition, there were knownHitler doubles in Berlin. The plot to create misdirection—after the manner of astage magician—was in place as early as 1944, if not earlier.With the simple expedient of shaving off his famous moustache and covering hishead with a hat or a blanket, Hitler easily could have escaped Berlin andGermany itself as an old man in a wheelchair. His nurse could as easily havebeen Eva Braun. If they had not managed to get a plane out of Berlin to eitherSpain or Denmark, as has been alleged, then they were able to go via the surfaceroads to another location. A painstaking journey, but who would have questioneda sick old man in Berlin in April of 1945?He could not have traveled so easily without some form of documentation,however. Neither could Eva Braun.Enter the Pöchs.At some point in the last days of the war it was decided that a husband-and-wifescenario would play out best. Those looking for Hitler would not be looking fora married couple, for no one knew that Hitler and Eva were married or that Evaeven existed. But they needed verifiable documentation, real papers but withfalse identities. Like Himmler using the identity of a real German policeman,Hitler and Eva used the papers of a real married couple. They had to beAustrian—Hitler's German might have given him away—and they had to be the rightage. There also should be some physical resemblance.With Georg Anton Pöch they had all of this. With Eva there was a problem, butonly in her age. She was thirty-three at the time of the fall of Berlin. HellaPöch was forty-seven. But by 1951, when the Pöchs left Europe, Eva would havebeen thirty-nine and Hella fifty-two. That thirteen-year difference in theirages could have been compensated for with the judicious application of makeup orsurgery.At some point between April of 1945 and September of 1951, the transition wascomplete. Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun had become Georg Anton and Hella Pöch. Theauthor contends that the identities would not have been used until it wascertain that the Allies had no interest in the Pöchs (which may be related tothe stories of CIC interest in the Pöchs in 1945 and 1946 and their eventualdisinterest after that time). When the dust had settled, the newly minted“Pöchs” would have to leave Salzburg. After all, Georg Anton Pöch had been themedical officer of the Salzburg Gau. He would have been recognized. So theodyssey began: first to Graz in the British sector, then to Slovenia, andeventually to Rome and Genoa. The Pöch diary may very well be genuine; or it maybe something German intelligence had mocked up to provide what the intelligencepeople refer to as “litter”: paper artifacts that help reinforce a falseidentity.Hitler and Braun then make it to South America. The Hitler sighting in Colombiais suggestive; so is the sighting in Brazil. Hitler could not have stayed longin either place, for there were so many Germans already emigrating to thesecountries that it would only be a matter of time before he was identified andthe authorities alerted: by a survivor of the death camps, perhaps, or by alow-level Nazi who wanted to be a hero to the Allies. As we have seen, theIsraelis snatched Eichmann out of Argentina in 1960. While Latin America mayhave been far from Europe, there were still too many possible ways to getidentified and caught.Thus, we can account for the missing years 1951—1953. Eventually, a deal wasstruck with the Sukarno regime to accept a German refugee couple. The passportnumber is troublesome, as it does not match any of the known passports used atthe time by members of the Ratline. However, it is entirely possible that itrepresents an Indonesian immigration permit, something special worked out byDraganovic with perhaps a gold transfer to sweeten the deal. The Indonesiangovernment would not have known whom they were letting into the country. Theywould have been under the impression that it was a Nazi, but not someone veryimportant.Pöch's old job title was “Chief Medical Officer” and the job he eventually getsin Sumbawa is the same. An article is planted in an anthropological journal in1957, purporting to be by Hella Pöch, to reinforce the idea that she was stillalive and working. But she becomes a non-entity, fading into the backgrounduntil 1964 when news of the sickness or death of Eva Braun's father reaches herand she decides she has had enough of the tropical, third world lifestyle andreturns quietly to Europe.Georg Anton Pöch, in order to further reinforce his stolen identity, converts toIslam, takes a Muslim name, and marries an Indonesian woman who more or lessserves as his assistant and nurse. The transformation is complete. Adolf Hitlercompletely disappears.As for the real Pöchs?Buried somewhere in the “National Redoubt” would be the author's guess, a bullethole in the back of each cranium. Another two martyrs for the Reich.All this time, J. Edgar Hoover is looking for Hitler, mostly in Latin America.The Soviets believe they have his body, but they don't show it to anyone. Theybury and dig up the body again and again and, finally, bury it in Magdeburg inwhat was then East Germany.Then panic sets in.A man with the name Georg Anton Pöch dies in Indonesia on January 16, 1970. Agravestone is prepared, but mysteriously no one seems to know the date ofdeath…or the date of birth. Someone in Indonesia knows who Pöch really is, so hecannot bring himself to have Pöch's date of birth inscribed. The stone is leftblank.But someone alerts the Soviets. A body has been buried in Surabaya, andeventually someone will come along and say it's Hitler. But Soviet intelligencehas records to show that they buried Hitler—along with Eva and an entire gaggleof Nazis (and their little dogs, too)—in East Germany. But the records are partof an elaborate hoax that was played on Stalin. The bodies in Magdeburg are notthose of Hitler and Braun. Someone in Soviet intelligence knows this. Theycannot afford the body in Indonesia to be dug up and revealed to be Hitler. Theyhave to destroy their own “Hitler” and remove any trace of their involvement inhis burial. It's called Operation Archive.And then…they wait.The decade of the 1970s comes and goes. Then the 1980s. In 1983, Dr. SosroHusodo publishes his account of Georg Anton Pöch. There is a brief flurry ofinterest, which then dies down almost immediately as “experts” ridicule thestory. The Soviets breathe a sigh of relief. They can now spin the Hitler storyany way they want to.And they do. In 1992, the Russians make public for the first time that they haveskull fragments from Hitler's corpse (a claim that was proven false fifteenyears later). They reveal the existence of the order, signed by Yuri Andropov,to destroy the bodies buried in Magdeburg. The operation was carried out onApril 4, 1970, seventy-seven days after the death of Pöch in Indonesia. Thereason given is they wish to avoid possibility of the burial place becoming ashrine for neo-Nazis.Neo-Nazis. In East Germany. In 1970.And who would have revealed that there were bodies buried in the headquarters ofthe Soviet secret police in Magdeburg? One supposes it would be a logicalconclusion, but seriously would anyone want to dig up what might be oldexecution and torture victims? And what if they had found the bodies—afterfifteen years in the ground—and opened the wooden boxes in which they had beenkept? The bodies had not been embalmed. According to the agents who carried outthe secret mission, the state of the corpses was…well, disgusting. A “gelatinousmass” is how one agent described it. Would anyone really have identified thesegelatinous masses as the bodies of Hitler, Eva Braun, and the entire Goebbelsfamily?This entire account seems doubtful. Another intelligence cover story. And, onceagain, we have to come back to the single most salient point of all: it has beenproven that the bodies the Soviets believed were those of Hitler and Braun werenot those of Hitler and Braun.A ParallelPerhaps it would be useful at this point to introduce a similar story. Amilitary and ideological leader, a rabid anti-Semite, delusional with dreams ofreinstating an ancient Reich, is hunted by the world's democracies. He hascommitted mass murder, and has urged his followers to continue to do so. He isworshipped, almost like a god. His pronouncements are published everywhere. Hisphotograph is an object of veneration. His enemies are the United States,England, Russia, and the Jews. He warns of a global Jewish-Masonic conspiracy.One day he is located in a bunker. He is killed. His body is taken away, and hisremains dumped into the ocean, so that his grave would not become a shrine. Thewest breathes a sigh of relief, even as others plot revenge.We are referring, of course, to Osama bin Laden.The parallels between the two men could not be stronger. And even as bin Ladenwas buried at sea—the same way Hitler was presumed to have had his ashesscattered in the Elbe River—American intelligence warned of the existence of“lone wolf” terrorists who would continue to carry out bin Laden's mission evenafter his death. We remember that American intelligence was concerned about the“Werewolf” operation that was announced by Goebbels: of lone operators who wouldcontinue to harass the Allies after the war was over.This scenario has become iconic. The evil dictator whose body is destroyed andnever found. The belief in his continued existence by his faithful followers.The lack of photographic evidence of his death and burial. The control of all ofthis information by the intelligence agencies. Nursery and Myth, indeed.Until whoever is buried in Georg Anton Pöch's tomb is dug up and identified, wemay never be sure about the truth of this story. It is even possible that no oneis buried in Pöch's tomb. Wouldn't that also go a long way towards explainingthe lack of dates on his tombstone? Maybe Pöch didn't die at all. Maybe he wassnatched—by the Soviets, by the Americans, by the Israelis even—and brought backto an underground cell, a kind of weird exhibit for those with the highestclearance. Who knows? Since we have been lied to so consistently about thissince 1945, anything is possible.If these conclusions and speculations seem wild or paranoid, blame the arroganceof governments and their intelligence agencies that treat the people they aresworn to govern and protect as children who cannot be trusted with the truth,and who are devoted to Hitler's concept of The Big Lie as quoted on the veryfirst page of this book. Cynicism is the gap that separates the governed fromthose who govern; realpolitik is the excuse that is made for the worst sinsagainst the soul of nations. And lies—like the lie about the suicide of Hitlerin the Berlin bunker on April 30, 1945—become the currency for spies andpoliticians alike, to be traded like baseball cards until one has a complete setand can call it “the official version of events.”Did Hitler survive?Look around. Neo-Nazism is on the rise. There is a hard swing to the right inmany countries around the world, some of it provoked by fears of a terroristthreat. The instability of the global economies and the widening gap betweenrich and poor is a familiar precedent for the appearance of populist dictators.Civil liberties are being eroded in the name of national security. Military andpolitical leaders are warming their hands on today's versions of the Reichstagfire. In Latin America and Asia, Hitler is more popular than ever.What the Allies feared would happen, did happen. As the story of Hitler'ssuicide is shown to be unsupportable by the evidence, the resurgence of beliefin this monomaniacal madman and his fanatical ideology of race, purity, andpower is guaranteed. Like Barbarossa, he sleeps in a cave—perhaps in a salt minein Salzburg, or more comfortably in a guest house in Bolzano, in that “monasteryin Tibet” or a tropical island in Southeast Asia—waiting for the hurt, thehateful, and the willfully-ignorant to call his name in their hour of need.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------187 [part0014.html#fn187] See Heike B.

The importance of understanding the Führerprinzip orLeader Principle is demonstrated by the fact that all of the SS ranks (exceptthe lowliest three who are not leaders but followers) incorporate the wordFührer. While Hitler was the Leader—der Führer—he was not the only one. TheLeader Principle was designed around a pyramidal structure of allegiances andloyalties. Every person had a leader above him or her, and that leader reportedto another leader, and so on to the ultimate leader, Hitler himself. Everyoneunderstood their place in the hierarchy and there was no room for positionsoutside this carefully-constructed pyramid.To make it easier to visualize the SS ranks, a table is provided showing themand their American military equivalents. The reader will note the use of theGerman words unter, ober, haupt and sturm. They translate into under, over, highand storm or assault respectively. This is further clarification of thehierarchical system that begins with under and proceeds to assault.SS Rank American Equivalent SS-Anwärter (“candidate” or “aspirant”)RecruitSS-MannPrivateSS-Sturmmann (“storm man”)PFCSS-RottenFührer (“foreman”)CorporalSS-UnterscharFührerSergeantSS-ScharFührerStaff SergeantSS-OberscharFührerTechnical SergeantSS-HauptscharFührerFirst SergeantSS-SturmscharFührerMaster SergeantSS-UntersturmFührerSecond LieutenantSS-ObersturmFührerFirst LieutenantSS-HauptsturmFührerCaptainSS-SturmbannFührerMajorSS-ObersturmbannFührerLieutenant ColonelSS-StandartenFührerColonelSS-OberFührerNo American equivalentSS-BrigadeFührerBrigadier GeneralSS-GruppenFührerMajor GeneralSS-ObergruppenFührerLieutenant GeneralSS-OberstgruppenFührerGeneralReichsführer-SS: This was the title used by Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS"},{"pageContent":"Appendix IIRatline Organization: Names, Groups, CompaniesThe structure of the Ratline is vast and complex. For the most part itexisted—and continues to exist—underground in a world of lies, deceptions,secret meetings, and covert action. However, the last few years have affordedresearchers an enormous amount of new data to understand and organize. Thefollowing breakdown is merely an introduction, a basis from which to develop abetter idea of the breadth of the organization.It should be remembered that the Ratline is not a single corporate entity. It isa loose confederacy of fellow-travelers with a similar worldview and identicalgoals of evading prosecution and continuing their work on the global stage. Itbegan as the war was ending, when the flight of personnel and capital was anurgent requirement. But around those high profile war criminals such as Eichmannand Mengele was an extensive network of safe houses, false documents, slushfunds and secret transportation methods that was run by the lower-level SSofficer, Catholic priest, and Red Cross bureaucrat as well as various pettycriminals such as forgers, smugglers and thieves. In addition, agents of variouswestern governments were also complicit in running the Ratline.Ironically, the combination of these factors makes the Ratline a very real andvery well-documented international conspiracy, far surpassing in its reach anyfevered “Jewish-Masonic” conspiracy that the Nazis themselves imagined.The European ElementThe Ratline can be said to have begun in Austria. Salzburg and Vienna were thehotspots, with an emphasis on the CIC (the US Army's Counter-intelligence Corps)presence in Salzburg whose officers invented the term “Ratline”. The CICutilized the services of Roman Catholic Monsignor Krunoslav Draganovic as wellas other Croatian priests. It is believed by many that Croatian ArchbishopStepinac was also involved in the smuggling of Nazis and Nazi wealth out of thehands of the Communists. Draganovic began the movement of the Ustashe warcriminals to Argentina, and then continued with the Nazis in general using thesame channels via Rome and Genoa.In Italy the major centers were in Bolzano (in the Italian Tyrol), Rome, Genoa,and Milan (and to some extent Bari). These were all run by Catholic clergymenwith an assist by the International Red Cross. Bishop Alois Hudal was based inRome at the Collegium Orientalis at Via Tomacelli 132 which served as a safehouse for men like Franz Stangl. Archbishop Giuseppe Siri was based in Genoa,which served as the major transit point for war criminals fleeing to LatinAmerica. The address of the Genoese safe house was Via Albaro 38. ArchbishopIldefonso Schuster was based in Milan and provided assistance to war criminalssuch as Walter Rauff on their way to Genoa.And the German Archaeological Institute has been revealed in this book to havebeen another leg in the Ratline from its base at Via Sardegna 79.Mgr Krunoslav Draganovic, when he was not in Salzburg working for the CIC and,later, the CIA, was in Rome at the Collegium Illiricum running the “BratovatinaRelief Organization” which was a cover for his Ustashe escape routes.Also in Rome was the headquarters of Caritas, the Catholic relief and welfareagency whose name translates from the Latin as “charity.” The element of Caritasthat was involved in the Ratline was run by Cardinal Montini who later becamePope Paul VI.We must also include the International Red Cross and the International ReliefOrganization as elements of the Ratline. They provided the temporaryidentification documents that the refugees would need in order to obtainpassports and visas.All of the above was in place as early as 1946, if not earlier.In Spain, Madrid was the focal point for the Spanish Ratline as it was thecapital of the Franco regime. Franco was very sympathetic to the Nazi cause andwelcomed the assistance of the Nazi Condor Division in his fight against theSoviet-supported Republicans in the civil war that lasted from 1936–1939. TheNazis were able to use Spanish ports to refuel their U-Boats—the Etappendienstservice that was started by future Admiral Karl Dönitz in World War I—andSpanish banks and corporations to launder their funds.A key figure in the Spanish Ratline was SS officer Carlos Fuldner who beganmaking arrangements to move men and money (particularly gold) through Spainbefore the end of the war, through such front groups as Sofindus. Later, as thewar ended, Hitler's favorite commando—Otto Skorzeny—became intimately involvedwith the Franco regime and the movement of men and money continued. In addition,Spain's close relationship with Argentina and particularly between the nationalleaders Franco and Perón meant that Spain would remain an important element ofthe Ratline long after the end of the war. Franco and Perón were alsoconservative Catholics and saw the Catholic Church as a bulwark againstCommunism; for this reason the Fascist-Nazi-Catholic nexus was an importantfactor in creating and maintaining the Ratline globally, with the Churchproviding both logistical support as well as moral legitimacy.Latin AmericaPride of place in the Latin American segment of the Ratline must go toArgentina. While there was a noticeable pro-Nazi element in Argentina before thewar and a thriving Nazi Party organization there, it was not until the electionof Juan Perón in 1946 that the Ratline could make Argentina its destination ofchoice. Shortly after his election, the number of war criminals fleeing toArgentina increased dramatically.One of the organizations that served to obtain Argentine visas for the refugeeswas Vianord which operated offices in Buenos Aires as well as in Spain. It was atourist agency with no tourists. The European element of the Ratline madeextensive use of Vianord among other agencies and individuals with similarcapabilities in both Argentina and Spain.Cardinal Antonio Caggiano was the Roman Catholic prelate most identified withthe Argentine Ratline. He personally visited Rome to ask the Pope to letArgentina accept war criminals who were still in hiding in that city in 1946.The subject of the Argentine Ratline has been covered extensively by Uki Goñi,but in addition to his work the following sites have been uncovered:Walter and Ida Eichorn of the Eden Hotel, in La Falda, Argentina offered theirresort to Hitler personally during a meeting with the Fuhrer in Berlin in 1935.There have been many rumors that Hitler did, indeed, make it to La Falda afterthe war's end.In addition, areas of Argentina that were known as both remote and hospitable tofleeing Nazis included Entre Rios, Chaco and Misiones. It was an element of theRatline that was financed by Karl Dönitz himself, along with Count Lutz Schwerinvon Krosigk, Hitler's Finance Minister. Dönitz—from his background with theU-Boat fleet, with the Etappendienst, and as the official successor to Hitler—would have been in the ideal position to know of escape routes and to ensuretheir success. Companies such as Lahusen of Argentina served as fronts for Naziorganizations in the country and would have lent their aid to any war criminals,in concert perhaps with the operation at the Eden Hotel in La Falda.But Argentina was not the only country in Latin America to serve as a conduitfor the Ratline. Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and Chile werealso important destinations. In Chile we had a large Nazi Party organizationduring the war. Chilean ambassador to Austria (1964–1970) Miguel Serrano was adevoted Nazi Party member who was friendly with Otto Skorzeny, Hans Ulrich Rudeland Hanna Reitsch, among others, and was thus in a position to assist theRatline using his credentials as ambassador. He was also intimate with theleaders of Colonia Dignidad in Chile, a notorious safe house on the Ratlineroute.In Brazil, the towns of Rio Grande and Casino were populated by immigrantGermans who were pro-Nazi both during and after the war. The Grande Hotel deCasino was mentioned as one of the possible locales of a Hitler sighting in the1940s.Bolivia, of course, became the home of Klaus Barbie, the “Butcher of Lyons”,before he was deported to France to stand trial in the 1980s.The Middle EastSyria and Egypt were the most important sites of the Ratline in the Middle East.More than eighty Nazi specialists in torture and interrogation techniques foundwork with the Nasser regime in Egypt. Johannes von Leers, a friend of GrandMufti Al-Husseini, fled first to Argentina and then to Egypt.Nazis such as Franz Rademacher, Walter Rauff, and Alois Brunner all foundsanctuary in Syria, Rauff being assisted directly by Bishop Hudal and ArchbishopSchuster.Paul Leverkühn, the Bilderberger and Nazi, found refuge in Lebanon.But the most important figure in the Middle Eastern Ratline was, of course, EmirAl-Husseini who raised an SS division to help the Nazis in the Balkans. The Arabresistance to the creation of the State of Israel opened the doors to anacceptance of Nazi influence in the region and some personalities andorganizations became pro-Nazi in sentiment as they accepted at face value thestories of a global “Jewish Masonic” conspiracy to rule the world.AsiaThe Asian element of the Ratline is only being revealed in the present time.Although it is known that many Nazi war criminals wound up in Australia—wheresome are still fighting extradition to this day— Asia has been ignored byhistorians as a potential Nazi refuge. Yet the relationship between crank Germanscientists and the Tibetan government before, during and after the war iswell-known. The search for Hitler in the Ashinoyu region of Japan has beennoted. And, of course, the story of Indonesia and the Nazi Party of Indonesiahas been discussed in these pages. Asia was also a destination for Nazi warmateriel and engineering designs, via the U-Boat traffic from Europe to Malayaand Indonesia, and possibly also for Nazi gold. It is safe to assume that themen running the Ratline did not dismiss any area of the world as a potentialsanctuary, and Asia—due to its remoteness from the European battlefield—wouldhave held some definite attractions.The United StatesThere can be no doubt that agencies of the US government (as well as of theBritish government) actively cooperated in the escape of several Nazi warcriminals. Allen Dulles, William Pawley and Frederick D. Hunt are only a fewexamples of well-placed government agents who were involved in the Ratline. Wemust also consider Operation Paperclip—which brought numerous Nazi scientistsand doctors to the United States—as an element of the Ratline. Klaus Barbie andKrunoslav Draganovic both worked at one time for the CIA with the full knowledgeof their Nazi past.The Roman Catholic ChurchAs we have demonstrated, the Catholic Church was most intimately involved in therescue of war criminals from apprehension and prosecution. Every level ofpriesthood, from cardinals and bishops to priests and monsignors, foundthemselves involved in protecting men like Eichmann, Rauff, Mengele and so manyothers. Church participation extended from Austria to Italy and Spain and thenceto Latin America among the radically anti-Communist and pro-ecclesiasticalregimes in that region.The Eastern Orthodox ChurchThe Eastern churches are nationalistic by nature. Each country has its ownOrthodox Church (Russia, Bulgaria, Serbia, etc.). The Ukrainian Orthodox Churchwas involved in pro-Nazi activities during the war as was the Russian OrthodoxChurch Outside Moscow. An entire division of Ukrainian Waffen-SS was allowed toimmigrate to North and South America as well as to Australia after the war. InSerbia, however, the Orthodox were considered the enemy of both the CroatianCatholics and the Bosnian Muslims, adding to the general confusion. Thus, inaddition to the Catholic networks aiding Nazis there are also Eastern Orthodoxnetworks which should not be overlooked in any investigation. Valerian Trifa, amember of the Romanian Iron Cross (a Nazi organization responsible for warcrimes), became the head of the Romanian Orthodox Church in the United Statesbefore he was identified as a war criminal and fled to Spain."},{"pageContent":"Appendix III:Hitler's DNAOne of the critical factors in determining Hitler's fate has been the absence offorensic evidence that would prove that a skull, a body, or any part thereofactually belonged to the German leader. The skull that was in the possession ofthe Russians for more than fifty years after the end of the war has been shownto be that of an unknown woman. The dental work that the Russians have so farnot allowed anyone to examine would also prove inconclusive, since—as we haveseen—multiples of these dentures were made by Hitler's dentist in Berlin.Thus, we are left with DNA evidence.In 1945, there was no such thing as determining a person's identity on the basisof genetic matching. In the past twenty years, however, DNA tests have become anindispensable tool of law enforcement. This new technology has permitted deathsentences to be overturned all across the United States as innocent men andwomen have been released on its basis. It has also permitted many cold cases tobe resolved, as the DNA of convicted felons have been added to criminalidentification databases, thus linking new prisoners to old crimes.In the event that the body in Indonesia is ever exhumed, or in the event thatother forensic evidence is uncovered elsewhere in the world, the only reliabletool we will have for identifying any given set of remains as Hitler's wouldrely on the availability of Hitler's genetic material for establishing a match.Unfortunately, even though members of Hitler's family have survived the war,they have resisted providing DNA samples to researchers.That hasn't stopped some investigators from procuring Hitler family DNA usingmeans that would not survive a legal challenge, however.In Belgium, Marc Vermeeren and Jean-Paul Mulders have claimed that they had beenstalking Hitler family members for years and insist that they have tracked downall living survivors for a total of thirty-six in Europe and three in the UnitedStates.Most of the European descendants live in Austria—Hitler's home country—undernames they have changed to disguise their lineage. In the United States, thesame strategy was employed. Now living in Patchogue, Long Island—a suburb of NewYork City—they live quiet, unassuming lives. They did not know they were undersurveillance by Vermeeren and Mulders, who took a napkin one of the descendantshad used in a fast-food restaurant and matched it with a sample of Hitler's DNAthey claim they have stored in a safe.They also extracted DNA from cigarette butts and from stamps that had beenlicked by one of the survivors.The type of DNA extracted is from the great-grandchildren of Alois Hitler, theFührer's father. The admissability of this evidence in a legal proceeding wouldbe moot; it was not obtained during a legal search. However, as a means oftesting other evidence in an effort to determine Hitler's fate, it could beworth a great deal. It is entirely possible that Vermeeren and Mulders are theonly people in the world at this moment with a quantity of the Hitler family'sgenetic material, material which could be used to make a definitive judgment asto whether or not the body in Surabaya is that of the twentieth century's mostnotorious political leader."},{"pageContent":"AcknowledgmentsIt is nearly impossible to acknowledge all the people who have influenced theprocess of writing a book. Writing an article or even a short story or essay oneis struck by how many individuals have had some impact on ideas, information,voice, structure, and point of view. How much more so a book, especiallynon-fiction: something that marshalls information from various sources and triesto put a face on events that transpired long ago.If this were an Oscar acceptance speech, I would be getting the five-secondwarning already. I would have mentioned God for some reason, as well as family,producers, directors, a great cinematographer, a charming co-star…and extendedgratitude to the Academy for making the right decision in the face of so muchtalented competition. Instead, and since I have unlimited space and no timeconstraints, I would like to acknowledge the people who in so many ways reallyhelped write this book.Donald Weiser and Yvonne Paglia deserve pride of place because this is not abook that neatly falls into their list as publishers. An investigative work onthe Nazi underground now rubs shoulders with books on spirituality, psychology,Eastern religions, and my own Tantric Temples. I may have taken some chances inhunting Nazi networks in Latin America, Europe and Asia, but they took a chancein deciding to publish the results of my work. History will show who made thegreater gamble!Maya Gabrieli, a friend of long acquaintance, lent her support in so many waysto this and other works and while she is reluctant to take credit she deservesat least this mention. It is due to Maya that I was able to make presentationsbefore various groups in South Florida that were interested in the survival ofthe Nazi underground and the political decisions that enabled the escape of warcriminals for decades. This helped me organize my information and formulate myapproach. For this, and so much else besides, thank you.John Loftus was gracious with his time and information. A well-known expert inthe field of US government collusion in the cover-up of the Ratline, he was ableto guide my investigation into areas I had not considered previously.Nick Bellantoni, the State Archaeologist of Connecticut, was equally gracious.He had gone to Moscow to examine the putative Hitler skull and who had come backwith fragments to be tested, thus proving that the skull in question did notbelong to the Fuhrer (the story that is told in these pages). As anarchaeologist, Dr Nick gets involved in the strangest cases, including thefamous “vampire” graves in eastern Connecticut, but is always a calm andrational voice in the midst of the hysteria. While he believes that Hitler did,indeed, die in the bunker his investigation of the Hitler skull was a criticalfactor in my decision to take the Indonesia story seriously.Uki Goñi was kind enough to respond to emails concerning the International RedCross passports, which was important to my understanding of the documents usedby Pöch when he entered Indonesia. Uki is probably the best-known researcher inthe field of the Nazi networks in Argentina, working from the Argentine side.His contribution to the knowledge we have of how the ODESSA organizationsfunctioned is invaluable to all of us who work in that area.Heather Pringle was a great help in the writing of this book as she and her teamprovided some important documentation concerning the German ArchaeologicalInstitute. Her book on the SS-Ahnenerbe is the definitive text in English onthis bizarre organization. Her kindness and willingness to help in this endeavorwere deeply gratifying.Clemes Brünenberg of the Deutsches Archäological Institut was helpful inanswering email inquiries about the current state of research into theInstitute's war time activities.Marc Frings of the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung in Jakarta, Indonesia was atremendous help in enabling me to prove that Pöch could not have met Adenauer inBali as was claimed by his Indonesian widow.Joseph Farrell toils in the same vineyards. His inexhaustible energy when itcomes to writing and thinking about the effect the Nazi underground has had onmodern politics and science is astonishing. I am in debt to his published workon Nazi scientific experiments and projects which by now has become an imposing,and heavily-documented, ouevre.Journalist Tom Beyerlein helped in my research on the background of Ohiomurderer Frank Spivak. It is one of the strangest elements of the Indonesianstory, and one that has yet to be understood.Annie Azzaritti was supportive through the entire arc of the project, from thediscovery that there were strange Germans in Indonesia who might have been Nazisto the idea that one of them might have been Hitler. We have collaborated on anumber of television documentary projects, and she has been gracious enough tointroduce me to many of her associates and colleagues in Los Angeles with whomwe have been brainstorming concepts on how to treat this story in the bestpossible way. A good friend and a helpful colleague, Annie has never wavered inher belief that this would make a good documentary some day!James Wasserman. What can I say? I have known Jim for decades and his aestheticsense as well as his grasp of historical realities contributed to the completionof the artifact that is now in your hands. The revelation that the USgovernment—as well as the governments of many other nations—actively orpassively collaborated in the escape of war criminals and in the establishmentof their underground networks is not an easy one to stomach, let alone digest.Throw in the Catholic Church and the Red Cross, and one's belief in the inherentgoodness of the human race is sorely tested! But Jim has never lost his moralcompass, even in such heavy electromagnetic storms.It is also necessary at this point to mention my Indonesian partners in thisendeavor. Indonesia is not an easy country to move around in, or to understand.It is a complex matrix of cultural relationships and influences that involveslanguage, religion, politics, history, and mysticism. An Indonesian wouldprobably not compartmentalize her life the way I have just done, and this is thestrength of the culture.That said, the one person who helped me the most on this project desires not tobe identified. I was fortunate enough to have enjoyed the partnership of variousindividuals associated with the Universitas Gadjah Mada in Yogyakarta, but theyare in no way responsible for the conclusions I have drawn or for the way I havedescribed Indonesian history in these pages.In addition, all attempts to contact the authors and publishers of the twooriginal Indonesian-language texts on this subject were met with silence. Muchof their work had to be independently verified, and this is where my story beganas I deconstructed the events described in their books. There were errors intheir work, errors of fact mixed with errors of understanding European historyand the war, and these I believe I have addressed and answered. In the end,however, the story of Georg Anton Pöch is a remarkable one—whoever he was, andwhatever he was up to in Indonesia—and it is to those Indonesian authors that Iam grateful for sending me off on this wild ride.It is customary at some point to include thanks to more intimate members ofone's immediate circle: spouse, children, siblings, parents, brothers-in-law,family friends, pets, imaginary playmates, stuffed animals, spirit guides, etc.The nature of this work, however, and the possible reception it may receive incertain quarters, makes me hesitate to unburden myself of familial referencesfor their safety as well as my own. As someone who has received threats in thepast, it seems that discretion is the better part of advertisement, and for nowthat is how I will leave it. However, you know who you are, and you know thecontributions you have made, and you know how grateful I have always been.Thank you!Peter Levenda2012, The Year of Living Dangerously"},{"pageContent":"BibliographyThe primary source material supporting the contentions made in this book comefrom declassified American, British and Soviet files, most of which only came tolight in the last ten years. The Soviet files on Hitler's death had only beenpublished in 2005, fully sixty years after the end of the war, and Americanintelligence files from World War Two are in the process of being declassified.Those that have already been released still, in some cases, contain portionsthat have been redacted.Aside from the FBI, OSS, MI6 and CIA files that have been cited in the text,secondary sources include the following. It should be noted that some of theresearch done on the Nazi underground outside of Europe was published as earlyas 1939; there was thus an abundance of evidence to support the contention thatthe Nazis had escape routes in place at the time the war started, using theirexisting intelligence networks in North America, Latin America and Europe. Therewas a strong Nazi presence in Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Colombia and elsewherein Latin America since the 1930s and those files—when they exist—also are beingdeclassified and revealed, albeit in piecemeal fashion.There are two excellent online sources for declassified government files, andthey are Paperless Archives (http://www.paperlessarchives.com[http://www.paperlessarchives.com]) and The Black Vault(http://www.blackvault.com [http://www.blackvault.com]). The interested readerwill find many thousands of scanned files on these sites. Paperless Archives isa great source for World War Two-era files, and The Black Vault specializes inFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) declassifications. Both come highlyrecommended. One can, of course, download some of these files from the FBIwebsite as well as several other US government sites, but the value in PaperlessArchives and the Black Vault rests in their organization of the files intospecific categories that make the investigator's life easier. Also, in the caseof Paperless Archives, one is able to purchase DVD-ROMs with the entire filesets which means less on-line browsing and downloading.Andrew, Christopher & Mitrokhin, Vasili, The Mitrokhin Archive: the KGB inEurope and the West, London: Penguin, 2000Artucio, Hugo Fernandez, The Nazi Underground in South America, New York: Farrar& Rinehart, 1942Basso, Carlos, El ultimo secreto de Colonia Dignidad, Santiago (Chile):Editorial Mare Nostrum, 2002Bellant, Russ, Old Nazis, The New Right, and the Republican Party, Boston: SouthEnd Press, 1991Bird.
