[{"pageContent":"undefined"},{"pageContent":"$26.95More than thirty years after his first investigation of the Naziunderground—which saw him detained at Chile's notorious Colonia Dignidad—PeterLevenda has returned to his quest for the truth about the genuine character ofthe Nazi cult and the people and political movements it has influenced in thedecades since the end of World War Two.The wide sweep of this investigation moves from a Ku Klux Klan headquarters inReading, Pennsylvania, to the New York City office of the Palestine LiberationOrganization; from the apartment of a notorious neo-Nazi leader, to an Islamicboarding school—headquarters of the man who ordered the Bali Bombings. WhenLevenda uncovered the existence of a Nazi underworld in Asia, the nexus ofreligion, politics, terrorism and occult beliefs was revealed to be the realdomain of the threat to global security.This book will challenge all you are accustomed to believe about such subjectsas the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist terrorism; about Tibetan and ZenBuddhism; about such popular concepts as ODESSA and the underground Nazi networkthat has been financing global terror since the postwar period; and even aboutthe alleged death of one of history's most infamous killers, Adolf Hitler.Meticulously researched—from archival material and declassified intelligenceagency files, to personal interviews and investigations undertaken in Asia,Europe, and Latin America—The Hitler Legacy is the story of how the mistakes ofthe twentieth century have come home to roost in the twenty-first. The failureof American, British and Soviet intelligence agencies to hunt down Nazi warcriminals and disrupt their networks meant that we were unprepared when asimilar enemy decided to use the same structures to prosecute their campaigns.Both the Nazi and jihadist networks are composed of nonstate actors involved inasymmetrical warfare against identical enemies. Both are fueled by ideologiesthat combine apocalyptic fanaticism and anti-Semitism with a rabid hatred ofWestern “decadence.”This book further documents how the cynical manipulation of religion (includingChristianity, Islam and Buddhism) and the politics of the post-war periodresulted in the devastating experience of the September 11, 2001 attacks on NewYork and the Pentagon. lire failure of such policies continue to influence—andthreaten us—today.This is a book for those engaged in religious, esoteric or spiritual studies aswell as those with an interest in world politics, history and terrorism.PETER LEVENDA is the author of a number of works on esoteric and politicalsubjects, including his two bestselling books on Nazi ideology: Ratline: SovietSpies, Nazi Priests, and the Disappearance of Adolf Hitler and Unholy Alliance:A History of Nazi Involvement with the Occult. He is also the author of thethree-volume study of the influence of esoterica on American politics, SinisterForces: A Grimoire of American Political Witchcraft.

It can be lost after youhave won it—if you are careless or negligent or indifferent.—President Harry Truman, Radio Address, August 9, 1945It is not mere chance that millions in Germany are of the holy conviction thatNational Socialism is more than politics, that in it the word and the will ofGod proclaim itself, that the bulwark it has created against Bolshevism wasconceived on higher inspiration as the last salvation of Occidental culturebefore the threat of Asiatic atheism.—Joseph Goebbels, From Kaiserhof to Reich Chancellery, 1934."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONIn the early morning hours of Saturday, October 11, 2008, the government-issuedVolkswagen Phaeton V6 luxury sedan sped along the slick road outside ofKlagenfurt, Austria. There was little traffic at that hour, and the driver wasconfident of the road having driven it for much of his life, and having been inan accident previously, was especially cautious. But, after all, the Phaeton wasa top-of-the-line automobile with an excellent safety record and numerousfail-safe features such as anti-lock brakes, a traction control system, and anelectronic differential lock that transfers power from one wheel to another whenthe first one is going faster than the second.The posted speed limit was 42 miles per hour.The driver was doing 88.He had had a few drinks that evening and was feeling no pain. It was a time tocelebrate, after all. His party had won another resounding victory and it meantthat the Bruderschaft was even more firmly entrenched in the Austriangovernment. Their position on immigration was one major factor in their success.Of course, his deputy had made the mistake of using the word in public thateveryone used in private—Umvolkung—a word from the past that was used to referto ethnic cleansing, and was criticized for it immediately. But it was there,out in the open, and anyway it was ten years ago and didn't seem to harm hisparty's position.There was a car in front of him, going painfully slow, so he swerved around itand continued on his way. The steering control of the Phaeton was excellent. Onefelt truly in command of the car, as it responded to every touch.He had segregated the Austrians from the Slovenes, and removed public signswritten in Slovene. What was the point of coddling Slavs who happened to live inAustria? If they wanted to be Austrians, let them speak German. Until they did,they were to be as isolated as possible from Austrian public life. It wasanother victory for his party, and another reason he won the last electioneasily.For a moment he thought of Huber. Poor old “Ahmed” Huber, the Swiss patriot whodied a few months before. Another of the old guard, a man who representedright-thinking, right-acting men of Aryan ancestry. His “conversion” to Islamdidn't fool anyone, of course. Huber was much more “out there” than he couldafford to be. No pictures of Hitler or the Ayatollah in his house! No point inexercising all the lumpen proletariat with their survivor guilt and liberalideas of atonement. Huber was visible and vocal, and he got shut down. Theyclosed his banks and his financial networks ... or thought they did, anyway.He smiled.It was pleasant to drive a little drunk, he thought to himself. The speed, themotion, the scene outside the windshield, the control of the five thousand poundvehicle on the polished black macadam in the early morning ...His parents. His parents had been Nazis when it was illegal, back in the daysbefore the Anschluss. And they paid for it after the war, his father reduced tomanual labor, digging graves, and his mother reviled and forbidden to remain ateacher. Why was he thinking of his parents now? Would they have been proud ofthe way he validated their sacrifice by bringing the old ways back to Austria?He thought briefly of Stefan, and tried to block the thought from his head. Theyhad quarreled, as usual. That's why he was a little drunk right now. Had todrown his anger and his sadness somehow. His wife would never understand. Whatdid women know or understand about men, really?His mother, now, was a real woman. He was on his way to her birthday party thisvery day. She will be ninety years old, he thought with something like pride. Atrue nationalist, like her husband. A smart woman. Accomplished. Faithful to herconvictions. She was born just as Germany was losing the First World War, andthen had to watch the Third Reich defeated in the Second World War. But stillshe hung on.Lights in front of him. Another car. Damned slow, too.He swung the wheel too sharply to the left to pass, and something went wrong.All those safety features. Air bags. Anti-lock brakes.Suddenly he was in the air, rolling over and over, and then it was finished.The newspapers and electronic media reported that Jörg Haider, the Governor ofthe Province of Carinthia, in Austria, far-right demagogue and apologist for theNazi regime, had hit a lamp pole going 88 miles per hour in a 42 mile per hourzone. His blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit, but there werethose who were certain he had been assassinated. That someone knew of hispenchant for speed, and tampered with his state-of-the-art braking system.Soon thereafter news of Haider's financial relationships with Saddam Hussein andMuammar Gaddafi became public knowledge. Millions of dollars had passed throughHaider's hands to a series of blind accounts in Lichtenstein. Handwrittennotebooks were discovered. Files accessed. Suspects questioned. The darling ofthe New Right in Austria, the man some called the “Yuppie Fascist,” had beendealing with Arab dictators and providing some kind of service for them whichhas yet to be identified.That same year I returned to the United States after an extended stay inSoutheast Asia where I was researching the material that became Ratline. While Igreeted the news of Haider's death with mild interest, it was the revelationconcerning his longtime relationship with Saddam and Gaddafi that attracted myattention. That was because the object of my research was an Austrian, too: anAustrian doctor who fled to Indonesia after the war, converted to Islam, andnever set foot in Europe again. In Indonesia, they say the old doctor was noneother than Adolf Hitler. While I understandably was far from convinced as to theaccuracy of that claim, what the research proved to me was that there had beenan extensive Nazi network in Southeast Asia before, during, and after the war.Further, that Nazi funds had made their way from Europe to Indonesia and mighthave been used to overthrow the government of left-leaning Sukarno in favor ofthe more right-wing, anti-Communist leader General Soeharto, as the involvementof former Reichs Finance Minister Hjalmar Schacht would imply.Since then I have seen documentation that proves beyond any doubt that networksexisted after the war to assist Nazi war criminals in their escape and survival,and that these networks were far more pervasive than even the fantasies ofFrederick Forsyth and Ira Levin would have us believe. More to the point, theevidence that there existed (and still exists) a strong relationship betweenunderground Nazi organizations and underground “Islamist” organizations isstrong, incontrovertible, and deeply troubling.In addition, documentation has become available—some of it recentlydeclassified—to show that these networks were relegated not only to LatinAmerican dictatorships and “banana republics” but to nations in the Middle East,Asia, and North America. The number of Nazis who “converted” to Islam after thewar is astounding. The number of Americans who participated in the Naziunderground is even more astounding.When we discuss the rise of what the press calls “jihadism” or “Islamistfundamentalism” or “Islamist terror cells,” we have to put these terms and whatthey represent into context.This is the Hitler Legacy. From terror bombings in Europe in the 1960s and1970s, to assassinations of political leaders around the world, to drug-runningand arms smuggling, to Operation Condor, and all the way to the events ofSeptember 11, 2001 what we have to confront is the possibility that ourgovernments and our intelligence agencies have become Sorcerer's Apprentices.Like the Disney movie, our Mickey Mouse savants and spies have clumsily summonedforces beyond their control. What began as an effort to contain the Soviet Unionand the Peoples Republic of China has become the template for a campaign ofglobal terrorism directed at us.This is that story."},{"pageContent":"A PERSONAL NOTEHistorians often write about events that transpired long before they were born,or at least events that had taken place without their involvement. The NewJournalism school has not had much of an impact on academic historians whoprefer the purely objective recitation of facts and the sober, impersonalanalysis of same. Subjectivity is the domain of the blogger, the journalist, thenovelist. Ernest Hemingway and Norman Mailer could be in the middle of importantpolitical events and write about them eloquently but it's not “history”. You canhave a Michael Taussig in anthropology, with a chatty and sometimes confessionalstyle, and he is still an anthropologist because this is, after all, apost-modern (or a postpost-modern) era, except when it comes to the writing ofhistory. There can be no subjectivity in history for history, after all, is therecitation and analysis of facts. As the saying goes, “you're entitled to yourown opinion, but not your own facts.”There are those of us, however, who realize that history books are as fictionalas novels. That is why Mailer and Truman Capote were comfortable with the“non-fiction novel” as a genre. One may pose as an objective observer andrecorder of historical fact, but the selection process itself—which facts toinclude, which to exclude— reveals the potential for all sorts of novelisticforeplay. Add to that the truism that the victors write the history books, andone realizes that much of what we think we know is wrong or at best woefullyincomplete and biased: like a criminal case in which everyone knows thedefendant is guilty but the jury returns a different verdict, either based on atechnicality or due to solidarity with the accused. The fact of the case is the“not guilty” verdict, regardless of who actually pulled the trigger.So it is with history.I have had the fortune to become involved in some seminal historical events,either through accident or because I was bold enough or stupid enough to becomeinvolved. My connections were largely indirect, but they were there. Forinstance, my youthful obsession with Arabia.I had been interested in the Middle East since I was in primary school. Theimpetus was an event that I will never forget: going with my sixth grade classto see Lawrence of Arabia when it was released. It was considered an educationalfilm, and there was a great deal of promotional material available at theschool, including maps, posters and the like. I paid attention to none of it atthe time, but sitting in the huge theater (in those days movie theaters werelarge, single-screen affairs with excellent sound systems) and having that filmwash over me in all its exotica and with that rousing score by Maurice Jarrecaused an emotional and psychological resetting of my entire being.Here was an outsider, an Englishman, leading Arab tribes in battle against amechanized enemy, blowing stuff up. He wore Arab robes, and understood Arablanguage and culture. As I found out later, he was also quite short. I wasdiminutive as well, especially during primary school when I was the shortest kidin the class every year. (I grew twelve inches the year I reached puberty.) Iwas also an outsider. I had tested in the genius range that year, and waslargely understood to be teacher's pet - or I should say “teachers's pet” sinceteachers from other classrooms came to gawk at me when the test results werereleased. Nonetheless I had poor social skills, and was daily the target ofbullies.But here was an actual person, an historical figure, who had the sameshortcomings (no pun intended) as I did and who found a way to overcome them bysimply ... going somewhere else. He used his intellect, his creativity, and hisdetermination where others might have been gifted as more physically imposingand socially-comfortable. He had a problem with authority, and so of course didI, beginning with the nuns in Catholic school and extending to virtually anyonewho tried to tell me how to behave or what to do, or who criticized my stutteror my poor posture or my silence in social gatherings. I found I did not reallyoccupy my physical space; I did not own it. I was not really in my body, atleast not until I had emergency surgery for a collapsed lung when I was in myearly twenties and for the first time in my life felt like a human being withphysical substance. Corporeality.As I grew older, I realized that my salvation lay outside the country. I had totravel, to see the world, to find the place where I could fit in and be acceptedas who I am and not have to adapt to the expectations of others. I studiedforeign languages and realized I had a knack for them. I copied foreign wordsand phrases I came across in my reading—and I read a great deal—and memorizedthem. I was a failure at Latin with all of its rules and tables, but somehowfound French easy. And later, Spanish. And eventually Mandarin after a briefforay into Church Slavonic. I couldn't find anyone to teach me Arabic in thosedays (pre-Internet, pre-personal computer, pre-Rosetta Stone) so I did the bestI could with what I could find, and prepared myself for a possible future.Now here I was, forty years later, walking through the Javanese rainforest insearch of Nazis and temples. I already had decades of foreign travel under mybelt. Had risked my life in South America. Had been a business executive inEurope and China. Had lived in Malaysia, awakening each morning to the cry ofthe muezzin from a dozen mosques. In China, I had worked with the People'sLiberation Army. A military limousine with a uniformed driver would pick me upeach day from the Beijing Hotel and drive me down the rainswept streets toanother meeting, another discussion. In Malaysia, I drove myself (on the otherside of the road, Malaysia being a former British colony) and visited governmentagencies, high-tech centers, computer network device distributors. It was alwaysdifferent, and I was exposed to such a variety of cultures one would think itwas enough for any one life. But my worldly trajectory was somewhat different.In 1968, I met with Dr. Izzat Tannous who at that time was running the office ofthe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in New York City, close to theUnited Nations. I had been startled by the Six Day War between Israel and Egyptthat had taken place in 1967 and was still in the throes of reading all I couldabout T.E. Lawrence and the Arab Revolt. I began researching the Six Day War,writing letters to foreign governments, to the chambers of commerce of MiddleEastern countries including even the Tru-cial States (I had read and beencaptivated by The Doomed Oasis by Hammond Innes) and always asking for moreinformation. When other teenagers were cramming for tests or looking for ways toget lucky with girls, my interests were clearly elsewhere. I received a replyfrom the PLO and an invitation to come down and see them at their office.The headquarters of the PLO Mission to the UN (they had observer status sincePalestine was not officially a country) was in a non-descript office building onSecond Avenue in midtown. The door was reinforced steel (alone of all the otherdoors in the same corridor) and locked. I had to knock quite loudly, which was abit disconcerting, and a woman's heavily-accented voice called out from behindthe door asking who I was, which was worse since I had to identify myself in anequally-loud voice believing there were FBI agents hiding behind the oppositedoor recording every word. I said I had a meeting with Dr Tannous, and theGerman-speaking assistant finally let me in.Dr. Tannous was a dapper man, thin and elegant. He had authored a book on theoccupation of Palestine by the Israelis, based on British reports of the time(the 1940s) during which Menachem Begin was said to have described the Britisharmy as Nazis. His son also happened to be there, and we had a lively discussionon the situation in the Middle East and especially that of Palestine and Jordan.The purpose of the PLO in the United States, he said, was not to recruitfighters against Israel but to educate Americans as to the reality of thesituation in Palestine so that they would withdraw their unconditional supportof Israel. The PLO had printed pamphlets condemning the alleged use of napalm byIsrael against Palestinians, among other issues, and they were almost timidlytrying to convince Americans that their cause was just. I never saw Dr. Tannousafter that meeting.A little while later, he was replaced by Sadat Hassan, an altogether differentadministrator. Where Dr. Tannous was slender and charming, Hassan wassolidly-built and aggressive. I met him perhaps two or three times in the late1960s-early 1970s and maintained a basic sort of correspondence, includingreceiving in the mail one day a letter signed by Yassir Arafat himself. My lastmeeting with Sadat Hassan was instructive, or at least it now seems instructivefrom the remove of decades: he had arranged for me to join the Syrian OrthodoxChurch as a clergyman if I so desired, my having left the rather more poisonousembrace of another Eastern Orthodox church which served as a front for Americanintelligence, about which more later. It was his ability to coordinate a networkthat was composed of Muslims and Christians (both of which were pro-Palestinianand anti-Israel) that interested me and made me realize that the political issuewas a bit more complex than I had thought, or that had been discussed in thepopular media.Of course, meeting with the PLO in New York did cause me some problems. One daycoming out of my parents' home in the Bronx my photograph was taken with awide-angle lens from a car parked across the street. This same incident would bereplayed years later, during the first Gulf War when I was photographed onceagain; but by that time it was anyone's guess what had triggered that particularepisode for by then I had met Nazis, Klansmen, Satanists of various disciplines,strange churchmen, Black Panthers, the Weather Underground, met Irish radicalBernadine Devlin, as well as an ex-CIA officer, and had traveled to SouthAmerica to stumble into an interrogation center in the Andes.I got my first full-time job in the garment district of New York City in 1970,and held a variety of other jobs until I finally joined the Bendix Corporationin 1973, at their International Marketing Operations on Broadway. While there, Iwas exposed to the militaryindustrial complex in a very real way as ouroperation was staffed by personnel from all over the world, representing everykind of political ideology and ethnicity, united in the desire to make millionsin the defense business. We supplied guidance systems to Asian customers,sophisticated radar equipment (to Pakistan, as an example), and almosteverything we made to the Shah's Iran. I worked with Muslims from Guyana,Germans with questionable pedigrees, a Dutch submarine commander, and a salesrep from Venezuela who showed up at our offices wearing sidearms and cowboyboots.It was during Watergate, and it was reported in the New York Times that Bendixwas used as a cover for intelligence and military training operations around theworld. I witnessed reams of computer printouts being shredded at our offices atthat time, as some of the financial arrangements we made with our far-flungnetwork of sales representatives and agents would have revealed some darkertruths. The Yom Kippur War broke out in 1973, the first year I began working forBendix, and tensions were strained between some of our personnel. A monthearlier, the administration of Salvador Allende in Chile was overthrown in amilitary coup supported by the Nixon administration. It was also the year of anIsraeli invasion of Beirut, at which time our sales office there was in themiddle of the free fire zone, our only link a sputtering telex machine. We wereengaged in monitoring all of this activity worldwide and in some cases activelysupporting one side or another with emergency shipments of spare parts, avionicsequipment, and the like. In 1976, the head of Bendix—W. MichaelBlumenthal—became the Secretary of the Treasury under President Jimmy Carter.Blumenthal was a German Jew who had been raised in Shanghai during the war andwho spoke fluent Mandarin and Shanghainese.It was that kind of time.Then, in 1980, I began working for an Israeli bank. Headquartered at RockefellerCenter, it had been the site of the original Tonight Show studio. I worked therefor four years, before my entry into China trade in 1984.1[../Text/part0007_split_001.html#intro-aft1]I am telling you all this because as I report on the events that follow it isimportant to understand that I have a context for this information, and to knowwhat that context is. Naturally, most of what I relate is carefully sourced andfootnoted where possible; but it was due only to my own proximity to theindividuals and the groups in question that I was able to piece together thevarious, seemingly disparate, elements that make up the larger narrative.Maybe what I am writing will annoy more mainstream historians. Maybe this issomething different, a kind of anthropology of political and religiousextremism. No matter what, the facts remain as facts. This is not conspiracytheory, commonly understood. I don't have a theory about any of this; it doesn'treally need one. The facts as they stand are damning enough.We have to stop being drunks. We have to stop looking for our keys under thestreetlamp because the light is better there. We have to look where we lost ourkeys in the first place: in the darkness and the shadows. It's harder, sure, butwe have a much greater chance of success even though what we blindly touch andfeel in the stygian night might make us squirm in revulsion. Regardless, ourkeys are there.1 [../Text/part0007_split_001.html#intro-ft1] Some of which was described in myThe Mao of Business, New York, 2007."},{"pageContent":"PART ONEORIGINS OF 21ST CENTURY CONFLICT"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEAMERICAN REICHBetween 1933 and 1941, at least 120 anti-semitic groups were founded in theUnited States, and that figure excludes most of the ethnic fascist movements.—Philip Jenkins, Hoods and Shirts, 1997The story of Jörg Haider is not an isolated one. Austria has been strugglingwith Nazi and pro-Nazi groups since long before Anschluss made the land ofMozart and kaffe klatsches a part of the Third Reich. Hitler, after all, hadbeen born and raised in Austria. Many of the Reich's most notorious and violentNazis were Austrians, such as Ernst Kaltenbrunner. Haider's parents had beenNazis in Austria when it was still an illegal political party, risking theirliberty and reputations in support of Hitler's ideology. Revelations in the1980s concerning Kurt Waldheim's Nazi past made headlines all over the world,calling into question his role both as the head of the Austrian government aswell as his tenure at the United Nations.And it was in Austria—in the salt mines and underground caverns in and aroundSalzburg—that the Nazis had planned to make their last stand. And it was fromthis same region—and specifically the offices of the Counter Intelligence Corps(CIC) of the US Army—that men like Klaus Barbie, the “Butcher of Lyons,” werehired to work for American intelligence—before they were aided in their escapeto Latin America. Kaltenbrunner, Skorzeny, Hanna Reitsch: these and many othercelebrities of the Reich were either captured in Austria, or worked for a timefor the CIC in Austria, or both. Travel through the Tyrol to the Italian borderwas relatively easy and many refugees made it to the Italian town of Bolzano(Bolzen), where they awaited papers and funds to make it the rest of the way toRome or to Genoa, and from there to the ships that would take them to safety.One of the most famous Nazis to have survived the war relatively intact wasGeneral Otto Remer, the man in charge of the clean-up campaign after the failureof Operation Valkyrie: the plot to assassinate Hitler. Remer rounded up theconspirators and had them shot, and for that earned a special place in Hitler'sestimation as a man who could be trusted when all others were suspect. Remerwent on to become involved in post-war Austrian politics for various extremeright-wing parties and was suspected of being involved in a plot to resurrectthe Nazi apparatus during the Naumann Affair. He became a sought-after speakerat various ODESSA-like events in Europe, and was even an invited guest at aconference held by Wilis Carto's Liberty Lobby in the United States. (an eventat which former Nixon speechwriter Pat Buchanan was in attendance).Otto Remer is one of the links in the chain that connects the Nazis of theSecond World War to the right-wing underground in Europe, the United States, theMiddle East, and Latin America after the war. He, along with Otto Skorzeny andHans-Ulrich Rudel, was one of the most visible and unapologetic members of theReich in the post-war period. His role—and that of his colleagues—is one of thereasons I resist calling this movement “neo-Nazi.” So many actual Nazis who heldrank and privilege during the war were involved in helping the Party apparatussurvive after the war; there is nothing “neo” about “neo-Nazism.”"},{"pageContent":"THE ODESSA FILEThe term ODESSA was popularized by the novelist Frederick Forsyth in hisbestseller The ODESSA File and by the movie inspired by the book, starring ayoung Jon Voight as a German journalist on the trail of the post-war Naziunderground. Aside from an opening sequence that takes place in the Middle Eastas Israel becomes aware that former Nazi scientists are in Egypt working onmissile technology, the action takes place completely in Germany and Austria.ODESSA thus entered the mainstream consciousness as a catch-all term for any oneof several groups of former SS officers and other assorted Nazi war criminalsengaged in a kind of secret society of murder and world domination. In fact, asArgentine journalist and investigator Uki Goñi has shown,2[../Text/part0009_split_005.html#c1-aft2] ODESSA did, in fact, exist and was oneof the names given to the extensive escape routes taken by the war criminals outof Germany, through Austria and Italy, to South America: escape routes that werealso known as the ratlines.What many investigators have missed, however, is the true extent of this networkin the United States. While we have all heard of former concentration campguards being arrested in America and deported to stand trial abroad, we have notlearned of the underground support systems that existed in the United Statesbefore the war, and how many individuals offered covert support to war criminalsafter the war. Some of this has been revealed in declassified files of Americanintelligence agencies, who were complicit in the escape of at least onewell-known war criminal—and that of course was Klaus Barbie, the infamous“Butcher of Lyon,” who was eventually discovered in Bolivia and extradited toFrance to stand trial in the 1980s. We have also heard of Operation Paperclip:the US government's program of bringing Nazi rocket scientists to America tojump-start the space program (a military program, it should be remembered, atthat time and still under the aegis of the Department of the Army).But there were other, lesser known, individuals in America who were part of aquiet ODESSA of their own, men and women who believed in the Nazi ideal and whoidolized its heroes. Some of these were revealed when an address book belongingto one of the leaders of the real ODESSA was recently declassified (possibly inerror, since some of the names in that book are of individuals still alive asthis is being written). What is important to understand is that this was not anew, perverse sort of hero-worship that only began when Germany was defeated.Rather it had roots in America long before the war began.It is easier to understand the post-war Nazi underground if we realize theextent to which there was a pre-war Nazi underground: not only in Europe(principally Germany and Austria) but also in North America, South America, theMiddle East and Asia. Many individuals, groups, corporations and politicianswere sympathetic not only to Germany's situation in the aftermath of World WarOne and the punitive Treaty of Versailles, but also to Germany's intellectualcontribution to discussions (and policy positions) on race, eugenics, and SocialDarwinism. The Russian Revolution took place a year before the end of World WarOne, and the perceived threat of a global Communist movement mobilizedright-wing elements across the globe even as it inspired many others."},{"pageContent":"SECRET POLITICS, SECRET RELIGIONGermany at the end of World War One was in shambles. The Treaty of Versailleshad restricted the size of its military to a token force, while placing all theguilt for the war squarely on Germany and demanding huge reparations in return.Valuable territory was lost, and to add to its burden, there was a growingCommunist presence in the country that threatened to turn it into the nextSoviet Union.When World War One began, Russia was ruled by the Czar. By 1917, however, theBolshevik Revolution had begun and the Czar and his entire family were arrestedand eventually executed. A new political and economic regime was installed underVladimir Lenin, and the Russians stopped fighting on the side of Great Britainand France (the three countries had formed what was called the Triple Entente).Instead, Russia signed a peace treaty with Germany. The Allies had thus lostRussia as an ally against the Kaiser.At the same time, returning German soldiers were bringing the Communist messageback to their homeland. Various German lander were in danger of having Socialistor Communist governments. The German Navy raised the red flag of Communism overits ships in the port city of Kiel; Berlin had a Socialist leader; and in Munichthe Bavarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed. The German Revolution had begun.As an example, a battle took place in the streets of Munich in May of 1919between the swastika-helmeted Freikorps brigades (a kind of militia orparamilitary force made up of former German soldiers) and the Reds. TheFreikorps eventually won and saved Munich for the anti-Communist—or“White”—forces. A provisional Communist government had tried to take power inBavaria, but suffered from factionalism within its ranks. The right-wingFreikorps took advantage of this weakness and reclaimed the territory after theReds had made the fatal error of arresting—and then executing—seven members of abizarre secret society that nevertheless numbered important German nobilityamong its ranks.This Order was the Thule Gesellschaft, or Thule Society. Nominally under thecharge of one Baron von Sebottendorf—a mystic and astrologer who had spent timein Egypt and who fought for the Ottoman Empire in its Balkan War—it combinedNordic runes, Theosophy, occultism, yoga, and other esoteric disciplines with aheavy dose of racial ideology imbibed from the font of such race-mystics asGuido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels. It met at the Four Seasons Hotel inMunich, the same locus for meetings of the German Workers Party, theorganization that would become the National Socialist German Workers Party: theNSDAP or Nazi Party. The memberships of these two organizations—the ThuleSociety with its milky gaze fixed on the legendary origin of the Nordic race,Thule (a kind of Teutonic Atlantis), and the Nazi Party (a collection of thugs,unemployed laborers, and bitter ex-soldiers)— often overlapped. The young AdolfHitler, a corporal in the defeated German army, was sent to infiltrate thesuspiciously-nomenclatured German Workers Party and report back on what hefound. Instead, he took it over and made it the vehicle for his own mission:trendy socialist-sounding sentiments masking an anti-internationalist, racist,and hegemonic platform to restore Germany's greatness and wreak vengeance onthose whom he felt betrayed the nation: the Jews, the Communists, and theliberal elite.At the same time, the Middle East was reeling from various European decisionsthat had been made, either without consulting its leaders or through ignoringpromises that were made and then summarily broken. The Balfour Declaration of1917—which made Palestine a Jewish homeland—was one of these, entered intowithout a thought to discussing it with the Arab leaders who had thrown in theirlot with the Allies against the Ottoman Turks (thereby defying the Caliph'sfatwa that called all Muslims to jihad against the Triple Entente). There wasalso the Sykes-Picot Agreement (which essentially carved up the former OttomanEmpire in the Middle East between France and Great Britain, redrawing the map ofthe region completely—again without consulting the indigenous populations).Declassified correspondence reveals the extent of the British and Frenchdouble-cross where the Arab Revolt was concerned. It is a trail of deceptionworthy of comparison to the hundreds of peace treaties signed by the USgovernment with the Native American populations—only to be matched perhaps bythe notorious Hitler-Stalin Pact, or the sadly optimistic Munich Pact signed byNeville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler.Revolts against British and French rule in the Middle East in the decades afterthe end of the First World War were numerous and were put down with brutalefficiency. This was the cauldron in which the witches' brew of Arabnationalism, Islamism, and anti-Western activism were mixed and fermented,becoming the intoxicating (in both senses of the word) beverage that we looselycall “terrorism” or more insistently “Islamist terrorism.” The French became acolonial power in Syria and Lebanon due to the Sykes Picot Agreement and, in1920, ousted King Faisal from Damascus by force. The French general who led thecampaign to retake the city at the Battle of Maysalun is reported to haveinsulted the tomb of the great twelfth century Muslim commander Saladin,bragging that he had raised the Cross over the Crescent. This cavalierappropriation of historical and religious icons is a hallmark of Western-Easternand especially Christian-Muslim relations of the 20th century and its aftermathaffects the world we live in today.Thus, the experience of Germans in the 1920s ran oddly parallel to that of theaverage Arab citizen in the Middle East at the same time. Rightly or wrongly,both felt victimized and betrayed by the Allied powers, especially Great Britainand France and to some extent Russia. Both began to see the Jews as symbolic ofthe sinister forces at work in the world: Germany, because it believed thatCommunism was a Jewish invention to enslave the world, and the Middle East,because suddenly there would be a Jewish homeland—administered by England—in themiddle of its territory, thus proving there was, indeed, a conspiracy of Jewsand European Christians against Islam.In both cases religion and race were made to be seen at the heart of theproblem, rather than the more intellectually demanding and complex forces ofpolitics and economics.This was as true in America as it was in Europe. While groups such as theNational Socialist German Workers Party were being formed—largely underground inGermany and later in Austria—in response to the very real threat of a Communisttakeover in Germany, organizations sympathetic to the plight of the Germansbegan forming in the United States.This phenomenon took on tremendous energy with the 1929 stock market crash. Theresulting anxiety and financial ruin only contributed to the paranoia of thosewho suspected a worldwide conspiracy of bankers and industrialists to impoverishand enslave the masses while enriching themselves. This paranoia took two forms,a leftist interpretation and a rightist one.The leftist view said that the global conspiracy was one of the bosses againstthe workers, and the bosses were fat-cat capitalists. The leftist viewpoint wasdevoid of racist rhetoric for it had been influenced by Marxist thought whichdescribed the inevitable development of socialism and communism from the ashesof capitalism in the aftermath of the industrial revolution. Marx's famousdictum—Workers of the World, Unite!—was meant to be an international call to allworking people to throw off the yoke of capitalism. This was the sentiment thateventually won the day in Russia and resulted in the overthrow of the Czaristsuperstructure and the elevation of the worker and the peasant to positions ofcontrol over the means of production (at least theoretically).The rightist view agreed in part that the global conspiracy was one of thebosses against the workers, but added a racial and spiritual component to theconflict. While the left blamed Capitalism and touted Communism as the solution,the racist right blamed Communism and furthermore identified Communism with theJews.The early Nazi Party was a battleground between these two points of view. Therewas a “left wing” of the Nazi Party—represented most notably by Otto Strasser(1897-1974)—that believed in an international workers party that would supportthe right of workers to strike, an idea that was not welcome to theindustrialists who were backing Hitler3[../Text/part0009_split_005.html#c1-aft3] Strasser also called for closer tieswith the Soviet Union and an end to the anti-Semitic policies of the Nazi Party.He and his group were eventually expelled from the Nazi Party and Strasserhimself was forced into exile. He remained a committed Nazi to the end of hisdays. Although Strasser had participated in the early post-World War OneFreikorps movement that opposed Communism, his form of Nazism became completelyout of synch with the right wing of the Party, represented by Hitler, whichbecame the dominant force. There were those Nazis after the war who entertainedStrasser-ist ideas by urging alliances with the Soviets; however, this was lessthe result of ideological conversion to Strasser's point of view than it was apragmatic decision to pit the Soviets and the Americans against each other in aneffort to weaken both.As the struggle between the warring viewpoints of Hitler and Strasser was takingplace in Germany, in America a number of pro-Nazi parties and groups found theirvoice among the disaffected and disenfranchised whites who feared that their wayof life was being threatened by Jews, African-Americans, and Communists— who,they believed, had engineered not only the Russian Revolution but also theelection of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Thus it was that the Hitler racist rightposition on National Socialism became the dominant one in America, leavinglittle room for a leftist, Strasser interpretation.Many anti-Roosevelt broadsides of the time—from the 1930s to the early 1940s—arevitriolic attacks on the Democratic President for being a Communist, a Jew, adictator, and every combination of these. The White House was seen as a hotbedof Communist agents bent on destroying America from within. This radical pointof view found fertile ground among working-class men and women in the citieswhere rumors spread that Jewish firms were firing Gentile workers in order tohire recent Jewish immigrants. These and other variations of the “bloodlibel”—in this case sacrificing the income of Gentiles rather than their infantchildren—were common currency at the time among the newly-formed extremeright-wing parties.While the German-American Bund is probably the most famous of these parties,there were other “patriotic” American societies that claimed similar pedigrees,as we shall see; and these favored a spiritual component in addition to therather more mechanistic one of the German intellectual establishment."},{"pageContent":"SPIRITUAL DARWINISMThere have been many opinions advanced in popular and academic circles as to howa country as cultured and sophisticated as Germany could have provided fertileground for something as heinous and savage as the Third Reich and the Holocaust.It is probably easier to understand what happened if we realize that Germanywas, indeed, at the forefront of science and philosophy in the early twentiethcentury—a time when the work of Charles Darwin was having its greatest effect onboth religious and scientific thinking. Darwin's Theory of Evolution shook theChurch to its core, in much the same way as Galileo had done hundreds of yearspreviously when he averred that the earth revolved around the Sun (and wasimprisoned by the Church for his audacity in insisting on the facts). The Theoryof Evolution was another blow to Christianity for it challenged the Biblicalstory of how humans were created, and instead demonstrated that human beingswere only the latest in a chain of creatures that had evolved from single cellorganic structures, through an amphibious, lizard-like stage, and finally—viathe apes—to present-day homo sapiens. While this idea was originally rejected bythe Church (and remains controversial within Evangelical and ChristianFundamentalist circles today that insist the universe is less than seventhousand years old), it was embraced by Western esotericists and occultists.Darwin's theory mirrored long-held beliefs concerning spiritual evolution, asevidenced in everything from the ascent literature of Jewish mysticism to theinitiatory rituals of Freemasonry, all of which presumed that human beings werein an imperfect state and were progressing along a path to ultimate perfection.This was perhaps no better represented than in the writings of Madame HelenaBlavatsky, the nineteenth century author, occultist, and political adventurer,who gave Social Darwinism a mystical interpretation that we may call SpiritualDarwinism.It was Blavatsky (1831-1891) who popularized the idea of an advanced “Aryan”race and who promoted the swastika as an esoteric symbol representing thehighest spiritual state. While the swastika is an Asian symbol with associationsof auspiciousness, Blavatsky managed to Europeanize the sign so that it accruedother meanings and implications. It became, indeed, the official symbol of theAryan Theosophical Society—a Theosophical sect that broke off from the originalTheosophical Society founded by Blavatsky—and was led by William QJudge andlater by Katherine Tingley from a base in California. The Aryan race—accordingto Blavatsky—was the fifth in a series of seven “root races.” While Blavatskydid not consider these “races” to be ethnicities in the traditional sense, theterminology of “Aryan race” became identified with German ideas about eugenicsand anti-Semitism. (That Blavatsky was herself anti-Semitic can be discernedfrom a careful reading of her published works.) Thus, while it can be arguedthat Blavatsky did not consider the Nordic “race” to be superior to all othersand exclusively identifiable with the fifth root race of her system, it isnonetheless obvious that the concept of an Aryan “race” was adopted by Germanracial theorists (via Blavatsky admirers such as proto-Nazis Guido von List andLanz von Liebenfels) and eventually became synonymous with Nazism.At the same time, there was an understanding by German scientists that ifDarwin's theory was true—accepted as a scientific fact—then it stood to reasonthat, once conscious of the process of evolution, human beings could involvethemselves in it: i.e., they could take direct action to accelerate evolutionand take measures intended to facilitate the “survival of the fittest”—weedingout those human specimens that would have been eliminated anyway over the courseof thousands, if not millions, of years. It was Darwinism taken to its logicalconclusion: if human beings are the latest result of the process of evolution,and if we have evolved certain traits and characteristics that enabled us tosurvive all those millions of years, then those among us with less desirablecharacteristics should be eliminated in order to allow the fittest to thrive.What Darwin saw as a natural process of selection became, for the Germaneugenecists and for those who were on the same page, a system that could bedeliberately and consciously controlled and manipulated. In fact, one could saythat—once Darwinian theories became understood—it was incumbent upon scientistsand political leaders to take immediate steps to encourage arationally-administered evolutionary process.In a sense, the Nazis saw themselves as servants of Nature in much the same wayEuropean alchemists saw themselves as facilitating what they believed was thenatural evolution of base metals into the spiritual perfection of gold. Inasmuchas the alchemist saw the chemical process of transmutation as mirroring aninterior process of spiritual illumination, so the Nazis understood theDarwinian “process” as reflective of a path of spiritual initiation that wasaccessible only to those of pure blood: a genetic aspect that is impossible tofake, resistant to any form of “conversion” or artifice. Purification ofphysical substances is an essential component of European alchemical literature,as it is of religious and spiritual texts in many cultures (such as that of theQumran sect made famous by the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls). Purificationin the Nazi sense meant “unmixed” with other elements, as it was essential toprotect the genetic heritage of the Völk: a nearly untranslatable term that hascome to mean “the people,” not in a nationalistic sense (i.e., “Americans” wouldnot be considered a Völk because of the multiethnic and multi-racial componentof the American population) but in the sense of a homogenous gene pool withcommon origins, beliefs, culture, and aspirations that are reflective of thathomogeneity. The German Völk had a parallel in Japanese political and militarythought according to at least one observer, a Gestapo chief in Tokyo during thewar, who became one of the West's most influential Zen philosophers of thepost-war period4 [../Text/part0009_split_005.html#c1-aft4] The well-knownethnophobia of the Japanese of that era—illustrated by their hatred of theChinese and their enslavement of the Koreans—indicated to the Nazis that theyhad similar if not identical beliefs about race, and that they identifiedthemselves in terms of racial (and cultural) purity, albeit not the same race orculture as the Aryan but one that was just as worthy of admiration if notemulation.I submit that it was this level of perceived responsibility that caused thecollective nervous breakdown of an entire society that we know under the rubricof the Holocaust. While there were many other reasons for the growth of Nazismin post-World War One Germany (economic, political, military and cultural), theracial theories that led to the Nuremberg Laws, and eventually to the deathcamps, were the result of German thinkers, scientists, and academics who sawthat it was their duty to humanity to protect the gene pool and to acceleratethe evolutionary process, a process that was at once spiritual as it wasbiological. This is evident in the Nazi pronouncements of the New Man: the nextstep in evolution, courtesy of the Nazi Party and the SS. If only the fittestsurvive then one had to demonstrate that one was, indeed, the fittest through aprocess of selection where cruelty and the willingness to participate insavagery were considered emblematic of the necessary new warrior caste. War,eugenics, and genocide demonstrated the iron will of the New Man to do whateverwas needed to ensure the survival and eventual triumph of the Völk. It was thisassumption, that the Aryan “race” was the highest-existing form of humanevolution, and the identification of that “race” with pure German or Nordicblood, that allowed the Nazi race scientists to create the labyrinth of lawsthat would dispossess entire ethnicities and subject them to the worst forms ofslavery and extermination. Needless to say, this was not what Darwin had inmind5 [../Text/part0009_split_005.html#c1-aft5]While these theories were being discussed and debated in Germany during theperiod between the two World Wars, they were also being debated—and put intopractice—in the United States. Racism was largely a factor in thisphenomenon—from such infamous projects as the Tuskegee Syphilis program thattargeted African-Americans as unwitting guinea pigs in medical tests, to thelaws against “miscegenation” in many states, laws that forbade the “mixed”marriages of whites and blacks. Add to that the forced sterilization of thosedeemed mentally unfit to have children, and you have the parameters for whatwould become Nazi Germany's racial laws, euthanasia programs, and theexperimentation on prisoners in the camps. When one considers the policies ofthe US government in the 19 th century where the Native Americans wereconcerned, you have a precedent for Nazi Germany's policy of lebensraum: theidea that, since the German people needed more room to expand, it was necessary(and permissible) to invade the territories of neighboring countries and enslaveor exterminate their inhabitants.In addition to the race science that was taking the western world by storm,there was also the problem of Bolshevism."},{"pageContent":"“GODLESS COMMUNISM”The Russian Revolution had taken place in 1917 at the height of the first WorldWar. Bankers, corporate elites, and industrialists were thrown out of power inthe ensuing chaos by people identifying themselves as Socialists, Bolsheviks, orCommunists. Communism was seen as an enemy to everything the West considered thebedrock of its culture: religion, the free market, and a stratified classstructure. Further, Communism was an international movement. Internationalismthreatened the hegemony of nation states that had built their wealth on thecolonization of other countries and the careful maintenance of zones ofinfluence, such as that represented by the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas. Byraising the working class above all other classes, Communism further threatenedto upset the balance between slave and master, between colonized and colonizer,between wage slave and boss.Germany had been on the front lines of this conflict. There were dozens ofSocialist parties in Germany, and in some cases they won elections andcontrolled individual cities, if only for short periods of time. Thus, it wasacknowledged that Germany had first-hand experience of Bolshevism and had foughtsuccessfully to remove it from its borders. And, inasmuch as Bolshevism,Marxism, and Communism were seen as products of Jewish thought andpersonalities—Karl Marx, after all, famously was Jewish even though his writingsshow him as violently anti-Semitic—it was asserted that the Jew and theCommunist were one and the same.In the United States, these themes were taken up by a variety of celebrities andby a coven of bizarre, right-wing political organizations that claimed to bepatriotic, but were at the same time taking money and support from Germanpolitical parties and operatives and—after 1933—from the German governmentitself. This came at a time of the rapid growth of labor unions, whichthreatened the profit structures of industry. Inasmuch as these unions werebeing influenced by Socialist and Communist parties and “fellow travelers,” theworld was suddenly perceived to be in a state of tremendous danger from a secretglobal conspiracy designed to rob corporations of their power, the bankers oftheir money, and citizens of the traditions and values of Western civilizationas they understood them.The political atmosphere in the United States at the time was poisonous,reminiscent of the state of affairs that obtains at the time this book is beingwritten. As mentioned above, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was being accusedby the extreme right of being a Communist, and allegations were made that he wasJewish as well. A number of assassination plots against him had been foiled, andpassions were running high in the wake of the Great Depression. Labor unionswere seen as tools of international Communism, and corporate leaders and factorydirectors were cracking down hard against labor unrest. Roosevelt's NewDeal—exemplified by the establishment of Social Security and various laborprograms—was seen by some as evidence of the president's plan to install aCommunist dictatorship in the United States, and charges were made that theWhite House was a hotbed of Communists and fellow-travelers.In the midst of all of this, Nazism attracted the attention of many of America'smost famous personalities. Men like Henry Ford and Charles A. Lindbergh openlyadmired Adolf Hitler and his nationalist, anti-Communist agenda. Ford activelycontributed to the Nazi Party in its earliest days, using Hitler's close friendDietrich Eckart as his “bag man” in the transference of funds to the Party inthe years before Hitler's 1923 Beer Hall Putsch attempt to take control of theGerman government. Ford's collected writings on the evils of Jewish bankers andinternational Communism were published as a book entitled The International Jew,distributed widely in Germany as well as around the world. To this day, the bookenjoys popularity in areas as diverse as the Middle East, Latin America andSoutheast Asia and it has been translated into dozens of languages. In thoseareas, Ford is almost better known for his anti-Semitism than for theautomobiles that bear his name. Charles Lindbergh became a featured spokespersonfor a group calling itself “America First”: an isolationist organizationdesigned to keep America out of the European conflict being waged by Hitleragainst his neighbors.More quietly, other corporate leaders and captains of American industry were insupport of Nazi political agendas and racial programs. It is by now well-knownthat Prescott Bush (grandfather of George H. W. Bush) was an early supporter ofHitler, as were his fellow Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. executives GeorgeHerbert Walker (after whom the first President Bush was named) and W. AverellHarriman. The company was an investor in German industry at a time when theUnited States was gearing up for war against Hitler, and even after war had beendeclared. Due to the relationship between Brown Brothers Harriman and the Germanindustrial giant Thyssen (through the Union Banking Corporation), as well asother German firms, Brown Brothers assets were seized under the Trading with theEnemy Act in 1942, and held for the duration of the war. Such other icons ofAmerican capitalism as Standard Oil, ITT, and IBM were all implicated in thedeliberate support of Hitler's agenda and the smooth running of his war machine,as has been described and extensively documented in many other places. If suchhighly-regarded captains of American industry were supportive of the Nazi Party,then it became increasingly difficult to demonize the rank and file anti-Semitesand America Firsters as ignorant, “low information” voters. In other words, theNazi context in the United States was not simply one of the uneducated, thehateful and the paranoid. It was a network of associations and individuals withtremendous—albeit often clandestine—reach into every aspect of American life,from education and religion to the media and to the houses of Congress itself.Nazism attracted the highly-educated and the self-made millionaires as much asit did the sociopathic personalities who formed Storm Trooper clubs and armedmilitias that marched in American streets. In that sense, it was no differentfrom the Nazi phenomenon in Germany itself.In America, with its strong tradition of religious freedom— largely created inthe seventeenth century by Christian sects that combined fundamentalist Biblicalteachings with a healthy dose of mysticism and even Rosicrucianism—Nazi ideologytook on a messianic and apocalyptic tinge."},{"pageContent":"RACISM AS RELIGIONMoney is its own religion, especially in a country largely dominated by theCalvinist equivalency between financial success and divine favor; but otherspiritualities were abroad in the land in the 1920s and 1930s. Such sentimentswere easily manipulated by those who wished to see a fascist or pro-Nazi regimein the United States as a hedge against Communism, with its corollaries of laborunions, internationalism, and anti-colonialism. Even democracy was consideredsuspect, as Hitler believed it was just another obstacle created byInternational Jewry to accelerate the demise of national identities. Democracy,theoretically, is a great leveler: all citizens have equal rights before the lawand an equal say in the running of the government. This concept is anathema tothose who believe that equality contributes to the elevation of the weak and thediminution of the strong: in other words, to those who believe in the Naziversion of Social Darwinism, which requires the strong to rule the weak and thewhite race to rule all others. Internationalism is also proscribed by the Naziviewpoint, for it implies that all nations are equal in some sense. Communism isan international movement of class against class rather than nation againstnation, and as such it would be illogical to expect a German nationalist toembrace it.It would also go against the grain of those who feel that the Indian castesystem is an ideal way to run a society.During the early days of the author's research involving the Nazi underground,he made the acquaintance of James Madole, the founder and leader of the NationalRenaissance Party: a Nazi organization with a pedigree going back to theimmediate postwar era in the United States. Madole's group blended doctrinaireNazism with esotericism and mysticism, influenced heavily by the writings ofBlavatsky as well as by other “orientalist” authors like Savitri Devi, who sawin the Indian caste system a perfect template for organizing society alongracial and class lines. Madole would constantly invoke this system in his talkswith me, emphasizing that the world would be better off if there were strictdivisions between the kshatriya or warrior caste and the brahmin or priestlycaste, for instance. In fact, he seemed to favor elevating the warrior casteabove the priestly caste, at least at the present time when warriors are morenecessary—in his opinion—than priests. This idea is reflected in some of thelesser-known writings of Zen Buddhist scholar D.T. Suzuki, an issue we will pickup in our chapter on the Japanese element in the Nazi underground.Madole and his National Renaissance Party came to the attention of the HouseCommittee on Un-American Activities in 1954, and was the subject of a forty-pagereport on “Neo-Fascist and Hate Groups” published that year. In that report,Madole is linked with a variety of interlocking Nazi and fascist organizationsas well as with H. Keith Thompson, a wealthy supporter of Nazi causes before,during, and after the war. In that report, Thompson's relationship to SS GeneralOtto Remer and his Austrian Socialist Reich Party is mentioned, and this is animportant connection. Remer had a role to play not only in the ODESSA-like Naziunderground after the war, but also with a variety of American political groupsand personalities, from Wilis Carto and the Liberty Lobby to former Nixonspeechwriter Pat Buchanan.6 [../Text/part0009_split_005.html#c1-aft6]But aside from the purely esoteric or mystical Nazism of groups like Madole'sNational Renaissance Party, much of the agitation by pro-Nazi organizations inthe United States were informed by Christian ideas, especially those concerningthe Jews as “Christ killers.” Anti-Semitism alone was not the main thrust ofpro-Nazi sentiment in the United States in the period before the war however,but the identification of Jews with Communists.Thus, in an environment of passionate views concerning foreign policy, race, andreligion—as much in 1934 as in 2014—it should come as no surprise that therewere those who favored a violent solution to the problems they believed thecountry faced. The growth and spread of armed militias, for instance, was justas much a problem in the 1930s as it is in the America of today; the differencebeing that these militias were openly pro-Nazi, such as William Dudley Pelley'sSilver Legion and the German-American Bund. While heroes such as Otto Skorzenyand Hans Ulrich Rudel would organize the networks and provide funding, jobs, andother options for the Nazis after the war, these home-grown American Nazis wouldprovide the demographic stratum and the ideological motivation to attract newrecruits to the cause and would modify the Nazi Party's platforms to accommodatethe post-war reality while not abandoning the Party's core issues: race(particularly white supremacy), anti-Semitism, and an anti-Western “thirdposition” that was neither capitalism nor Communism, but German-style fascism.At the same time these groups—led by individuals with varying degrees ofcharisma—would incorporate blatantly spiritual, esoteric, occult, or evenUFO-related themes into the overall Nazi Weltanschauung.Often these people and their groups are not taken seriously, either by academiaor by government security agencies, and certainly not by the population atlarge. In the first place, the Nazis lost the war so why pay attention to abunch of crackpots who can't accept that the war is over and their side lost? Inthe second place, they seem odd, neurotic, paranoid, or whatever otherpsychological term you wish to apply because of their anachronistic politicalpositions and their fascination with fringe spirituality and eccentricinterpretations of mainstream religion, science, and culture. Thus, they do notdemand careful examination or investigation, any more than one might give to aschizophrenic wandering the streets and talking to the voices in his head. Inthe third place, they represent such a minority view (in the United States) andcommand the allegiance of only a relative handful of members, so why be botheredwriting or talking about them?It was just this constellation of factors that allowed the Nazi underground inAmerica to flourish after the war; they were able to fly under the radar, so tospeak, precisely because of their very odd characteristics. In addition, in thepost-war period, the enemy was international Communism; we had no time to wasteon watching, following or infiltrating movements that claimed a Nazi pedigreewhen the Nazis no longer had a country of their own.However, while the Nazis were either ignored or even at times tolerated bywestern intelligence agencies, they succeeded in committing assassinations andterror bombings throughout the postwar period and on virtually every continentin a series of campaigns using multinational terror cells and charismaticpersonalities that would later provide the template for future, Al-Qaeda-type,terrorist operations. Al-Qaeda, after all, didn't have a country of its own,either.I submit that the laissez-faire attitude of western intelligence towards theNazi underground leads us directly to the events of September 11, 2001 andthereafter, and that our lack of interest in this underground—both in the UnitedStates and abroad—made us vulnerable to international terrorism and the rise ofwhat has been called Islamist movements. These are anti-Western and anti-Semiticand wish (like their Nazi predecessors) the demise of the United States and theinstallation of a global government based on ideological principles involvingthe superiority of one group over another (again, like their Nazi predecessors).Everything from the clandestine movement of funds around the world to theestablishment of individual cells and “lone wolf” operators in dozens ofcountries to assassinations and bombings targeting civilianpopulations—phenomena that today we associate with Islamist terror-ism—were allprefigured in the Nazi underground that survived the Second World War and whichcontinues to exist to the present day. And this underground could not havesurvived the Second World War without a pre-existing infrastructure and thequiet cooperation of governments: in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, LatinAmerica ... and the United States.Thus, readers will be forgiven if they always had believed that the Naziphenomenon was strictly a German affair. Events that were taking place inAmerica at the same time as Hitler's rise in Germany have largely been ignored,even as they illustrate in alarming detail that a similar political movement wasforming in the United States. This movement would connect and even collaboratewith the German movement and lend credibility to some of the planks of Nazism'sideological platform—such as anti-Semitism, racism, and anti-Communism—while atthe same time providing a network of logistical, military and intelligencesupport in North and South America that would long survive the end ofhostilities in 1945.The United States in the 1920s and 1930s was in the midst of a greatsociological upheaval, exacerbated by the Great Depression which officiallybegan in 1929 with the stock market crash on October 29: Black Tuesday. Waves ofIrish and Italian immigrants threatened the comfortable homogeneity of white,Protestant America by bringing in Roman Catholic minorities. Jewish immigrationfrom Eastern Europe made the “melting pot” boil over in violence, eth-nophobia,and anti-Semitic prejudice. The Russian Revolution had taken place a decadeearlier and threatened the European status quo in ways more profound andfar-reaching than the First World War, because it introduced concepts likeCommunism and atheism into a wider audience, far beyond the Russian borders. TheComintern— or Communist International—was at once a political movement as wellas a kind of missionary effort targeting the working class of all nations in anexistential conflict against religion, capitalism, and slave labor. ManyAmericans were so shocked by the barbarity of the First World War that theyadopted an isolationist position when it came to foreign policy and especiallyforeign wars. They did not want to entertain hordes of foreign immigrants whodid not share their values, their religion, their language, or their race withinAmerica's borders for it could lead to America being pushed into involvement inanother global war. The Great Depression merely underlined that attitude, fornow America could no longer afford to feed, clothe and house the destitutevisitors who filled the ships docking at Ellis Island; nor could it affordanother foreign military adventure.Roosevelt was inaugurated President of the United States on March 4, 1933,little over a month after Adolf Hitler was named Chancellor of Germany onJanuary 30, 1933. Both leaders would survive a number of assassination attemptsand would, of course, square off against each other during World War II.Roosevelt would die in office on April 12, 1945, and Hitler is believed to havecommitted suicide on April 30, 1945. The War in Europe would end the followingmonth, in May of 1945 (with the Pacific War ending only with the Japanesesurrender four months later).During the twelve-year period of Roosevelt and Hitler's concurrent leadership,enormous changes took place in the world economy and in the global politicalsituation. A massive Depression, a World War, the rise of tyrants and dictators,the Holocaust, the first use of atomic weapons, and the collapse of empires alltook place within that short period of time. The fates and agendas of bothRoosevelt and Hitler (and therefore of America and Germany) were inextricablylinked.In America, the situation was not identical to Germany but it was grim. TheDepression had taken its toll on the lives of millions of its citizens andstrong leadership was needed to keep the nation from plunging even deeper intodespair. The leader they elected (an unprecedented four times) was Franklin D.Roosevelt.Where Hitler would govern by fiat, Roosevelt had to govern with a certain amountof finesse if not subterfuge. Both had to rescue their respective nations fromeconomic chaos. Roosevelt did so by creating various programs that would putAmericans to work building infrastructure, and by setting up social welfareprograms that would keep the neediest from starvation, and which would guaranteea certain level of security once they attained retirement age, part of anoverall philosophy he called the “New Deal.” To some Americans this smacked ofsocialism and communism— people were never quite sure what the difference wasbetween the two—and they began to call for Roosevelt's impeachment, or worse.The ugliness of the political rhetoric of the 1930s was a precursor to that oftoday, including hate radio, yellow journalism, and conspiracy theories. Infact, some of the broadsides that were printed attacking Roosevelt for beingJewish (he wasn't), are reminiscent of accusations against Obama as being a“Muslim.” In both cases there is the tacit understanding that these religiousaffiliations, real or imagined, are evidence of anti-Americanism or even oftreason.As mentioned, there were several attempts on Roosevelt's life. One of these, byItalian immigrant and naturalized American citizen Giuseppe Zangara on February15, 1933 in Miami, targeted president-elect Roosevelt as a dictator. The claimthat Roosevelt was a dictator was common currency in the anti-Rooseveltdiatribes of the time, ignoring the fact that he eventually was elected fourtimes and that his 1936 re-election victory in particular was a landslide.Emblematic of the tenor of extreme anti-Roosevelt rhetoric is the rant ofprominent anti-Semitic South Philadelphia schoolteacher Bessie R. “Two Gun”Burchett. She was the founder of the Anti-Communist Society (ACS), and a criticof what she called the “Jew Deal.” She had this to say about Roosevelt in apamphlet she distributed in 1939:“The president is a traitor. We must do all we can to break down the president,and have the people know what kind of man he really is, and then proceed toimpeach him. If Hitler does come here, he should drop a bomb on the right placein New York. You all know where I mean. ... a skyscraper full of Jews.7[../Text/part0009_split_005.html#c1-aft7]That this would anticipate the events of September 11, 2001 when New York Cityskyscrapers were indeed “bombed” by anti-Semitic Arabs, has gone unnoticed bymost. But Burchett's odd presentiment of events that would take place sixty-twoyears in the future was not the only one.Another influential right-wing movement that became progressively more pro-Naziwas William Dudley Pelley's Silver Legion, usually referred to as the SilverShirts.William Dudley Pelley (1890-1965) was a journalist and foreign correspondent forthe Saturday Evening Post who became a Hollywood screenwriter in the 1920s,writing scripts for Lon Chaney. In 1929 he left Hollywood and moved toAsheville, North Carolina. Here he began building a movement around a near-deathexperience he had in 1925 in which God instructed him to begin the spiritualtransformation of America, an experience that he detailed in an article he wrotefor American Magazine in 1928 entitled “Seven Minutes in Eternity.” He combinedapocalyptic ideas about the Second Coming of Jesus with anti-Semitism, andconspiracy theories about secret cabals of Jews, the Illuminati, and Communistsrunning the world. Becoming active in politics during the Great Depression,Pelley was a vocal critic of President Roosevelt and the New Deal, seeing theRoosevelt administration as another manifestation of the Soviet system thatPelley had seen first-hand during his days as a foreign correspondent in RussianSiberia during World War I. Pelley defined Communism as part of a worldwideJewish conspiracy to control the world, and the Depression as part of a masterplan by this same conspiracy to destroy America and bring it under the aegis ofthe Comintern. In this, he was similar—if not identical—in thinking with BessieBurchett (indeed he had close ties to the ACS), both of whom opposed thepresence of Jews in America and who accused new Jewish immigrants of taking jobsaway from “white Americans.”When Hitler came to power in 1933, Pelley was inspired to form a paramilitaryorganization of his own that he called the Silver Legion. Their uniformconsisted of silver shirts emblazoned with the scarlet letter “L” for Legion,and they subsequently became known as the Silver Shirts (in emulation ofMussolini's black-shirted fascists and Hitler's brown-shirted Nazis). Pelley wasunabashedly pro-Nazi and as such came to the attention of the House Committee onUn-American Activities. Pelley's Nazism was mixed with millennialism, occultismand esoteric teachings. While this combination might seem strange, it is of apiece with the origins of the Nazi Party itself which had its roots in themystical Aryan theologies of the Thule Society—as well as of such groups as Lanzvon Liebenfels's Order of the New Templars, as promoted in the magazine Ostarawhich the young Hitler read avidly while struggling as a postcard artist inVienna.8 [../Text/part0009_split_005.html#c1-aft8]Pelley was also inspired by the works of David Davidson, a British-Israelite (amovement founded around the belief that the English and not the Jews are thetrue Israelites) and member of the Silver Shirts, who wrote that the GreatPyramid of Giza was a kind of cosmic calendar that could be used to foretellfuture events. The most important of these events was the Second Coming whenJesus would return to rid the world of the Jews and bring about Paradise onearth (with the assistance of the Silver Shirts, of course). According to thecalculations of Pelley based on those of Davidson, the exact date when the Jewswould be destroyed was given as September 17, 2001.9[../Text/part0009_split_005.html#c1-aft9]Six days off from the day “the world was changed” on September 11, 2001; wemight say “close enough for government work.” Both Burchett's and Pelley'sstatements were published about the same time, in 1939 and before Americaentered the Second World War. This eerie prediction of Pelley's—when combinedwith the plea of Bessie Burchett that Hitler come to New York City and bomb askyscraper full of Jews—seems to indicate more than just a coincidence ofhistory but a deeper preoccupation of the radical Right that will persist to thepresent day.Pelley would eventually be arrested by the US government and indicted for avariety of offences including sedition, and he would spend some years in prison,getting out only in 1952. Although the political involvement of his Silver Shirtmilitia would wane once the war started, its ideological influence would be feltfor decades. Pelley's Silver Legion was the inspiration for the ChristianIdentity movement and the Posse Comitatus, another extreme-right,con-spiratorialist movement founded by a former member of the Silver Shirts,Henry Beach. Both Christian Identity and Posse Comita-tus exist today, ChristianIdentity philosophy and teachings having a major influence on white supremacistgroups like the Aryan Nations, while Posse Comitatus has claimed that the USgovernment is in the hands of the international Jewish conspiracy—the “ZionistOccupation Government” or ZOG—and as such refuses to recognize any governmentauthority above that of the local county level. Both groups have beeninvolved—through their individual members—in political terrorism andassassinations in the United States. The Order is one such group that wascomposed of both Christian Identity members and those who joined a neo-paganNordic or Odinist denominaton. The Order committed a series of armed robberiesand engaged in shoot-outs with the police until it was wiped out in 1984.Another Christian Identity-affiliated group has been implicated in the Sowetobombings in South Africa in October and November, 2002.It may seem that an ideology that looks forward to the Second Coming of Jesusand the End of Days would not have much in common with Nazism. Except that itwas just those teachings— that Jesus was not Jewish, that true Christianity isAryan, and that Jews are the spawn of Satan—that informed one of the strangestreligious movements in Nazi Germany, that of the Deutsche Christen, or theGerman Christian sect.Formed in 1931 to rid Christianity of “Jewish influences,” the Deutsche Christenaimed to de-emphasize (or excise or rewrite entirely) those portions of the OldTestament that were concerned primarily with Jewish ideas, and to promote theconcept of an “Aryan” Christ. By 1933, after Hitler's rise to power asChancellor, the Deutsche Christen was instrumental in the formation of theGerman Evangelical Church, used by the Nazis to centralize ProtestantChristianity in Germany under a state-sponsored aegis. Openly anti-Semitic andsupportive of Nazi racial ideas, the German Christian movement flourished untilthe end of the war, after which it diminished considerably in numbers andinfluence. But its central themes of the Aryan Christ, the Jews as sons ofSatan, and the race-consciousness and ethnophobic platforms would findthemselves renewed in the Christian Identity movement and its fellow-travelers:in the Aryan Nations; the Order; The Covenant, Sword, and Arm of the Lord; andmany others. The role of Christian Identity as a political movement has beenabbreviated in the past few years and indeed it was never very well-organized orcentralized to begin. But its ideology has had many admirers in organizationsthat can be considered white supremacist, anti-Semitic, and anti-Communist: someof its adherents have called for the overthrow of the US government, which isseen as a tool of the international Jewish conspiracy as detailed in the famoushoax document, The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion.Pelley's pro-Nazi, Hitlerite, Christian, and anti-Semitic views were largely inharmony with those of the Deutsche Christen. Pelley's contribution to thediscussion was a heavy dose of mysticism and esoteric ideas—such aspyramidology, spiritualism, and the like—combined with conspiracy theories (inthose days such theories were always focused on a purported global Jewish cabal)all wrapped in the American flag. At its height, the Silver Legion numberedabout 15,000 members in the United States, and that does not count the numerousother individuals and groups that were sympathetic to its aims and comfortablewith its rhetoric of armed resistance to the perceived Communist takeover of thecountry represented by the hated President Roosevelt.One should not believe that Pelley was strictly a crazed occultist andconspiracy theorist with wild ideas about the Apocalypse and “pyramid power.” Hewas a skilled activist as well. His ties to the German-American Bund—thepro-Nazi society led by Fritz Kuhn that was eventually banned as the warstarted—are well-established, as are Pelley's Silver Legion connections withother right-wing groups that advocated close cooperation with the Nazis andtheir secret service—the Geheimstaatspolizei or Gestapo. Pelley was alsowell-acquainted with Nazi ideologue Francis Parker Yockey and with FatherCharles Coughlin (1891-1979), the infamous Roman Catholic priest and radiopersonality whose pro-Nazi sentiments became more pronounced as the music of the1930s progressed from Depression blues to the drums of war.One thing is sure. Democracy is doomed. This is our last election. It is fascismor communism. We are at the crossroads—I take the road to fascism.—Father Coughlin, 193610 [../Text/part0009_split_005.html#c1-aft10]Coughlin was representative of the ideology embraced by Hitler of a “third way”:a political and economic system that was neither capitalism nor communism.Coughlin attacked the greed inherent in the capitalist system but fearedcommunism more because its atheist philosophy denied the possibility of God andan afterlife. Coughlin had successfully helped to create a third political partyto challenge Roosevelt in the 1936 presidential election, but when that electionwas lost he removed himself from the limelight for a short time, returning tothe stage a year later even more anti-Semitic and anti-Communist. His radiobroadcast was finally silenced by the Roosevelt administration in 1940 as thecountry prepared for war with Germany. Coughlin himself came dangerously closeto being arrested for sedition. It was Coughlin, for example, who defended theNazi atrocity known as Kristallnacht—the Night of Broken Glass in 1938 whenhundreds of Jewish shops and synagogues in Germany had their windows smashed anddefaced with swastikas and signs like Juden Raus! (“Jews Out!”). He said,essentially, that the Jews had called it on themselves for their persecution ofChristians—a snide reference to the Russian Revolution for which the allegedglobal Jewish conspiracy was considered responsible, and its assassinations ofthe Czar and his family as well as the murders of thousands of RussianChristians.11 [../Text/part0009_split_005.html#c1-aft11]Like Pelley's influence on current forms of New Age Christianity, spirituality,and fascism, Coughlin was the American model for a generation of pro-NaziCatholic priests and hierarchs in Europe who would aid directly in the escape ofGerman, Croatian and other war criminals in the immediate post-war period. Ithas also been reliably reported that Coughlin was the beneficiary of fundingfrom Nazi Germany itself.12 [../Text/part0009_split_005.html#c1-aft12] It wasonly his popularity as a radio personality that kept Father Coughlin from beingarrested and indicted for sedition, especially as he was in the middle of animportant Nazi espionage ring (see below) that included everyone from FritzKuhn's German-American Bund to pro-Nazi Ukrainian emigre groups and Germanagents throughout the United States and Mexico. It was Coughlin who repeatedlyreferred to President Roosevelt as “President Rosenfeld” in an attempt tostigmatize him as Jewish and Roosevelt's opposition to Hitler as indicative ofthe former's support of Communism.Father Coughlin's support for Germany extended considerably deeper than even hisradio program would indicate. From his base in Royal Oak, Michigan—a suburb ofDetroit—Coughlin entertained fascists and Nazi spies and facilitated theiroperations in North America. These included William Pelley's Silver Legion andthe German-American Bund, but also involved a group of White Russian emigres whowere agitating for a Nazi invasion of Russia in order to remove the Communistregime. Coughlin's support extended as well to members of the Christian Front: ashort-lived anti-Semitic organization that went on rampages in Jewishneighborhoods in American cities, notably in New York City, until it wasdisbanded after the start of America's entry into the war.The White Russian community is an insular group that, in the decades before thefall of the Soviet Union, revolved around the Russian Orthodox Church OutsideRussia (ROCOR). Its US headquarters were in New York City on Park Avenue, in abeautiful building that had been home to an American railroad magnate before itwas purchased by emigre members of the Romanov family. For conspiracyaficionadoes, this was the same Church that is mentioned—usually fleetingly—inaccounts of Lee Harvey Oswald's relationship to the mysterious George deMohrenschildt and the Russian emigre community in Dallas. ROCOR was violentlyanti-Communist, as was the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. These religious groupswould provide political, monetary, and even logistical support to Americanintelligence activities against the Soviet Union and its allies both in theUnited States and abroad, and their full story has yet to be told. However,there are many similarities in the way in which the Eastern European churchesaided and abetted fascist and Nazi organizations, espionage rings, and escapenetworks, and the activities of the Roman Catholic Church during the sameperiod, and to the same ends. Pope Pius XII—who has often been criticized forhis role during the War—refused to censure Father Coughlin, even when some (butby no means all) American bishops begged him to do so.American sympathies with the Nazis were not limited to a handful of cranks,crazed clergymen, and sociopathic personalities dressed up as storm troopers,marching at the Bund's infamous Camp Siegfried however. As mentioned earlier,many American politicians and industrialists were unashamed supporters of Hitlerand the Third Reich and actively sought to prevent Roosevelt from antagonizingthe Führer, whom they considered a bulwark against Communism. Ideologues likeCoughlin and Pelley—among many others—merely gave a theoretical framework forwhat actually was taking place behind the scenes as prominent members ofCongress, allied with financiers and industrial giants, threw their weight (bothcovertly and overtly) behind a movement to depose Roosevelt and establish afascist-friendly administration in the United States before Roosevelt could endAmerican isolationism and go to war against Hitler.One can drill as deep as one likes into these complex relationships (and theespecially disturbing participation of leaders mentioned earlier such as Ford,Lindbergh, Bush, Harriman, Walker, et al) and never run out of material fordespair at the callous disregard for anything remotely suggestive of humanvalues that these individuals and companies displayed. Banking and industrialrelationships between American and German companies during the war never reallyended and, on the contrary, were often expanded considerably. Allen Dulles—whowould eventually become Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (until firedby President Kennedy over the Bay of Pigs fiasco)—played both sides of the fenceduring the war. Dulles is on record for his disinterest in the Holocaust and hisdesire to work with Nazi leaders and insiders, such as former Reich FinanceMinister Hjalmar Schacht, to bring hostilities in Europe to an end so thatGermany could re-arm for the eventual conflict with the Soviet Union. When thewar ended, these sympathies did not die with the signing of peace treaties andunconditional surrenders. The end of the war was merely one stage in a long-termstrategy that involved support for fascist and Nazi ideas, individuals, andorganizations in order to combat the forces of Communism around the world. Themilitary defeat of the German armed forces was, in a sense, misdirection. Thesigning of the unconditional surrender in Europe was a bit of theater thatlulled the world into a false sense of security by implying that the ideals ofthe Third Reich had been defeated along with its armies.With a long history of pro-Nazi organizations and their underground activitiesin the United States in the 1930s, nothing could be further from the truth. TheAmerican ODESSA had been established early on and the defeat of the Third Reichwas not accepted as the death of the Nazi program, but as a bump in the road, asetback to be sure, but not the end of the struggle. The Soviet Union was stillthere, rattling its own sabres against Eastern Europe and threatening the West.Fear of Hitler was transferred to fear of Stalin and the “Red Menace.” Mao wastaking over in China, bringing Communism and the “Yellow Peril” to the Asianmainland. Ho Chi Minh was fighting the French in Vietnam. A band ofrevolutionaries led by Sukarno was removing Dutch influence from Indonesia.Korea was about to fall to Communists from the north. Great Britain was about tolose its colonies in India and Malaya.There was much work to be done still, and who better to oversee the globalproject of resistance to Communism than the very people who had started it aslong ago as 1919? The Germans felt that they had been the first to recognize thedangers of the Soviet system and had fought—city by city—to eradicate it fromtheir borders. They had a kind of proprietary interest in the subject. When theSecond World War was over and the West geared up for a confrontation withRussia, it would be the Germans who would say “I told you so.”While the more flamboyant members of the radical right got most of the attentiondue to the same tactics that enabled Hitler and the Nazi Party to rise to powerin Germany—notably the ability to use patriotic slogans and iconography, incombination with a strong appeal to paranoia and fear-mongering by means ofconspiracy theories that targeted minority groups—there were more soberindividuals within the radical movement who were just as committed as theirflashier colleagues but who were able to keep a lower profile and thus workbehind the scenes. This category included spies and saboteurs, of course—andAmerica had its share of Nazi fifth columnists in the years leading up to thewar—but it also included ideologues and specialists in psychological warfare andpublic relations campaigns who would go on to form the backbone of the NaziUnderground after the war due to their more pragmatic approach. These wereintelligent men and women who remained devoted to the Nazi cause, but who wereclever enough to understand that an overtly pro-Nazi movement would not playwell in Peoria.The American psyche already had enough elements that were in line with Naziideology that a subtle approach was more likely to win converts than a platoonof goose-steppers in home-made SS uniforms. These elements included a certaindegree of ethno-phobia, racism, and anti-Semitism (i.e., fear of the unknown andthe different) combined with an overall distrust of a foreign policy concernedwith the defense of democracy abroad, or the rescue of captive peoples of otherraces, or in countries with—to American ears—unpronounceable names. Both Americaand Germany were suffering from economic setbacks that crippled their respectiveeconomies (at least insofar as the average workers were concerned) and someonehad to take the blame. Jewish bankers and Communists were the scapegoats in bothcountries, and some of the American rhetoric against Jews was just as vociferousas anything found in Germany at the time.Before the two World Wars, isolationism was very popular in America. In the1930s, as noted, there were both Republican and Democrat isolationists whowanted to keep America out of foreign wars. This sentiment—with a patriotic,pro-American veneer overlaying a covert hostility to cultural change and Jewishand Asian immigration—became enshrined in the America First Committee (AFC).America First was a clearing house for those with pro-fascist or pro-Nazi pointsof view who wished to enjoy a certain patriotic prestige to go along with theiravowed aim of keeping America focused on Americans and away from the graduallydeteriorating situation in Europe and Asia. A focus on Americans was an easysell; but the sub-text was quite different.The America First movement wanted to ensure that the United States would notenter a war in Europe on the side of England against Germany. Isolationism, inthis context, was equivalent to aiding and abetting the Third Reich in all ofits policies. The idea was to allow Hitler free reign in Europe by turningAmerican sentiment against another conflict abroad. Supporters of America Firstincluded Father Coughlin—who was himself implicated in a Nazi spy ring, asmentioned above—and a somewhat more enigmatic H. Keith Thompson as we shall see.Other high-placed isolationists included the heir to the Quaker Oats fortune,the owner of Morton Salt, the chairman of Sears, Roebuck, Walt Disney, and thepublishers of the New York Daily News and the Chicago Tribune. These were nameswith which every American was familiar, names that added a comfort factor to themessage the AFC was promoting. That message was couched in the homely andfamiliar, the gemutlichkeit of the American middle class, making it appear as ifthe AFC was a bottom-up organization, a grass-roots movement of right-thinking(no pun intended) and hard-working people, when in reality it was a top-downpolitical action committee being manipulated by Old Money.There were politicians who were supporters of AFC as well, such as futurepresident and Warren Commission member Gerald Ford when he was still a collegestudent, some Democrat senators from Montana and Massachusetts, and even thehead of the Socialist Party of America. AFC had successfully branded itself as apatriotic organization that put the interests of the American people ahead ofall other considerations, and many found it a convenient vehicle for promotingtheir own political platforms. Gradually, however, the true nature of themovement was revealed as speech after speech by movement leaders identified theproblems facing America as those of international communism, the Jewish lobby,and the threat of American intervention in the war about to rip Europe apart.“America First” became synonymous with allowing Hitler to rampage unimpededthroughout Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and the rest of Europe, keepingAmerican troops out of the conflict, and letting Great Britain fend for itself.It was vitally important to Hitler that America stay out of the conflict becausehe was already stretched too thin across two fronts and didn't need the countrywho helped defeat Germany in the First World War to come back to Europe and doit a second time. Roosevelt knew the danger of permitting Hitler free reign, buthe could not convince the American people of this. He ran on a platform ofkeeping America out of war, and as time went by it was becoming increasinglydifficult to honor that commitment.On September 11, 1941 Charles Lindbergh gave an important speech before hisfollowers in Des Moines, Iowa (today a state whose primary elections are lookedupon as bellweathers for the success or failure of presidential candidates). Inthis speech he railed against the Jews as being in control of the media andagitating for war against Germany. (Of course, the hugely influential New YorkDaily News and the Chicago Tribune, supporters of America First, were exemptfrom this characterization which leads one to wonder to which media specificallyLindbergh was referring.) He blamed the British for trying to drag America intothe conflict, and the Roosevelt administration for collaborating with both theJews and the British in this regard. While he expressed sympathy for the Jewishplight in Germany, he also warned American Jews that things could get a lotworse for them if they persisted in dragging America into the conflict.Precisely three months later, to the day, America First was disbanded as theUnited States was attacked by Japanese forces at Pearl Harbor on December 7,1941. The position of the America First Committee became untenable. However,while the organization as such disappeared, the individual members did notabandon their faith. Some wholeheartedly joined the fight for victory overHitler, but others waited for events to turn in their direction. (Even H. KeithThompson—who bragged of being a member of the Nazi Sicherheitsdienst or SecurityService (SD)—enlisted in the US Navy.) Many interpreted the war as a Jewish war,a Communist war, part of an overall struggle that was essentially racial andspiritual in nature and that would not end with the signing of a peace treaty ordefeat on the battlefield.After all, Christianity itself survived underground for more than threecenturies before Constantine made it a state religion.2 [../Text/part0009_split_001.html#c1-ft2] Uki Goñi, The Real ODESSA.3 [../Text/part0009_split_002.html#c1-ft3] As we will see in a later chapter,both American industrialists such as Henry Ford, and German industrialists werestrong supporters of Hitler and the Nazi Party, in part due to their rejectionof Communism and the denial of workers' rights.4 [../Text/part0009_split_003.html#c1-ft4] We will get into more detail on thisenigmatic figure—Graf Karl von Dürck-heim—in a later chapter.5 [../Text/part0009_split_003.html#c1-ft5] My reading of Darwin's Theoryindicates that it was based on the understanding of a natural process takingplace over millions of years and not amenable to human intervention ortinkering.

H. Keith Thompson—an American member of the Sicherheitsdienst (theintelligence branch of the SS) and a man who swore a loyalty oath toHitler—contributed generously to Buchanan's political campaigns. Buchananhimself revealed that it was he who convinced then-President Reagan to lay awreathe at the SS cemetery in Bitburg, Germany “because they were victims, too.”Buchanan has appeared as a guest on syndicated radio programs hosted by theextreme right, such as Stormfront, and has blamed the Holocaust on WinstonChurchill, saying that England's entry into the war somehow forced Hitler tobegin slaughtering Jews, Gypsies and other “undesirables.” The meeting at whichSS General Otto Remer spoke (as a guest of H. Keith Thompson) was held under theauspices of the Liberty Lobby which has been an outspoken supporter of Holocaustdenial.

As I have stated before inseveral places, we are still fighting the First World War and it is possiblethat future generations will refer to the period 1914-present as the “SecondHundred Years War.”It is astonishing how greatly events in the Middle East affect the peace andsecurity of the entire world, yet at the same time how little most of us knowabout the origins of those events. When we speak today of the MuslimBrotherhood, of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the situation in Iraq orAfghanistan or Iran, of the “Arab Spring,” we are not really speaking aboutrecent events but about circumstances that were set in motion a century ago; andwhen we throw around the term jihad as if we know what it means and what itrepresents, what we do not realize is that the current, contemporary phenomenonwe call “global jihad” or what some journalists and academics call jihadism hasits origins not in the Middle East but in Europe, not from Muslims but fromChristians, and not in the seventh century but in the twentieth: long after thedeath of the Prophet.While the concept of jihad as religious struggle is enshrined in Islam, thepolitical application of global jihad is relatively recent and dates to theFirst World War. At that time, Germany and Turkey (the “Axis Powers”) wereallies against the British, the French, and the Russians (the “Triple Entente”).As we will see, in the period October–November, 1914, the Kaiser'srepresentative in Turkey urged the Ottoman Caliph, Sultan Mehmed V, to declare aholy war, a jihad, against the Entente. This he did, on November 12, 1914, whichwas followed by a fatwa issued by the Sheikh-ul-Islam (the leading spiritualauthority of the Empire) a few days later on November 14. This jihad was toencompass the entire world and the call went out to Muslims everywhere on theplanet to rise up against the European colonizers and destroy them.That this was motivated by purely political motives is obvious from the context.Germany was at war with the European powers of Great Britain, France and CzaristRussia. The proclamation of jihad and the accompanying fatwa specified thesenations as “enemies of Islam.” Germany was just as Christian as the countriesnamed in the fatwa, but that was clearly not the issue. Cynically, religioussentiment was used by both political and religious leaders to incite revolt.Jihad was a stratagem, a means to an end, and that end was the elimination ofthe colonial powers from the Middle East. It was a stratagem devised by theGermans and implemented by the Turks in order to control access to the oilfields of the Middle East and, of course, the Suez Canal, wresting access awayfrom the colonial powers and replacing one set of masters with another.This was a carefully-conceived attempt to unite the otherwise woefully disunited“Arabs” in a military campaign designed to stretch from Tunisia to Mesopotamia,Persia, and Afghanistan, encompassing all of what is now Saudi Arabia and theLevant: the countries of Lebanon, Palestine, Syria and what is today theHashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Anyone familiar with the facts on the ground inthis region at the time understands that it was not a monolithic ethnic entity,just as Islam is not a monolithic faith with a central cathedral and a pope.Instead, the region was—and to a large extent still is—populated by factions andrivalries and cultural differences that are just as vast as those between (forinstance) Hungarians and Italians, only more so. The 18th century fundamentalistIslamic revival of Wahhabism found its supporters in the Arab tribes under IbnSaud—for instance—while this same doctrine was considered heresy by theHashemite rulers of the Hejaz (the area where the holy cities of Mecca andMedina are located). The peoples of what is today Saudi Arabia are almostexclusively Sunni Muslims, who view the Shi'ite Muslims of what is today Iranand most of Iraq as heretics and infidels. Throw into the mix the Kurds, thevarious Christian sects, and antinomian groups like the Yezidis, and you beginto realize that there is no such thing as the “Arabs” except as a kind ofconvention for referring to people whose primary language is Arabic. Of course,that would not include Persia/Iran (who speak a different language and who areethnically distinct from the Semitic Arabs), or the Urdu-speaking populations ofCentral Asia, the Turks, and many others.A call to the common faith of the majority of the population in the region,however, could sidestep these obvious difficulties and unite these fractious,warring clans into a common cause against the British, the French, and theRussians if it was claimed that the Caliphate itself was in danger from them.That, anyway, was the idea.The Ottoman Empire had suffered a string of humiliating defeats at the hands ofthe colonial powers in the decades prior to the outbreak of the First World War.The Caliphate had lost territories in North Africa (Libya to the Italians, andEgypt to the British) and the Balkans (the First and Second Balkan Wars of 1912and 1913, respectively, which contributed directly to the assassination ofArchduke Ferdinand by a Serbian nationalist that ignited the First World War). Amilitary alliance with Germany would give the Empire an opportunity to regainsome semblance of national pride, as well as unite the various warring factionsin its domain by identifying the foe with a kind of cosmic evil: “enemies ofIslam.”While the war proved disastrous for the Ottoman Empire and led to its collapse,the idea of jihad as a weapon that could be wielded by the non-Muslim Westernpowers did not lose its luster. As Czarist Russia fell to the Bolsheviks duringthe war, a new enemy was found to unite the Western powers and Islam in a newcommon cause. This time it was atheistic, “godless” Communism which,conveniently, was considered an invention of the Jews. This, coupled with thenews that England and France were betraying the Arab revolt against Turkey bydividing up the Middle East between them (the Sykes-Picot Agreement, to whichthere were no Arab signatories), while providing a homeland for European Jews inPalestine (as set forth in the Balfour Declaration, to which there also were noArab signatories) meant that the European powers were once again intent oncolonizing the Middle East—and the nefarious Jews were behind it all. The cosmicstruggle against the “enemies of Islam” was thus refined to the extent that itwas now a struggle between Islam and the Jews (and their allies, the Christian“crusaders”). What began as a holy war against European colonialism and theeffort to remove the European powers from the lands of the Levant, Central Asia,and the Maghreb gradually was being transformed into a religious conflict perse. Or, at least that was the way it was being presented.And once again it would be Germany that would come to the rescue of theFaithful."},{"pageContent":"MAX FREIHERR VON OPPENHEIM, ABU JIHADInvoking jihad was the idea of Max von Oppenheim, the German “Abu Jihad.” Inlate October 1914, before the Ottomans had entered the war (siding with theCentral Powers) he designed a master plan “fomenting rebellion in the Islamicterritories of our enemies.”—Wolfgang G. Schwanitz, “German Middle East Early Years.”The man most often credited with having single-handedly created the idea ofglobal (as opposed to localized) jihad was an amateur archaeologist. Max vonOppenheim (1860–1946) was one of that breed of late-nineteenth andearly-twentieth century adventurers who longed after exotic locales, ancientruins, and international intrigue. Coming from the famous Oppenheim bankingdynasty, Max's mother was Catholic but his father was a Jewish convert toCatholicism, thus making Max what the Nazis would call Mischlinge, a “hybrid” or“mixed race.” Early on, Max decided he did not want to be a banker but wantedinstead to travel abroad, and this he did first in the military and later as anarchaeologist and adventurer in the decades before the outbreak of the FirstWorld War.He considered himself an expert on Middle Eastern affairs, although he had noacademic credentials at all in the fields in which he felt most comfortable:archaeology, ancient civilizations, and most importantly Islam. He lived inCairo for years, in an apartment near Al-Azhar University where he literallykept a small harem; he actually “bought” slave girls from the market on anannual basis. His exploits in that area became so well-known that a liaison withanother man's wife led to her being murdered by a jealous husband, who drownedher in the Nile.Oppenheim became something of a celebrity in his native Germany, and was knownto entertain all sorts of famous people, German and foreign, both in the MiddleEast and back home. Most people took it for granted that “the Baron” (as he wasknown) was a spy for the Kaiser's government. He was on close terms with theSultan of the Ottoman Empire, and later with the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem—andtherein hangs a tale.Oppenheim was twenty-three when he first visited Greece and Turkey, and twoyears later—in 1886—found himself in North Africa, where he began to engage inthe type of serial monogamy that is practiced in some Islamic cultures whereinone marries a woman for a short period of time and then divorces her, only toseek another to replace the first.This fascination with the “Orient” fueled Oppenheim's travels and intrigues forthe rest of his life. In 1892, Oppenheim began his first serious investigationof the Levant, traveling to Beirut, Damascus, and then eventually to Cairo wherehe put down stakes. Ostensibly he was there as an archaeologist, interested indigging for buried civilizations and ruined cities. Of course, he also spentsome time as a kind of government agent, building relationships with Bedouintribes in Arabia, and cultivating friendships among the influential denizens ofthe mysterious East.Oppenheim's archaeological expeditions took him far afield. While he is betterknown for his excavations in Syria at Tell Halaf, he also spent considerabletime in North Africa—from Algeria and Tunisia to Libya and of course Egypt. Hiscontacts among the indigenous peoples across the region convinced him that asummons to an unprecedented global jihad against the Kaiser's enemies would befruitful and would unite the entire Muslim world against the Entente. Key tothis strategy was the cooperation of the Ottoman government and its spiritualleader, the Sheikh ul-Islam, whose fatwa was considered an important element ofthe strategy for fomenting a region-wide revolt against the British, French andRussians. As the intrigues between Germany and Turkey began to take form,Oppenheim's idea of global jihad developed as a tool of German military policy.Oppenheim had the Kaiser's ear; he was named an official adviser to the Kaiserand supplied him with hundreds of reports every year on the situation in NorthAfrica (the Maghreb) and the Middle East. So it was with the Kaiser's approvalthat the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was approached in October of 1914 with theproposal that he declare a jihad against the Kaiser's enemies, thus sealing therelationship between Germany and the Ottomans during the First World War.It should be remarked that even though Germany had foreign colonies, these werelargely in Africa. While these colonial territories numbered upwards of twomillion Muslim inhabitants, oddly they were not considered “Muslim territories.”Thus the Kaiser could get away with pointing the Ottomans at the other Europeanpowers who did have colonies in lands whose populations were largely Muslim.Germany also had territories in East Papua and in some South Pacific islands buttheir populations were not Muslim. Italy—ostensibly Germany's ally for at leastpart of the war—was nervous about the call to jihad against the “enemies ofIslam,” for they had occupied Libya, and were afraid that those living in thispredominantly Muslim country would heed the call to arms and turn on them. This,of course, was always the possibility and something very like this would come topass in the years to come. The intelligence community has a word for it:blowback.This ploy may not have worked at all save for the fact that the Kaiser himselfwas a fan of the Middle East and particularly of Islam, so much so that he wasgiven the honorific of “Hajji Wilhelm,” a title normally only conferred onsomeone who had made the pilgrimage—the hajj—to Mecca. The Kaiser and the Baronwere drunk on the same Orientalist fantasy of whirling dervishes, sensuousconcubines, gorgeous architecture, flowing robes, flashing scimitars, and vast,lonely desert spaces that was the stuff of European dreams of the “Orient.” TheKaiser had received a hero's welcome on a pre-war visit to Jerusalem and hadstood in awe before the tomb of the famous Muslim commander Saladin: the man whoput an end to the Christian Crusader dreams of conquest for a thousand years.Thus, the Kaiser not only saw the idea of global jihad as a practical politicalasset, but he also dreamed of an alliance with the Caliph and the emirs, thesheikhs and the Bedouins of the exotic lands of Arabia Deserta and the fabledcities of Baghdad, Damascus, Jerusalem, Mecca, and Cairo.Both he and his trusted advisor—Max von Oppenheim—saw what they wanted to see.Oppenheim was convinced that the entire region would rise up in support of theTurkish-German alliance in response to the call of holy war; and that the Kaiserwould thus have an easy time of controlling the Suez Canal; and, in the process,develop lucrative trade routes and business relations with Constantinople andthe East. They saw their own reflections in the shimmering desert sands and theglow of a thousand minarets.The fatwa was translated into Arabic, Farsi, and Urdu, as well as French, thustargeting not only the Arabs of the Levant and the Maghreb, but also thoseMuslims living in Persia (Iran) who were Shi'ites, and those living in India andAfghanistan. This was intended to be a truly global jihad, designed to summonwarriors from the entire region that had been colonized by the French and theBritish, from North Africa all the way to India. It was to be an uprisingencompassing millions of the faithful—Sunni and Shi'a, Arab and Persian,Afghani, Turk, and Central Asians—in a call to arms against the European“enemies of Islam.” As such, it could be considered the first of its kind.There were other elements in the fatwa that bear repeating here. For instance,Oppenheim suggested that the jihad not be limited to pitched battles and armiesin the field (that would be the responsibility of the Ottoman Army), but thatthe struggle could be carried out by individuals, using assassination and otherterror tactics against the infidels. It also suggested that “bands” of jihadistsbe created in various countries to wage war against the occupiers.14[../Text/part0010_split_002.html#c2-aft14] Thus, the “lone wolf” and “terrorcell” concepts were enshrined in the idea of global jihad as early as 1914 ...and by a German of mixed Catholic and Jewish ancestry who was neither Arab norMuslim.Unfortunately for both, the call to jihad was not embraced by all Muslims. TheSaudi princes in particular were not comfortable with the arrangement and—as iswell known—they rose up in revolt against the Ottoman Caliphate, aided andabetted by the British government with promises of gold and independence. Thisis the revolt that made another archaeologist—-T.E. Lawrence (1888–1935)—famousthroughout the world, thanks partly to the public relation efforts of Americanjournalist Lowell Thomas. Lawrence was a British intelligence officer withexperience in the region and with some Arabic language capability, who saw inthe putative Arab Revolt a possibility to remove Ottoman rule from the Saudipeninsula and from there to the region generally. While the Ottomans werefighting pitched battles in the nineteenth century tradition, Lawrenceunderstood that guerrilla war against them would be more efficient andsuccessful. His approach was a type of “asymmetrical warfare” that we willexamine later, as it comes up in the context of not only “global jihad” but alsoin terms of the Nazi underground.Thus, we had the English archaeologist Lawrence on one side of the conflict, andthe German archaeologist Oppenheim on the other: each trying to convince hisside of the righteousness of his respective cause, and each manipulating thesituation (and the trust) of the Arabs in service to European masters, and apost-war strategy that would have benefited no one but the Europeans.While the jihad strategy did not work as it was intended (the German-Ottomanalliance was defeated in World War One, and the Ottoman Empire fell a few yearslater) it did sow the seeds of what would become a grander and more articulatedtool of Western foreign policy—one that the Germans would revisit less thantwenty years later when the war drums again were beating in Europe and vibratingbeneath the sands of Arabia. The Oppenheim concept of global jihad was nothingless than the weaponization of religion in the service of German territorialambitions; and it was a weapon that could be wielded with cold efficiency onlyby those who had no religious sensitivity themselves. (Oppenheim had repudiatedhis Jewish origins and only identified himself as Catholic in order to avoid theopprobrium attached to his Semitic background. As far as we know, he was not aconvert to Islam, which made his urging of jihad particularly hypocritical.) Insum, global jihad was originally conceived as a tool for Western, Europeancolonialists to (ironically) manipulate anti-colonial sentiments by elevatingthem to the status of divine ordinance, taking what was a political and economicsituation—colonialism—and interpreting it within a purely religious context. Thestruggle of the colonized against the colonizers (an ancient construct goingback to at least the time of the Roman Empire) was recast as the cosmic,Manichaean conflict between the forces of good and the forces of evil. (Aprecedent might be seen in the revolt of the Jews against the Romans in thefirst century CE, which produced the Book of Revelation.)This approach required a level of cynicism and a degree of sang froid that stillis astonishing, even when examined from the remove of one hundred years. Thewillingness of the Sultan to go along with this strategy is evidence of just howmorally bankrupt the Ottoman Empire was at the time. It goes a long way towardexplaining why the Saudis in particular—infused with the fundamentalistdoctrines of Wahhabism, which center on a complete rejection of modernism andforeign influence—did not accept it, and instead raised their swords against theSultan's armies in defiance of the fatwa. They had indeed opposed the OttomanEmpire since the early nineteenth century, but again and again were defeatedmilitarily. It was only with the end of World War One and the collapse of theEmpire that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia—founded on Wahhabi principles—wascreated.But that was not the end of Oppenheim or of the idea of global jihad at theservice of non-Muslims. By the time Hitler had become Chancellor of Germany, theidea of global jihad had been combined with another European invention:anti-Semitism.And thus the die was cast for the great global terrorism epidemic of thetwentieth and the twenty-first centuries.15[../Text/part0010_split_002.html#c2-aft15]"},{"pageContent":"THE GRAND MUFTIThe armistice that was signed in November, 1918 formally ending the First WorldWar was not the seal of enduring peace that everyone desired. If anything, itset the pieces on the chessboard for even greater conflict to come. The Treatyof Versailles was one problem, for it was seen by many as unnecessarily punitiveto Germany. This is not the place to go into a discussion of all the factorsthat led to the outbreak of war and its devastating aftermath; suffice it to saythat this era is still being discussed and debated; and that there is noconsensus among scholars and historians as to who (if anyone) should bear thesole culpability for what was seen as the most horrendous war in modern times.At the same time as the war was coming to a close, Czarist Russia had become theSoviet Union; and on the other side of the Mediterranean from Europe, NorthAfrica and the Middle East were still in flames.The Arab Revolt clearly had been betrayed. That was the idea all along. Thedespised colonizers of Great Britain and France had lived up to their reputationand carved up the region between themselves, deciding who should be theirregents on the ground and where. In Arabia, there was a struggle between theHouse of Saud and the Hashemite Kingdom for control over the region, with theHashemites eventually losing Arabia to the Saudis (who were heavily influencedby the Wahhabi sect). Faisal—the Hashemite leader immortalized by the Englishactor Alec Guinness in the film Lawrence of Arabia—became briefly King of Syriauntil ousted by the French, and then King of Iraq (a region where no one knewwho he was). It was Faisal who wanted to create a pan-Arab state uniting Sunnisand Shi'ites and who even considered helping the Jews find a homeland inPalestine (if it were under Arab control).Thus the early post-World War One history of the Middle East is one of Arableaders jockeying for position among themselves and currying favor with theirnew landlords—the British and French rulers who had replaced the Ottomans as theforce to be reckoned with in the region. There was also the thorny issue ofIsrael and the British Mandate of Palestine, which seemed to indicate that theEuropean powers were planning on establishing a state within the Arab world thatwould be answerable to (and controlled by) them. Faisal and Chaim Weizmann—thefamous Zionist leader, and eventually the first President of Israel—came toterms on the plan for a Jewish homeland. Faisal hoped that an alliance with theZionists would assure him of continued British support, especially against theFrench. Add to this the fact that the boundaries of the new Arab nations ofIraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Transjordan, etc. were being drawn by twoEnglish archaeologists—-T.E. Lawrence and Gertrude Bell—and you have a cauldronin which future conflicts and unbelievable tragedies would begin to boil.In other words, it was political chaos.In Palestine itself, there was growing resentment against the presence of theEuropean powers and the perceived intentions of the Jews to take over theAl-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. This idea was spread by the spiritual leader ofPalestine's Muslims, Haj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem andfriend of the aforementioned Max von Oppenheim. It led to the outbreak of realviolence during the 1929 Palestine riots.Al-Husseini (1897–1974), a native of Jerusalem, had served with the Ottoman armyduring World War One, but after the war shifted his allegiance to Faisal and thenotion of a pan-Arab Empire. However, Faisal would be defeated in his aims inSyria by the French army, leaving al-Husseini disillusioned with Arabinternationalism. He left Damascus for Jerusalem and decided to explore a morenationalist agenda in Palestine. A riot that broke out between Muslims and Jewsduring the Nabi Musa procession in Jerusalem in 1920 gave form to al-Husseini'sdeveloping ideology.The Nabi Musa (“Prophet Moses”) procession had been an annual event for athousand years, since the time of Saladin (according to tradition). It alwaystook place during the Easter festival, beginning on the Friday before GreatFriday (the Catholic Good Friday) in the Eastern Orthodox Calendar, and involveda procession from Jerusalem to Jericho, to a site where it is believed Moses isburied.By the time the Ottoman Turks had renovated the buildings along the route of theprocession in 1820, the date of the festival was changed to Easter Sundayitself, thus allowing both Christians and Muslims to celebrate on the same dayin honor of the prophets of both religions: an ecumenical tradition that itwould be difficult to conceive taking place today.In 1920, however, political tensions in Palestine were already running high.Al-Husseini was in the middle of the controversy, instigating what would becomea full-fledged riot between Arabs and Jews that would last for days—with ninekilled (both Arabs and Jews) and hundreds more injured. This was al-Husseini'spublic “coming out” as an anti-Zionist, and he made speeches to that effectaccompanied by his uncle, the mayor of Jerusalem. Al-Husseini reiterated thatthe Balfour Declaration made it impossible for the indigenous populations ofPalestine to have the right to selfdetermination which had already been grantedto other populations in the Ottoman Empire. By declaring a National Home for theJews in Palestine, the British had effectively told the Palestinians that theyhad no rights over their own territory. In addition, there were Socialistelements among the Zionists in Palestine, and this increased the paranoia beingfelt by the local population at this perceived Jewish-Communist conspiracy.The Nabi Musa riots of 1920 introduced the concept of a global plot—aided andabetted by the European powers—to invade and conquer Palestine, to put nativePalestinians under first British and then Jewish rule, and eventually to takeover the al-Aqsa Mosque: one of the three most important Islamic sites afterMecca and Medina. A few weeks previously, Faisal had been proclaimed King ofSyria and claimed Palestine as part of his Kingdom, a step that proveddisastrous for Syria was French territory, and the British were still in controlof Palestine. In addition, this declaration alarmed the Jewish population for itimplied that they would be living under an Arab—and a Muslim—ruler and wouldlose the protection of the British Mandate. In fact, there was division overthis issue even among the Arabs over whether or not they wanted to be under therule of a Hashemite king. As noted previously, Faisal's ill-timed coronation ledto the French-Syrian “war” of 1920 in which he lost his crown, only to reappeara few years later as the King of Iraq.Haj Amir al-Husseini was blamed by some British diplomats in the region forhaving fanned the flames of Muslim outrage against the British and the Jews; butthey also cited similar inflammatory rhetoric coming from the Zionistleadership, who were nervous that the British were cooperating much more closelywith the Arabs than with them. Chaim Weizmann characterized the Nabi Musa riotsas a “pogrom” because he felt that some British military officers and diplomatswere behind the manipulation of the Arabs, inciting them to riot in order toshow the world that the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine was hopeless. Inthe end, the British Palin Commission blamed both sides for the riots, and evencited Bolshevism as having an influence over the Zionist activists (not a chargethat could be levelled against the Muslims).As for al-Husseini, he was convicted in absentia for his role in the riot butwas pardoned by the British the following year. In March of 1921, he wasappointed Mufti of Jerusalem (the title used for high-ranking Islamic scholars)even though he had no academic qualifications for the post; and in 1922, he wonthe election to the position of Grand Mufti—which means the highest authority onIslamic law in a given country, able to issue fatwas (decrees or edicts) and toissue judgments on particulars of Islamic jurisprudence. He was disqualified forthis role in initial balloting, but some Byzantine, behind-the-scenesmaneuvering managed to place him ahead of the more moderate Islamic scholars,and he held the title for life.Al-Husseini's academic career was a major sore point with the ulama, the Islamicscholars, of Palestine. He did indeed attend the prestigious Al-Azhar Universityin Cairo and studied under the controversial Rashid Rida—a Salafi scholar whoargued for a return to the fundamental principles of Islam, while at the sametime embracing science including the Theory of Evolution—but he never finishedhis studies or received a degree. Instead, he enlisted in the Ottoman armyduring the First World War and when that war was over flirted with the idea ofpan-Arabism under Faisal until that experiment failed at the Battle of Maysalun.By all accounts, al-Husseini was a charismatic speaker and orator who identifiedthe enemies of Islam as modernization and Westernization. The Jews were carriersof modern thinking and ideas—including, of course, Bolshevism—and their verypresence in Palestine was the cause of moral decay and decadence.By the middle of the 1920s, al-Husseini's political platform was becoming moreconcretized, even as England's was descending into confusion. Although theBalfour Declaration, which provided the framework for a Jewish National Home inPalestine, was a British creation, many Britons were hostile to the ideaincluding many military men and diplomats on the ground. As the Jews begancreating a self-defence force in Palestine known as the Haganah the British wereunderstandably unsympathetic, even though the Nabi Musa riots had shown that theBritish were either incapable of defending Jewish life and property, or weremore or less completely disinterested in doing so. After the riots had ended, acommunity of local sheikhs actually issued a proclamation repudiating theviolence against the Jews, but the die had been cast. A new narrative was aboutto be born, and it became the Grand Unified Theory of Islamist terrorism:anti-Zionism became equivalent to anti-Semitism; the Jews had created Bolshevismas a mechanism for dividing and conquering all other races; they were aided andabetted in this program by the European powers—the “Crusaders”—who cooperatedwith the Jews in order to enslave the Muslims; and that the only way to defendArab, i.e. Muslim, territories against the invaders was to proclaim a jihad.Since the Arabs did not have the same access to money and military equipment asthe Crusaders and the Jews, the jihad would have to be waged “by any meansnecessary.” This included the regimen suggested by Oppenheim16[../Text/part0010_split_002.html#c2-aft16] of individual assassinations,independent bands of jihadists, and guerrilla warfare that included targetingcivilian populations. Once Jews were identified as the enemy of Islam, thedesignation of enemy combatant could be extended to include not only able-bodiedmen who carried arms and fought in pitched battles, but anyone who was Jewish:women, children, and all those previously considered noncombatants.This was not a war of armies against armies; that paradigm had lost the AxisPowers the First World War. This would be instead a war of civilians againstcivilians, of religion against religion, of ethnicity against ethnicity. Thisnew paradigm would become enshrined in the concept of “total war,” a phrasecoined by former German General Erich Ludendorf (1865–1937) to designate a statein which all the resources of a nation had to be mobilized in the war effort.When two such states are at war, then it is inevitable that civilian populationson both sides would be slaughtered in an effort of each side to deprive theother of the raw material of conflict—to destroy logistical support, industry,agriculture and most of all every human being who could grow food, makeammunition, or fire a weapon. To Ludendorf, war was the actual, permanent stateof human activity: intervals of peace only served to replenish the human andmaterial stocks of nations in preparation for the next war.Ludendorf had taken part in Hitler's failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, and onceHitler had come to power in Germany he openly courted Ludendorf's approval andsupport; but by this time, the old general had become something of a mystic whobelieved the world's problems had been created by Jews, Christians, andFreemasons (in other words, a veritable template for al-Husseini's politicaltheory as well as for the Nazi Party itself). Nevertheless, Ludendorf's “totalwar” had become the jihadist's “holy war.”As the decade of the 1920s progressed, the situation in Palestine became worse.Tensions between the Palestinians and the new Jewish immigrants were transformedinto open hostility resulting in several massacres and pitched battles. TheBritish appeared increasingly helpless to manage the territory, and with everynew conflict al-Husseini's reputation grew. He became the face of Palestinianresistance against the British mandate and against Jewish immigration. In hisposition as Grand Mufti, he was also the supreme religious authority among theMuslims of Palestine. Like his idol, Hitler, al-Husseini would combine politicalgoals and anti-Western ideology with a call to religious conviction andspiritual necessity. It would prove to be an irresistible combination.The situation in Europe was growing more dangerous for Jews by the hour.Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch had taken place in Germany in 1923, and hisanti-Semitic newspaper Der Stürmer began publication that year. Arrested by theauthorities, but given only a slap on the wrist for what was, after all, hightreason Hitler spent 1923–1925 in prison writing the memoir that would becomeMein Kampf. During that time a wave of pogroms in Poland in 1924 resulted in anoverwhelming number of refugees seeking sanctuary in Palestine, to the tune ofmore than 65,000, and a violent reaction by Palestinians to this new influx.That same year Arabs attacked Jewish communities and confronted not the Britisharmy but the Haganah. When the dust cleared more than 100 each of Jews and Arabswere dead and many others wounded.Things only got worse as the global economic crisis deepened. The Jewish Agencydecided to include non-Zionists in its ranks in order to raise more funds forthe ongoing settlement project. This development deepened Palestinian fears thata European-Jewish cabal was being created to disenfranchise the considerablypoorer Arabs in the region. The combination of tens of thousands of new EuropeanJewish immigrants, plus an undisclosed amount of money to back them up,indicated to Arab leaders like al-Husseini that the Jews had a long-range planthat would inevitably include seizure of the holy places of Islam and the forcedevacuation of all Arabs from Palestine.In 1929 violence erupted as Arab gangs attacked Jewish settlements nearJerusalem in a wildfire campaign which expanded to include Hebron, Safed, andthe Gaza Strip. The riots went on for six long days and saw the death once againof more than one hundred Jews and many wounded. It should be noted that theBritish Army did not intervene until nearly a full week of violence had takenplace.A commission that was named to discover the reasons for this outbreak ofviolence in the Holy Land came to the conclusion that ambiguous promises by theBritish Government to both Arabs and Jews had contributed to the current stateof affairs. The Shaw Commission, as it was known, recommended that some claritybe interjected into the situation and issues like land tenure and immigration bereviewed in order to forestall further violence.However, by 1930, the release of yet another British document on Palestine—thePassfield White Paper—insisted that England's promises to the Arab leaders weresufficiently important that to ignore them in favor of Jewish settlement and theNational Home project would be inadvisable. It seemed as if the government wasabout ready to overturn the Balfour Declaration, and the British Prime Ministerfound himself forced to write a letter to Chaim Weizmann saying, essentially,that the Declaration still stood and Britain's commitment to the establishmentof a National Home for the Jews was unswerving.The seesaw effect of all these mixed signals was demoralizing to both Jews andArabs. There was no clear-cut and unequivocal position being taken on the planfor a Jewish homeland in Palestine, but by the 1930s it seemed to many like afait accompli. More than 160,000 Jews had already settled in Palestine by thistime, and although the Arab population was greater (more than eighty percent ofthe total population of 1,035,000), the Jewish presence was more powerful anddetermined. They had the backing of European governments and European funds.But in 1933, Adolf Hitler was proclaimed Chancellor of Germany.And by 1935, the Nuremberg Laws were passed which denied Germany's Jews therights of citizenship.No matter who was considered right or legally or morally justified in theirposition concerning Palestine and the putative Jewish Homeland, by 1935 thestakes had risen to an astonishing degree. The Jews now were on the verge oflosing everything they had in Europe, including even their lives.13 [../Text/part0010_split_000.html#c2-ft13] As referenced in Sean McMeekin, TheBerlin-Baghdad Express, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2010, p. 195.14 [../Text/part0010_split_001.html#c2-ft14] See Sean McMeekin, TheBerlin-Baghdad Express, Cambridge, Harvard U.

Both Arco-Valley and Dürckheim wererelated to the Oppenheim banking dynasty and, interestingly enough, the nameOppenheim crops up again in our research via a connection with the EscapeOrganization that was being run out of the German Archaeological Institute inRome (as mentioned in Ratline).16 [../Text/part0010_split_002.html#c2-ft16] Indeed, Oppenheim and al-Husseiniwere friends and colleagues. See, for instance, McMeekin (2010), p. 360. Thiswas a relationship that lasted throughout the Second World War and is a link inthe chain of the Kaiser's “global jihad” in 1914 and al-Husseini's revoltagainst the British beginning ten years later."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEZEITGEISTThe forces of life and blood exist and will be effective. The very state thattoday charges us with crimes against humanity, the United States of America,ought to listen with particular attentiveness to the theories of race andheredity if it wishes to preserve its power. Fourteen million Negroes andmulattos, four to five million Jews, the Japanese in the west, and the rest, aremore than America can carry without endangering the heritage of her pioneers.But if the present generation fails to do something to elude the fate of someday having twenty-five million Negroes and mulattos, ten million Jews andhalf-Jews in America, then a later generation will certainly be harsh in itsjudgement. The Americans will have to decide whether they want a white Americaor whether they want to make the choice of their President ever more a questionof additional concessions toward mulattoisation. In the latter case, the UnitedStates of America, in a few centuries, will go the way of Greece and Rome; andthe Catholic Church, which even today has black bishops, will be the pacemaker.The day will come when the grandchildren of the present generation will beashamed of the fact that we have been accused as criminals for having harboureda most noble thought, simply because of its deterioration in times of warthrough unworthy orders.—Alfred Rosenberg17 [../Text/part0011_split_003.html#c3-aft17]It would be wrong to believe that the events of the 1930s in Germany andPalestine went somehow unnoticed by the rest of the world; it would be equallywrong to believe that they were anomalies, that they represented some kind ofidiosyncratic ideologies and cultural phenomena that were native to otherpeoples in strange lands.In fact, many Americans were on intimate terms with what was happening overseasand they took sides according to their own beliefs, many of which were religiousas well as political, cultural as well as ideological. The same was true ofindividuals and groups in Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, France, Spain, Portugal,the Netherlands, and other countries in Europe, as well as in Latin America,South Africa, and Asia. Nazism became a global phenomenon even as it resistedany attempts at being “internationalized” like Communism or Socialism. It was,first and foremost, a “white” ideology and those in foreign countries whoself-identified as coming from white European stock—even if they were living inLatin America, South Africa or Asia—were part of the Nazi “demographic.” Themistake some historians make in categorizing Nazism as a purely German (orGerman-Austrian) affair are missing a vital aspect of why and how it was able tosurvive the war as an ideology and as a political action network in regions asremote from Germany as Argentina and Paraguay, South Africa and Indonesia.Chicago and New York.As we saw in Chapter One [../Text/part0009_split_000.html#c1], there was a vocalminority of Americans on the extreme right who supported Hitler's goals and whoharbored a deep suspicion and hatred of Jews and a pronounced antipathy towardsRussia and Communism. With the outbreak of World War Two, many of theseindividuals and groups either went underground or affirmed their allegiance tothe United States of America and enlisted in the war effort, patriotism thusoutweighing ideology, at least in the short term. Before December 7, 1941however, the presence in the United States of a cohesive network of Nazi agentsaided and abetted by German government officials was attracting considerableattention from the FBI as well as the media. As in the rest of theworld—especially Europe but also including Latin America—many people believedthat anyone who had a strong opinion against Nazism or Fascism had to be aCommunist or a Communist sympathizer, what was known as a “fellow traveler.”Books and articles that attacked Nazism often bore imprints of publishingcompanies that were known fronts for socialist groups in the United States.Outspoken opponents of the Nazis were labeled “Jews” or “Communists” and oftenboth. As we have seen, even President Franklin D. Roosevelt was not immune fromthese charges, and he was elected four times.In addition, antipathy towards Roman Catholicism was also at an all-time high.It is perhaps not as well known, but the Nazis had passed laws discriminatingagainst Catholics as well as Jews, forbidding Catholics to hold political officeor to function as professors in universities, etc. The Nazis had lumped Jews andCatholics together, for some of the same reasons: Catholics represented areligion whose members had allegiance to the Pope in Rome and this was achallenge to Nazi supremacy, just as the perceived unassimilatability of theJews was a challenge. Both the Jews and the Church were believed to have hiddenassets of considerable wealth. And the Church's origins were, of course, in thesame books of the Bible as the Jews: the Tanach.To some, this should have meant that the Church would form an allegiance withEuropean Jewry since they had a common enemy. In actuality, although the Churchhierarchy understood that Nazism represented a religious threat—as it was not apolitical party per se but a well-organized and well-armed cult that sought toreplace all religion in the Reich with Party ritual and ideology—the Church knewthat if it formed too close an association with the Jews it was in danger ofinviting the same consequences: isolation leading to internment and eventualextermination.Thus, while the Church objected most strongly to Nazism on theological grounds(and to Communism in Russia and Fascism in Italy) it did little on a practicallevel to oppose the Reich. Some apologists have said that this was a pragmaticdecision designed to preserve the Church and especially those Catholics livingin Germany, Austria, and the countries subsumed under the Reich. However, inlight of the considerable assistance given to the Nazis after the war by theChurch, it becomes increasingly difficult to accept this argument at face value.Eugenio Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII) was a Papal nuncio in Germany at theend of the First World War and remained in Germany for a decade after. Hewitnessed first-hand what had happened when Communists tried to take over thecountry and had sympathies with the Germans who wanted to oppose Communism inany form. At the same time, he was uncomfortable with the anti-Semitism beingopenly and aggressively promoted in Germany long before the Nazis came to power,and increasingly so once Hitler became Chancellor. He tried to formulate aChurch policy that involved invoking “charity” (cantos) as a universalprinciple: i.e., that all people (regardless of race and religion) deserved thebenefit of Catholic charity, that God's peace was not reserved for one race orone nation alone but for all human beings. This was an affront to Germannationalism, of course, and to the entire philosophical edifice (if such itmight be called) of Nazism.Ironically, it would be this principle of universal charity that the Churchwould invoke again when it came time to rescue Nazi fugitives after the war.Caritas was the name of the umbrella organization run by Pacelli and supervisedby Cardinal Montini (the future Pope Paul VI) to help the Nazis escape.In the United States, the Church was in a difficult position as well. While manybishops and other clergy were opposed to Nazism, there were those—like FatherCoughlin—who supported Nazism and who promoted such flagrant political hoaxes asThe Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion as if it were a real blueprint forglobal domination by the Jews.This was the spirit of the times, the Zeitgeist that haunted not only Americabut the world at large. Once Hitler was installed as Chancellor of Germany inJanuary 1933, and later proclaimed the Third Reich, German embassies andconsulates around the world had their ambassadors and consuls replaced by thoseloyal to the Nazi Party. That meant that Hitler's ideology (not only hisgovernment) now had a global presence; and the Party went to great lengths toensure that its message was being promoted aggressively around the world even asits agents—both overt and covert—began making contacts and issuing orders tooperatives in the media, in political office, in the military, and in everyaspect of daily life. Key figures in industry, politics and culture wereidentified as being sympathetic to Hitler's aims and cultivated accordingly. Thegoal was not only to promote the Nazi ideology abroad and win converts. Therewere other missions and they were often more sinister: such as identifying andprotecting sources of much-needed war materiel; or developing intelligencenetworks in foreign countries targeting the United States (from Mexico, forinstance, which was a hotbed of Nazi intrigues) and Latin America (from bases inChile and Argentina); and for developing resources for refueling and resupplyingU-boats (in Colombia and in Southeast Asia).The Reich's relationship with Franco's Spain and Salazar's Estado Novo regime inPortugal might have been problematic at times but they were all essentially onthe same page. Nationalist and Catholic, both Franco and Salazar were not onlysympathetic to Hitler's aims but—especially in Franco's case—willing to lendquiet logistical support to the Reich. Franco supplied refueling bases for theGerman Navy's submarines, and when the war was in its final year, allowed theshipment and transshipment of Nazi gold and artwork to and through Spain to getthem out of the hands of the Allies. Portugal provided safe haven for Nazi gold,and when the war was over more than forty tons of it was reported to have madeits way by U-boat to the Portuguese colony of Macau—from which half made its wayto China and the other half to Indonesia.Thus the Nazi movement clearly was not restricted to the Greater German Reichbut extended in one form or another around the world. This is an importantfactor to address, for it means that Nazism was not simply another politicalparty or ideological movement that would—sooner or later—be consigned to thedustbin of history. Nazism was—and still is—a living ideology that manages tosubsume so many different groups, economies, and even spiritualities for thevery reason that it remains non-specific and often vague in an intellectualsense, but clearly recognizable in an emotional and psychological context. Weknow what the Nazis were against: Jews, Communism, Freemasonry, miscegenation,“mongrel races,” “useless eaters,” and Christianity (among other things). Whatthe Nazis were for is rather more difficult to define. The information iscertainly there, but it has been overshadowed so completely by the war and byits program of genocide, that it has become convenient to characterize Nazismsimply as an ideology of hate. There is more to Nazism—and we ignore the otherdimensions of the Party, its leadership, its organizing principles, and itsagenda at our peril."},{"pageContent":"RACE AND POLITICSBy the time the Nuremberg Laws were enacted in 1935, Germany already knew thatworld opinion would not have a negative impact on its domestic policy or impairits ability to wage war. The voyage of the MS St Louis from Hamburg to Havana,Cuba in 1939 illustrates the confidence given to Hitler and the Party by therest of the world: first Cuba and then the United States itself refused entry tothe more than nine hundred Jews aboard the ship, forcing it back to Germany andcertain death for more than two hundred of its Jewish passengers in theconcentration camps.18 [../Text/part0011_split_003.html#c3-aft18] Thishighly-publicized event seemed to give an American seal of approval to whatwould become known as the Holocaust.One of the academic sponsors of this racial program was a well-known andwell-respected anthropologist and chairperson of the Vienna AnthropologicalSociety, Dr. Helen Pöch. Documents have come into the author's possessiondemonstrating just how influential Dr. Helen Pöch's views were on deciding whowas, and who was not, a Jew. Working for the Orwellian-nomenclatured Race andResettlement Office of the Reich, Helen Pöch interviewed subjects and performedquestionable tests to determine the degree of “Jewishness” in an individual, andwhether or not they qualified as Jews or as German citizens: a decision thathad, of course, enormous implications. It was this same Helen Pöch who, it isbelieved, eventually emigrated from her native Austria in 1952 to Sukarno'sIndonesia along with her husband, Dr. Georg Anton Pöch, the chief medicalofficer of the Reich's Salzburg Gau.With the stereotypical German passion for legality and precision, the Reich'svarious programs involving citizenship, property, and eventually genociderequired a sound academic and scientific basis. Institutes and agencies sprangup throughout the Reich's bureaucracy to satisfy this need to prove to the world(and to themselves) that the measures they were taking were decided upon usingthe same critical and rational approach for which Germany had always beenfamous. Yet, this desire to find justification for their actions—in effect,putting the cart before the horse—resulted in a caricature of science and law.It would have made a rousing plot for a comic opera had the consequences notbeen so horrendous, leading to a loss of life and destruction of cultures thatis still, at this remove, almost impossible to contemplate.The same ideology was at work abroad. While many countries looked to Germany asa role model for their eugenics programs, their incorporation of bad scienceinto government procedures and laws, the United States had its own version tooffer. While many American eugenicists admired what Germany was doing to ridtheir country of the incurably ill and the mentally- and physically-handicapped,and in the forced segregation and sterilization of their people, the UnitedStates itself was suffering a collective schizophrenic breakdown over the sameissues."},{"pageContent":"THE INVISIBLE REICHThe 1920s saw a tremendous rise in popularity of the Ku Klux Klan, thatquintessential racist movement characterized by white-robed night riders,burning crosses, and lynchings. While the Klan is usually identified withanti-Black racism, they were equally anti-Semitic—and a series of bombings ofsynagogues in the 1960s was evidence of this—as well as being anti-Catholic,anti-Asian, etc. They ran candidates for public office even as they wereterrorizing the countryside.The first Ku Klux Klan came of age in the Reconstruction Era after the end ofthe Civil War. It was another of the political movements based upon nostalgiafor a former age, and its members wanted to turn back the clock to theantebellum period when African-Americans were slaves and knew their place. AsHitler did in Germany when it came to the Jews, so did the Klan when it came toBlacks: they were the scapegoat for the loss of a war, a race that first had tobe segregated from “white” people and then deported or, barring that, eliminatedentirely from the planet.The second incarnation of the Klan took place around 1921, with its nativistdemands for a return to conservative, white American principles, and an attackon “Popism” (i.e., Roman Catholicism) and Jewry, as well as on Communism andimmigration. Italians, Irish, and Eastern European immigrants were targets ofKlan opprobrium in the 1920s. Klansmen sought to return America to itsprelapsarian age when only white, Anglo-Saxon Protestants were consideredAmericans. In 1920, an estimated four million Americans had joined the Klan. By1924, that number had jumped to six million, or about five percent of the totalpopulation of 114 million. Coincidentally, 1924 was the year the Immigration Actwas signed which severely limited immigration to the United States andespecially barred Asian immigrants. New immigrants were permitted from WesternEurope and Great Britain, but immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe wererestricted. According to the Office of the Historian of the United States, whenit came to what was known as the Gentlemen's Agreement19[../Text/part0011_split_003.html#c3-aft19] between Japan and the United Statesconcerning immigration, an Agreement that was now abrogated:... it appeared that the U.S. Congress had decided that preserving the racialcomposition of the country was more important than promoting good ties with theJapanese empire.20 [../Text/part0011_split_003.html#c3-aft20]It seemed that at least part of the program of the Ku Klux Klan had beenachieved: by denying entry to Southern and Eastern European immigrants there wasan effective ban on Catholics and Jews. A decline in Klan membership by 1930—dueto scandals and internal disagreements—did not alter the general mood ofanti-Semitism and racism in the country. Instead, other outlets were discoveredthat seemed more inclusive of new immigrants—Catholics, and Northern whites—andthe Nazi phenomenon provided them.At that time, Nazi movements began sprouting all over the country in response tothe New Deal of the Roosevelt administration. Both the American Nazi and theKlan movements wanted America to go back to the way it was before the GreatDepression, before the First World War, to a time that never really existed theway they thought it did: a time before the advent of Communist states like theSoviet Union; a time before blacks and Jews could be considered equal citizensof the nation. Like many of today's extreme right protestors, the Nazis andKlansmen of the 1920s and 1930s wanted to “take their country back,” in thiscase—and possibly in the present case also—”back” meant “back in time.”In the nineteenth century the Ku Klux Klan was known as the Invisible Empire,the Unsichtbare Reich if you will, to Germany's later Dritte Reich orTausendjährige Reich. It was a terror organization whose members met in disguiseand who murdered people in the middle of the night, torching their homes orhanging family members from trees in very visible locations. Later, in the thirdmanifestation of the Klan in post-World War Two America, groups in theloosely-organized Klan became responsible for bombings and assassinations,largely targeted at African-Americans, but extended to include Jews, synagogues,and those white Americans who were involved in the Freedom Rider movement andother Civil Rights groups.While the violence and the weird torchlight meetings in the middle of the nightof robed and masked Klansmen may have seemed almost comic, if nonethelesslethal, it was a manifestation of racism gone amok. There were, however, other,subtler forms of racism abroad in America at the same time that the Klan and theNazi movements were gathering force. One was the grossly unethical TuskegeeSyphilis program.Although word of its existence did not come to light until a whistleblowerappeared on the scene in 1972, the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment was one exampleof the type of endemic racism that could be found in scientific and academiccircles in the United States (and which was openly practiced in Nazi Germany).It ran from1932 until it was exposed in 1972. For forty years, black men frompoor, sharecropper backgrounds were used as guinea pigs in a pointless series ofexperiments, ostensibly designed to monitor the evolution of the disease. Themen were not told they had syphilis, and they were not given treatment for it.(Penicillin did not become available until the 1940s and therefore could nothave been used to treat the disease in the 1930s; however, its availability andits use to treat syphilis from about 1943 until the end of the experiment in1972 did not affect the progress of the experiment. Penicillin has enjoyedwidespread use in the treatment of the disease since 1947.) Men with syphiliswere allowed to unwittingly infect their sexual partners, and babies were bornwith syphilis as a result of these unions.The rationale behind the study was the idea that men of African-American originwere more promiscuous than men of other races and willingly engaged in riskysexual behavior. In other words, a value judgement was made by the Americanmedical establishment (and in the absence of any kind of evidence) that thepresumed risky behavior of African-Americans made it permissible to use them aslaboratory material: petri dishes for the cultivation of syphilis.The men were told that they were being treated for something called “bad blood,”a generic term covering a wide range of symptoms. There were 399 men in thestudy, of which 28 had died of the disease by 1972. Another 100 died ofcomplications due to the illness. These numbers do not include 40 wives who wereinfected by their husbands in the study, and nearly 20 children who contractedsyphilis in the womb. Since the experiment focused only on African-American men,the others were ignored.This is a single example of the type of race-based decision-making that wasprevalent in America in the same period that Nazism was on the rise in Germany.Laws against the marriage of whites and blacks (and in some cases with otherraces, including Native Americans, Native Hawaiians, Asians, and in some statesspecifically against Filipinos) were on the books in forty-one states. Such lawswere repealed in eleven states by 1887; but remained in many other states untilthe final Supreme Court decision finding miscegenation laws illegal in 1967. Addto this the academic fad of eugenics, which had attracted a wide audience amongnon-scientists including industrialists and politicians, and you had all of theelements necessary for a government-sponsored control of sexuality, reproductiverights, and other aspects of population control, including forbidding sexualreproduction involving those the medical or the legal profession declared“unfit,” a mindset paralleling that of the Third Reich.At the heart of the eugenics debate was the idea so dear to the bureaucrats andideologues of the Third Reich—that humanity was on the path of evolution asdescribed in the works of Darwin and others since then, and that human beingsshould do what they could to contribute to evolution in a positive way, thushastening the next step in the evolutionary chain, the creation of the “NewMan.” It provided justification for the creation of euthanasia programs in theReich, which was the first phase of what would become known as the Holocaust.In this phase, those whom the Nazis determined were “useless eaters” were slatedfor death. First, they had to be sterilized to ensure that they would notreproduce. Various chemical agents were used in these programs, as well asradiation and castration, all involuntary. These “useless eaters” included thephysically and mentally infirm, or those the Nazis deemed were infirm. The agedwere also considered eligible for “processing.” It is important to point outthat these individuals were Germans, by and large. This was not a racialprogram, but one designed to ensure that future generations of Germans would notcarry genetic material deemed weak or deleterious to German evolution. Thus, thefirst victims of Nazi medical and scientific policies were not Jews or Gypsiesor Communists, but Germans themselves.Once the “useless eaters” or “life unworthy of life” (Lebensunwertes Lebens)were purged from the system so that only healthy Germans remained, the force ofthe Reich was turned on other undesirables. Communists were arrested and sent tothe camps created for political prisoners. Some religious denominations weresingled out as well, such as the Jehova's Witnesses. Freemasons were on thelist, and other members of secret societies or esoteric organizations wererounded up in the aftermath of Rudolf Hess's flight to England in 1940.Homosexuals were arrested and thrown into prison camps as well, and a projectundertaken to exterminate the entire Roma (“Gypsy”) population (which led to thedecimation of the Roma and Sinti to the extent that the percentage of theirpeople killed in the genocide can be considered even greater than that of theJews).21 [../Text/part0011_split_003.html#c3-aft21]The object was purification:purification of Germany's bloodlines, its spirituality, its sexuality, itspolitics, and its economics.Lebensborn units were created to enable only the best and the brightest of theGerman military and political elite to father children on women especiallyselected for their racial purity and fertility. These were not marriages oractual romantic relationships; the Lebensborn units were basically stud farms toincrease the German population through selective breeding. It was anotheriteration of the basic eugenics philosophy to weed out the bad seed andpropagate the good or desirable seed. It was the other side of the genocidecoin.This focus on purity could be seen as a desire to return to a more primitivetime—in illo tempore—when the world was pristine. That this time probably neverexisted did not occur (or was not acceptable) to those promoting this “return tonature” and “return to our roots” philosophy. Legends of ancient Greece and Romewere conflated with legends concerning Atlantis and Thule: the latter thepresumed ancient homeland of the Aryans. With the coming of Westerncivilization—according to this theory—much of humanity's basic goodness andinherent physical and psychic powers were lost, a kind of Samson and Delilahmoment when the virile and pure Samson is shorn of his hair and thus loses hispotency and strength to the Levantine, Semitic seductress. Psychologically, thismay be understood as the desire to return to childhood—to a prepubescent statebefore the onset of sexual awakening—when a child can still believe in magic andwonder, in invisible beings, in the potential power to change the world—inshort, a time when the child is the center of the universe and all things comeinto being through a child's wishes and dreams. A child is thought of as pure inthis state—at least, until the time of Freud who fled Nazi Germany when the“Jewish” field of psychology was condemned by the Reich—and a return to purityis a return to childhood and its fantasies.It is also an implicit acknowledgment of failure. This yearning for a return tosome other state in the distant past indicates an incapability of dealing withpresent-day issues in any other way. It represents a desire to wipe the slateclean and start over, which may be attractive as a fantasy but not practicablein life. In Weimar Germany, the trauma of having lost the first World War andsurrendering valuable territory, assets, and prestige to the victoriousallies—coupled with the intensity of the economic collapse of 1929—made everyoneyearn for a better time. There seemed to be no way to grapple with the severeproblems facing the nation, and perhaps some of the attraction that Hitler andthe Nazi Party had for the German people was the idea that they would fight thatwar all over again and this time be the victors. It was either that, or find amore positive—albeit more demanding and time-consuming—way to confront thevarious issues facing them, accepting responsibility for the war, finding waysto increase their economic status, negotiating better contracts and loans withother governments, and all the consequent maturity of a nation those measureswould imply.Germany had been arguably the most intellectually and culturally sophisticatedWestern country in the world at the time, having contributed immortal works ofliterature, music, philosophy, and science. It is a measure of the psychologicaltrauma the country experienced that the only way this creative and energeticpeople could find to improve its state in the world was to murder or enslave asmany of the world's inhabitants as possible. In the author's own conversationswith prominent Nazis in the 1970s and 1980s, this point was raised again andagain: if the Germans were the people who produced Bach, Beethoven, Brahms,Wagner, Goethe, Heine, Rilke, Hegel, and Kant, why was their only solution totheir problems the “caveman” solution of war and mass murder? There was never ananswer to this question, and often the person being interviewed would simply gosilent, or in some cases begin extolling the virtues of a Spartan approach tolife, of continuous war being the only way a race could survive and thrive. Inillo tempore. This lack of imagination and incapability of Nazi theorists whenit came to problem-solving has been one of the most astonishing aspects of themovement in general; and it is this lack of imagination, coupled with violentfantasies of revenge and purification wrapped in spiritual justifications, thatinforms what I have been calling the Hitler legacy.If Germany had been defeated in the First World War then it wasn't Germany'sfault, according to the Nazi idea. They had been betrayed from within, by theJews, the Freemasons, the bankers, and the Communists. Eradicate those elementsfrom German society and the nation would inevitably improve. The German peoplewould return to that golden age when there were only Germans within its borders:no Jews, no immigrants of any kind except perhaps as slave labor. No alienreligions, or foreign—i.e., decadent—culture. It was the era of the Germanictribes defeating the Roman legions at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in thefirst century CE: pagan warriors successfully defending their territory againstthe global reach of the Caesars. This idea became a powerful meme during theThird Reich. Esoteric groups such as the Armanenschaft (named after Arminius,the commander of the German forces against the Romans) and the Germanenordenwere founded before the First World War by such occult theorists andanti-Semites as Guido von List and his followers. They set the stage for wildtheorizing about Germany's “origins” and helped to instigate a back-to-naturemovement known as the Wandervogel, founded in 1901 and representing nationalistideals and Teutonic romanticism. This movement received the enthusiastic supportof German and Austrian youth in the years following Germany's defeat in WorldWar One.I have written elsewhere about the role occult ideas and organizations had inthe formation of the Nazi Party, Nazi ideology, and specifically on theactivities of the SS,22 [../Text/part0011_split_003.html#c3-aft22] so I will notbelabor the point here. What I have said about the Nazi Party not being apolitical party the way most of us would understand it, but a cult, stillremains the best characterization of the Nazi phenomenon that I can find. Italso goes a long way toward helping us to understand how it could have survivedthe way it did, and still influences the ideas and actions of peoples andpolitical leaders around the world. It also helps us to realize that the growthof new Nazi movements in Europe is a validation of this basic premise. Nazismbegan as a cult, and survived as a cult. As an idea it is vague enough toattract a collection of philosophies and political movements around it, eachseeing in the Nazi archetype a version of their own belief system; as a cult, ithas the power to communicate viscerally to its followers through an elaboratesymbol system, ranging from the omnipresent swastika to the death's headinsignia and black uniforms of the SS. Nazism is about the will to power,merciless and proud in its extremism and cold-bloodedness; its success lies inits ability to take the superman concept found in the works of Nietzsche, andbuild an organizational and operational structure around it that includes: apolitical apparatus, race science, fringe archaeological and anthropologicaltheories and practices, euthanasia, and a complete cultural identity composed ofworks of art, music, and literature that are acceptable and consistent with theNazi Weltanschauung. The first use of the word “holocaust” in reference toNazism did not refer to the crematoria and the death camps, but to the burningof prohibited books. Purity of ideas. Purity of art.The difference between the overt excesses of Nazi Germany and the subtler,institutionalized racism in the United States was due to the fact that inGermany, the Nazi Party was in power. In the United States, there were Nazigroups, pro-Nazi groups, and Nazi sympathies, but the man at the top of thepolitical pyramid was a president who was also a Democrat. Hitler came to powerin Germany through a series of political machinations; Roosevelt came topower—and stayed in power for the rest of his life—through the ballot box. Theracism and anti-Semitism of a large segment of the American population was nosecret to Roosevelt, or to anyone else in America at the time.After all, it was an age of new media."},{"pageContent":"FLOWERS OF EVILThe extreme right had been ignoring a potential ally in the war against Jews andCommunists, and it was the Catholic Church. While the white extremism of theKlan targeted Catholics as well as immigrants from predominantly Catholiccountries such as Ireland and Italy, the Nazis had formed an uneasy alliancewith the Vatican. Many ultra-nationalists of the time—such as Franco in Spainand, later, Peron in Argentina—were also observing Catholics who saw in theChurch a powerful ally against the rising tide of Communism from the East.Hitler himself had been born a Catholic, as were many of the Party's leadership.In Europe, clergymen such as Bishop Alois Hudal of Austria began as critics ofNazism as a rival cult. But as the world edged closer to war, such men becameoutspoken Nazis and figured prominently in the efforts to rescue as many Naziwar criminals as possible and get them safely to sanctuaries in Latin Americaand the Middle East. While the role of Pope Pius XII during the Holocaust hasbeen hotly debated, what is not questioned is the fact that many Roman Catholicclergy were sympathetic to the vigorous anti-Communism of the Nazi Party and sawin its unequivocal opposition to the Soviet Union the best hope for the survivalof Christianity. While some of these clergy were uncomfortable with the Party'santi-Semitism, the Jews could be considered collateral damage in the largerstruggle against atheistic Communism.One of these outspoken Catholic Nazis was Father Charles Coughlin (alreadymentioned) whose parish in the Royal Oaks suburb of Detroit was known as theShrine of the Little Flower. It was Coughlin (and Catholic clergy like him) whobridged the gap between the Irish, Italian, and Eastern European Catholicimmigrants, and the white supremacist extremists of the Ku Klux Klan. Hispolitical agenda was virtually identical to that of the Nazi Party and thepro-Nazi organizations in the United States, including their anti-Semitism. Hewas also on intimate terms with American industrialists and politicians who sawin his celebrity a way to validate their own pro-Nazi sentiments.In November of 1933, in the first year of his presidency, Franklin D. Rooseveltdecided it was finally time for America to recognize the government of theSoviet Union. The USA had been the last holdout among the leading nations of theworld by refusing recognition of the regime that had taken power in Russia in1917. His rapprochement with the Soviets infuriated many on the right who sawRoosevelt as a Communist-sympathizer or a closet Communist himself. One of theconditions of the recognition was that the Soviets would cease providing supportfor the American Communist Party, a promise they never kept.That same year the Reichstag Fire gave Hitler the excuse he needed to demanddictatorial powers in order to protect Germany from what was believed to be theCommunist terrorists who had set the blaze. In March of 1933 he was givenextra-constitutional powers by the Reichstag, and upon the death of PresidentHindenburg in 1934, Hitler assumed full power over the German Reich. Thefollowing year, the Nuremberg Laws were enacted which robbed German Jews ofcitizenship in the Reich. With that, the road to the concentration camps waspaved.It was in this atmosphere that personalities like Father Coughlin, andorganizations like the German-American Bund, William Pelley's Silver Legion, andothers of similar ideological provenance could thrive. If it had only been aquestion of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly—rights guaranteed by theBill of Rights to the American Constitution—then this episode might have beenforgotten once the war began. As it was, however, these groups actively plottedthe overthrow of the American government. It is doubtful that their plots wouldhave proceeded very far, but violence had been used, intelligence networkscreated, and assassination plots advanced. Weapons caches were uncovered, andperpetrators were sent to prison for sedition. An environment had been createdin the United States that was conducive to paranoia, suspicion, and conspiracytheory; combine this with racist scapegoating by the Klan and the Bund (and itsfellow travelers) and you had a formula for rebellion that was analogous to—ifnot identical with—that obtained in the Reich.In Father Coughlin's case, it was an organization he created called theChristian Front. Coughlin had long been promoting Nazi ideas—some of themcribbed from the newspaper owned by his friend, Henry Ford, the DearbornIndependent. It published a series of articles by Ford on the dangers ofinternational Jewry—since collected and published as a book, The InternationalJew—and quoting from The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion as well as Naziapologist Alfred Rosenberg's The Myth of the Twentieth Century (a book that wason the Catholic Church's Index of forbidden books). Coughlin's own newspaper,Social Justice, carried excerpts of both the Protocols and Rosenberg's writings.It was Rosenberg, after all, who brought the Protocols to the attention of AdolfHitler in the early days of the Nazi Party. (In fact, Rosenberg joined the Partymonths before Hitler did.)Rosenberg's magnum opus is considered by many to be virtually unreadable andRosenberg himself, in his Memoirs written in prison awaiting the Nuremberg Trialverdict that would condemn him to death, admits that it could have used arewrite. Basically, it's theme is that race determines culture determinesreligion, with its corollary that a religion that has no connection with aspecific race is alien to it. In this way, Rosenberg felt that both Christianityand Judaism were alien religions to the German people: faiths that were graftedonto the Germans like monstrous hybrids, stunting their spiritual and politicalgrowth and making them vulnerable to the machinations of other races, otherpolitical agendas. Christianity and Judaism were “Oriental” faiths that had noplace in the “Aryan” culture of northern Europe, and their influence had led tothe catastrophe of the First World War and its aftermath. To Rosenberg,spirituality was the key to a German revival. This required a major overhaul ofGerman culture to eradicate that which was alien, weak, and decadent in itsspirituality, its art, music and literature, and its racial composition. As thequotation from his Memoir that is at the beginning of this chapter states,Rosenberg advised America that it faced the same dangers if it allowed itsracial composition to become “mulatto-ized.”Hitler had placed such confidence in the young Nazi of Baltic origins that hedesignated Rosenberg as leader of the movement while the Führer was in LandsbergPrison due to his involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch of 1923. Thisacknowledgement of his contribution to Nazi ideology is important when werealize that Father Coughlin felt the same way, and made copies of Rosenberg'sMyth of the Twentieth Century available at the bookstand at his Shrine of theLittle Flower in Michigan—even though it had been banned by the Church itself.Coughlin's Christian Front was founded to advertise and promote these ideas in avery practical way. It was a Nazi movement designed to be more American incharacter than the German-American Bund, and more traditionally Catholic thanWilliam Pelley's Silver Legion (which was an amalgam of racial politics,anti-Semitism, and esoteric lore). It would appeal to the large numbers of IrishCatholics who had come to America in the decades before the First World War, ata time when Irish nationalism was in full flower against the British Empire(thus making common cause with other anti-British movements such asal-Husseini's political action groups in Palestine, and anti-colonialist partiesin India, to name a few). This “strange bedfellows” coalition of Catholics,Muslims, Arabs, and Indians with the goals of the Nazi Party would set the stagefor events in the century that would follow.It is important to emphasize from time to time that not all Catholics, or allMuslims, Arabs, Indians, etc. identified with the mission of the Nazi Party. Infact, it could be said that a minority of members of these groups felt that way.However, it was a very vocal and oftentimes violent minority, with whom some inthe majority felt sympathy, or with whom they had ambiguous or onlypartially-conscious identification, and this is the point of this study. Thetype of threat the world faces today after the fall of the Soviet Union is lessfrom established “state actors” than it is from independent, autonomous,non-state actors such as the terror cells usually identified as belonging toAl-Qaeda or Al-Qaeda affiliates. The type of terrorist activity we usuallyassociate with this type of group is to be found in America in the 1920s and1930s at the sharp edge of the nativist, racist, and anti-Semitic sword. Itrepresents a “sub-cutaneous” layer of paranoia and ethnophobia just below thesurface skin of American tolerance and desire for universal justice, oftendescribed or justified as an attempt to protect America and Americans fromforeign influences that seek to harm the country from within.One of these attempts was the result of Father Coughlin's unrelenting attack onthe Roosevelt administration and on the measures adopted by Congress and thePresident during that period. In November, 1938, Coughlin founded the ChristianFront set up in opposition to what he called the “Communist Front.” It was avehicle for attacks on Jews, Communists and the perceived Red infiltrators ofthe US government, and was heavily promoted and propagandized in Social Justice.It received the overt support of such high-profile clergymen as Bishop Fulton J.Sheen and Bishop Thomas Molloy of Brooklyn, and was quietly tolerated byArchbishop Spellman of New York.The Front was most active in New York City, with its large complement of Jewishimmigrants. Through the Coudert Committee in 1940 it agitated for the removal ofJews from teaching positions at City College of New York, and thirty-fiveteachers were suspended on charges that they had turned the college into ahotbed of Communism. The son of one of the suspended teachers was attacked byChristian Fronters and his “forehead was branded with a swastika.”23[../Text/part0011_split_003.html#c3-aft23]Christian Fronters attacked Jews on the streets of New York City in actionsreminiscent of Krystallnacht. Indeed, this show of Nazi barbarity in Germany andAustria in November of 1938 was discussed sympathetically by Father Coughlinhimself in one of his radio addresses at the time. It thus became impossible todifferentiate the ideology and the tactics of Father Coughlin's Christian Frontfrom those of the Storm Troopers during Hitler's rise to power.But behind all of this frenetic activity on the part of the ChristianFront—including one alleged attempt to overthrow the government by a cabal ofChristian Fronters in Brooklyn—there was another layer of action that was knownonly to government investigators and intelligence operatives at the time.Coughlin was at the center of a web of Nazi intrigue involving not only Catholicorganizations like the Christian Front but also Pelley's Silver Legion, theGerman-American Bund, and a whole menagerie of Eastern European activists whorepresented immigrants from nations held captive by the Soviet Union. Theseincluded White Russians and Ukrainians.In 1941, Coughlin's circle was penetrated by a Ukrainian Orthodox priest at thebehest of Hoover's Federal Bureau of Investigation. This was the notoriousPelypenko affair.Alexei Pelypenko was ordained in 1915 and in the 1930s he worked as a teacher inMunich during the time of the Third Reich. By 1937 he was in Argentina, workingfor the local Gestapo chief, and by 1940 was in Valparaiso, Chile, still workingfor the Nazis. As a Ukrainian, he was opposed to the occupation of his countryby the Russians and as a priest he was opposed to Communist atheism. ManyUkrainians saw in Hitler a viable alternative to the regime in Moscow and wereorganizing themselves into a revolutionary force to support the Nazis at thetime of their invasion of Russia. However, these same Ukrainians weredisillusioned when the Hitler-Stalin pact was signed and it appeared that Russiaand Germany would work together, thus robbing the Ukrainians of any hope ofliberation. Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union renewed the enthusiasm of someof the Ukrainians for Nazism and an entire Waffen-SS division, comprised ofUkrainian troops, was formed (and eventually many of these were resettled in theUnited States after the war). This historical episode has other ramificationsfor it led to the formation of several important lobby groups that agitated forpolitical and military resistance against the Soviets under the general rubricof “captive nations” organizations such as the World Anti-Communist League(WACL). The Pelypenko affair reveals the extent of the American Nazi network andthe intention of its perpetrators to overthrow the US government and install amilitary dictatorship that would remove Jewish and Communist influence at alllevels of American life.Pelypenko eventually decided that working for the Americans for a Communist-freebloc in Eastern Europe made more sense than waiting for Hitler to liberate hiscountry. He contacted the FBI directly in 1940 and offered his support ininfiltrating the Nazi networks he knew existed in the United States.What he had to tell them was nothing short of astounding. Pelypenko knew theextent of Nazi and Japanese plans concerning the Panama Canal; the frustrationof the Soviets with the United States in not cracking down more severely onWhite Russian activities in America; and that the Axis Powers were runningagents in the United States using Ukrainian and other Eastern European groups,including the White Russians.In addition, Pelypenko also knew the identity of a White Russian assassin whowas being brought in by the Nazis to assassinate President Roosevelt. Thislatter fact might have seemed almost too much to believe, except that theassassin was located in Latin America as per Pelypenko's information, andterminated.24 [../Text/part0011_split_003.html#c3-aft24]Father Pelypenko became the FBI's golden boy from that point on. He had theimpeccable Nazi credentials, a mastery of foreign languages, the Ukrainianpedigree, and long experience working for Nazi intelligence. They decided hewould be useful as an infiltrator in American Nazi circles, and they preparedhim for that mission.The first step in Pelypenko's infiltration was the estate of Count AnastaseVonsiatsky, in Thompson, Connecticut.Vonsiatsky (1898–1965) was of White Russian ancestry, born in Warsaw, whosefamily had a distinguished pedigree in the Czar's army, and who identified withthe White Russian struggle against Communism. In the United States, he was anopenly-avowed fascist who colluded with Nazi agents in the United States, andwas a colleague of Father Coughlin, William Pelley, and the other AmericanNazis. His background was colorful and exotic, and he attracted a lot ofinterest from both the Nazi underground as well as from the US government. Hisestate in northeastern Connecticut was elaborate, filled with Russian and Nazimemorabilia, and served as the headquarters of his own political party organizedfor the liberation of Russia from Communism.Vonsiatsky had married well. After making his way from Crimea in 1920 toConstantinople to recover from war wounds (he had been shot in his back, hisarm, and his stomach), he later made his way to Paris where he met the Americanwoman who would become his wife. She was an heiress to the Nabisco fortune andhis wealth came largely through her. He sailed to America in the summer of 1921,and by the following year he was married to the heiress, becoming a naturalizedAmerican citizen in 1927.After a period of relative political inactivity, Vonsiatsky decided that it wastime to form a party that would prepare for the day when the Soviet Union wouldfall and Russia would be free of Bolshevism. He admired the political philosophyrepresented by Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and in May of 1933 (fourmonths after Hitler became Chancellor of Germany) Vonsiatsky formed the RussianNational Revolutionary Labor and Workers Peasant Party of Fascists. The aimseemed to be to gather together all the Russian emigre groups that wereproliferating throughout the United States, Latin America, and Europe under oneumbrella with Vonsiatsky as its leader. The headquarters of the All RussianNational Revolutionary Party, as it was known for short (!), was called TheCenter and was located at Vonsiatsky's estate.The Count's involvement with other fascist organizations is well-known anddocumented. He claimed not to be anti-Semitic, and that his brand of fascismindicated only a desire to overthrow Soviet Communism and liberate Russia fromthe Bolsheviks. The problem with this type of platform is that it lends itselftoo easily to alliances with other anti-Communist groups, and in the extremecase, it leads to a partnership—if not identification—with Nazism. Of all theanti-Communist organizations that ever came into existence since the 1917Russian Revolution, Nazism is the only one with an easily identifiable profile.Nazism became an unapologetic opponent of Communism, and the Nazis weredetermined opponents of Russia itself. If one wished to “liberate” Russia, theonly country that seemed intent on doing so militarily was Nazi Germany. Ittherefore behooved the nationalist, anti-Communist forces of Eastern Europe toalign themselves with the Reich, and to follow behind its invasion force, inorder to set up provisional governments in Russia, Ukraine, and the othercaptive regions that comprised the Soviet Union and its satellites. To thosetired of policies of appeasement, tolerance or acceptance—such as thoseproferred by the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States—wherethe Soviet Union was concerned, Hitler's approach seemed fresh and invigorating.Just as Hitler had successfully invaded Poland, France, the Low Countries, etc.,so (it was believed) he could invade Russia and turn it into another extensionof the Reich.By the time Father Pelypenko had walked through the iron gates of The Center,Vonsiatsky was already deeply embroiled in various fascist intrigues. The UnitedStates had not yet entered the war, and there was an energetic movement to keepAmerica isolated from the conflict: an attitude that was exploited by the Nazis.Ukrainian fascist groups had been planning acts of sabotage in the United Statessince at least 1934, and it has been claimed that the OUN (Organizace UkrajinskaNacionalistov or Ukrainian Nationalist Organization) was working with the Abwehr(German military intelligence), and the ODWU (Organization for the Rebirth ofUkraine, founded in the United States in 1931) was involved in a series ofkidnappings and murders that took place at the Ukrainian National Home on East6th Street in New York City. Ukrainian fascists even were believed to have beenbehind sabotage of the Cleveland-Pittsburgh express train in 1941, although itwas never proved.Vonsiatsky himself welcomed the Ukrainian Father Pelypenko to The Center andthey talked for hours concerning the state of the world and the threat of worldcommunism. Pelypenko's bona fides were established early on: he knew what namesto drop and what references to make, as he had been, after all, a devoted Nazifor years until the demoralizing Hitler-Stalin pact. He had worked in SouthAmerica for the Gestapo, and was considered loyal to the cause. Only the FBIknew otherwise.The Count felt comfortable enough to reveal some sensitive information to thepriest, including his connection with Dr. Wolfgang Ebell. Ebell was a Germannational (b. 1899) who served in the German army during World War One and whowent to medical school in Freiburg. He became a naturalized American citizen in1939 after first working for awhile in Mexico (1927–1930). He was then based inEl Paso, Texas and while there was discovered to be running Nazi agents south ofthe border. Also involved in the Mexican operation was Gerhardt Wilhelm Kunze,who had taken over control of the German-American Bund. Kunze was in factworking for Nazi intelligence at the same time he was the Bund's figurehead. Inthat capacity he was in contact with Japanese agents in Mexico on behalf of theReich, and to Pelypenko's surprise he was informed that Kunze was shortly to goto the Pacific coast of Mexico to make contact with Japanese submarines.Vonsiatsky bragged that he was also in radio contact with the Nazi consul in SanFrancisco—Fritz Weidemann—who passed his messages on to Japan and from there toGermany in an effort to avoid the American censors.The importance of this information cannot be overstated and, indeed, it formedan essential part of the US government's case against the espionage ring. In oneconversation, the German-American Bund and Vonsiatsky's Russian Fascists wereall revealed to be working together with the Third Reich and the Empire of Japanin the months and years leading up to America's entry into the war. A spy ringin Mexico being run out of El Paso, Texas was connected with the Nazi consul inSan Francisco and Japanese submarines, White Russian émigrés, and AmericanNazis. While historians strive to study these various threads separately,history itself is rarely so neat and tidy. It is, in fact, quite messy as thisparticular case demonstrates. While the goals of the Russian Fascists and thoseof the Bund, the Japanese, and the Third Reich may have been different inparticulars—representing different ethnicities, histories, ideologies—they hadenough essentials in common that they would make a joint effort to undermineAmerican national security and materially support the war efforts of the AxisPowers.As it would later transpire, this group of conspirators would also extend toinclude Father Coughlin himself, as well as the Lutheran minister Kurt Molzahnof Philadelphia, and the head of the Chicago chapter of the Bund, OttoWillumeit. Pelypenko was urged to attend a clandestine meeting of the leadingNazis in Chicago at the Bismarck Hotel (where else?) in June, 1941. The meetingwas bugged by the FBI.At the meeting—attended by Vonsiatsky, Kunze, Ebell, Wil-lumeit and Molzahn inaddition to Pelypenko—it was learned that Kunze was to quit the leadership ofthe Bund so that he could disappear into Mexico and rendezvous with theJapanese. On June 20, 1941, Pelypenko met with Willumeit himself at Bundheadquarters and was urged to go to Detroit and meet personally with FatherCoughlin. Willumeit further informed the priest that Coughlin received regularmessages from the Reich by way of the German embassy in Washington, DC. TheGerman consul in Detroit—Fritz Hailer—confirmed to Pelypenko that Coughlin wasone of their friends and intimated a degree of financial and other support forthe radio priest.Thus it was that Father Pelypenko finally would meet the infamous FatherCoughlin and learn of the extent to which the seemingly comic-opera AmericanNazi underground—replete with storm troopers, swastika armbands, and weaponstraining in the national parks—was actually part of the extensive network ofspies, saboteurs, agents provocateurs, propagandists, and financiers thatexisted before the war began, and which would be around (albeit in somewhatdifferent form) once the war was over.As Charles Higham writes, in American Swastika:Now Coughlin really opened up. He revealed to the astonished priest that he wasa coordinating link with all subversive groups in the country; that he wasconnected to the whole White Russian Nazi groups under Vonsiatsky, that he wasin direct touch with Ukrainian terrorist groups in Detroit, and that he waslinked to John Koos, the Nazi Ukrainian working for Henry Ford.25[../Text/part0011_split_003.html#c3-aft25]John Koos was the leader in America of the Ukrainian Hetman Organization (UHO).This was a Nazi group, based in Berlin, composed of ethnic anti-Communists andengaged in terrorist activities against the Soviets, as well as againstpro-Communist or anti-Nazi individuals and groups everywhere else. Koos workedout of the Ford Motor Company factories in Detroit where he arranged for thehiring of thousands of Ukrainians to work the plants and to form a fifth columnworking directly for Henry Ford. The position of Koos was so secure in the eyesof the Reich that Hitler himself sent the message that Koos would be namedMinister of Internal Affairs in Ukraine once it had been liberated by theNazis.26 [../Text/part0011_split_003.html#c3-aft26] Koos received a medalawarded by Alfred Rosenberg, the Nazi ideologist mentioned above.(It should be remembered that the most famous leader of the German-American Bundwas Fritz Kuhn, who was himself a Ford Motor Company employee. And it was theson of a Ford Motor Company executive in Chile who masterminded theassassination of Orlando Letelier in Washington, DC: Michael Vernon Townley,currently in prison in the United States and in witness protection. Townley wasinvolved with the Nazi Party in Chile which is where he was in regular contactwith the Chilean secret police—DINA— under dictator General Augusto Pinochet. Hewas also the man who designed the interrogation cells at Colonia Dignidad.)27[../Text/part0011_split_003.html#c3-aft27]Coughlin insisted that Pelypenko bring him as much anti-Semitic literature aspossible, that he would be remunerated for any material brought to him, and gavehim a letter of introduction to an agent working at the German Embassy inWashington. At that point things began to heat up.In November, 1941—and only weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor—Kunze waswaiting in Texas for the false documents he would need to cross the border intoMexico. The man arranging for the fraudulent paperwork was the Lutheranminister, Molzahn, who used the Lutheran Church's printing office for thiseffort. This would not be the last time the Lutheran Church was involved inhelping a Nazi escape by providing false papers. As evidenced in the Pöchaddress book and elsewhere, the Evangelical Lutheran Church was running Nazisout of Europe after the war in parallel with the Catholic Church's program.Kunze had spent the previous few weeks touring America's west coast, identifyingvulnerabilities in her defenses, and liaising with White Russians along the way.Once in Texas, he received the phoney documentation and made it across theborder into Mexico. He was on his way to be picked up by a German U-boat whenFBI agents, posing as Mexican fishermen, arrested him just as the periscopebreached the surface.Kunze's arrest—coming as it did only months after the attack on Pearl Harbor—waspart of a broader sweep of Nazi agents. Molzahn, Willumeit of the Chicago Bund,Wolfgang Ebell of El Paso, and Vonsiatsky himself were all arrested and chargedwith espionage.Father Coughlin was named as a co-conspirator in all of Pelypenko's debriefings;Coughlin had obviously been the lynchpin to the spy ring, and Pelypenko met himseveral times during the course of his espionage work. But Coughlin was neverarrested, never made to answer for his role in the affair. He was too hot toarrest, too hot to try in open court, too popular with too many Americans. Itwas decided that it was safer to leave him alone.And Pelypenko? Did he get the key to the city? The gratitude of grateful nation?A medal? US citizenship?No. Pelypenko was arrested by the Immigration authorities because—due to hisinfiltration of one of the most dangerous Nazi espionage rings of the time—hehad overstayed his visa! He was released but told he had to leave the country atonce. Where could he go? It was the middle of World War Two, and he had been adouble agent. His life was in danger no matter where he went.So he was arrested again and interned for the rest of the war.This, briefly, was the spirit of the times. Paranoia, suspicion, scapegoats,ethnic rivalries, religious bigotry, fear of new immigrants, cynical clergymen,corrupt politicians, a polarized nation. A yearning for an America that used tobe, or might have been. Tolerance interpreted as weakness. Anger and hatred asstrength.The cover of Vonsiatsky's tabloid, The Fascist, had a photo of a battalion ofGerman troops. Over it is the legend “The Army of the Holy Swastika.”War. And Faith. And Holy War. What is past truly is prologue.17 [../Text/part0011_split_000.html#c3-ft17] Alfred Rosenberg, Memoirs, writtenin prison in 1946 before being sentenced to death in the Nuremberg Trials forcrimes against humanity.

We live on top of an enormouspalimpsest.—Jean-Claude CarrièreNormally, one places information on sources at the end of a book, but in thiscase the provenance of the source material is important towards an understandingof the value and relevance of the narrative as a whole. Primary sources on theNazi underground are few and far between and are usually the work of Alliedgovernments and intelligence agencies and not that of the members of theunderground itself. That is not to suggest that the material in these sources issuspect, but that it would inevitably be one-sided and lacking many essentialsthat only the personal diaries and notebooks of the actual fugitives themselvescould provide. My intention was to remedy that situation as much as possible,for only in this way could original research be accomplished and new discoveriesmade. That meant I had to travel extensively, as well as revisit old archivalmaterial and painstakingly decode hundreds of pages of handwritten documentswith an eye towards identifying what appeared to be random bits of data.There is not a lot of primary source material written in the hand of the actualunderground organizers themselves, for obvious reasons, but those that do existthrow a great deal of light on the otherwise shadowy networks of Nazi survivorsaround the world. They also illuminate the extent to which non-military andnon-political actors were involved in the creation and the maintenance of Naziideology and programs throughout the entire period under review here. Theseinclude academics with backgrounds in anthropology, archaeology, medicine,genetics, and the like as well as industrialists, arms dealers, and those whooperated safe houses along the ratlines."},{"pageContent":"THE ADDRESS BOOKSThere were several address books that were utilized in this research. Therelevance of these documents will become obvious as this research progresses.The first such document consists of various pages of the address book kept byDr. Georg Anton Pöch, the Austrian doctor that I profiled in Ratline. I neverhad access to the entire document, even though it was contractually promised tome, but what I was able to view during several contentious months in Singaporewas enough to assure me that the source is genuine. In these pages I will onlyrefer to material that was already seen by others or published in books or otherprinted or electronic media, or seen by me before the mentioned contract becameeffective. I will not refer to any documents that were not seen previouslyeither by me or by other investigators. The contribution I make is my ability toidentify persons, places, and institutions in the previously exhibited documentsthat other investigators could not, probably due to their lack of theappropriate background in the subject.The address book was small, the kind of thing you could keep in a jacket pocket,bound in green, and written in various colors of ink. It was not alphabetical inany way; in fact it seemed more chronological than alphabetical, as if names andaddresses were added as soon as they were known. Thus, the earliest entriesseemed to be those most concerned with the escape routes out of Germany andAustria, while the later entries were of those friends and colleagues of thePöch couple who had survived the war. Some entries were of those who fled toLatin America and were easily identifiable; others were somewhat less so. Iunderstand from previous accounts of the address book that there was at leastone entry for South Africa, but I did not see that one (many pages were withheldfrom me); in another case, a reported entry for Tibet was clear and unambiguous.The address book also contained a brief account of the escape of Dr. Pöch, onethat had been published in a small volume in the Indonesian language.Along with the other Pöch memorabilia, there were passports, some photographs(again, I never saw all of these), and other disjecta membra. Taken altogether,these items may tell a more complete story of the Pöch escape, and may even gosome way towards telling us who the Pöchs really were: the same Austrian medicaldoctor and his famous academic wife, or in reality two other persons who hadtaken the Pöch identity in order to get as far away from Europe, and the MiddleEast, and Latin America as possible: as far away, in other words, from theirNazi colleagues as geography would allow since they could not be trusted.The second document consists of a volume of photocopied pages that were part ofthe CIA's file on Josef Mengele, the notorious “Angel of Death” at the Auschwitzextermination camp. While it was included in Mengele's file, and only recentlydeclassified, it is most likely not the address book of Dr. Mengele himself, butthat of Hans-Ulrich Rudel: Hitler's favorite Luftwaffe ace, who was instrumentalin propping up the post-World War Two Nazi underground. The names and addressesin this document are an astonishing record of the global Nazi network, and evenincludes the pseudonym and address of Klaus Barbie in Bolivia in the yearsbefore he was extradited to France to stand trial for war crimes. To the best ofmy knowledge, I am the only researcher who took the pains to identify the namesin this important text and while I did not succeed in identifying all the names(usually due to the illegibility of the handwritten text) what I did identify isan incredible amount of information, including some data on persons still alivein the United States.The third document has already been exhaustively researched by generations ofinvestigators but its relevance to our case remains important. This is theaddress book kept by the alleged assassin of President John F. Kennedy, LeeHarvey Oswald. There are several reasons why I decided to include this datahere, in a book on the Hitler legacy, and they will become apparent as we goalong.In the Appendix, the entire contents of the Rudel address book are listed withas many of the entries identified as possible, including addresses and phonenumbers (some of which are still valid today). I believe that since thisdocument was released into the general public by the US Government that itspublication here is justified. The Oswald address book appears in various placesand collections and does not need to be reproduced completely here.As for the infamous Pöch address book, publication of that in its entirety willhave to wait for its present owner to come to his senses. What I do reproduce isdata found on the pages that were available to me before I entered intocontractual negotiations with its owner, plus information that was available toother investigators, journalists, and authors before me (albeit in differentlanguages and countries and therefore not easily accessible byEnglish-speakers)."},{"pageContent":"OTHER DOCUMENTATIONOther primary documentation that was used to support the research in this volumeincludes US Government reports on Nazi gold; declassified CIA and FBI files onvarious subjects and individuals, where noted; records of the Nuremberg andother trials; captured German documents, and other verifiable specimens.Secondary sources include scholarly and journalistic books and articles on thesubjects covered here, and some selected videos including interviews withimportant individuals, and these are noted where relevant.Photographs of World War II personalities are usually courtesy of the Germanarchives, as noted.

Any errors in translation are thereforemine alone."},{"pageContent":"INTERVIEWSIn addition, many persons were interviewed by me over the course of more thanforty years of investigating this story. I personally met with members of thePalestine Liberation Organization, the Ku Klux Klan, the National RenaissanceParty, the leaders of Colonia Dignidad in Chile, members of the Americanintelligence community, the Chinese military, experts in Tibetan religion,high-ranking clergy of various Eastern Orthodox denominations, the leadership ofthe American Orthodox Catholic Church (a front for US intelligence operations),the leader and founder of Jemaah Islammiyah (the terror organization responsiblefor the Bali Bombings of2002), and many, many others. Where relevant, thesemeetings and discussions are noted in the body of the text.I also have traveled to many of the locations noted here. I have spentconsiderable time visiting and working in Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Ihave intimate knowledge of Muslim societies in Indonesia and Malaysia, andpossibly for that reason was, for awhile, on a TSA list for “special screening.”The story of my brief detainment at Colonia Dignidad in Chile in 1979 is told inmy first book, Unholy Alliance, and will not be repeated here.A certain degree of subjectivity is unavoidable, especially when one has spentdecades doing this type of research, and often in close proximity to theindividuals and groups most strongly associated with the Nazi underground, aswell as with Arab and Islamist organizations some of which are on terror watchlists. When one winds up on a list oneself, the experience is a little uncanny.However, I have tried to present as coherent and balanced a study as possibleunder the circumstances.

Krunoslav Draganovic when asked by Klaus Barbie, theButcher of Lyon, why the Church was helping him as the latter was boarding theship for Argentina using papers created by the Catholic priest.By the summer of 1944, it was obvious that the Third Reich was about tocollapse. The D-Day invasion had put paid to any idea that Germany would be ableto hold onto its occupied territories in Western Europe. France was beingliberated and the Allies were soon to march into the Low Countries. The Russianswere advancing inexorably from the east. North Africa had been lost. The Balkanswere already in the grip of socialist partisans under Tito.—Father Pelypenko's Ukraine was lost.Hitler might have been insane, or deluded, but that did not mean hissubordinates were crazy. The men who had financed and supported the Reich fromits salad days in the 1920s and 1930s now realized that other arrangements hadto be made. Industrialists, bankers, engineers and scientists had to find a wayto pool their resources and hide as much money, information, and technology aspossible from the Allied forces so that Germany could be rebuilt quickly. At thesame time, the SS knew that it had been declared a criminal organization by theAllies and that the days of its members were numbered. It had, however, anextensive network of spies, informants, and sympathizers all over the world,some of whom had begun to engage in anti-colonial movements against the British,the French, and the Dutch. These would become useful in the months and years tocome.Imagine that the Sicilian Mafia had begun as the legitimate government ofSicily, but that Palermo was being overrun by another army; the Mafia wouldsimply go underground and form a government-in-exile, waiting for the day itsmembership could quietly return to Palermo to retake power. That was the SS in1944 and 1945: what had started as an official German government agency andparamilitary and military force was suddenly declared a kind of Mafia, anorganized crime syndicate whose members would be hunted to the ends of the earthand prosecuted to the fullest extent of the (newly created) law: the Nazis wouldbe charged with crimes against humanity and all SS-men would be declaredcriminals by virtue of their membership.At the same time, as the Allies marched into Germany, other groups were makingdecisions that would have tremendous implications for global security in thedecades after the war. While the Allies were fixated on the Germans as warcriminals, many others of different ethnicities had committed some of the samewar crimes. Cadres of pro-Nazi Ukrainians, Croats, Romanians, and others wererunning for the exits. The Ukrainians had fielded an entire Waffen-SS division;the Croats had a puppet Nazi government in the Ustase, now on the run toArgentina; and the Romanians had the Iron Guard, responsible for pogroms againstthe Jews as well as the torture of prisoners.A new paradigm was taking place, something rare in world history. A defeatednation had been occupied by its enemies, but a defeated ideology survived themilitary defeat and reorganized and rebranded itself. What the Allies did notrealize at the time was that Nazism could not be eradicated with guns and bombs.What the Nazis knew was that they could carry on their ideological struggle fromanywhere on earth, and they did. The war was not over for them; they had simplymoved the theater of operations: to the Middle East, the Americas, Central Asia,and to South and Southeast Asia. And they did all of that with assistance fromthe very governments that had defeated them. This would be absurd if it wasn'ttrue."},{"pageContent":"THE RED HOUSE REPORTAfter the war, the existence of a highly-classified report from a French spy ona meeting held at the Maison Rouge (“Red House”) Hotel in Strasbourg came tolight. It had been buried in the National Archives since at least 1976 (which isthe date on the stamp on the top of the document), but was little known untilrecently. It is referred to as the Red House Report, but it's official name isUS Military Intelligence report EW-Pa 128, Enclosure No. 1 to despatch No.19,489 of Nov. 27, 1944, from the Embassy at London, England. It was markedSECRET and addressed to: “SUPREME HEADQUARTERS ALLIED EXPEDITIONARY FORCE Officeof Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2.” The subject of the report was fascinating:SUBJECT: Plans of German industrialists to engage in underground activity afterGermany's defeat; flow of capital to neutral countries.28[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft28]It detailed a discussion that was held at the Maison Rouge Hotel on August 10,1944 to which the heads of German corporations such as Volkswagen,Messerschmitt, Krupp, Brown-Boverie, and others were in attendance. They weretold by an SS General that it was imperative for as much German capital andother assets to be transferred out of the country and to neutral nations, awayfrom the grasp of the Allies. This included all industrial material currently inFrance, and wherever else the Germans could reach.In other words, as the rest of the SS was preparing escape routes for personneland gold, the SS chief in Strasbourg was preparing for a different kind ofescape route. The money, the industrial base, and the personnel would gotogether; it was nothing less than the recreation of the Reich somewhere else,out of the reach of the victors. The plan was to arrange for the resurrection ofthe Reich and the reconstitution of the German economy as soon as the Alliesgave them the opportunity.According to the French agent's report:From now on also German industry must realize that the war cannot be won andthat it must take steps in preparation for a post-war commercial campaign. Eachindustrialist must make contacts and alliances with foreign firms, but this mustbe done individually and without attracting any suspicion. Moreover, the groundwould have to be laid on the financial level for borrowing considerable sumsfrom foreign countries after the war. As examples of the kind of penetrationwhich had been most useful in the past, Dr. Scheid cited the fact that patentsfor stainless steel belonged to the Chemical Foundation, Inc., New York, and theKrupp company of Germany jointly and that the U.S. Steel Corporation, CarnegieIllinois, American Steel and Wire, and National Tube, etc. were thereby under anobligation to work with the Krupp concern. He also cited the Zeiss Company, theLeica Company and the Hamburg-American Line as firms which had been especiallyeffective in protecting German interests abroad and gave their New Yorkaddresses to the industrialists at this meeting.The fact that many American firms had been supporting the Reich in the yearsbefore the war—and some during the war—was not new to American intelligence, ofcourse. It was to be expected that German industrialists would do what theycould to cement earlier relationships to ensure their own survival and that ofthe firms they represented. What is important to realize from the aboveparagraph is that the Germans were to be pro-active in these relationships. Itthen begs the question: what was the motivation of, for instance, the hundredsof Nazi rocket scientists the United States invited to work on the Americanspace program? Was the dynamic simply one of the Americans salvaging as much ofthe Nazi program as possible, both to reap the rewards themselves and to keepthem out of the hands of the Soviets? Or were the Nazi scientists beingpro-active in their relationship with the Allies, cultivating the US militaryand promising the moon (literally) in pursuit of some other agenda?The Red House Report goes on to state that there was a second, smaller meetinginvolving the German Armaments Ministry and representatives from Krupp, Hecho,and Rochling:At this second meeting it was stated that the Nazi Party had informed theindustrialists that the war was practically lost but that it would continueuntil a guarantee of the unity of Germany could be obtained. Germanindustrialists must, it was said, through their exports increase the strength ofGermany. They must also prepare themselves to finance the Nazi Party which wouldbe forced to go underground as Maquis (in Gebirgaverteidi-gungastellen gehen).From now on the government would allocate large sums to industrialists so thateach could establish a secure post-war foundation in foreign countries.Existingfinancial reserves in foreign countries must be placed at the disposalof the Party so that a strong German Empire can be created after the defeat. Itis also immediately required that the large factories in Germany create smalltechnical offices or research bureaus which would be absolutely independent andhave no known connection with the factory. These bureaus will receive plans anddrawings of new weapons as well as documents which they need to continue theirresearch and which must not be allowed to fall into the hands of the enemy.These offices are to be established in large cities where they can be mostsuccessfully hidden as well as in little villages near sources of hydro-electricpower where they can pretend to be studying the development of water resources.The existence of these is to be known only by very few people in each industryand by chiefs of the Nazi Party. Each office will have a liaison agent with theParty. As soon as the Party becomes strong enough to re-establish its controlover Germany the industrialists will be paid for their effort and cooperation byconcessions and orders. (emphasis added)29[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft29]Thus, in August of 1944, the local SS commander in France was aware of detailedplans for the resurrection of the Third Reich which involved foreign assets, thefinancing of an underground terror organization, and the development of newweapons. He would have received this information from Berlin, presumably fromHimmler himself, as no one else would have dared to utter such defeatistsentiments or to plan for a post-war Germany using wealth and technology thathad been secreted abroad. As we now know, Himmler's second-in-command—SS GeneralErnst Kaltenbrunner— had been sent to oversee the resistance movement that wassaid to be headquartered in Austria, near Salzburg, in the last days of the war.Prior to that, he was in charge of the legal proceedings against the Hitlerassassination plotters and demanded their execution. He was a trusted SSofficer, an Austrian, and fanatically loyal to the Führer. Would Kaltenbrunnerhave been aware of the strategy to expatriate as much of the Reich's wealth andtechnology (and personnel) as possible, as early as August of 1944?Or would these orders have come from someone even higher up in the commandbureaucracy? If not Kaltenbrunner or Hitler, then the only other name that seemsplausible is Martin Bormann.Bormann is often mentioned in the same breath as the Nazi gold reserves andpost-war Nazi financing. There has been considerable controversy surroundingBormann, with many researchers suggesting that he survived the war despire asomewhat questionable eye-witness account that says he died in Berlin in May,1945. A distinguished CBS journalist and associate of Edward R. Murrow, PaulManning, followed the Bormann story for years. Manning provided credibleevidence pointing to Bormann's survival and to his management of Nazi financesaround the world, evidence that was ignored or devalued by his colleagues in themedia.Whether or not Bormann himself survived the war is not the issue before us,however. What is relevant is the fact that a postwar strategy was already inplace to protect the assets of the Reich (both monetary and otherwise), rescuethe Nazi Party and insure its survival, develop new weapons, and use guerrillatactics to enable the Reich to resist defeat as long as possible. Central to thesuccess of this mission was the expedient of escape. None of this money ortechnology would do the Party any good unless its personnel were there toorganize it, protect it, and invest it. These persons had to be true believers,otherwise the wealth of the Reich was in danger of being sold off to the highestbidders, piecemeal, as Germany lay devastated and hopeless.The most trustworthy of all the Nazis—and the ones most sought after as warcriminals—were the SS. Not the Wehrmacht, the Army whose generals had tried toassassinate Hitler—but the SS.The Red House meeting took place two months after the D-Day invasion in June of1944, and a month after the Generals' Plot to assassinate Hitler in July of 1944(known as Operation Valkyrie). Secret cables from the OSS (the Office ofStrategic Services, forerunner of the CIA) to Washington revealed that theringleader of the plot—Colonel von Stauffenberg—was part of a cabal that wasready to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union, believing that it would be betterfor Germany to side with the Russians than with the British and the Americans.30[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft30] Had the plot succeeded, Germanindustrial and military assets would have been transferred (at leasttemporarily) to Soviet control. This would have been a disaster for Americanpost-war policy (forgetting for a moment that the Soviets, who had lost twentymillion of its own citizens fighting the Nazis, would never have honored such acommitment to the Nazis even if they made it). It would have been equallydisadvantageous militarily, as it would have given the Soviets complete accessto the secret Nazi weapons facilities that had developed the V-1 and V-2 superweapons, and which were in the process of creating even more advanced weaponry.It was vital that Stauffenberg be stopped; it was not as essential that Hitlerbe saved from assassination, but it was important that the Stauffenberg cabalnot be permitted to take control of the country: important to the Nazis, andalso important to the Allies.Enter SS Major-General Otto Remer.One of the original conspirators, at the last minute Remer decided to throw inhis lot with the Nazi establishment and blow the whistle on the conspiracy,identifying von Stauffenberg as the chief conspirator.31[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft31] Stauffenb erg's network was rolledup, and he and other conspirators were executed (as mentioned, on orders fromErnst Kaltenbrunner).After the war, Remer would be implicated in the Naumann Affair: an attempt toresurrect the Nazi Party in Austria that was foiled by British Intelligence. Andit would be Remer who would find himself addressing a meeting of the LibertyLobby thirty years later, maintaining his anti-Communist (and Nazi) credentialsto the very end of his life.The D-Day invasion was the handwriting on the wall for the Third Reich, and thegenerals and the SS knew that whatever military action they performed now wasonly a stalling tactic. The Soviets were pouring through the east, and theBritish and Americans were pouring through the west. Those faithful Partymembers and SS men who were not completely insane understood that they had to dowhat they could to prepare for the defeat of Germany.The Generals' Plot demonstrated that neither Hitler nor the SS could trust thearmy. The Wehrmacht dealt in the hard-core realities of the battlefield; theywere led by career soldiers who were fighting Germany's wars long before therewas a Nazi Party. Once they realized that the war was lost (after the D-Dayinvasion and the successes of the Soviet Army on the eastern front) they knew,as soldiers, that their only course of action was to surrender with as muchdignity as they could muster, and to save as many lives as possible. Thisattitude was unacceptable to Hitler because it demonstrated a loss of faith inthe eternals of the Party and all it stood for, no less than a loss ofconfidence in the Führer himself. The Nazi Party, however, was a cult and itsmost fervent members—the SS—were true believers, the priesthood of the cult.That does not mean they were not pragmatic or wise, however. They knew thattheir most prominent leaders would be arrested and probably imprisoned, if notexecuted. They had to be sacrificed for the greater good. The rest would performa strategic withdrawal of their forces to areas around Europe and around theworld, where they could manage the resources left to them from such planningsessions as the Red House meeting and others which doubtless took place all overNazi-occupied Europe at the same time.The Red House Report was only one indication that the Nazis were planning fortheir survival almost a year before the surrender in May of 1945. They had ampletime to move gold and valuables out by truck and submarine to points all aroundthe world, and the evidence shows that they did. They had a network of agents inthe Americas, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East who would facilitate thesetransfers, as well as the transfer of personnel, and these networks were all inplace before the end of 1944.In the meantime, they would set up a rear-guard action designed to delay theAllies as much as possible while these other preparations were being made; thusthe “myth” of the National Redoubt was born. As we will see in a later chapter,there was considerable evidence that such an underground fortress existed, andmany prominent Nazis were found to be making their way to the Salzburg region ofAustria where it was believed to have been established.32[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft32] Top Nazis such as Foreign MinisterRibbentrop (hanged at Nuremberg) had summer homes in the region, and SS GeneralKaltenbrunner (hanged at Nuremberg) was captured there, disguised as a medicaldoctor.Salzburg, however, was only a way-station on a much longer route. Establishedlargely due to the tireless efforts of the Croatian Catholic priest—KrunoslavDraganovic—the ratline was first created solely to rescue the leaders of thepuppet Nazi government of Croatia, the Ustase. Later, the same routes andmethods were used to move other Nazis out of the reach of Allied justice.Monasteries, churches, and rectories from Austria through the Tyrol and northernItaly to Rome and Genoa were used as safe houses, and fraudulent identificationpapers were fabricated by the Catholic Church to enable the Nazis to obtainpassports issued by the International Red Cross.Much has already been discovered and reported about this episode in worldhistory, no less in the author's own books on the subject. The flight of Nazisto South America, especially to Argentina, has become something of a cliche andthe subject of novels, films, documentaries, and academic research andreportage. However, one aspect of the Nazi post-war strategy that often has beenoverlooked by popularizers and Hollywood screenwriters is the flight of capital.This is an essential aspect of the Nazi exit strategy—as evidenced by the RedHouse Report—and the ready availability of cash meant that the Nazi undergroundcould continue to function without worrying about how they would finance theiroperations. The amount of gold and other treasure that was taken out of Europehas yet to be adequately calculated, but it was enough to ensure—with carefulplanning and investments, legal and illegal—an operating fund that was the equalof the budgets of small countries.Due to the complexity of international trade and finance and the obscurity ofoffshore accounts, encoded wire transfers, and foreign currency transactions—aswell as the involvement in the trafficking of Nazi gold by other members of theAxis powers and sympathizers, including Argentina, Chile, Spain, Portugal,Switzerland and most notably Japan—this aspect of the ODESSA story resists allattempts at accurate accounting. What we can do is start with what is known, andthat means with newspaper accounts of banking investigations taking place inGermany, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, and elsewhere.Government-sponsored research, such as the Eizenstat Report also makes clear theextent of the financial holdings that are known ... and the extent of theholdings that are unknown. Compiled in 1997 by Stuart E. Eizenstat, who wasUnder Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, and Special Envoy of theDepartment of State on Property Restitution in Central and Eastern Europe underthe Clinton Administration. The report involved participation by the CIA, theFBI, and virtually the entire Cabinet. Entitled U.S. and Allied Efforts ToRecover and Restore Gold and Other Assets Stolen or Hidden by Germany DuringWorld War II, it begins with a warning:... this study is preliminary and therefore incomplete. Not every U.S. documentrelated to looted Nazi assets could be located and analyzed in the very shorttime we had to conduct and complete the study. As we progressed, additionaldocuments were constantly found. While we were compelled to rely mostly on U.S.documents, we are well aware that not until the documents of other countries areexamined can a more complete picture be drawn.This is the crux of the problem. While the Eizenstat committee was able toestimate the accummulated amount of wealth stolen by the Nazis as US $580million (US $5.6 billion in 1997 dollars), it admitted there were “indeterminateamounts in other assets.” Between 1939 and 1945, according to the Report,“Germany transferred gold worth around $400 million ($3.9 billion in today's33[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft33] values) to the Swiss National Bank inBern.” It is to be emphasized that these amounts are the result of traditionalbookkeeping and accounting methods and practices necessary for the Nazis topurchase raw materials from other countries for the prosecution of the war, aswell as to provide nest eggs for high-ranking Party and SS members. In otherwords, there was much gold and other assets that did not pass through the formalchannels of banks and federal institutions; there were also assets that weretransferred not to Swiss banks but to banks in Spain, Portugal and elsewhere andthese countries have been very slow to account for these assets. As more andmore investigations are undertaken—usually by independent journalists andinvestigative reporters in other countries, from Europe to the Americas toSoutheast Asia—the fiscal profile of the greatest theft in modern history keepsexpanding.Add to this hidden treasure the financial support of those regimes sympatheticto the Nazi cause, and there exists a slush fund of considerable size and power.As we have seen in the opening chapter, Jörg Haider and his pro-Nazi Alliancefor Austrian Progress Party was the recipient of just this type of largesse,from Libya and Iraq. Ahmed Huber, his Nazi colleague, was another: he was on theboard of directors of Al-Taqwa Bank, believed to have been a conduit of fundsfor Al-Qaeda.Just how did this start, and why has this essential aspect of the Naziunderground not been shut down and rolled up?"},{"pageContent":"THE FREUNDESKREIS HIMMLERThis meeting between Hitler and Papen on 4 January 1933 in my house in Colognewas arranged by me after Papen had asked me for it on about 10 December 1932.Before I took this step I talked to a number of businessmen and informed myselfgenerally on how the business world viewed a collaboration between the two men.The general desire of businessmen was to see a strong man come to power inGermany who would form a government that would stay in power for a long time.34[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft34]Historians as a rule do not focus on the minutiae of finance, especially whenthe larger issues of wars, treaties and revolutions are being considered.However, money is the fuel that powers governments and this is especially truein time of war. Books could probably be written on World War Two from a strictlyfinancial viewpoint and they would be quite revealing. Instead, we are usuallyoffered ideological explanations, analysis of strategy and tactics, evenbiographical and psycho-biographical studies of the main protagonists. Thismisses an essential point, and that is that these governments could not possiblywage war without a reliable source of income; just who provides this income andwhat may be their motivation to do so is usually ignored.In the case of Germany after World War One, this need for a reliable source offunds was especially true. German assets were seized; valuable land and otherresources were carved up by the Allies; and on top of that a Great Depressionwas looming over the horizon. The Nazi Party was just coming into its own in theyears after Hitler was released from Landsberg Prison for his abortive putsch inMunich in 1923. It needed votes in the Reichstag in order to consolidate powerin the federal government, and to get votes one needed cash to pay foradvertising, staff, and travel. Every politician knows this, of course, andHitler was no different. He could rely on donations from devoted Party membersand supporters, but only to a point. More than anything else, he neededfinancial experts who could help him woo the bankers and industrialists who heldthe real power and the real financing. He needed to be able to convince themthat his anti-capitalist rhetoric was just that: political expediency.Hitler was not a communist by any stretch of the imagination, but he did seecapitalism as representing the decadence of the city, and the curse of theindustrial revolution which took people out of the countryside and enslaved themin unhealthy urban areas. One wing of the Nazi Party—the Strasser wing—flirtedwith socialist ideas and dreamed that the Party would be a “workers party” withsolidarity among workers parties of other nations. Hitler, however, could notalign himself or his Party with foreigners, communists, or leftists of any kindand the Strasserites were suppressed. Hitler was against class warfare,believing instead that the classes could be organized into an efficientstructure in which each individual member of each class contributed to theoverall success of the country, each organization having its own leader—it'sführer—and each leader having another leader, up to the ultimate leader, theFührer himself. This was not the communist “dictatorship of the proletariat”: itwas simply a dictatorship by a single leader. While the communist theory heldthat the means of production in a communist state would be owned by the state,in Hitler's Reich the industrialists cooperated with the state and held ontocontrol of the industrial apparatus, at least for the time being. The concept oftotal war would mobilize the entire country and be a more or less constantstate, with every aspect of life, culture, and industrial production employed inthe service of total war. Hitler wanted the cooperation of the industrialists;he did not want the state to become an industrial enterprise itself, for thatwent against his völkisch ideas of the beauty of nature and the superiority of alife lived outside the cities and away from the factories. Hitler, indeed, didnot understand industry or care much for it, but he needed the power of industryand the capital of the bankers and financiers if Germany was to become greatagain. He had no time for a workers revolution that would see factory laborerstry to run corporations and find a way to make them work. Hitler was about todeclare war on most of Europe, and the industrial and financial strength heneeded was already available. He wanted to build a strong and invulnerableReich, and the ideologies of the Left and of communism held no appeal for him.This encouraged German and foreign financiers to support the Nazi Party againstits communist and leftist adversaries. As early as the days before the Beer HallPutsch, American industrialist Henry Ford was a generous contributor to theParty coffers due to his hatred of labor unions, communism, and Jews. In Europe,the German and Austrian business magnates would throw in their lot with the NaziParty and create a war machine under the noses of the Allies, in collaborationwith their American counterparts.To that end, a Freundeskreis was formed.A Freundeskreis is a “Circle of Friends.” A number of important German corporateleaders had gathered together to form a kind of lobby or political actioncommittee to raise funds and organize influence for the Nazi Party, under thetitular leadership of the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler. The SS was theviolent priesthood of the Nazi cult, composed of men who had taken an oath ofallegiance to Adolf Hitler. They were men who could be trusted, unlike thePrussians in the Wehrmacht who looked down on the Austrian corporal and hisragtag bunch of followers. These members of the Circle of Friends were those whocould see that Hitler had the answer to the malaise of Weimar Germany. Theywanted to see Germany strong again, and to avenge what they saw as theinjustices of the Versailles Treaty which had emasculated their country andblamed them for the war. Moreover, they wanted a leader who understood theirvalues and who would stand by them: a leader who hated the communists as much asthe corporate executives hated the unions.Among these Friends were names famous in German business and industry. Begun bybusinessman Wilhelm Keppler (18821960) in 1931 as the Freundeskreis derWirtschaft (“Circle of Friends of the Economy”), it was known familiarly as theKeppler Circle until, after Keppler's joining the SS in 1932, it became known asthe Freundeskreis Heinrich Himmler, named after the head of the SS.Keppler was the first Economics Minister of the Third Reich upon the accessionof Hitler to power in 1933. He previously had been the chairman of a small I.G.Farben subsidiary, and also held a position at the Reichstag as therepresentative of Baden until the end of the war. His most importantcontribution, however, was in organizing the Freundeskreis on behalf of Himmlerand the Reich. It brought together the real power brokers in Germany in anexclusive club that would exert tremendous influence over the re-arming of thecountry, and in ensuring preparedness for war, despite the restrictions placedupon it by the Versailles Treaty.It was this Freundeskreis or Circle of Friends that would later meet in theMaison Rouge Hotel in Strasbourg in 1944 to decide what to do about Germany'sassets in the face of almost certain defeat.Members of the original Freundeskreis include:Kurt Baron von Schröder of ITT, the Schröder Bank (which had Allen Dulles on theboard of its American branch, Schro-banco, in 1937), and the J.H. Stein Bank(Himmler's bank, and the official bank of the Freundeskreis), as well as theBank for International Settlements (BIS) as appointed by Hjalmar SchachtEmil Heinrich Meyer of ITTHjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank and architect of the Bank forInternational SettlementsGottfried Graf von Bismarck-Schönhausen (grandson of Chancellor Bismarck andBrigadeführer-SS)Friedrich Reinhardt, Chairman of the Board at CommerzbankOtto Steinbrinck, Vice President of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG (UnitedSteelworks, the largest steel manufacturer in Europe, manufacturing at least 50%of the Reich's total pig iron production)August Rosterg, General Director of Wintershall, one of the largest oilcompanies in EuropeEwald Hecker, chairman of Ilseder Hütte (major steel producer)Carl Vincent Krogmann, Mayor of Hamburg and fanatical NaziEmil Helfferich, Director of the German-American Petroleum Company (i.e., theDeutsche-Amerikanische Petroleum Gesellschaft, better known by its English nameas Standard Oil)Of the above list, two personalities will stand out as being particularlyimportant to this study. The first, of course, is Hjalmar Schacht, the talentedand creative financier who made it possible for the Third Reich to re-arm eventhough it had little in the way of actual funds. Schacht would survive the waronly to become deeply involved in the Nazi underground in Europe and inSoutheast Asia.The other name is Emil Helfferich, whose position with Standard Oil obviouslywas important to the Nazi war machine, but who also had a very differentpedigree as a plantation owner in what was then the Dutch East Indies: whatwould become today's nation of Indonesia.We will return to both of these individuals later on. For now, we will look atthe Nazi funding mechanisms and how they survived the war years only toresurface in unexpected places."},{"pageContent":"BIS AND OSSBut the real significance of this flow of capital was not just financial. Thebonds between the American bankers, businessmen, and industrialists, and theirGerman counterparts, would prove far more durable than the doomed WeimarRepublic, and even the Third Reich. With the BIS as the central point ofcontact, these links would endure during the SecondWorld War and reshape Europeafter 1945.35 [../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft35]The Red House (Maison Rouge) meeting took place in August, 1944. However, themonth previously reports were filed by the OSS under the signature of spy chiefWilliam J. Donovan that show the Allies were aware of capital flight takingplace at that time. In one communique, Donovan reports that the ArgentineMilitary Attache in Madrid was in contact with agents of the Nazi armamentplants, Skoda and Bruenn, to obtain manufacturing rights for the Argentinemilitary. The report goes on to state, “The money would be paid in free foreignexchange and a Spanish intermediary would be used for purposes of camouflage.”36[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft36]A few days later, Donovan sent another communique to the President detailingplans for a Nazi exit strategy that involved “higher Nazi bosses” moving withtheir families to Austria. The report goes on to state:Diplomatic baggage is being sent to Spain every day. So far, diplomats aretaking large packing cases, and countless valuables have already been shippedfrom the Reich to that country.37 [../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft37](That report also contains information on a Hitler “double” as one possiblereason why the assassination attempt known as Operation Valkyrie failed.)Thus, the Red House meeting came at least a month after the OSS was alreadyaware that the Nazis were moving assets to Spain. Further, the OSS was awarethat deals were being struck with Spain and Argentina for the movement of fundsand technology out of Germany shortly after the D-Day invasion.In Switzerland, however, plans for salvaging Germany's wealth had been in motionlong before the invasion and the subsequent assassination attempt on Hitler.This was at the offices of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), afinancial institution that was the brainchild of Hjalmar Schacht, ostensibly asa device for handling Germany's World War One reparations as required by theTreaty of Versailles.BIS was created by Bank of England chairman Montagu Norman in collaboration withSchacht; the first, tumultuous meetings that finally gave the BIS its formalblessing involved American financier Charles G. Dawes and American industrialistOwen D. Young. Dawes was chairman of the board of City National Bank and Trustof Chicago, and had been a Director of the US Bureau of the Budget, involvedwith German reparations arrangements after World War One. Young was the founderof the RCA Corporation and chairman of General Electric. The idea was to createa kind of clearinghouse for the funds that Germany would pay (to the tune ofover 130 million gold marks per year, as per the Versailles Treaty, a sum thatincreaed to more than 500 million marks per year as the discussions evolved) asreparations to those countries that had lost blood and treasure in the war. BISwould be “the central bankers's central bank,” a kind of super-bank, whosemembers included representatives from Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, Japan,and the United Kingdom. It would be immune from any country's laws and politics,the luggage of its members not subject to search by the police forces of anynation. The members of BIS were and are economic and financial diplomats, whoseloyalty is not to the countries that sired them but to the Bank itself. Until1977, in fact, the location of its headquarters in the Swiss town of Basel,hidden behind a chocolate shop, was a secret known only to a few. Outsiderswere— and are—not permitted to observe meetings, or even to view the rooms wheremeetings were held. Its deliberations are secret, save for the annual reports,which presumably have been sanitized of any incriminating evidence.Schacht, as president of the Reichsbank at the time of the founding of BIS(January 20, 1930), was deeply involved in its inspiration and creation. He sawBIS as a tool that could be used to move money around discretely, paying offGermany's war debts in the kind of sleight-of-hand for which Schacht wasunderstandably famous. It was Schacht who stabilized the German mark in theyears after the war, implementing what was known as the Hellferich Plan (namedafter Karl Hellferich, the brother of Emil who was a founding member of theFreundeskreis). The role of the Hellferich brothers cannot be overemphasized inthis study, for they had tremendous influence not only in securing Germany'sfinancial future and stability (and its ability to re-arm and wage war again),but also in supporting the rise of the Nazi Party and Adolf Hitler. KarlHellferich was an important banker and an outspoken opponent of the VersaillesTreaty. His financial acumen enabled Schacht and his colleagues to rescueGermany from the damaging reparations demands. Emil Hellferich was equallyimportant as a high-profile supporter of the Third Reich, and in addition, hadconsiderable experience in Indonesia, where a young Walter Hewel—confidant ofHitler since the days of the Beer Hall Putsch—would spend ten years developingthe Nazi Party. After the war, as we shall see, twenty tons of Nazi gold wouldmake its way to Indonesia, and so would Hjalmar Schacht.For all intents and purposes, BIS was the Nazi bank during the waryears—essentially the foreign branch of the Reichsbank, where deals could be cutin safety and secrecy with the heads of other central banks, including theconsortium of American banks that were represented by Thomas H. McKittrick.In 1944, meetings were being held at the highest level at the BIS headquartersin Basel to determine how to best allow the Nazi machine to survive what wasseen as its inevitable defeat on the battlefield. It was a surreal composition,and if the documentation did not support it, we would have a difficult timebelieving it. The bankers present at these meetings included representativesfrom countries that were currently at war with each other, discussing how tohide and move Nazi gold to ensure continuity of the German economy in thepost-war period. Indeed, according to US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau—a devotedanti-Nazi—at the 1944 Bretton Woods meeting that created the InternationalMonetary Fund, there were a total of fourteen BIS directors, of which twelvewere Nazis or members of regimes controlled by the Nazis (such as the Czechs whohad to surrender all their gold to the Reich's accounts at BIS). Morgenthau'sefforts to shut down the BIS were doomed to failure when the Swiss bankersthreatened to walk out of the conference.The head of the BIS at this time was an American, the said Thomas H. McKittrick,who was a friend of both Allen Dulles (at the time running the OSS office out ofBern, Switzerland) and his brother John Foster Dulles. McKittrick's policy wasto ensure a smooth flow of currency into and out of BIS coffers as the Nazisprovided gold that BIS could convert to other currencies to enable the Reich topurchase much-needed war materiel abroad. As late as 1943 McKittrick38[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft38] was praising the Reich's internalstability, and stability is what the world's industrialists and bankers wantedto hear.39 [../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft39] In fact, on May 1, 1943,Emil Puhl of the Reichsbank met Per Jacobssen, the Swedish BIS board member (andNazi collaborator), to discuss Allied post-war plans.40[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft40] Officials of the Nazi regime wereperspicacious enough to realize that they might lose the war or, at the veryleast, be stopped before they could expand much further. There were reversals onthe Russian front and supplies of much needed war materiel were being threatenedon all sides.BIS came into existence to facilitate the rise of the Third Reich by arrangingreparations to be paid in such a way that Germany would not feel the pain. TheDawes Plan, and later the Young Plan, made it easier and easier for Germany torestore itself after World War One, even as the Allies were pressing for greaterand greater reparations payments. Eventually, by 1932, the entire reparationsplan was scrapped due to the worldwide economic crisis and the inability ofGermany to pay down the debt. Even though the requirements of the Young Planwere now null and void, BIS still stood. It had been doing exactly what NaziGermany's financial wizard Hjalmar Schacht had intended; and now he returned tothe Reichsbank after a brief hiatus and took his seat on the board of BIS.The efforts of McKittrick to enable US firms such as IBM, ITT, Standard Oil, andothers to do business with Nazi Germany were essential to the Reich's initialsuccesses, both in the industrial arena and subsequently on the battlefield. TheDulles brothers also had a morally ambiguous relationship to Nazi Germany; eventhough Allen Dulles ran OSS intelligence operations against the Nazis, he alsobefriended many of them, including General Karl Wolff, whom he persuaded tosurrender along with his forces in northern Italy. Both Allen Dulles and JohnFoster Dulles were members of the prestigious New York law firm of Sullivan &Cromwell, which itself was handling some of the legal matters for BIS—as well asfor a list of American corporations who would remain friendly to the Reich forthe duration of the war, such as Brown Brothers, Harri-man and Co., Kuhn & Loeb,etc. The Dulles brothers had deep ties to Europe and especially to Germany,beginning in the days of the Paris Peace Conference after World War One. Theirinvolvement in international business, finance, and espionage—and their easyaccommodation with German nationalism—made them excellent contacts for thefledgling Nazi Party that they saw as the hope of a financially strong Germany.As mentioned, McKittrick (OSS codename 64441[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft41]) in 1943 was still encouraginginvestment in Nazi Germany due to its internal “stability.” While this may makea great deal of sense to an investor or financier, it is just one of manyindicators that the way war is perceived depends largely on who is doing thefighting. While ideologies and moral issues are important to the rank and fileof every nation, and motivate young men and women to enlist and go to combat anddie, to those who pay for the wars ideologies are simply fantasies with no realsubstance. What was different about the Third Reich was that an entire countrywas in the hands of ideologues and madmen who actually believed the ideologies,and who were planning on surviving long enough after the end of the war toresurrect the True Faith. In other words, the True Believers manipulated menlike McKittrick, whose cynical pragmatism and moral imbecility worked well forthem. Indeed, the Nazi goal of worldwide domination was not so different fromthat of I.G. Farben or any other multinational corporation. The only differenceis that the Nazis had all the guns and I.G. Farben had the camps.I.G. Farben is the most notorious of the German corporations which were integralto the Nazi war machine, and I.G. Farben Auschwitz was one of their facilitiesdesigned for the use of slave labor. What may not be so widely known is theextent to which this company had tentacles reaching all the way into other partsof Europe and the Americas. The network of I.G. Farben subsidiaries is so vast,and the interlocking directorships of this company with American companies (andwith BIS) is so intricate, that volumes have been written in an attempt todisentangle them. The company's immediate value to the Reich was in theproduction of oil and rubber, essential components in 20th century warfare. I.G.Farben, however, was tremendously diversified. After the war it was broken upinto pieces with brand names that today are well-known, such as Bayer, Hoechst,GAF (the company's American subsidiary), and others. Indeed, the chairman ofI.G. Farben—Hermann Schmitz—was a board member of BIS.In addition, the company had an intelligence operation in the United States.Known as “Buro IG” it spied on American industry, and had agents under cover whohad become American citizens and married American women to perfect their covers,as they worked to get as much technical, engineering and scientific knowledge aspossible for onward transmission back to Germany.42[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft42] This was taking place even as otherGerman agents were infiltrating American society, managing propaganda campaigns,recruiting sympathizers, and plotting sabotage as well as espionage, as we sawearlier. Thus the Nazi war machine was functioning in virtually every arena oflife, business, and culture, not only in Germany but everywhere abroad they hadan interest. This was certainly unprecedented in modern history, and isreflective of an overarching worldview that is almost missionary-like incharacter. This was not a movement that would go quietly or surrender its faitheasily, regardless of success or defeat on the battlefields. Indeed, they hadtaken all necessary measures to survive any eventuality.As Allen Dulles would write in a memorandum concerning his meeting with EmilPuhl (a director of both the Reichsbank and BIS) in March of 1945:... Nazism would not end with military defeat as Hitler and his fanaticalfollowers would no more change their philosophy than would Socrates or Mohammed... He emphasized that Nazism was like a religion and not merely a politicalregime.43 [../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft43]Thus, not only was Emil Puhl—tried and convicted at Nuremberg for war crimesstemming from his contribution to the Reich's financial machinery—stressing thatNazism was not going away no matter what happened in the war, but Allen Dulles,through this memorandum, was obviously aware of the conviction of thishigh-ranking Nazi of the durability of Nazism and of the implied threat of Nazipost-war survival. More importantly, the Allied intelligence agencies were beingtold, again and again, that Nazism was a cult, a religion, a faith: it was not apolitical party that had lost an election or a war. Religions don't die withbattlefield reversals. Sometimes, defeat even enables them to thrive.John Foster Dulles would become a Cold War Secretary of State. His brother,Allen Dulles, would become DCI: the head of the CIA, monstrous progeny of theOSS. It was Dulles who was CIA director when the Bay of Pigs operation failedagainst Cuba; it was Allen Dulles who was fired by President Kennedy whothreatened to break the CIA into a thousand pieces; and it would be Allen Dulleswho would find himself on the Warren Commission, charged with finding out whatreally happened that November afternoon in Dallas, 1963, when the president whofired him was shot and killed. It was Allen Dulles who ran interference at theCommission, derailing the interrogation of witness and friend of the Oswalds,Ruth Hyde Paine, when it became clear she might implicate his mistress andfellow spy, Mary Bancroft.44 [../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft44]It was also Allen Dulles who was in charge of the OSS end of OperationSafehaven, the Anglo-American plan to restrict the movement of Nazi gold andother assets out of the reach of the Allies, a plan that in the end proved to benot very successful."},{"pageContent":"SAFEHAVENThe motivations behind Operation Safehaven were obvious: to prevent a resurgenceof the Nazi Party after the war by cutting off their funds. Intercepted cablesshowed that the Nazis were moving large quantities of gold through neutralcountries such as Spain, Portugal, Turkey, and, of course, Switzerland. Today,CIA believes that this represented the normal actions of a regime that wasdesperate to acquire as many foreign products as necessary (such as oil,wolfram, and other raw materials) to continue propagating the war, and was notdesigned to contribute to an underground Reich or a future Fourth Reich.45[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft45] However, as other documentation (suchas, but not limited to, the Red House Report) clearly demonstrates, the Reichdid indeed plan for a reconstituted Germany after the war and was serious aboutproviding a central role for the Nazi Party apparatus.US Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau was adamant that Germany shouldnot have an industrial base, and that the country should be reduced to the levelof a basic, agrarian economy. Horrified at the obscene excesses of the Reich,and at what he saw as the willing cooperation of all its citizens, he wasdetermined that Germany would no longer be able to wage war against itsneighbors and wanted a scorched earth policy to flatten the country'sindustries. His Under Secretary, Harry Dexter White, was in total agreement withthis. Both Morgenthau and White were determined to close down BIS and replace itwith their own creation: the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,which were announced at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944.President Roosevelt also signed off on the proposal to curtail any futureindustrial growth of Germany after the war. This was essentially the position ofthe Allies in general, including Churchill. In this, they were to come upagainst Dulles and others—like McKittrick—who allegedly wanted a strong Germanyto stand up to the Soviet Union and to be the lynchpin for Western Europe.Basically, what the pro-German lobby in the American government wanted was moreor less what Nazi Germany had always wanted: a united Europe with Germany as theleader.The strong anti-Nazi position of Morgenthau and White (as well as Roosevelt) wasused against them, to paint them as leftists and Jews. Both Morgenthau and Whitewere Jewish, and this was seen as one of the reasons behind their intractiblestand against Germany. During the McCarthy period, White was accused of being aCommunist agent, a charge he successfully defended. However, after his death,the publication of the so-called Venona transcripts—decoded Soviet traffic heldin greatest security by the US government—seemed to prove that White was indeedspying for the Soviets. A careful examination of these transcripts in thecontext of the time tells a somewhat different story, and this has beendescribed by various researchers in recent years and White's record defended.By 1952 and the election of former Allied general Dwight D. Eisenhower to theAmerican presidency, the position of the United States changed dramatically. TheGOP establishment—and particularly those in the banking industry—were set onreversing as much of Roosevelt's New Deal as possible, and by paintinganti-Nazis as “soft on Communism,” they were able to characterize theaccomplishments of the New Deal as virtual treason against the US government.The same strategy that had been used by Hitler to seize total control inGermany—fear of Communist plots—was used by a whole generation of right-wingzealots in the United States to justify the witch hunts of the McCarthy era, aswell as new measures undertaken to extend American hegemony around the world.One may agree or disagree with this strategy on ideological grounds, but thefacts are incontrovertible. Even as the Truman administration ordered that noNazis be accepted into the United States to work for the military or in anyother capacity, Army officials ignored the wishes of their commander-in-chiefand brought in hundreds of scientists, doctors, engineers, and technicians, whohad known Nazi Party and even SS credentials under OperationPaperclip—sanitizing their war records to expunge any evidence of atrocitiescommitted by them during their tenure with the Reich.In the end, the Nazis stayed; BIS was left to do what it does best; theanti-Nazis in the US government were isolated from power; men with impeccableNazi credentials from a number of countries (Germany, Austria, Romania, Hungary,Slovakia, Ukraine, etc.) became involved with various political lobby groups inWashington to press their interests; and the Cold War made every moral andethical transgression not merely possible but justified in the name ofanti-Communism. There was no middle way or, it should be clarified, noalternative to either Nazism or Communism. It was this political atmosphere thatmade it possible, for instance, for the 1950 Richard Nixon senatorial campaignin California to paint his opponent—Helen Gahagan Douglas—as a Communist andmarried to a Jew, and therefore unworthy of the office. In other words, theAmerican political climate of the 1950s was little different from that of the1930s, even after years of the bloodiest conflict in human history and theobscene spectacle of the death camps.So while the British and American governments instituted Safehaven as a meansfor identifying and seizing Nazi assets abroad, men like Allen Dulles took ahalf-hearted approach to the problem, citing other, more pressing, intelligenceissues in an effort to avoid responsibility for it entirely—even though Dulles,as a friend of McKittrick at BIS, was in the perfect position to glean economicand financial intelligence that might have helped advance Safehaven's goalsconsiderably. While some data was obtained—famously not by Dulles, who was basedin Switzerland—it was not the complete picture of Nazi asset movements that theAllies hoped for. Either Dulles did not believe (in spite of all availableintelligence reports) that the Nazis would survive the conflict and returnstronger than before, or he simply did not care. Worse, he may have been hopingfor just such a survival of the philosophy that had succeeded in the slaughterof forty million people, albeit with some slight modifications and adjustments.The anti-Communist hysteria of the 1930s had made it seem wiser to throw in withthe Nazis than to oppose them, and Dulles was not immune to this point of view.Communism was the stated enemy of Capitalism, and Dulles was nothing if not adedicated Capitalist. Due to the adversarial relationship between the twophilosophies, it was always easier to point to the excesses of Communistregimes—the harsh and murderous rule of Joseph Stalin, for instance—than toacknowledge the brutality of many Capitalist regimes, such as the concentrationcamps under the Nazis, or the iron dictatorships of Franco in Spain and Salazarin Portugal (the latter two, supposedly neutral countries during the war, aidedand abetted the Third Reich in covert ways and especially where moving Naziassets was concerned). What the rest of the world saw as the hideous nature ofthe Third Reich and the necessity of exterminating every vestige of it on theplanet, the insiders saw as an ally against a greater enemy: the Soviet Union.It was as if Satan had appeared to Dulles (and to McKittrick, and to so manyothers) in the uniform of an SS officer standing on the peak of Mount Brocken,gesturing to Europe and saying “All this you shall have, if you but bow down andworship me.” While Jesus famously rejected the offer,46[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft46] Dulles accepted it with both hands.Dulles was only part of a larger cabal of pro-Nazi American diplomats and spiesthat flourished in the post-war years, doing their best to control Alliedresponse to the atrocities perpetrated by the Reich. One of those who wasimpatient with the liberals in the American government was William D. Pawley(1896–1977), a career diplomat with extensive ties to Latin America as well asto the famous Flying Tigers: the ersatz American-Chinese air force that foughtthe Japanese in China before Pearl Harbor. Pawley fought tooth-and-nail withanother US diplomat, Spruille Braden (1894–1978), who was just as involved withthe corporations that would become synonymous with American involvement withNazism (such as Standard Oil and W. A. Harriman & Co.), and with the USpolitical and economic domination in Latin America (United Fruit).47[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft47] Braden had created a copper miningoperation in Chile, and was instrumental in getting Somoza on the presidentialthrone in Nicaragua. His anti-Communist credentials were impeccable if not alittle tawdry, but his anti-Nazi credentials were just as strong, and this iswhat bothered Pawley.Braden was outraged that the Peron regime in Argentina was harboring Nazi warcriminals and was covertly assisting the remnants of the Axis powers byproviding its own version of “Safe-haven” by making Argentina a virtualsanctuary for Nazis on the run. Of course, this extended not only to personnelbut to the valuable assets that the Nazis were using to pay their way around theworld. In 1946, Braden published his infamous Blue Book which was a descriptionof Argentina's collaboration with the Nazis both during and after the war.48[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft48] In response, William Pawley (astaunch supporter of Peron, who had no patience with the breast-beating over theconcentration camps or the other horrors perpetrated by the Reich) did his bestto get Braden fired (unsuccessfully) and even accused him of harboring Communistsentiments: a charge which was ridiculous on its face. This case is illustrativeof the way that a kind of polarity had set in where American politics wasconcerned after the war—a polarity with which we must contend even to thepresent day: to be anti-Nazi was to be pro-Communist. There was (and is) nomiddle way.That was the leitmotif of the more than forty years that have passed from theend of World War II to the fall of the Soviet Union and the destruction of theBerlin Wall, and it remains the backbeat of the American political experience tothis day. It is this type of simplistic template of political consciousness (orunconsciousness) that is cleverly manipulated by politicians on both sides ofevery aisle, just as it was in Weimar Germany by men like Hitler and hispropaganda chief, Goebbels.As Germany became divided into West and East after the war as the Sovietsclaimed half of its territory—leaving only Berlin as an international city inthe midst of the Red zone—the West German government became ground zero in thestruggle against Soviet-style Communism. As German industrialists returned toresurrect the corporations and the factories that had fueled the Nazi warmachine with slave labor, so too did many officials of the Nazi regime find newpositions in the West German government. In addition, CIA created an anti-Sovietintelligence operation there composed of mostly former Nazis and SS-men withexperience in espionage and counter-espionage against the Russians. This was runby former Nazi intelligence chief on the Eastern Front, General Reinhard Gehlen,and his operation became known as the Gehlen Organization or the Gehlen Org. In1956, the Gehlen Org became the West German intelligence service, the BND(Bundesnachrichtendienst or Federal Intelligence Service)—and thus were manyNazis, including SS and Gestapo agents, incorporated into the German militaryand intelligence establishment as if nothing had ever happened.Due to the deep involvement of the Dulles brothers with Nazi personalities andorganizations and their pragmatic, realpolitik view of the world—as well astheir associations with many of the firms that had been doing business with theNazis right through the war— there would have been no real desire to focus onthe post-war threat of Nazism lest it shine a light into uncomfortable cornersof global finance and other liaisons dangereuses. It was more important to thebankers, financiers, and corporate executives that a strong Germany be rebuiltagainst the threat of Soviet-style communism than it was to worry about aresurgence of the Nazi Party, the SS, or its ideology. In fact, a vigorousGerman nationalism might well be the best fortress against the Soviet Union, aslong as such nationalism could be directed in the right channels.The exit strategy of the Reich was therefore twofold. In the first place, asmany as possible of the trustworthy true believers had to be rescued, especiallythose whose intelligence and contribution to the war effort and to the successof Nazism had already been proven. This included the SS, of course, but alsothose Nazis who had demonstrated not only their loyalty but also their acumen.In the second place, as much of German technology, tangible assets, patents,engineering capability, and manufacturing capability as possible had to beexpatriated. These assets would be employed in a variety of ways in countriesthat were sympathetic to Nazi aims or were, at least, not hostile to them. TheThird Reich would be reconstituted abroad: not in a single country or regionwhere it could be contained once again, but spread over the globe like amultinational corporation. Like I.G. Farben, in fact. The Nazis learned animportant lesson from their involvement with the Bank for InternationalSettlements, and that is that a nation need not be restricted to an idea ofnational borders, but that it could exist in a kind of virtual space, everywhereand nowhere all at once, like a bank account. The movement of currencies throughthe BIS coffers in Basel worked like a kind of magic. There were no tellerwindows at BIS. No adding machines. The physical plant of the bank consisted ofsome meeting rooms and some filing cabinets. The place had once been a hotel,and the hotel rooms had simply been refurnished with desks and chairs. Therewere telephones, enabling the bank's directors to conduct business worldwide.That was about it. These were men united in their desire to ensure thecontinuity of power and industry in Germany, regardless of the moral or ethicaldimensions of their hidden agenda. The facilitation of the bank transfers, themovement of the gold (there was no illusion as to how the gold was obtained, andunder what dire circumstances), the survival of the Nazi corporations were allaccomplished with a wink and a nod, and a small commission.49[../Text/part0014_split_004.html#c5-aft49]This nebulous construct was what enabled the Nazi corporations and theirAmerican and European subsidiaries and counterparts to keep the machinery of warrunning at full speed. Money has no national boundaries and neither, as the warwound down and the Reich lay devastated, did the Nazi Party. It had establishedbranches throughout the world and attracted sympathizers in regions as remotefrom Germany as Latin America, the Middle East, India, Japan, and SoutheastAsia. It had become a transnational cult, capable of eliciting the admiration ofthe colonized and the colonizer alike, depending on their own need forjustification and empowerment. It was a doctrine of strength and will, of theworship of nature, and contempt for mercy, compassion, and the Judeo-Christiantradition, which was seen as servile and weak, a belief system for victims andnot for champions, a True Faith for the collaterally damaged.The Islamic tradition, however, was much more interesting to the Cold Warriors.28 [../Text/part0014_split_001.html#c5-ft28] It also can be found in a USGovernment volume entitled Elimination of German Resources for War, dated June22, 1945, pp. 44–49. There is another reference to the meeting on page 464 ofthis massive, 1215 page collection of testimony and documentation.29 [../Text/part0014_split_001.html#c5-ft29] It should be noted that theveracity of the Red House Report has been called into question, most recently byHeinz Schneppen (Odessa und das Vierte Reich:Mythen der Zeitgeschichte, Berlin,Metropol-Verlag, 2007) who, in the same work, questions the existence of ODESSAas well as the Nazi-Argentina nexus. Research by Argentine journalist Uki Goñi(The Real ODESSA) and others dispute Schneppen's findings where both ODESSA andArgentina are concerned, and the event described as the Red House meeting inStrasbourg was considered genuine enough by US Government intelligence andmilitary analysts at the time. The fact that German industry had diversified itsholdings to the extent that at the end of the war I.G. Farben alone had dozensof subsidiaries in foreign countries and German corporations in general had morethan 750 foreign subsidiaries abroad in 1945, including in Turkey and Argentina,argues against Schneppen's analysis. Schneppen's point is that this was all“business as usual” and should not imply a nefarious Nazi underground network.However, the US Government report cited above also mentions a document in whichHimmler “informed all gauleiters that certain party men in whom Hitler hadconfidence would be sent abroad for special missions; in February 1945, 345party members received orders to prepare to leave Germany.” (Elimination ofGerman Resources for War, dated June 22, 1945, p. 646). This would seem to offerevidence that, far from being a fantasy, the threat of an underground Reich wasa real and present danger.30 [../Text/part0014_split_001.html#c5-ft30] One of these, a Memorandum For ThePresident, is dated 27 January 1945 on OSS stationery, and signed Charles S.Cheston, Acting Director, was declassified by the CIA in 1973. It reports thatone of the conspirators in the assassination plot against Hitler escaped toSwitzerland, and claimed to investigators that von Stauffenberg had planned tocut a peace deal with the Soviets.31 [../Text/part0014_split_001.html#c5-ft31] As discussed in anotherdeclassified OSS memorandum, this one dated 1 February 1945, and signed byActing Director Cheston. This memo also references the desire by the vonStauffenberg group to cut a deal with the Soviets who ensured that “Germanywould receive a just peace from the Soviets and the Wehrmacht would not bewholly disarmed.”32 [../Text/part0014_split_001.html#c5-ft32] Allen Dulles, from his position asOSS representative in Bern, Switzerland, was one of those who alertedDonovan—head of the OSS—that the Nazis had planned their last stand at theNational Redoubt.

You maycall this primitive and you may laugh about it, but it is based on deeperwisdom. A religion must speak a man's language.—Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler50 [../Text/part0015.html#c6-aft50]To accuse one's political adversaries of being Nazis is to engage in relativelymeaningless polemic, since the term Nazi has been used by just about everyone tocharacterize just about everyone else. To equate Islamist terror groups withNazis seems equally pointless, an appeal to emotion rather than logic: ashorthand for everything evil or sinister. However, as we shall see, theidentification of Nazism with some of the more virulent ideological positions ofIslamist groups is not all hyperbole.Recent publications in the relatively new academic field of fascism studies haveidentified several characteristics that may be considered emblematic offascism.51 [../Text/part0015.html#c6-aft51] These include utopianism, or adesire to create the perfect society: often a nostalgic longing for what isreferred to as in illo tempore, or “in that time,” i.e., a golden age. This is abelief (in the face of all empirical evidence) that such a society was everpossible or ever existed. Nazi visions of a perfect state reflect this longing,especially when combined with its neopagan, pre-Christian trappings. Muslimlonging for the return of the khalifah, or caliphate, is evidence of a similarvision of a perfect state.This characteristic often appears paired with anti-modernity. The modern worldis seen as sick and decadent, the product of the industrial revolution and themove to the cities, in which human beings are herded together in housing unitsof ever-decreasing size, working at meaningless jobs for which they receive onlysubsistence pay or benefits. Anti-modernity also includes attacks on modern art,literature, music, and other cultural expressions. Sayid Qutb, the founder ofthe modern Salafist movement that had such an influence on contemporaryIslamism, attacked modernity as spiritually bankrupt and evidence of thedecadence of the West. At the same time he criticized jazz and modern music as“savage” and the apparent freedom of women in America as revealing the declineof morality, a poison that he feared would infect the Arab (i.e., Muslim) worldas well. Thus, anti-modernity has a spiritual component. To be modern is to beWestern, is to be spiritually empty.Islamism became the outgrowth of this moral position, a blending of conservativeIslamic thought with an activist political agenda, a liberation movementtargeting the colonial powers under the guise of attacking decadent Westernculture. It was a reaction to the unacceptable status of Arabs as serfs in theirown lands, perceived as the result of a loss of true faith. In this it wassimilar to the Nazi viewpoint that the defeat of Germany in the First World Warwas the result of the cultural, racial, and moral weakness of its leaders. BothNazism (and fascism) and Islamism are revolutionary movements; but Nazism andIslamism, in particular, are revolutionary movements with a spiritual dimension,a desire to create a new spiritual state in combination with a new politicalreality. Both Nazism and Islamism see that there is no point in dividing churchand state: that church and state, religion and political government, areindivisible. This is the Islamist as well as the Nazi point of view.There are differences, of course, between Nazism and Islamism. In the firstplace, Islamism is international in scope, an appeal to all Muslims anywhere inthe world, whereas Nazism and fascism are by definition nationalisms. Islamismis not (overtly) racist, even though a subtle preference is given to Arabs overother Muslims, and the blood descendants of the Prophet are held in high esteemabove all others, thus linking Islamist ideas of the blood to Nazi ideals ofracial purity. Even then, however, Islamism cannot be considered racism, thoughaccusations of anti-Semitism are legitimate enough. This may be due to the factthat at this time—the early decades of the 20th century—the Arabs in generalwere an oppressed people and not in a position to oppress anyone else. Further,they were hopelessly divided amongst themselves: tribe versus tribe, Bedouinversus city-dwellers, region versus region, even Shi'a versus Sunni. Bydeclaring all non-Muslims as “other,” there was the possibility of uniting thesevarious factions into a pan-Arab movement, but all such efforts so far havefailed.By substituting religion for racism, the Islamist movement became internationalin scope. This was encouraged by the ruse of the Western powers who attempted touse the newly-minted concept of “global” jihad to unite Muslims against their(the Westerners') enemies—as discussed in chapter two[../Text/part0010_split_000.html#c2]. Thus, the Muslims became proxies of theWest, and jihad was the tool used by the West to manipulate Muslim (primarilyArab and Central Asian) sentiments and arouse a religiously-infused militancydirected against Western targets.Due to its internationalist character, global jihadists could potentiallytranscend their ultra-nationalist brothers on the extreme right (Nazis,fascists), but this is also their inherent weakness. Can the jihadists rely on arudimentary religious bond and a superficial identity as “Muslim” to supersedecenturies of mutual distrust and antagonism? As we have seen with the rise ofgroups like the Islamic State (formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq andSyria (ISIS) or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)) and othermilitant or terror groups, there is no consensus among the jihadists as to whocan rule, command, and inspire them. They will still fall victim to charismaticleaders (like Osama bin Laden) regardless of fine theological distinctions, andin this they are little different from the populist leaders like Hitler,Mussolini, Pavelic, Franco, Peron, etc. who defined themselves much better thanthey could define an over-arching political philosophy. Of all the fascisms ofthe 20 th century, Nazism survives due to its symbol set, its book, itscharismatic leader, its adoration of violence, its worship of the masculineprinciples embedded in the heroic ideal, and its exclusionary positions. Italianfascism never had all of these to the extent that Nazism did. For jihadism tosurvive it must adopt more of these characteristics. While it can be argued thatthey have a book—the Qur'an—it is interpreted freely by all Muslims and indifferent ways by various theological factions. Mein Kampf is more powerful (inthis sense) in that it is not studied, so much as held up as a kind of totem.Islamism requires a symbol set that transcends language (like the swastika), forits symbols to this date are largely Arabic verses and relate specifically toArab language and culture; it needs a swastika equivalent.It also needs a charismatic leader who is strong enough to unite the warringfactions and so far this has not happened. Jihad-ism is still sectarian andsubject to pressures from both within and without.An Islamist-Nazi combination would be virtually unstoppable: a genuine, livingspiritual tradition mixed with an inclusive internationalism; anti-modernity;anti-Semitism; a Manichaean worldview; hero worship; and a potent symbol systemwith a charismatic leader, the latter of which have yet to be discovered.There have been a few attempts, however, and they can only provide us with aforetaste of what will come.We have already shown how the concept of “global jihad” was invented, not by theMuslims, but by a German, an amateur archae-ologist—who thought he haddiscovered the key to uniting the Arabs of the Middle East, as well as theMuslims of Central, South, and Southeast Asia into an uprising against thecolonial powers of England, France, and Russia on behalf of the Kaiser'sGermany. This militarization and politicization of the religious concept ofsacred struggle was embraced by the Arab world's foremost proponent ofanti-colonialism and avowed enemy of the English, the Hajj Amin al-Husseini,Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.Al-Husseini had not been silent during the greatest conflict of the twentiethcentury. He saw in the Nazis an important ally against the British occupation ofPalestine, especially so as the Nazis were also aggressively anti-Semitic. Itwas a throwback to al-Husseini's own history as a soldier with the OttomanTurks, who had formed an alliance with Germany during the First World War,declaring a jihad against the enemies of Islam. Now, during the Second WorldWar, al-Husseini would revive the idea of global jihad in forming a division ofBosnian Muslims for the Third Reich.Known as the Handschar Division (the handschar was a type of knife unique to theTurks who had control over the Balkans until the early 20th century),52[../Text/part0015.html#c6-aft52] the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS wascomposed of mostly Balkan Muslims and some Croatian Catholics who would fightalongside the Nazis for the duration of the conflict. These troops fought inEurope, not the Middle East, but it was central to the Mufti's idea of globaljihad that Muslims should fight against the British, French, and Russianswherever the “colonialists” and “Zionists” could be found. In fact, much of theaction seen by the Handschar Division was against the socialist partisans underJosep Tito, who was attempting to form his own Yugoslav Republic. This wasanalogous to the motivation behind the Ukrainian SS unit, composed of men whowanted to fight on the side of the Nazis in order to liberate their homelandfrom Soviet rule. “The enemy of my enemy is my friend,” so goes the Arabproverb, and the truth of this dictum was nowhere more apparent than it wasduring the Second World War. It was this polarization of ideology againstideology—rather than country against country—that formed the template from whichfuture conflicts, both global and local, would be spawned.Initially, the Muslims balked at serving with the Nazis, but it was al-Husseiniwho assured the ulama that it was the right thing to do. From the Nazi point ofview, it was Himmler who stated that he admired the Muslim fighters for theirexcess of valor and even brutality on the battlefield, and their willingness todie for a holy cause, a jihad. He even considered as plausible the argumentsthat were put forward by the Croatians and the Bosnians that they were, inreality, Aryans and not Slavs. Certainly, al-Husseini himself, with his fairhair and blue eyes, fit the Nordic stereotype.Let loose upon the Balkan countryside, these troops proved to be as vicious asany other in the SS armory, committing atrocities against local Jewish andSerbian populations as well as fighting the socialist partisans. Their missionsupposedly was to perform counter-insurgency operations against the partisansunder Tito, and keep order for the Nazi puppet regime, the Ustase under AntePavelic. The Muslims, however, did not trust the Croatians, even after Pavelicbuilt them a mosque in Zagreb. Pavelic's wooing of the Muslims was part of hisoverall plan to ensure that Bosnia (which had a large Muslim population) wouldremain an integral part of the country he was trying to form out of Croatia,Bosnia, Herzegovina, and parts of Serbia. Although a Catholic, Pavelic had nodifficulty in exploiting Muslim sensitivities in his efforts to create a Naziregime in the Balkans that would, at times, exceed even Nazi brutality in theconcentration camps he created and left under the control of Catholic priests,such as the notorious Jasenovac Concentration Camp.Eventually the tide of war turned against the Ustase and against the SSHandschar Division. The leaders of the Ustase regime found it necessary to fleeabroad, to avoid capture and prosecution by the Allies. This also extended tosome of the Handschar officers—those who managed to avoid being extradited toYugoslavia to stand trial for war crimes, such as Major General Sauberzweig (whocommitted suicide), and SS Obersturmführer Imam Halim Malkoc who was executed in1947.When it came time to arrange for the escape of the Ustase leaders (and theUstase treasure, much of it in gold), it was a Croatian Catholicpriest—Monsignor Krunoslav Draganovic—who organized the itinerary and whoprovided the false papers necessary to permit Pavelic and virtually the entireUstase government to flee to Argentina. Draganovic's name and contactinformation also appear in an address book kept by the Chief Medical Officer ofthe Salzburg Gau, Dr. Med. Georg Anton Pöch. As detailed in Ratline, Dr. Pöchprovides the key to examining the extent of the Nazi escape routes to SoutheastAsia, a fact heretofore never examined by other researchers in this field. It isalso Dr. Pöch who introduces us to the bizarre phenomenon of Nazis who convertedto Islam.Towards the end of his life in exile on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa, theenigmatic Austrian doctor became a Muslim. A dedicated Nazi since before theAnschluss, Pöch had the impeccable credentials of a loyal Party member andcapable (and well-connected) functionary of the Nazi regime. While I have hadthe opportunity to examine some of the documents left behind by Pöch during anextended research trip in Singapore, I cannot definitively say whether theindividual who escaped to Indonesia after the war—after a lengthy sojourn in theBolzano (Bozen) region of the Italian Tyrol—was in reality Dr. Pöch himself, orsomeone else who had appropriated his documentation for purposes of concealinghis true identity, much as Ernst Kaltenbrunner had taken the identity of anothermedical doctor in his attempt to flee the authorities in the region outsideSalzburg. What his papers do suggest, however, is that the doctor was a devotedNazi, who had ample opportunity to make good use of the contacts he had to getout of Europe and to South America. Yet, rather than follow his colleaguesacross the Atlantic to certain safety in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,Uruguay, or any of the other countries that welcomed Nazi fugitives—countriesthat were at least Christian and Westernized to some extent, and where he couldfind European food and culture—he chose the largest Muslim country on earth, onthe other side of the world, and on the most remote island he could find.This decision seemed counter-intuitive at the time I encountered the story ofGeorg Anton Pöch, but since then enough information has come to light to suggestthat his story is by no means anomalous. Rather, we can now show that hundredsof Nazi war criminals and SS members converted to Islam after the war, and manyof these found themselves working for Arab regimes in North Africa and theLevant. This element of the Nazi exit strategy is one that bears closeinspection, for it reveals the extent that Nazi ideology and Nazi personalitieswere able to influence political directions in the Middle East long after theend of hostilities in Europe—political directions that have taken anincreasingly dangerous turn since the fall of the Soviet Union when one ofNazism's archetypal enemies was destroyed, leaving only Israel and the UnitedStates left with which to settle scores.An appendix to this book will give a list of some of the known Nazis whoconverted to Islam. For now, it is enough to describe a few of the moreprominent in order to demonstrate not only that they escaped justice, but thatthey continued their work for the Party and, in many cases, for the SS fordecades after May of 1945. The relevance of this information cannot beoverstated: Nazism continued to thrive after the war because it is not apolitical party per se but—as even Josef Goebbels admitted—a religion. It is areligion that made common cause with the anti-colonialist element of Islamicnationalism that was born in the Middle East as a result of British and Frenchpower politics in the region. Both Nazism and what is often referred to asIslamism are opponents of what they perceive to be decadent Western culture andrampant capitalism; they are opponents of what they perceive to be a globalJewish conspiracy to control the world; and they both idolize romantic notionsof male dominance, the warrior ethos, and a return to the simplicity of a bygoneage (ideas that are familiar to those who study bushido, the Japanese cult ofthe warrior, and indeed there were more than just ideological similarities, aswe will see). Islamists wish to reconstitute the Caliphate in a region that someidentify as stretching from the Middle East and North Africa to Southeast Asia.Nazis wish to reconstitute the Third Reich. Old empires, ancient dreams.The stuff of religion and spiritual aspiration.One of the first to realize that there could be an ally in Middle East Arabismwas SS-Obersturmbannführer (Lieutenant Colonel) Adolf Eichmann (1906–1962). Whatis not generally known is that Eichmann visited Palestine in 1937 while alreadyin the SS, and that he spoke some Hebrew and Yiddish. Eichmann's purpose inPalestine was to determine whether German Jews would be able to emigrate there.However, a larger Jewish presence in Palestine would ultimately have led to theJews having a state from which they could organize themselves into a regional ifnot a global power, and that idea was scrapped as it ran counter to Nazi policyconcerning the Jews. During that visit, however, Eichmann visited both Palestineand Cairo, meeting at one point with a representative of the Haganah who arguedfor a larger number of Jewish emigres. Germany and Italy had already beenoffering military and other assistance to the Palestinians in a somewhatsporadic manner, all arranged by the Mufti, so he was not an unknown entity tothe Reich.This was during the Arab Revolt in Palestine (1936–1939), and the position ofthe Jews at that time during the British Mandate was problematic. They saw theirenemies as both the Arabs and the British, just as the Arabs saw their enemiesas the Jews and the British. It is not known whether Eichmann met with leadersof the Arab resistance—such as the Grand Mufti53[../Text/part0015.html#c6-aft53]—or with elements of the Muslim Brotherhood(Ikhwan) in Cairo which was similarly anti-British (Egypt was under Britishcontrol at the time as well) and anti-Semitic. It is known that Eichmannattempted to enter Palestine after his meetings in Cairo, but was turned away bythe British. That same year, the Grand Mufti had to escape Palestine due to aBritish arrest warrant that had been issued for him due to his role in the ArabRevolt. Al-Husseini lived for awhile in Lebanon and Iraq before finally makinghis way to Rome and then Berlin in 1941.Eichmann's interests also included Freemasonry, and his first job with the SSwas to curate the Freemasonry material that had been seized from German lodgesand, later, from lodges in the occupied territories. In other words, Eichmann'sbrief could be identified with that twin bugaboo of Nazi—and, later,Islamist—paranoia: the Jewish-Masonic conspiracy.Eichmann traveled along the same ratline after the war that was taken by so manyothers. He wound up in Argentina, working as a clerk for other Nazi fugitiveswho had held much lower rank than he during the war, a situation that must havebothered him greatly. He found other servile employment in various companies inArgentina. He was often ostracized by his own people, possibly due to hisnotoriety as one of the architects of the Final Solution—a participant in theinfamous Wannsee Conference, during which the details of the Endlösung werehammered out. His later kidnapping by the Mossad and subsequent trial inJerusalem actually might have boosted his ego somewhat, even as it sealed hisdoom.As exposed as he had been to Freemasonry, Jews, and Arab nationalism, however,he did not convert to Islam. His religion had always been Nazism and it remainedthat way until his execution. Others, however, were more pragmatic.One of the pre-eminent Arabists within the Reich was Sturm-banführer-SS Dr.Johann von Leers (1902–1965). An early participant in the Freikorps brigadesthat fought communist groups in Weimar Germany after World War One, he was alsoa relatively early member of the Nazi Party (1929) and became an SS officer in1936. Von Leers had studied law and was fluent in several languages, includingJapanese. He was briefly a professor at the University of Jena, and had evenworked for awhile at the Foreign Office. Tapped by Goebbels to work in thePropaganda Ministry, von Leers was a prolific writer of anti-Semitic tracts. Hecompared Islam favorably with Judaism, preferring the heroic warrior mystique ofthe Arabs to what he saw as the decadent condition of the Jews—who, he believed,measured success in purely financial (i.e., capitalist) terms and were thusessentially criminals. Like other Nazis, including Himmler, von Leers believedthat the Prophet Muhammad had taken care of the “Jewish problem” in the MiddleEast. He believed that what he saw as the relatively lax position taken byChristian Europe towards the Jews was what led to the growth of Jewish cabalsand to the empowerment of European Jewry.When the war ended, von Leers escaped to northern Italy, where he remained forfive years (roughly the same amount of time, and in the same region, as Dr.Georg Anton Pöch), before leaving for Argentina in 1950. In Argentina, hecontinued his pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic propaganda activities by publishing theNational Socialist Der Weg, a German-language periodical that featured articlesby von Leers and also by Otto Skorzeny, Hans-Ulrich Rudel, and OttoRemer—further evidence that the SS was composed of true believers who would notwillingly abandon their faith, even years after the defeat of the Third Reich.An American, H. Keith Thompson, was their United Nations correspondent in NewYork, a personality to which we will return.Von Leers was eventually convinced to come to Egypt by Hajj Amin al-Husseinihimself. In Egypt, von Leers worked first for Egyptian President Naguib, andthen for Naguib's replacement, General Gamal Abdel Nasser, working in Egypt'sversion of Goeb-bels's Propaganda Ministry, the Department for Jewish Questionsin the Egyptian Information Ministry. It was about this time that he convertedto Islam and took the name Omar Amin, a name that could be interpreted to mean“eloquent speaker” (Omar) of Amin, i.e., Amin al-Husseini, his mentor: in otherwords, the Grand Mufti's mouthpiece. Such an homage would not be out of thequestion for von Leers, for he remained a fanatic to the end of his life.We would not need to dwell too much on von Leers except for the fact that he hadtremendous reach, even into the United States, and was an associate of AhmedHuber (1927–2008). Huber was the Swiss Nazi, and Muslim convert, who formed oneof the contemporary links between Islamist terror groups and Nazi organizationsand individuals. Von Leers is also known to have flown to France in the wake ofthe Eichmann kidnapping in 1960 to meet with the Belgian NaziSS-Standartenführer (Colonel) Leon Degrelle, then at the hub of a global networkof Nazi fugitives and their supporters in the United States, Latin America, andEurope, as well as the Middle East.54 [../Text/part0015.html#c6-aft54] The ideawas to come up with a way to manage the news fallout from the trial in order tospin the testimony in such a way that it would be beneficial to the Nazis(obviously, as late as 1960, this was still a concern that merited internationalconsultations). Von Leers' relationship with SS General Otto Remer was alsowell-known—as it was Remer who became a kind of poster-boy for everything fromHolocaust denial to ODESSA and its various manifestations.Otto Ernst Remer (1912–1997) was a career Wehrmacht officer who left the servicein 1945 with the rank of Brigadier General (Generalmajor). It was Remer whoserole in stopping Operation Valkyrie—the assassination attempt on Hitler's lifeand the resulting military coup—made him one of Hitler's most trusted generals.Working alongside Remer in the aftermath of the assassination attempt, and theensuing roundup and execution of its participants, was Ernst Kaltenbrunner andOtto Skorzeny.Kaltenbrunner would be apprehended by the Allies near Salzburg at the end of thewar and was eventually executed at Nuremberg. Skorzeny, also apprehended in thesame area, managed to escape (or was allowed to escape) in 1948, and carried onhis Nazi activities to the end of his life.Remer, on the other hand, also was captured by the Allies but only remained aprisoner until 1947, at a time when the attitudes of the Allies had shifted to amore anti-Communist position. Remer, not content to remain in the backgroundduring the Cold War, cofounded the Socialist Reich Party on October 2, 1949, anopenly pro-Nazi party that was eventually banned by the West German governmentabout two years later. Regardless of this setback, Remer remained a profoundinfluence on the underground Nazi movement for the rest of his life, and helpedto formulate a “third way” philosophy for the generation of Nazis who would comeafter him, a philosophy that involved support for a variety of pro-Arab andpro-Islamist movements. While rejecting both communism and capitalism, the“third way” Nazi philosophy could appeal to a wide variety of groups that feltvictimized or oppressed by the superpowers that were largely perceived as newcolonialist regimes. It was a “plague on both your houses” ideology thatgarnered support from Islamist activists, who rejected what they saw as thecrass materialism of capitalism as well as the militant atheism of communism.And as the decades moved from the 1940s to the 1950s and 1960s, colonialismbegan to take on different forms, including cultural and economic strategiesthat disempowered the former Ottoman territories even further. What began ascolonies in the centuries prior to the Second World War, became “spheres ofinfluence” in the postwar era, divided up between the Soviet Union on the oneside and the United States on the other.Before it was banned, Remer's Socialist Reich Party offered him a very publicplatform for the rejection of West German dependence on the United States. Heeven made overtures to the Soviet Union, in an attempt to create an imbalancewithin the West German government that would topple its leadership and create avacuum for the Socialist Reich Party to fill. The party platform includedHolocaust denial, and went so far as to accuse the United States of havingfabricated film footage of the death camps and having created the crematoria forpropaganda purposes. The Soviet Union saw the Socialist Reich Party as a usefultool for destabilizing the West German government, and went so far as to providesome financial assistance towards that end. Needless to say, by 1952, when theparty was banned, Remer had to find other avenues for his political philosophy.Accused by the West German government of trying to revive the Nazi Party, awarrant was issued for his arrest. He fled to Egypt, where he developed a closeworking relationship with General Nasser, as well as with Johann von Leers, andbecame involved in the arms trade. His customers included mainly other Arabnations.By 1956, Remer was involved in gun running in Syria and in providing arms to theAlgerian National Liberation Front (and similar groups), through his ownimport-export house, the Orient Trading Company based in Damascus. There isevidence to support the claim that Remer had a close working relationship inDamascus with Alois Brunner—one of the most wanted Nazis in the world and AdolfEichmann's deputy—a war criminal with tens of thousands of victims to his name.Brunner survived not only the war, but at least two assassination attempts bythe Israeli secret service, the Mossad, who mailed him letter bombs that took aneye and some of the fingers of his left hand. There is no evidence that he hasdied. As late as 2001, there were Brunner sightings in Damascus. Indeed, he gaveinterviews to various reporters in the late 1980s, in which he voiced hissatisfaction at the Holocaust and with his role in it (a situation that, initself, gives the lie to Holocaust deniers who claim it never happened).The various North African liberation movements were heavily supported by Nazisat various levels of the supply chain: from operational experts like Remer,Brunner and Skorzeny; to propagandists like von Leers and Rudel; to financialwizards like Hjalmar Schacht and the irrepressible François Genoud (see below).The groundwork for what would become the third attempt at global jihad, afterthe failed attempts of World Wars One and Two, was laid in the 1950s, and itwould enjoy the financial and operational expertise of hundreds, if notthousands, of dedicated Nazis in the Middle East, North Africa, and around theworld. They were assisted in this endeavor by new converts to Nazism as well asby Arab nationalists, and a growing demographic of Islamist jihadists culledfrom the meeting rooms of the Muslim Brotherhood. Groups like al-Qaeda andJemaah Islamiyyah would not rise to pose a serious threat to the West until thebreakup of the Soviet Union, when Islamists became emboldened by the retreat ofSoviet forces from Aghanistan, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the resultingpower vacuum in the Middle East and elsewhere. The failure of Soviet Communismwas only Phase One of the Nazi-Islamist “third way” strategy, however. Thesecond phase would involve the elimination of the second major super-power fromthe world stage: that bastion of capitalism, the United States of America.In the 1960s the Soviet Union and the United States were locked in a Cold War.This war had two levels of experience: on the one hand it was an ideologicalconflict between two mutually-exclusive points of view on how humanity should beorganized. It was capitalism versus communism, and religion versus atheism. Onthe other hand, this was a power struggle between two military behemoths. Bothsides courted the Arab nations due to their proximity to the oil fields, theSuez Canal, and the land bridge between Europe and Asia.The third factor in the Cold War was the presence of large numbers of Nazimilitary, espionage, and scientific experts in Europe and the Middle East. Thesewere professional anti-Semites who were only too happy to assist Egypt, Syria,and other Arab nations in their intrigues against Israel. Many had beenrecruited through the Gehlen Organization in West Germany, ostensibly underdirection of the CIA. Others made their way to the Middle East through theratlines. In the case of von Leers, he had already escaped to Argentina beforesetting his sights on Egypt. Others took a more direct route, such as AloisBrunner, who went directly from Rome to Cairo and then to Damascus.And then there was Aribert Heim (1914–1992?), or “Doctor Death” as he was knownat the Mauthausen Concentration Camp.An SS doctor very much in the mold of Dr. Mengele, the “Angel of Death” ofAuschwitz, Dr. Heim experimented on live prisoners by injecting their organswith toxic chemicals. An Austrian by birth, Aribert Ferdinand Heim received hisdoctorate in Vienna after studying in Graz (the cities where we also will findfellow Austrian physician Dr. Georg Anton Pöch during the same period, althoughPöch was a generation older). Heim joined the SS only after Austria had becomepart of the Greater German Reich, and rose to the rank of captain by the end ofthe war. As numerous reports confirm, Dr. Heim, in at least one instance,hideously mutilated an 18-year old Jewish man, after which he made a paperweightof the victim's skull.He was captured by the Allies in May of 1945, but was released and permitted tocontinue his medical practice as a gynecologist undisturbed; the authoritieswere unaware of the atrocities he had committed. However, by 1962 he had beenidentified as the Butcher of Mauthausen and a warrant was issued for his arrest.One step ahead of the authorities, and painfully aware of the arrest andconviction of Adolf Eichmann who was executed that year, Heim drove relentlesslythrough Europe to Gibraltar and caught a ferry across the Mediterranean toMorocco. From there, he wound up in Libya and then Egypt, where he converted toIslam, took the name Tarek Hussein Farid, and continued to function as a doctoruntil his alleged death in 1992 in Cairo. Heim was one of the most wanted Nazifugitives in the world at the time, and rumors of his existence—everywhere fromSpain to Latin America—were rife. But it was the discovery in Cairo of abattered suitcase with his documents that proved his flight to Egypt, and whichsatisfied the authorities that Doctor Death was indeed, himself, very much dead.It was rumored that he had assistance from Skorzeny in Spain on his flight toNorth Africa and, indeed, it seems almost impossible to believe that Heim wouldhave made it very far without the connivance of ODESSA. From the falseidentification papers he would have needed to avoid capture by the police whohad been alerted to the arrest warrant issued against him, to the fundsnecessary to survive until he could establish himself (he had left his medicaloffice in the middle of the day without warning when he learned of the warrantby a phone call to his wife), the Brotherhood would have been there to help.Otto Skorzeny was very much part of this network. He ran guns into North Africaand the Middle East through his arms dealership in Spain. For Skorzeny, theallure of the arms trade was not purely economics; he remained a true believer,and assisted those with whom he felt he shared a common ideology. Anti-Communismwas a primary motivating factor; anti-Semitism ran a close second. Eventually,Skorzeny, Remer, Brunner, von Leers, and so many other wanted criminals wound upworking for the Egyptian government of Gamal Abdel Nasser. By 1961 they wereoverseeing the creation of the Egyptian rocket industry, developingsurface-to-surface missiles that were used to target Israel. In much the sameway as Operation Paperclip scientists—made up of former Nazis and many SS men,such as Wehrner von Braun—were recruited by the US Army to develop offensiveweaponry, the Egyptian program was designed to jump-start military technology.It resulted in the development of at least two missile systems by this time: theAl Zafir and the Al Kahir. Believed to have a range of 350 kilometers, the AlZafir was a liquid-fueled rocket capable of delivering a modest 60 kilogramwarhead; the Al Kahir was somewhat larger and modeled after the V-2 rocketsdeveloped at Peenemunde by Nazi scientists during the war, having a greaterrange and greater payload capability. Their only obstacle at the time was theguidance system, and there was some debate over using a wire-guidance systemversus the traditional V-2 type, which was more accurate but considerably moredifficult to design.In the United States, NASA was using Nazi scientists to develop the technologythat would put a man on the moon. In Egypt, Nazi rocket scientists, withessentially the same background as their counterparts working for the US, weredeveloping strategic weapons to be used against Israel. In the middle of allthis frenetic activity—the fascists supporting the fedayeen—were Remer,Skorzeny, Schacht, and Genoud. Given greater impetus by the 1960 kidnapping ofAdolf Eichmann from Argentina by Israeli commandos, his subsequent trial inJerusalem, and inevitable execution in 1962, the Nazis in Egypt felt tremendouspressure to ramp up their operations—not only against Israel, which had justdemonstrated the kind of threat they posed, but against the wide range of theirenemies worldwide. These included Nazi hunters like Simon Wiesenthal to liberalpoliticians, communist insurgents in Latin America and Asia, and theirtraditional foes such as the French, who were trying to hold onto what coloniesthey could in North Africa. Eichmann's defense had been arranged by von Leers,who obtained the financing from his colleague François Genoud. Just where thatfinancing originated forms an integral part of the story of the Hitler Legacy,and for that we have to begin with the Skorzeny Hunting Society.50 [../Text/part0015.html#c6-ft50] As quoted in the memoir of Himmler's masseur,Felix Kersten, Totenkopf und Treue.

Some of these groups are reportedly anti-Americanwhile others are anti-Communist. Confusion existed, and negotiations werereportedly going on for the purpose of agreeing on a policy and selecting aleader. SKORZENY and Lt. RADEL [sic] were listed as representing the Armed SS(Waffen SS?).—(Source: FBI ltr 6 April 1949 to Department of State, subject, “Communist PartyPlans in Germany,” classified CONFIDENTIAL)The above quotation is from a “Summary of Information” report dated 29 March1951 from the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 (US Army intelligence) with thesubject “Otto SKORZENY” and stamped “TOP SECRET CONTROL.” The “Lt. RADEL” isactually a reference to Luftwaffe Ace Hans-Ulrich Rudel, and the twomen—Skorzeny and Rudel—can be said to represent the face of what subsequentinvestigators and authors have identified as ODESSA. They are the “face” ofODESSA in that they were the two men most publically identified as belonging to,or running, the Nazi underground network in the decades after World War II, andthey both were authors of popular books on their wartime experiences. WhereasRudel's role seems more in line with that of a sales and marketing executive forthe post-war Nazi Party, Skorzeny was actively involved in the operationalaspect: running guns, arranging financing, and building bridges between fascistand Nazi sympathizers world-wide to assist in the smooth functioning of theunderground.Rudel was de-nazified at the end of the war, and according to my phone interviewwith one of the people listed in his address book—aviation engineer PierreSprey—who knew Rudel personally, the ace Luftwaffe pilot had never been adie-hard Nazi until the denazification process itself. It was the insistence ofhis Allied interrogators that Nazism represented all that was evil in the world,and their implication that Rudel himself shared in the culpability for all theatrocities committed in the name of the Reich, that soured Rudel completely onthe Allies and made him a kind of “born again” Nazi determined to be what theAllies most despised. Since Rudel had not been indicted for war crimes, he wasfree to roam about the world promoting Nazism and becoming a kind of one-manclearinghouse for communications between Nazis in various parts of the world,many of whom were not as free to travel due to their need for security and thecomplex paper trails they had created to disguise their identities. In thiscapacity, Rudel could carry messages between fugitives, help arrange financialsupport, and keep the spirit alive among the members of the Bruderschaft, the“brotherhood.” His address book is ample evidence of the connections Rudel hadaround the world with both prominent Nazis and sympathizers, and with those lesswell-known or living under pseudonyms. It also reveals the extent of Rudel'sconnections with influential and powerful members of various governments andmulti-national orporations. In fact, his relationship with Pierre Sprey wasbased on just that kind of government contact, for it was due to Rudel'sproficiency as a wartime ace pilot that his knowledge and experience was valuedby the US Defense Department, for which Sprey worked in developing the F-16 andA-10 aircraft in the 1960s and 1970s. Sprey was encouraged to talk aboutaviation with Rudel if it would help aircraft engineers design a better plane.In other words, one could say that for awhile at least Hans-Ulrich Rudel workedfor the Pentagon.In this way, Rudel's address book is a blueprint of ODESSA.In fact, as the above extract from the G-2 document shows, it was believed thatboth Rudel and Skorzeny held leadership positions within the Nazi movement asearly as 1949, a movement comprising former SA and SS men as well as members inthe regular army, the Wehrmacht. In Skorzeny's case especially this is notdifficult to believe.In another memo, this one dated 16 October 1949, with the subject heading“SKORZENY Movement,” it is revealed that something called the Skorzeny HuntingSociety55 [../Text/part0016.html#c7-aft55] had been created as an anti-Communistorganization in Munich composed of former SS men. It was claimed (in another CICmemo dated 16 November 1949) that this movement was formed subsequent toSkorzeny's escape to Latin America and specifically to Sao Paulo, Brazil. Inother words, it was a “stay behind” organization being run by Skorzeny inabsentia.In 1949, Skorzeny was a fugitive having escaped from Allied custody in 1948 (orwas allowed to escape, as rumors abound that he was working for ReinhardGehlen's anti-Soviet spy organization under the auspices of the newly-formedCIA), and US military documents record various rumors concerning his whereaboutsat this time. Argentina and Brazil were among the most popular destinations, butthere was also substantial evidence that Skorzeny had been in Madrid, organizinga paramilitary force there with Franco's blessing.In a CIA memo dated May 1, 1955, from the Assistant Director of the CIA to theFBI, it was reported that Skorzeny had made contact with former Nazi generals inGermany, “arranging for the removal of up to 200,000 men to Spain in the eventof war. He is reported to have claimed to have United States approval andsupport for this project.” In other words, as the Cold War began to heat up andit appeared as if there would be a shooting war over the fate of Berlin and WestGermany with the Soviets, Skorzeny was arranging to salvage a small army of200,000 German soldiers under command of Nazi officers, and claimed he had theblessing of the United States to do so.Where would these 200,000 men have come from? Is this figure in any way relatedto the “Skorzeny Hunting Society” or whatever other name you wish to call theextensive stay-behind network in place in Germany and Austria (and parts ofEastern Europe) as early as the winter of 1944 and the spring of 1945? And wouldthis organization really have the support of the US government? It is certainlya possibility, especially when one considers that the Gehlen Organizationcomprised of former Nazi spies was now working for CIA. Would it be so hard tobelieve that ODESSA—or whatever name you wish to call it—was (at least at times)working on behalf of US interests in Europe, especially when those interestsdovetailed so perfectly with Nazi interests? An ODESSA network of trained,blooded, anti-Communist fighters spread out around the world—and in politicaldanger spots like Southern and Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Africa (and,as we will see, Asia)— would be an ideal, and ultimately deniable, resource forthe Cold Warriors in Washington, DC.Recent academic scholarship56 [../Text/part0016.html#c7-aft56] on the subject ofODESSA has tended to downplay its existence as well as its significance. Thereis no doubt that discussions of ODESSA in the 1950s and 1960s tended todramatize if not romanticize the concept, ascribing to it the status of a kindof James Bond villain: well-organized, structured, centrally-controlled. It wasthis same characterization that was used to describe Al-Qaeda in the early yearsof its existence—as a kind of super-underground network of robot terroriststaking their orders directly from the mysterious Osama bin Laden in hiswell-fortified underground bunker.However, we have come to understand that the strength of Al-Qaeda is to be foundmostly in its moral leadership rather than in its day-to-day operations. Thereare a number of what are known as “Al-Qaeda affiliates” scattered around theworld, such as Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb, Al-Qaeda in Yemen, and sisterorganizations such as Jemaah Islamiyyah in Indonesia and Malaysia,Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan, etc. This lack of centrality has not altered theWest's determination to subdue if not eradicate these groups; and whilespecialists understand there are operational and strategic differences betweenthem—as well as cultural and linguistic differences—they are essentially workingfrom the same set of readily-identifiable ideas that attract the identical typeof recruit worldwide.The same is true of what we have been calling ODESSA. The strength of thisnetwork is in its ability to morph into different manifestations in differentcountries and at different levels of society without losing sight of its centralmission, which is the survival of Nazi philosophy as well as the survival of theNazis themselves. As mentioned previously, there is nothing “neo” aboutso-called “neo-Nazism” if the leaders of the movement are all members of theoriginal Nazi Party and held various ranks in the Nazi government, the military,the SS, and the espionage services such as the Abwehr, the Gestapo and the SD.There is a continuity of personnel, financing, and ideology that enabled thesemen to shift their theater of operations from western Europe to eastern Europe,the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. Further, there existed—and stillexists—a support structure of sympathizers and political operatives that enablesthe survival of these individuals and their philosophy, transferring theirideals to a younger generation capable of promoting the Nazi message in newmedia with subtle alterations of “spin” and, in addition, willing to commit theviolent acts necessary to demonstrate their dedication to the cause. In thisthey are no different from the support systems and methods enjoyed by theIslamist jihadists.The Nazi underground is, and was, composed of various seemingly disparateelements. No discussion of what we have been calling ODESSA is complete withoutalso mentioning Stille Hilfe, HIAG, Die Spinne, the Amsterdam Group, theBruderschaft, and other groups with varying individual missions but with aunified dream of protecting and resurrecting the Reich.Stille Hilfe (or “Silent Help”) was the name given to an aid organization begunabout 1946 in Germany to aid SS prisoners of war. In 1951 it was officiallyorganized around the personality of Helene Elizabeth, Princess von Isenburg, anaristocrat with extensive connections among the financial and military elite ofGermany who would be inclined to assist convicted Nazis by monetary and othermeans. One of the founding members was an assistant to convicted and executedwar criminal Ernst Kaltenbrunner, SS-Ober-sturmmbannführer Heinrich Malz, aswell as a chief of the RSHA (Reich Security Main Office) SS-StandartenführerWilhelm Spengler. The full name of the organization was Die Stille Hilfe fürKriegsgefangene und Internierte or “Silent Help for Prisoners of War and theInterned,” which seemed innocuous enough until it was realized that theprisoners and interned were almost all, without exception, former SS.That there was a political agenda behind Stille Hilfe became more obvious intheir association with Holocaust deniers, and eventually with the NaumannCircle. Dr. Werner Naumann was briefly Josef Goebbels's successor as head of thePropaganda Ministry after the suicide of Goebbels and his wife and the murder oftheir six children at the Berlin Bunker. He had sought to create a Nazi Party inAustria after the end of the war and intrigued with various underground groupsin order to infiltrate the Austrian government with his Gauleiterkreis, orCircle of Gauleiters. This circle was broken up by British intelligence in 1953,and its failure to take over the Austrian government may be one of the reasonsour Dr. Georg Anton Pöch, himself an Austrian Nazi who had served with theSalzburg Gau, decided to finally leave Europe in 1954.Stille Hilfe went on to form alliances with important members of the Naziunderground, including Leon Degrelle and Manfred Roeder, as well as with theslightly insane Florentine Rost van Tonningen, the widow of a Nazi officialaccused of stealing a fortune in Dutch gold and valuables, and who wassubsequently “suicided” while in Allied custody. Stille Hilfe was also involvedin movements to free Klaus Barbie and Erich Priebke, among others, but by farits most famous member is Gudrun Burwitz.Burwitz is the daughter of SS chief Heinrich Himmler, and is sometimes referredto as the “Nazi princess.” Her efforts run the gamut from arranging legalrepresentation for war criminals, to providing homes for them when they havebecome too old to care for themselves. For instance, she has been prominent inthe attempt to keep Dutch war criminal Klaas Faber from being extradited to theNetherlands to stand trial.Stille Hilfe may seem almost benign when compared to the other manifestations ofthe underground. HIAG or Hilfsgemeinschaft auf Gegenseitigkeit der Angehörigender ehemaligen Waffen-SS (“Mutual Help Association of Former Waffen-SS Members”)was founded about the same time as Stille Hilfe, but in this case bySS-Brigadeführer Otto Kumm (1909–2004) who led the SS Division LiebstandarteAdolf Hitler during the war. Denazified after the war, Kumm became a businessmanand organizer of HIAG. HIAG was created in order to provide financial assistanceto SS members who, because of the fact that they had been declared a criminalorganization, were not able to collect their pensions. Ostensibly, HIAG was onlythere to provide economic relief for its members, but its ranks included men whohad been convicted of war crimes and it was perceived by the West Germangovernment as a Nazi organization. It was eventually disbanded in 1992.Die Spinne is another case entirely.This was the creation of Otto Skorzeny (he of the Hunting Society) and it leadsus into the deeper, darker world of ODESSA. More than any other singleindividual, Skorzeny is the entry-point to the world of the Nazi underground andthe links between resurgent Nazism and what we are calling Islamist jihadism,with the connective tissue of the dictatorships of Latin America: first stop formost of the fleeing Nazi fugitives. Die Spinne and its offshoots provides uswith a glimpse into the interface between Western intelligence agencies andtheir ideological conflict with Communism on the one hand, and with experiencedand dedicated anti-Communists on the other. I have written elsewhere that thedeal America made with Nazi scientists under the rubric of Operation Paperclip,and with Nazi spies under the rubric of the Gehlen Organization, was a Faustianpact with the Devil: the point at which America bartered its soul in exchangefor a short-lived sense of security. The deal that American and other Westernintelligence agencies and political leaderships made with the brutal presidentsof Latin American and Asian nations in the 1950s, 1960s and through the 1980s isa codicil to that pact. What the American government could not effectivelypromote within its own borders—wholesale suppression of any opposition on amassive and unapologetic scale—it succeeded in accomplishing throughout LatinAmerica, and by extension into Southeast Asia with the support of Marcos in thePhilippines and Soeharto in Indonesia, among others. The breakup of the SovietUnion has been revealing—little by little—the extent of this complicity—asextreme right dictatorships have fallen through lack of purpose, and extremistreligious groups have risen in response.Otto Skorzeny was Hitler's favorite commando and a person upon whom the Führercame to rely increasingly in the days after the attempted assassination of July1944. Skorzeny was a can-do commander, the famous rescuer of Hitler comrade andItalian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini in a daring mountain-top glider attackthat made headlines around the world. Skorzeny's dedication to the Reich and hiswillingness to undertake the most dangerous missions on behalf of his Führermade him an indispensable servant of Nazism and he remained that way to the endof his days. The organization he founded after the war—Die Spinne, or TheSpider—spread its web from Franco's Spain to Peron's Argentina, from Adenauer'sGermany to Nasser's Egypt. Originally designed to help more than 600 SS andother war criminals to flee Europe after the war for the relative safety ofright-wing dictatorships around the world, Die Spinne became the foundation uponwhich Skorzeny was able to create an arms-smuggling empire. Arms dealers are anessential aspect of this story, and we will come across another suchbusinessman—the Indonesian prince Soeryo Goeritno—later on, in a similarcapacity. Skorzeny and his colleague François Genoud were able to run gunsthroughout Europe and to the Middle East and North Africa with impunity. InLatin America, they were assisted by other members of Skorzeny's brotherhood,men like the “Butcher of Lyon” Klaus Barbie (operating under the pseudonym KlausAltmann) in Bolivia, Freddy Schwend (who developed Operation Bernhard during thewar, an attempt by the Nazis to mass-produce counterfeit British pounds todestabilize the global currency) in Peru, and the cooperative pedophile PaulSchäfer of Colonia Dignidad and Operation Condor, in Chile: a direct beneficiaryof the Skorzeny arms trade.By 1950 Skorzeny was residing in Franco's Spain, operating Die Spinnelong-distance (the headquarters of its Austrian mission was in Gmunden, Austriawhile Skorzeny remained in Madrid). By 1960, he was actively involved in theglobal arms trade, working with groups that eventually were revealed to besupplying Arab nationalists in North Africa and the Levant, as well as fascistgovernments in Latin America and South Africa. He was an agent of ALFA (theSpanish arms company), and eventually joined (or co-founded, the history is alittle murky) the German armaments company Merex along with former Wehrmachtofficer Major Gerhard Mertins. In that capacity Skorzeny would become involvedwith such infamous right-wing terrorists as the Italian Stefano della Chiaie,who carried out bombings and assassinations on behalf of European and LatinAmerican dictatorships and underground terror cells long before there was anal-Qaeda or a Taliban. As the Rudel address book reveals, this network includedeveryone from notorious Swiss financier François Genoud (who bankrolled manyArabist and Nazi plots), to Klaus Barbie (who was running the secret police inBolivia and was a major player in the Operation Condor network of spies,assassins and gun-runners, whose Chilean node was Colonia Dignidad), toPresident Stroessner in Paraguay and the Peronists in Argentina, as well as withLeon Degrelle—the Belgian Nazi who maintained a circle of supporters long afterthe war and was another node in the underground network—and North American Nazissuch as Ernst Zundel in Canada, a Holocaust denier and publisher of pro-Nazitracts. The far flung Rudel/Skorzeny network included Savitri Devi, whom Rudeladmired and befriended. Devi was a fanatic Nazi ideologue, the bridge betweenthe Hindu-style Nazism (with Hitler as Kalki Avatar) of former Chileanambassador to Austria and India, Miguel Serrano, and the more mainstream Nazismof Degrelle, Skorzeny, and Barbie.In addition, Skorzeny was on intimate terms with Hitler's financial guru,Hjalmar Schacht, who plays an important role in the survival of Nazism, and inthe inspiration for a new, global, jihad against the West. The Skorzeny-Schachtrelationship cannot be over-emphasized, since Schacht had always been at painsto present himself as an anti-Nazi—pointing to his brief imprisonment foralleged involvement in the Hitler assassination plot as evidence of his bonafides. However, this episode has been criticized extensively by investigatorswho see it as a deliberate attempt to “de-nazify” Schacht in anticipation of thefall of the Reich, so that he would be free to carry on his mission ofresurrecting the German economy after the war.When Skorzeny was on the run from Allied forces after his escape from custody in1948, he hid at the farm of one Ilse Luthje, or the Countess Finck vonFinckenstein to give her noble designation. Ilse Luthje (1919–2002) was aniece57 [../Text/part0016.html#c7-aft57] of Hjalmar Schacht. She and Skorzenyeventually developed a relationship that led to marriage, with Ilse moving toSkorzeny's villa in Spain. The two dedicated Nazis—Skorzeny and Schacht—were nowrelated by marriage, as well as united by the desire to rebuild Germany, defeatCommunism, and restore the Nazi Party to its former glory. While Schacht workedto create a global financial network that would enable sympathetic regimes tocollaborate in this vision, Skorzeny worked to create a global military andespionage network that would ensure the original Hitlerian mission would not beabandoned. His partner, Hans-Ulrich Rudel, would move among the faithfulworldwide, raising their spirits, making speeches, keeping the flame alive,acting as a fixer when necessary, passing information between the comrades, anddoing what he could to protect them from the security forces of those nationsstill interested—due to political or public pressure—in apprehending warcriminals and bringing them to trial.With Merex, it would seem Skorzeny found the perfect vehicle for his mission.Merex was selling weapons worldwide, with Gerhard Mertins cutting deals withregimes in Pakistan, Egypt, and elsewhere with reckless abandon. Skorzeny'scontacts with Latin American dictators and generals provided Merex with a largermarket, and Hans Ulrich-Rudel (who lived in South America from 1948–1953) was anessential piece of the puzzle. He had excellent relations with PresidentStroessner of Paraguay, among others. In fact, it was Rudel who convincedStroessner to give Dr. Josef Mengele—the “Angel of Death” ofAuschwitz—Paraguayan citizenship, thus permitting the fugitive to live free fromdiscovery and extradition until his death in Brazil in 1979. As Rudel's addressbook indicates, he was on excellent terms with many Paraguayan notablesincluding politicians and military men.As for Mengele, the “Angel of Death” once paid a visit to Colonia Dignidad inChile as more recent investigation has revealed. A few months before Mengele'sdeath in 1979, the author himself was in Chile attempting to get information onthe Colony when he was detained by men acting under orders from Colony founderSchäfer. What the author did not know at the time was that Gerhard Mer-tins ofMerex had formed a Freundeskreis or “Circle of Friends” of his own, this onebased in Germany to help support Colonia Dignidad. That same year, Mertins madea deposition in a German court in which he denied that there had been anywrongdoing at Colonia Dignidad.Ten years later, the Colony was raided by the Chilean security forces undernewly-elected President Patricio Aylwin. The hideous truth was allowed to emergeof torture, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and the utilization of the Colony as asafe house for fleeing Nazis, including Mengele. It was also revealed thatColonia Dignidad was an important node in the communications network ofOperation Condor: the multinational effort by Chile, Argentina, and other SouthAmerican dictatorships to run guns, launder money, assassinate politicalopponents in the Americas and elsewhere in the world, and to develop weapons ofmass destruction such as chemical and biological weapons.This remote Andes mountain estate—with its barbed wire fences and guard towers,designed after the ones at the concentration camps was just another element ofODESSA, albeit one of its most elaborate. It had hosted Skorzeny, Rudel,Mengele, and many other notables—both before the author had inadvisably paid ita visit and long after. Its utilization as a laboratory for the manufacture ofWMDs is proven: there is photographic, video, and eyewitness testimony to thefact.58 [../Text/part0016.html#c7-aft58] Yet there has never been any outcry byWestern intelligence or military experts over this; never any condemnation fromthe White House or 10 Downing Street; no slide presentations before the UNSecurity Council.How much of this information and lethal capability was shared with Skorzeny'sand Rudel's jihadist counterparts (and clients) in Afghanistan, the Middle East,or Pakistan?We know, for instance, that Mertins tried to sell Saddam Hussein Chinese-madeweaponry during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. He had been selling weapons toEgypt since the 1950s, when he was working with Skorzeny to prop up first theNaguib and then the Nasser regime, hiring Nazis as mercenaries and instructorsof the Egyptian secret police in the humiliating aftermath of the 1948 waragainst Israel. By the 1960s, he was already heavily involved with suchnotorious American arms dealers as Interarms—selling Luftwaffe aircraft toVenezuela, and selling weapons to both sides in the India-Pakistan conflict in1966. Eventually he became more deeply involved in South America, and inparticular Chile under the dictatorship of President Pinochet. The story ofMerex is also the story of Skorzeny and Rudel—the Hunting Society—and of theways and means by which a Nazi ideology found new life in the right-wingdictatorships of the Middle East and Latin America. And Gerhard Mertins—closefriend of SS General Otto Remer and true believer in the Nazi cause—continuedthe war against communism, liberalism, and the Jews in a business suit insteadof a uniform, ensuring that his friends had all the weapons and ammunition theyneeded to continue the fight on a dozen different fronts.Skorzeny wasn't satisfied with just Merex, however. As entrepreneurial as ever,he founded a series of other companies with dubious pedigrees: such as thePaladin Group. Based in Alicante, Spain it was designed to provide paramilitarytraining and support to a variety of causes around the world. Foremost amongthese tasks was tutoring security personnel in Egypt and Argentina, and for thishe hired as manager one Dr. Gerhard Harmut von Schubert, who formerly worked forGoebbels's Propaganda Ministry (like Johann von Leers and Werner Naumann).Paladin Group also provided logistical support for the Palestine Liberationmovement. In addition, Skorzeny worked with the H. S. Lucht Corporation, anotherof the ubiquitous “import-export” firms used to provide cover for unsavorytrade, headquartered in Dusseldorf and directed by Werner Naumann himself.One should not think for a moment, however, that Skorzeny—like Mertins—put on abusiness suit and eschewed the life of violence and terror he had known duringthe war. There were still enemies to be fought, and traitors to be discoveredand dealt-with. One such case involved the hapless pair of Prof. Werner Heydeand Friedrich Tillmann.Heyde was the chief of a neurological clinic at Würzberg during the war. In1941, he transferred more than 200 Jews from Dachau to a mental institute atBernberg so he could give them lethal injections. He was one of only fourpsychiatrists selected by the Nazis to go to the camps and choose Jewishprisoners to be sent to these “nursing homes,” where they would be murdered.Tillmann, on the other hand, provided the ambulances that would transport these“patients” to their final destination.Due to their vulnerability as a result of their crimes, they were suspected bySkorzeny of talking to Dr. Fritz Bauer, the famous prosecutor of Nazi warcriminals, about the inner workings of ODESSA.They were both found murdered on the same day, February 13, 1964, before theycould give their testimony to Bauer.In Egypt, however, it was a different story.As information was revealed in the 1950s about the presence of large numbers ofNazi scientists (estimates range up to 450) in Egypt for the rocket program, andequally large numbers of Nazi military and security personnel, individual Naziswere identified as part of this program and attacked (presumably by Mossadagents). One of these was Heinz Krug, who was believed to be sending technicalinformation to Egypt from his office at United Arab Airlines in Germany, and whowas kidnapped and killed by Israeli agents. Skorzeny's response to this was totake Jewish hostages each time a Nazi was attacked. At that time there were anumber of Jewish communities in Egypt, and Skorzeny had his pick of whom tosnatch.By 1965, however, Nasser had begun making overtures to East Germany and theSoviet Union. American support for Egypt—and covert American support for theNazi presence in Egypt—was dwindling. Skorzeny, however, as an adherent of the“third way,” saw no issue with dealing Soviet and East German arms to Egypt ifthe American and West German sources dried up. Either way he made money and hiscause was furthered. During this period he brokered millions of dollars' worthof arms from Communist-bloc sources to clients in the Middle East and elsewhere.Mertins, as well, had no problem in selling weapons to both India and Pakistan.Arms dealers cannot afford to be too choosy. But the true faith was neverabandoned; it may have had to adapt its outward form to reflect newenvironmental factors, but it remained true to its core beliefs, and that iswhere the problem lies. If we mistake the form for the function, we will belulled into a false sense of security when the form changes, not realizing thefunction is the same.Another key figure in the underworld of the global Nazi network—and close friendof Skorzeny, Rudel, and Schacht—was the Swiss financier and former Abwehr agentFrançois Genoud (1915–1996). Although a Swiss citizen, Genoud was a devoted Nazito the end of his days, like his colleagues. The difference lay in Genoud'spost-war profession as a financier. It has largely been accepted that the fundsto which Genoud had access were secret accounts held in Swiss banks by Nazileaders and fugitives. He managed to parlay what was a considerable fortune intoeven greater wealth through a series of shrewd investments, as well as whatmight be called “protection money” from a variety of sources. He was theliterary executor of the works of Adolf Hitler, Martin Bormann, and JosefGoebbels, among other claims to fame, and collaborated with the Holocaust denierand historian David Irving (whose name also appears in the Rudel address book,along with Genoud and Skorzeny). As the post-war decades progressed, Genoudwould become a key figure in the financing of Arab liberation movementsthroughout North Africa and the Levant.There is a British Intelligence document dated 20 Nov 53, entitled “FrancoisGENOUD” [sic], which contains some background on this mysterious Swiss. It notesthat he is the literary executor for both Hitler and Bormann and “possesses manyNazi documents.” He is described as being in contact with British fascist SirOswald Mosley at the time, as well as with Paul Dickopf (who would eventuallybecome head of West Germany's equivalent of the FBI, the BKA, despite hisimpeccable Nazi resume; indeed he was even for awhile head of Interpol like hispredecessor Ernst Kaltenbrunner). Genoud worked for Dickopf in the Abwehr, andhis credentials as an Abwehr agent are referenced in the British document, aswell as his connection with the Naumann Circle and with one Frau Lucht ofDusseldorf, which indicates the H.S. Lucht firm of Dusseldorf managed by WernerNaumann.Prior to the war, Genoud had been a member of the National Front, a pro-Naziorganization in Switzerland. In 1936, he traveled to Palestine and met with theGrand Mufti Hajj Amin al-Husseini himself, and the two developed a life-longfriendship. Once war broke out, Genoud moved to Berlin and met al-Husseiniagain, becoming very involved in the Palestinian independence schemes of thepro-Nazi Mufti.In 1954, he began financing the Algerian Liberation Front, an organization towhich he already had been supplying weapons after meeting members of the Frontin Egypt. In 1955, he created AraboAfrika, another “import-export” company, toassist the Algerian cause and to provide a cover for anti-Israel propaganda. In1958, he went on to create a medium for the transfer and laundering of cash forAlgerian, Moroccan, and Tunisian liberation groups—the Arab Commercial Bank—withthe indispensable Hjalmar Schacht as a partner. By 1960, he added thePalestinian cause to his resume, and in particular financed the defense ofmembers of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) who blew upan an El Al airliner in Zurich. This involvement in providing expensive defenseteams extended to the trials of Klaus Barbie and Adolf Eichmann, with Genoudgenerously supplying whatever funds were needed to obtain the best possiblerepresentation.In 1969, he put members of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) incontact with Nazi personnel who would provide training in weapons, sabotage, andinfiltration techniques. (This was the same period—from about 1967–1969—that theauthor made contact with the PLO at their offices in New York City, having firstdealt with a German woman who was their receptionist.) Genoud was a serioussupporter of Palestinian liberation throughout his life and, according to authorPeter Wyden, was also a confidant and mentor of Ahmed Huber, the Swiss supporterof Nazi and Islamist causes. Huber also created his own bank in order to financethese missions. He is mentioned in the Introduction to this book.If Hjalmar Schacht was “Hitler's Banker,” Genoud was the banker of the Nazi andArab resistance movements in Europe and the Middle East. He was a friend of thenotorious assassin “Carlos the Jackal”—Ilich Ramirez Sanchez—and assisted theterrorist in several of his missions. He also helped financially support theAyatollah Khomeini during the latter's exile in France during the regime of theShah of Iran. Genoud and Schacht were partners in many of these ventures, andGenoud represented Schacht's financial interests where feasible—occasionallyhelping the older man make sound investments, or in brokering deals between Arabnations and the European firms that were in Schacht's comfort zone. That bothmen were instrumental in providing financial and logistical support to ODESSA isnot in question; but they extended that assistance to ODESSA's natural allies,the Islamist resistance groups that were founded to remove all traces of theirformer colonial masters in North Africa and the Levant, and to wage anideological war—a global jihad—against Israel and the West, under the guise ofreligious fervor.In the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001 many forget that a wave ofterror had been building since the end of World War II. Assassinations andbombings had been taking place throughout Europe, North Africa, the Middle East,and Latin America. These were directed at Communists and suspected Communistsympathizers. At the same time, groups like the PLO and the PFLP were runningterror operations against Israel. Gradually, it has been revealed that much ofthe financing for these operations came from money under the control of FrançoisGenoud: money that had been deposited in Swiss banks since the early 1940s. Thesource of Genoud's funds were never in doubt to those who worked with him; itwas only after increasing scrutiny by the Swiss, American, and other authoritiesin the 1990s that the extent of Genoud's control over Nazi gold was becomingknown. Not all of ODESSA's financing came from these accounts, of course.Skorzeny had access to mysterious sources of funds as well, with rumors linkinghim to Juan and Evita Peron of Argentina and the gold that was shipped to BuenosAires to help pave the way for a wave of Nazi fugitives after the war. Rumors ofthe wealth allegedly secreted by Martin Bormann also surface from time to time,and Skorzeny was even suspected of having been involved with the Great TrainRobbery of 1963.59 [../Text/part0016.html#c7-aft59]As more of these “rumors” become substantiated in the ongoing declassificationof intelligence files, the full scope of the problem will become known. Theexplosion of oil revenues in the Middle East was one possible source of fundingfor terrorist operations and groups, but by no means the only source. Arabgovernments had their own agendas, and often they did not include whole-heartedsupport for the liberation movements—as the very idea of a national liberationmovement challenged their own hegemony. The Palestinian issue was allowed tosimmer on indefinitely. The Western governments were wooing the Arabgovernments, keeping them out of the reach of the Soviets. The Shah of Iran wasinstalled as the ruler of that ancient kingdom, and the Ayatollahs bided theirtime. Saddam Hussein was America's ally against the Ayatollahs when the Shah wasdeposed. The Soviets were ousted from Afghanistan with the assistance of the CIAand the mujahideen. It seemed like politics as usual in the Middle East. Andthen the Soviet Union fell, and everything changed.In 1996, Swiss authorities were becoming more aware that Genoud and hiscolleagues had been financing terror groups worldwide for decades, and that theSwiss banker and former Abwehr agent knew where the Nazi gold had been stashed.Genoud also knew how it had been used to create the largest terror organizationin the world—known by its various names as ODESSA, Die Spinne, the Bruderschaft,Condor, etc. Increasingly aware of the danger he faced, Genoud decided to takehis own life.And this he did, on May 30, 1996.The Skorzeny Hunting Society had been decimated by that time. Rudel died in1982. Skorzeny himself had died in Spain much earlier, in 1975. Schacht, fiveyears before that. It seemed as if the old networks were being rolled up. Thesongs unsung. The flags unflown.

Eisenhower, in a letter written to Edward Elson of thePresbyterian Church, July 31, 1958.The President said he thought we should do everything possible to stress the‘holy war’ aspect ... Mr. Dulles commented that if the Arabs have a ‘holy war’they would want it to be against Israel. The President recalled, however, thatSaud, after his visit here, had called on all Arabs to oppose Communism.—General A.J. Goodpaster, Staff Secretary and Defense Liaison Officer toPresident Eisenhower, “Memorandum of Conference with the President” datedSeptember 7, 1957.Max Oppenheim invented the concept of global jihad in order to convince theOttoman Turks to side with Germany against Great Britain, France, and Russia inthe First World War. Nazi Germany renewed that idea during the Second World War,with the assistance of Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. Itdidn't work either time.Now the American president, who more than any other represented the Alliedforces in their defeat of Nazi Germany when he was Supreme Allied Commander, hadrevisited the old idea once again. Ironically, the only common denominatorbetween the First World War, the Second World War, and the Cold War was thesingular presence of Russia as the adversary in all three conflicts. GodlessCommunism would be opposed by fanatical Muslims intent on a jihad ... or thatwas the idea, anyway.In the 1950s a number of Muslims of various ethnic backgrounds were livingscattered throughout Europe. Some of them had fought with the Nazis against theSoviets; others had been refugees or displaced persons, victims of the shiftingborders that take place during armed conflicts. There were a number ofostensibly Christian organizations that had been organized around ethnic linesto oppose Soviet Communism, and the Russian Orthodox Church was perhaps the mostfamous. Composed of White Russians clustered around memories of the Czaristaristocracy, the Russian Orthodox Church had been largely pro-Nazi during thewar, as had been the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and to some extent the RomanianOrthodox Church. All of these churches had been penetrated to greater or lesserdegree by American, and other Western, intelligence services. In addition, theRoman Catholic Church had provided escape routes and false identity papers toNazi fugitives to enable them to escape to other parts of the world and carry onthe fight against Communism. Some of the Protestant denominations were alsoinvolved. As the Cold War developed through the 1950s, many other religiousgroups found themselves acting as fronts for intelligence operations, or at thevery least cooperating with CIA and FBI in their anti-Communist activities. Theauthor himself has personal and direct knowledge of some of these, dating to hisinvolvement with questionable Orthodox churches in the 1960s and 1970s.It would seem to reason, then, that other religious organizations would beapproached with an eye to using them as tools against the Soviet adversary. Aswe will see in the following chapter, Buddhism was not immune from thismanipulation; but for now our attention should be directed towards Islam.One can sense the frustration that must have been felt by American military andintelligence chiefs that greater use could not be made of Muslims in the effortto isolate and undermine the Soviet Union. After all, there was a large andgrowing Muslim population in the territories claimed by Russia, such asTurkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, etc. If the Muslim populationsin these Central Asian lands were to rise up against their Soviet overlords,then the Cold War would be over quickly, or so it was believed.What we have called the cynical manipulation of religion by the Germanintelligence and military organs was a strategy inherited by the Americans afterthe defeat of Germany. Sincere spiritual sentiments were to be ruthlesslyexploited once again, but this time with devastating consequences: what is knownin espionage jargon as “blowback.”Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ian Johnson reveals the depth of the insanityin his book A Mosque in Munich: Nazis, the CIA, and the Rise of the MuslimBrotherhood in the West. The subtitle says it all. The CIA inherited a raft ofpro-Nazi Muslims who were stranded in Europe in the decade after the end of theSecond World War and decided to use them to fight Russia. In order to do so, CIAfound itself financing Muslim Brotherhood activities in Europe, including amosque in Munich that would become the center of intrigues against the West.Ironically, of course, it was Munich where the Nazi Party was born. (And it wasin the Hamburg, Germany, apartment of Mohamed Atta that the final details andmain participants of the September 11, 2001 attacks would be determined.)In 1953, President Eisenhower's support was solicited for an important meetingthat would take place in September of that year at Princeton University. Themeeting was to be an Islamic Colloquium. Leading Islamic scholars from aroundthe world would be attending, including one Said Ramadan, “Delegate of theMuslim Brotherhood.”The history of the Muslim Brotherhood is too long to cover in any detail here.There have been numerous studies of the Brotherhood ranging from the purelyacademic to fringe conspiracy theories, but a synopsis is in order.The Muslim Brotherhood—or The Society of the Muslim Brothers or al-Ikhwanal-Muslimun—was founded in 1928, in Egypt, by reformer and Islamic scholarHassan al-Banna. The original idea behind the Brotherhood was to promote apan-Islamic message in the face of what was perceived to be European oppression.Egypt in 1928 was still a British protectorate, had been since 1882, and wouldremain so until 1953 when General Naguib was elected the first President of theRepublic. He would be replaced by Nasser a year later. Thus, at the time of theformation of the Muslim Brotherhood in the town of Ismailia, the country wasstill occupied by British troops. Close by, in Palestine, there were riotsagainst the British presence in that territory and against the perceivedinvasion by European Jews as promised by the Balfour Declaration. Hence, as theGrand Mufti of Jerusalem was agitating against both the British and the Jews inPalestine, Hassan al-Banna was urging a return to Islamic values in Egypt inorder to counteract the effects of Western decadence.The Brotherhood managed to attract thousands of followers very early on. Itbuilt schools and hospitals and ran support systems for the poor and thedispossessed. It spoke out openly against colonialism and chided Muslims forhaving abandoned the faith. Eventually, al-Banna and al-Husseini would joinforces, each with his own agenda but seeing in the other a potential ally in thefight against the European powers.To be sure this was a movement based on narrow interpretations of Islamicteachings and laws. Al-Banna's desire was to reinstate the Islamic caliphatefrom the Middle East to Indonesia, creating an Islamic empire based on religion,rather than the German or British or Dutch colonial empires based on materialismand profit. Gradually, the slogan of the Muslim Brotherhood changed from therelatively benign, “Believers are Brothers” to the more insistent, “Allah is ourobjective; the Qur'an is our Constitution; the Prophet is our leader; jihad isour way; death for the sake of Allah is our wish.” The reference to jihad anddeath is instructive and has been interpreted to mean that the MuslimBrotherhood advocates violence. Brotherhood leaders deny this, and have come outagainst violence from time to time; the problem is that Brotherhood members alsohave taken it upon themselves to get involved in violent struggles in Egypt,Palestine, and elsewhere. The Palestinian political party in Gaza that has beenlisted as a terror organization—Hamas—is staffed by members of the Brotherhood,and of course there are Brotherhood members in the PLO, and other groups thatare engaged in violent confrontation with those whom they deem the enemies ofIslam, most notably the Jews. Ironically, Osama bin Laden criticized the MuslimBrotherhood. He said he did not believe they were true to the intentions of itsfounder; i.e., they were not violent or radical enough. This apparent rupturebetween al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood led several experts in intelligencematters relating to Middle Eastern affairs to decide that it might be advisableto side with the Brotherhood against al-Qaeda; and this has led to manymisunderstandings and subsequent controversy in the United States.Before the Brotherhood became synonymous (in some circles) with terrorism, theywere considered politically important enough for the United States Government totake them seriously and woo their support against the godless Communists. Hencethe Islamic Colloqium at Princeton University in 1953, and the meeting betweenPresident Eisenhower and Said Ramadan.As noted above, Eisenhower was convinced that the idea of holy war or jihadcould be used to mutual benefit by the Arabs and the American administration asa way of containing Soviet intentions in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, aswell as the Middle East. He believed he had an understanding with King ibn Saudof Saudi Arabia in this regard, not realizing that the Saudi royal house was notthat influential among the Arabs of North Africa and the Levant, who had theirhands full with Israel on the one side, the Russians on the other, and theAmericans on still another. Saud's relationship to the West was largely that ofa mutual admiration society: the Americans admired Arabia's oil reserves and theSaudis admired America's money. It was—and remains—a “special relationship,” outof all proportion to what is actually taking place on the ground.In the 1950s, however, the Cold War was the determining factor in America'sforeign policy. Everything was predicated on the balance of power betweenAmerica and the Soviet Union, and nothing was left to chance, each sidejockeying for position, trying to get the best of the other without actuallygoing to war. Resistance movements in Central Asia against Soviet authority wereone way to distract the Russians and divert resources away from strengtheningtheir hold over Eastern Europe. The Brotherhood had its own problems, however,for it was banned in Egypt in 1948 for having participated in a series ofbombings and assassination attempts against government leaders. Hassan al-Bannahimself was assassinated in what was believed to be retaliation for theassassination of the Egyptian prime minister. However, within the Brotherhoodthere existed a secret cell of army officers who were plotting against thegovernment. In 1952, the leader of this secret cell— Gamal AbdelNasser—participated in the coup that overthrew the Egyptian government and putNaguib on the throne as Egypt's first President. Ironically, it would be Nasserwho would ban the Muslim Brotherhood yet again, ostensibly for having attemptedto assassinate him. Thousands of Brotherhood members were rounded up at thattime, and many were tortured and killed. Others fled to Saudi Arabia, where theywere welcomed as a kind of Islamic intelligentsia in a land that was in direneed of teachers and educators. This circumstance would backfire on the Kingdomin later years, when it was realized that the Brotherhood had a stranglehold onthe entire educational system in the country. By 2014, the Saudi governmentdeclared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization.However, in 1953, the Muslim Brotherhood had branches in most Islamic countriesoutside of Egypt, including even in Shi'ite Iran. They were a force to bereckoned with, easily the only pan-Islamic (if not pan-Arab) organization in theworld, including a presence in Europe. If the Eisenhower administration couldget the support of the Brotherhood, then between the two of them they couldeasily upset Soviet designs wherever the Brotherhood had chapters. As areligious as well as a political organization, the Brotherhood had connectionswithin the Soviet territories that could be exploited for intelligence purposes,including espionage and sabotage. The wide variety of languages and ethnicitiesmeant another level of complexity, but this was one that CIA intended to exploitthrough their European operations—specifically using Muslim Brotherhood membersto create print and broadcast media directed against the Soviet Union, andemphasizing the atheistic and immoral nature of Communism.This was essentially what CIA was already doing with their Christian networksand their infiltration of the World Council of Churches, the WorldAnti-Communist League, the League of Captive Nations, and so many others. Itdidn't require much imagination to port the Christian strategy onto aMuslim-based agenda. Some of this was done through Radio Liberty, a CIA asset inEurope that beamed pro-Islamic and anti-Communist programming into the SovietUnion. The CIA operation utilizing Muslims—and specifically members of theMuslim Brotherhood—was run by an agent named Bob Dreher. The US government feltthat helping to build an Islamic Center in Munich would attract the “right kind”of Muslims to their cause, and to that end, a mosque was built that later becamethe foothold in Europe (and the West) that the Brotherhood needed. They used themosque to disseminate Brotherhood-oriented propaganda and to act as a kind ofsafe house for Brotherhood members. The Muslim Brotherhood official Said Ramadanbecame central to that strategy, and in 1953 he had his photo oppportunity withthe President of the United States.None of this was happening in a vacuum, of course. Anti-Communist hysteria wasat an all-time high. The McCarthy Hearings had begun and the 1950s was an era ofRed-baiting and emotional accusations and counter-accusations. Communists werebelieved to have infiltrated every level of the US Government, as well as themilitary and even the CIA. The effect on the entertainment industry was no lessdramatic, as screenwriters and actors were blacklisted. The only safe positionto hold was that of a right-wing zealot, a passionate anti-Communist who couldsuspect even President Eisenhower of being a Communist, and there were plenty ofthese.An entire generation of high-ranking US military officers became embroiled inanti-Communist organizations and intrigues throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Menlike Major General Charles A. Willoughby, Major General Edwin Walker, LieutenantGeneral Pedro del Valle, and Major General George Van Horn Moseley were in theforefront of the anti-Communist crusade in the United States.Willloughby (1892–1972), to whom General Douglas MacArthur referred as his “petfascist,” had been born Adolf Karl Tscheppe-Weidenbach in Heidelberg, the son ofa German baron and an American mother from Baltimore. He became MacArthur'sChief of Military Intelligence during World War II and the Korean War, and thenbecame involved in a series of pro-Nationalist intrigues in Japan. He was anardent supporter of Franco in Spain and traveled to Madrid a number of times inthe early 1950s as an adviser to the Spanish dictator. He was also involved in anumber of anti-Communist, Christian crusades, including the InternationalCommittee for the Defense of Christian Culture, a front organization founded byoil magnate H.L. Hunt.Edwin Walker (1909–1993) was so right-wing he accused President Harry Truman ofbeing a Communist, and tried to tell the men serving under him for whom to vote(in violation of American law). In 1962, he was instrumental in leading theriots protesting the admission of African-American student James Meredith to theUniversity of Mississippi, leading then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy tohave him committed to an insane asylum for observation. Walker would laterbecome well-known as the first target of alleged John F. Kennedy assassin, LeeHarvey Oswald, in 1963.Pedro del Valle (1893–1978) was a highly-decorated veteran of World War II andthe Pacific theater of operations, the first Latino general of the Marines. Hecommanded the 1st Marine Division at Okinawa, for which he received the Navy'sDistinguished Service Medal. Yet in 1948, he wound up in Cairo as arepresentative of ITT. That year, the Muslim Brotherhood was implicated in actsof terrorism directed against the Egyptian government after the humiliatingdefeat of Egypt and its allies by the newly-recognized State of Israel. Theatmosphere was poisonous in Cairo, so Del Valle left Egypt and began working forITT as president of the company's South American division, this time in BuenosAires, Argentina during the Peron regime. A dedicated anti-Communist and memberof a number of crusade-like committees, he once quoted from the Protocols of theLearned Elders of Zion at a political rally in order to demonstrate the linksbetween World Jewry and Bolshevism. His involvement with ITT at this time and inthose locations is suspicious, as that firm had long-standing ties to the ThirdReich before, during, and after the war. As an anti-Semite and anti-Communist,his postings to Cairo and Buenos Aires during periods of great politicalupheaval in those countries are suggestive—if not indicative—of an intelligencefunction.George Van Horn Moseley (1874–1960) retired from military service in 1938 butnot before suggesting that European refugees fleeing persecution in Nazi Germanybe sterilized before they were allowed to enter the United States so as not topollute the gene pool. Once out of uniform, he became if anything morevociferous, attacking the New Deal as a form of dictatorship, and praising bothfascism and Nazism as the means to innoculate the United States against theJewish and Communist virus coming from Europe. He believed that the Second WorldWar was a device created by the worldwide Jewish conspiracy, and said thepersecution of the Jews in Nazi Germany was payback for their crucifixion ofJesus.Thus the atmosphere that was being prepared in the post-war period wasreminiscent of that which obtained in the immediate prewar period: attacks onthe US Government and whatever admin-istration—the Democrat administrations ofFranklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, or the Republican administration ofwar hero and five star general Dwight D. Eisenhower—as being Communist, orJewish, or both. The US State Department in the middle of all of this politicaland cultural angst tred carefully. They sponsored reports and briefing materialsthat extolled the value of religion in the fight against Communism. Theyactively sought a partnership with former pro-Nazi and current anti-Semiticindividuals and groups, like the Muslim Brotherhood, in the struggle againstwhat was perceived to be Soviet hegemonic intentions. The spooks in the StateDepartment and CIA intrigued with various Islamic factions in an effort to builda consensus for a strategy directed at encouraging the Muslim ethnicities behindthe Iron Curtain to resist, revolt, and to collaborate with their American caseofficers. In this, the official position and operations of the US Governmentwere not so far removed from those of the pro-Nazi American generals who werecausing such controversy in the media. Covert US support for such infamous Nazisas Klaus Barbie and Otto von Bolschwing has already been officially demonstratedin declassified intelligence files. Their utility to the US government was to befound specifically in their anti-Communist credentials. If CIA was covering forNazi military leaders, then they could tolerate the home-grown Americanversions.Some of these generals were involved in bizarre little conspiracies and secretsocieties of their own. Willoughby, for instance, was prominent in somethingcalled the Shickshinny Knights of Malta (SKOM), a fraudulent Order of Malta,founded in the small town of Shickshinny, Pennsylvania. The SKOM became a kindof fascist think tank, with former or retired members of the US military andintelligence establishments meeting to decide what to do about the dangers posedby creeping Communism in the American heartland.By the time the 1960s had rolled around, however, the focus had shifted toVietnam. There the generals actually had a theater of operations for theirground war against Communism. They had been stalled at the 39th parallel inKorea. The attempted invasion of Cuba to oust Fidel Castro had failed miserably.There had been CIA operations in Guatemala, Iran, the Dominican Republic, Laos,and elsewhere. But these were brush fires compared to the conflagrations desiredby what outgoing President Dwight Eisenhower had called the “military industrialcomplex” in his Farewell Address to the nation in 1960. The United States wasfinally at war with Communism, albeit in a proxy war being fought in a smallSoutheast Asian country on the other side of the world.The thinkers and plotters in Washington D.C. had always been aware thatCommunism was not merely a Russian threat. Communism could also come from China,from North Korea, from North Vietnam. The Communist threat was two-fold, and theUnited States decided it had to fight on two fronts. In Europe, it was a ColdWar; but in Asia, it was a hot war brought to the boiling point by religion onceagain.Eisenhower knew back in 1952 that the “holy war” he envisioned against Communismwould not be restricted to the European theater of operations. The Americanjihad would be extended to include Muslims all over the world. This was, afterall, the global jihad that Oppenheim and al-Husseini had always desired. Andwhen the dust had cleared the American jihad would include not only Muslims—butBuddhists, too.To the plotters and planners of the anti-Communist (read “anti-Russian,anti-Chinese”) holy war, God indeed was great."},{"pageContent":"PART THREETHE SHAMBHALA FACTOR"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETHE NAZI ARCHIPELAGOGeneral Willoughby: Fiscal responsibility is one of the prime requisites oforderly Government.

Willoughby,Former Chief of Intelligence, Far Eastern Command, Under General DouglasMacArthur by the Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives,Eighty-Fifth Congress, First Session, December 16, 1957.As can be seen from the above citation, our General Willoughby had insinuatedhimself into the foreign policy situation with regard to Indonesia. This 38-pagedocument is replete with references to Communists in the US Government, and howthe US foreign policy reflected that lamentable condition. The only possible wayto counteract the influence of Communism in Indonesia was, to use Willoughby'swords, the “Mohammedan party.” As we have seen, this is very much in line withUS foreign policy generally under the Eisenhower administration at that time.What is remarkable is the fact that this testimony was given before the HouseCommittee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) and not before Congress as a whole,or before an appropriate foreign policy or military committee. Willoughby wassounding the alarm that at any moment Indonesia could fall to the Communists.What he called the “Malay Barrier”—roughly a line that went from Malaya to theouter islands of the Indonesian archipelago—was the only thing standing betweenAustralia and the dreaded People's Republic of China.Someone must have listened, for the less than six months later the CIA mountedan operation to support anti-Sukarno rebel forces in Sumatra and Sulawesi,losing a B-26 aircraft at Ambon in the process. The entire story of thisoperation is still classified; CIA Director George Tenet refused to declassifythe relevant documents as late as 1998 due to the sensitive nature of theinformation contained within them. Fletcher Prouty, however, was not so reticentand revealed that upwards of 42,000 American troops were stationed at variousbases in the Philippines, ready to provide ground, sea, and air support to therebel forces in Indonesia. One of the men who was ordered to the Philippines totake part in this clandestine operation—according to Prouty—was Lee HarveyOswald.Another was a man personally known to the author, who met him in New York Cityin 1984. At the time he had a position with a European electronics manufacturerand my company was sourcing materials from him for a project in China. One day,he mentioned that he had been given an award by President Kennedy himself for asecret mission undertaken in Indonesia in 1958. The man in question was asubmarine commander.How had things turned out this way in Indonesia? How did Indonesia become aflashpoint for anti-Communist intrigues and violent rebellions? What wasAmerica's interest in this former Dutch colony, with its chains of volcanoes andancient architecture?It goes back to a meeting that was held in the Indonesian town of Bandung inApril of 1955, a meeting that caused a sensation of fear throughout the Westernworld—and especially in the United States.

It is relevant to our story because it mentions Oswald's interest inIndonesia and his assessment of Sukarno as an opportunist.The purpose of the meeting was to consolidate what Sukarno had called the “NewlyEmerging Forces,” or the Non-Aligned Forces, of what was then called the “ThirdWorld,” and which we now call the Developing Nations. These were countries thatformerly had been colonized by the West, and which were now reluctant to sidewith either the Soviet Union or the United States; in other words, theyrepresented not only the Third World but also the Third Way. Indonesia was thehost of this meeting, and as the most populous Muslim nation in the world, theimplications were serious. Attendees included not only the Grand Mufti, butMuslim leaders from the Middle East and Africa as well as the MuslimBrotherhood. Sukarno had decided to put into play an idea that had germinatedwithin his revolutionary brain ever since a series of meetings with a famousfinancier in Jakarta in 1951: none other than Hjalmar Schacht, “Hitler'sBanker.”Had this story only been about Dr. Georg Anton Pöch and his mysterious journeyto Indonesia, it would have been a good story but not enough for two books. Whatkept me coming back to the subject was the realization that there was an aspectto Asian history that has been largely ignored. This is the fact that there wasa Nazi presence in Asia long before the war began, replete with Nazi Partymeetings, U-boats, and escape routes. It has not attracted much attention—andthis is probably due to the Japanese aspect of the War in the Pacific thatoverwhelms all other narratives. Yet, when put against the volume of availableliterature on the Nazis and the war in Europe, not much is really understoodabout the Japanese war and the series of invasions that characterize theirterrorizing of an entire continent. Most Japanese war criminals escaped justice;very few were arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced; yet their record ofatrocities equals—and at times exceeds—anything that took place in Europe.Nazi Germany's role in the region has long been obscured by history's focus onJapan. To be sure, the Pacific was not a theater of operations for the Nazis inany coherent fashion. But there were vital trade deals with the Japanese, andeven before the war had begun, the Nazis were very involved in the region inpolitical and military matters. It is true they had left the management of thearea to the Japanese—at least until Germany would conquer the Middle East andIndia, and be able to turn her eyes to Southeast Asia and the abundant naturalresources that region could offer.Thus there is a shadow presence in the Indonesian archipelago, the longestarchipelago in the world. It represents a Nazi Archipelago. To understand thecontext for Pöch's flight to the region, and the reasons why even Hitler wouldhave seriously considered it as a sanctuary, we will examine the weird andunexpected world of the Asian Nazis.Southeast Asia, at the turn of the century, was largely a collection of Europeancolonies. Malaya (including Singapore) was a British colony. Indochina (laterVietnam) was a French colony. What is today Indonesia was a Dutch colony. ThePhilippines had belonged to Spain but was ceded to the United States after theSpanish-American War of 1898. Taiwan had become a Japanese colony in 1895, afterhaving been fought over by the Spanish, the Dutch, and the Chinese.With the Japanese invasion of much of Southeast Asia beginning at the end of1941—the year that also saw the attack on Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian islands,a US territory—the colonial hegemony over these territories was interrupted.Japan had come in the guise of a liberator, promising the Indonesians (forinstance) that they would gain their independence from the Dutch, and theMalayans from the British. This struck a responsive chord with some nationalistleaders who believed they could work with the Japanese, if it meant thatcenturies of colonial rule would end. What they did not expect was that theJapanese would see themselves as the new colonial power in the Pacific, rapingthe land; seizing gold, property and other valuables; and enslaving largesegments of the populations as a labor force, including women as sex workers forthe Japanese troops. But they were between a rock and a hard place.In Indonesia, the nationalists were happy that the Dutch had lost control overtheir most valuable colony; leaders such as Sukarno made speeches in Tokyo,praising the Japanese and calling for war against the Americans and the Britishas well as the Dutch; and announcing that the Third Reich would put Germany atthe very apex of world nations. But the situation was problematic, for not allthe Dutch were on the side of the Allies, and not all Indonesian nationalistswere pro-fascist or pro-Nazi.There had been pro-fascist and pro-Nazi supporters in the Netherlands before theGermans finally invaded that country in 1940. While there was determinedresistance by Dutch troops against the Nazis, the Dutch forces finallycapitulated to keep their country from being completely devastated by bombingruns over their main cities. Once the Nazis were in power, the nascent DutchNazis wanted to form their own, pro-Nazi, government. The legitimate governmentand the Royal family had fled to Great Britain ahead of the Nazi invasion, andwhile they claimed to be the legitimate government of the Netherlands, inpractice the Dutch Nazi Party was fighting to control its own destiny and tokeep the Netherlands Dutch. The German Nazis had a different idea, however, andthey eventually installed native Austrian Artur Seyss-Inquart as theGovernor-General of the Netherlands.What is usually not remembered by World War Two historians is that much of thewealth of the Netherlands had come from its colony in Southeast Asia. Known asthe Dutch East Indies and controlled by the Dutch East India Company (or VOC togive it its Dutch initials), the colony extended to the entire archipelago eastof Singapore and Malaya, and included the huge islands of Sumatra and Java aswell as Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, etc. It was a rich source of rice, rubber,coffee, tea, and other raw materials and natural resources. Thus one could nottalk of the Netherlands without including a discussion of its most importantcolony and the source of much of its economic power. When the Nazi invasion ofthe Netherlands finally took place on May 10, 1940, it was with theunderstanding that control of the Netherlands eventually would bring with itcontrol of the Indies. When their ally the Japanese invaded Southeast Asia in1941, and proceeded to remove the bynow autonomous Dutch government in theIndies in early 1942, it looked as if the prize possession was coming under thecontrol of the Axis powers. But the foundation had already been laid as early as1925.During the 1920s, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies put down athreat to Dutch control in the region represented by an Indonesian communistparty. It was the failure of this revolt that inspired Indonesian nationalistleaders to contemplate the successes of Mussolini in Italy and, eventually,Hitler in Germany, and to consider a fascist—rather than a communist—response totheir Dutch colonial masters.At the same time, there was a German Nazi presence in the Dutch East Indies, onethat has been largely missed by historians. This was the Nazi Party apparatusthat had been put into place by Walter Hewel, the man who would become a Germanambassador without portfolio under the inept (and possibly insane) Nazi ForeignMinister Joachim von Ribbentrop. Hewel had been one of Hitler's closest friends,allies, and confidants going back to the time when Hewel had marched with Hitlerand Himmler under the swastika banner during the failed Beer Hall Putsch of1923. Hewel had only been a teenager at the time, but was imprisoned along withHitler and his other co-conspirators in Landsberg Prison. He was released aftera year, and went to England for one year to study business, after which he wassent to the Dutch East Indies to work as a trader. While in England—and on theadvice of Rudolf Hess, Hitler's closest supporter and fellow inmate at LandsbergPrison— Hewel made contact with British fascists there and, thus inspired byfascist ideology from both England and Germany, he went to Indonesia to put hisbeliefs into practice.He remained in what is now Indonesia for ten years before returning to Germanywhen Hitler had become Chancellor and had installed Ribbentrop as ForeignMinister. For a brief period, Hewel was stationed in Spain before permanentlyreturning to the side of his old comrade-in-arms, Adolf Hitler.But his time in Indonesia was not spent in the tea trade alone, although thatwas his ostensible reason for being there. Hewel was a dedicated Nazi, a truebeliever. He set up Nazi Party cells in all of Indonesia's major cities amongthe expatriate German populations there. Based for awhile in the coastal city ofSurabaya—where Georg Anton Pöch would die in 1970—he became known back inGermany as “Surabaya Wally.”He remained at Hitler's side for the rest of the war. Hewel was a greatraconteur, and Hitler loved to hear the stories Surabaya Wally would tell of hisexperiences in Indonesia. Hewel was one of the last to leave the Berlin bunkerin May, 1945, and was never seen again, although it was reported that he died—orcommitted suicide—while trapped in a basement in Berlin during the Russianadvance. But, like Hitler, his body was never found.He was more than just a teller of tall tales and an entertaining figure to havearound. When SS Obergruppenführer Ernst Kalten-brunner was being questioned bythe Allies in 1945, he told them how important Hewel was:HEWEL belonged to HITLER's closest circle and was one of his main advisers onquestions of foreign policy. K. always tried to give important reports to HEWELsince he was certain that they would reach HITLER. He also used HEWEL to obtaininformation about what was going on in the German Foreign Office.60[../Text/part0019.html#c9-aft60]Ernst Kaltenbrunner (1903–1946) was an Austrian who rose to the highest rank inthe SS next to Himmler, and who was also head of Interpol during the war. He wasarrested in Austria near the alleged site of the National Redoubt: the areaaround Salzburg where the Nazis would hide in the complex series of salt minesand caves and stage their “Werewolf” guerrilla campaign against the Allies.While most historians today scoff at the existence of the National Redoubt, theAllies had good intelligence that it existed. There were aerial photographs ofbunkers being built, and large transport caravans making their way to theSalzburg area. It was in one area of the purported National Redoubt—the AltAussee—that a large cache of stolen art was recovered, believed to be some ofGoering's personal treasure, as well as that of Hitler's personal art collectiondestined for the Adolf Hitler Art Museum in his hometown of Linz, Austria ... aproject that was, of course, never realized. Kaltenbrunner was discovered hidingin this region, using the documents and identity papers of a medical doctor todisguise his own identity, and even carrying a medical bag as an ordinary doctorwould. As Kaltenb-runner would later demonstrate, they were the real identitypapers of a real military doctor61 [../Text/part0019.html#c9-aft61] and notforged papers.62 [../Text/part0019.html#c9-aft62]This last fact is important for it shows how it was not only possible but likelythat some Nazis escaped justice by using the papers of other Germans who werenot wanted by the Allies and, in this particular case, the papers of a medicaldoctor. In other words, like Kaltenbrunner's fellow Austrian, Georg Anton Pöch.Heinrich Himmler, Kaltenbrunner's boss, also used the genuine identity papers ofa member of the German police in his attempt to escape, not realizing that theGerman police were also on the proscribed list. Himmler committed suicide whenhe realized that the Allies had recognized him once he was captured, butKaltenbrunner was hanged at Nuremberg for war crimes in 1946.Kaltenbrunner is referenced here because of his knowledge of Hewel and ofHewel's importance to Hitler. Kaltenbrunner himself wanted more access to theForeign Office and was using Hewel to bypass Ribbentrop and go directly toHitler. (Ribbentrop was also hanged at Nuremberg.) Kaltenbrunner is interestingas well for his role in setting up a clandestine underground network ofNazis—including the SS, but also former Nazi diplomats and Gauleiters—as a“stay-behind” organization to fight the Allies and, in particular, the Russians.One of Kaltenbrunner's inner circle was Otto Skorzeny who, as we have seen,would go on to become one of the more visible leaders of the Nazi undergroundafter the war. Kaltenbrunner and Skorzeny had been having meetings right up tothe very end, as late as May, 1945, in the Salzburg area after Hitler's deathhad been announced. Thus in Kaltenbrunner we have a nexus of connections toHitler, Hewel, Skorzeny, and the Nazi underground, as well as to the NationalRedoubt and the buried gold and art treasures later discovered in the Salzburgarea.A CIA report insists that the National Redoubt existed:After the Siegfried Line was breached and Nazi Germany began to fall apart, itwas said that the hard core of Party leaders and their Waffen SS would hole upin a National Redoubt which they had made ready in the Austrian Alps and fromthere descend to prey like werewolves on the Allied occupation forces. This baddream, of course, never came true, and later there was a good deal of scoffingat the “myth.” But at the beginning of May in 1945 there was nothing mythicalabout either the Werewolves or the National Redoubt. General Walter Bedell Smithsaid, “We had every reason to believe the Nazis intended to make their laststand among the crags.” All of our intelligence pointed to the Alpine area eastand south of Salzburg as the final fortress for the Goetterdaemmerung of theremaining Nazi fanatics. Reconnaissance photographs showed that they wereinstalling bunkers and ammunition and supply depots in this mountain region.Interrogations of military and political prisoners indicated that governmentofficers, ranking Party leaders, and the SS troops were moving to the Redoubt,leaving it to the Wehrmacht to stem the allied advance.63[../Text/part0019.html#c9-aft63]In other words, all available intelligence showed that there was, indeed, such aplan in place and pilot Hannah Reitsch confirmed that it was a topic ofconversation in the Berlin bunker as late as the last week of April, 1945. Thisis something of which Hitler and Hewel were, of course, intimately aware.Kaltenbrunner was in the area of the National Redoubt because Himmler had puthim in charge of whatever forces remained in southern Europe; he left Berlin inApril of 1945, shortly before the fall of that city to the Russian Army, andwound up in the Salzburg area, which is where he was eventually captured.In fact, it was SS officer Friedrich Rauch who was in charge of the transport ofthe gold reserves of the Berlin Reichsbank to the Salzburg area in 1945. Thisgold was earmarked for the use of a “Fourth Reich” after the war, and we know itwas never recovered in full ... by the Allies.64[../Text/part0019.html#c9-aft64]Kaltenbrunner had been cooperative with the American interrogators, but when hewas transferred to London for interrogation by the British everything changed.According to the CIA report quoted above, Kaltenbrunner was tortured while inBritish custody. From that point he refused to cooperate in any way with anyone,became withdrawn, and suffered a cerebral hemorrhage which interfered with hisability to stand trial at Nuremberg. It did not stop the proceedings, however,and Kaltenbrunner eventually was tried, convicted and executed. The secrets ofthe National Redoubt and the possible escape of important war criminals—as wellas the stay-behind agent network he had been setting up throughout Europe—diedwith him.Kaltenbrunner was deeply interested in the foreign affairs of the Reich, whichis why he cultivated Hewel. He would have been one of those familiar withHewel's Indonesian past and whatever current connections Surabaya Wally had backin the Indies. But that was not his—or the Reich's—only connection to Indonesia.One enduring rumor that circulated among the Nazi elite was the idea that JosefGoebbels—the short, club-footed chief of the Nazi Propaganda Ministry and theman who forced his six children, his wife, and himself to die in the Berlinbunker—was actually part Javanese. His mother had been Dutch and her ancestorshad been born in Indonesia. The rumors stated that there was Javanese blood inher background, and that Goebbels's odd physical appearance was a result of thisbreeding with an “inferior” Asiatic race.65 [../Text/part0019.html#c9-aft65]With two of Hitler's closest friends—two of the men who were with him to thebitter end in the bunker—having ties to Indonesia, and in Hewel's case withactual experience in that country, it is no wonder that another rumor could bestarted that Hitler had actually fled to Indonesia after the war. Add to thatthe growing body of evidence showing a close link between Indonesia and thefascist and Nazi parties of the Netherlands—with extensive branches inIndonesia—and one could come away with an excellent argument that Hitler did,indeed, plan an escape to that tropical country on the other side of the worldfrom bombed-out Berlin.As early as 1931, there had been both fascist and Nazi parties in theNetherlands. The NSB or Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging in Nederland (NationalSocialist Movement in the Netherlands) was founded in Utrecht in 1931. One ofits founders was Anton Mus-sert (1894–1946), who envisioned a fascist partyalong the lines of Mussolini's Black Shirts in Italy. At this early stage of itsexistence the NSB did not have a policy of anti-Semitism but that would changewith the influence of another party member, Meinoud Rost van Tonningen(1894–1945). Van Tonningen was born in Surabaya, Indonesia (another Surabayaconnection), the son of a Dutch general responsible for putting down an armedrevolt of Indonesians against Dutch rule in Bali and Lombok, as well as in Aceh.He studied at the University of Leiden and and lived for a time in Austria,before returning to the Netherlands and joining the NSB in 1936. It was vanTonningen who tried to move the NSB towards a more openly pro-German andpro-Nazi ideology, including anti-Semitism. There was a power struggle betweenMussert and van Tonningen, but Mussert remained head of the party with vanTonningen66 [../Text/part0019.html#c9-aft66] a strong second.In 1935, Anton Mussert traveled to the Dutch East Indies where he received awarm welcome from the Dutch Governor General, both in Batavia (now Jakarta) atthe governor's official residence, and also at the governor's home in Bogor.Film footage of the visit shows a smiling Mussert being greeted by members ofthe Dutch community and giving the fascist salute. The NSB had been active inIndonesia since 1933, to the point that five percent of the total NSB membershipwas to be found there, with almost thirty percent of all revenues collected bythe NSB coming from Indonesia.67 [../Text/part0019.html#c9-aft67] The NSB hadroughly five thousand members in Indonesia by the time of Mussert's visit,although that number would start to drop off by 1940.One can compare that number to those of the Nazi Party in Indonesia as a whole,which constituted roughly 29,000 at the time the war broke out, most of whomwere Germans. Thus, anywhere from ten to fifteen percent of the total number ofNazi Party members in Indonesia at any given time were Dutch.In Indonesia, the NSB had its first meetings in Bandung, the town where we willfind the Asian-African Conference in 1955. Hewel's Nazi Party apparatus,however, extended from Batavia (Jakarta), to Makassar, Surabaya, Medan, Padang,Semarang, and Bandung.68 [../Text/part0019.html#c9-aft68]NSB leader Van Tonningen, although he was more completely pro-Nazi andpro-German than his rival Anton Mussert, was not allowed membership in the SSbecause he had been born in Indonesia, and could not prove his racial purityback to the year 1800 (for regular SS men) or 1750 (for officers). Thisrestriction was lifted in 1944 when the SS was taking virtually anyone, but ithad to have bothered van Tonningen considerably. He had salve for his wounds,however, as he was put in charge of the Dutch banking system during the war. Ithas been alleged that it was due to his intimate knowledge of how illegal fundshad been transferred and moved around—including the gold that had been seizedfrom Jewish and other accounts. It is believed that when he fell to his death inAllied custody in 1945, he was deliberately pushed. His widow insisted that hewas killed to keep him quiet about these financial transactions, and she mayvery well have been right. The story of Nazi gold has not yet been told in itsentirety. We will examine more of the story in the chapter entitled “Sukarno'sGold.”Mussert himself seems to have benefited financially from his position as “DutchFührer” during the war, for it has recently been discovered that Mussert died amulti-millionaire. Historian Dr. Tessel Pollmann has revealed that Mussert—farfrom being the “honest politician” he was made out to be—became the owner of“five houses, a major printing company and director of a thriving publishinghouse. He also owned various precious antiques and a villa, all unrightfullytaken from Jewish owners.”69 [../Text/part0019.html#c9-aft69]Then there was Willem Sassen (1918–2001) a Dutch Nazi and SS officer whovolunteered for the Dutch Legion (under command of Dutch officers in theWaffen-SS), and was a war correspondent for the “Voice of the SS” in theNetherlands. After the war he obtained fake ID—via the “Catholic Circle” inAmsterdam (a group of fanatically Nazi priests), and left the Netherlands inSeptember of 1948 to go to Argentina via Dublin, Ireland. He served as a publicrelations assistant to fascist dictators Gen. Pinochet of Chile and PresidentStroessner of Paraguay, and famously inter-viewed Adolf Eichmann at length.Sassen eventually died quietly in Chile, forgotten by everyone.70[../Text/part0019.html#c9-aft70]It becomes necessary at some point to view the Third Reich a bit differently—asa gang of bank robbers and highwaymen. The SS and other elements of the ThirdReich moved through Europe like a chainsaw, not only killing and raping on ascale heretofore unimaginable, but also stealing anything that wasn't naileddown, and much that was. While the thieving had begun in the very earliest daysof Hitler's rule as Chancellor with the Nuremberg Laws— that made all Jews inGermany non-citizens with the right of the State to confiscate their property—bythe time the war was ending, any Nazi leader with access to treasure—gold, art,antiquities, rare books, jewelry, anything—had improvised ways to get it out ofthe reach of the Allies.One of the ways that was available to the highest-placed criminals was theU-boat. This German version of the submarine had a long and legendary serviceduring the war. Admiral Doenitz—who briefly became head of the Reich after the“death” of Adolf Hitler— had begun his career in U-boats in the First World War.It was he who famously declared that there was a “Paradise” awaiting Hitler ifhe should decide to flee, transport courtesy of his U-boats.71[../Text/part0019.html#c9-aft71] It was General Wilhelm von Faupel who organizeda shipment of Nazi gold from Spain to Argentina by U-boat with the help of oneCaptain Dietrich Niebuhr (d. 1964) and one Gottfried Sandstede (who ran theGestapo in Argentina during the war). Clearly, then, the U-boats had other usesthan purely military ones.One of the facets of the Second World War that has fascinated me since I firstlearned of it was the extent of Nazi U-boat traffic to Asian ports. We tend tothink of the Germans as fighting in the European theater and nowhere else,except for the brief and doomed mission of Erwin Rommel—the “Desert Fox”—inNorth Africa. The idea that there was regular traffic to and from Asia usingNazi U-boats is rather startling, for it opens up new vistas of possibilities.While some U-boat missions to Asia may have been purely military in nature—thesinking of Allied shipping, for instance—as the war progressed, and as Japanconsolidated its hold over the former European and American colonies in thePacific, the Nazis exploited this situation for their own benefit. Theydesperately needed raw materials to help support their war machine, and thisincluded— among many other natural resources—rubber.The rubber plant most used in rubber production was not indigenous to SoutheastAsia; in fact it was brought to Malaya and the Indies in the 1860s by Dutchentrepreneurs who saw in the tropical environment an excellent place to plantrubber trees. Although there were wild rubber trees in Java and Sumatra beforethe Dutch arrived, it was found that imported trees were better suited for thetype of rubber production the Industrial Age would require. The local Dutchgovernment encouraged the practice and found foreign investors who would helpcreate the rubber plantations to help service the growing need for rubberproducts, such as tires for motor vehicles. Germany had to import rubber fromAsia in order to fill its growing demand for all the rubber products used oncars, trucks, jeeps, tanks, and planes. Japan, on the other hand, neededproducts that it could only source from German factories. Eventually, Germanblueprints and designs for advanced weapons systems were included as the ThirdReich began to realize it was losing the war. They decided to help the Japanesecause further destruction among the Allies in the Pacific, perhaps hoping that asudden reversal in the Asian theater would take the pressure off of Berlin whichwas now fighting on two fronts: Russia to the east, and the Allied advance tothe west.To that end, Nazi U-boat depots were created in Penang, Malaya; in Singapore;and in Batavia: all in Japanese-occupied Southeast Asia. As the Allies becamevictorious in the region and began bombing Penang from air bases in India, theU-boat station was moved to Singapore, and then to Batavia. The U-boats thatwere sent to Asia were not designed as Wolfpack-type submarines for search anddestroy missions. They had been redesigned for cargo. They would refuel in theIndian Ocean before making the final leg to Malaya and then, when Malaya becametoo dangerous, to Indonesia.When the war in Europe was over, the Nazi submariners who were in Indonesia werecaught between a rock and a hard place. They could not go home—the travel wouldhave been impossible. Their submarines would have been attacked and destroyed;fuel was a precious commodity; and there would be no useful purpose (in Japaneseeyes) for sending these very valuable warships back to Europe to fall intoAllied hands. So the German crews were set ashore and the U-boats rechristenedas Japanese submarines.Some of the U-boat crewmembers never made it back to Germany. In some cases theywere arrested and thrown into prisoner-of-war camps. Some tried to help theIndonesian nationalists fight against the Dutch; in some cases they weremistaken for Dutch themselves and killed.Some of the crewmembers died in Indonesia. They were buried in a cemetery nearthe city of Bogor—where the Dutch Governor General had a vacation home—on landthat had been owned by a close friend of Heinrich Himmler, one Emil Helfferich(1878–1972), one of the members of the so-called Freundeskreis Himmler thatincluded Hjalmar Schacht and the infamous Oswald Pohl, Otto Ohlendorf, and evenErnst Schäfer of the SS-Tibet Expedition. Helfferich was a German tea plantationowner, and had ties to Walter “Surabaya Wally” Hewel as well as to theReichsführer-SS: another indication as to the extent (and the depth) of Naziconnections in Indonesia.72 [../Text/part0019.html#c9-aft72]With the end of the Second World War a new conflict came to Indonesia. Much toUS President Roosevelt's dismay, an agreement had been reached at Yalta thatensured the colonial powers—principally England, France, and theNetherlands—would get their colonies back once the war was over and Germany andJapan defeated. It was this agreement that launched another series of brutalmilitary conflicts all over the region—from revolts in India and Malaya againstBritish rule, to the anti-French guerrilla war being carried out by Ho Chi Minhin Vietnam, to the liberation movement against the Dutch in Indonesia. WhileYalta had guaranteed the Dutch would retain their valuable colony, theIndonesians themselves had not been asked their opinion.At the same time, just as the Japanese were leaving Southeast Asia they madegood on their promise to grant independence to Indonesia. It was a futilegesture, for it was nothing they legally could give; and there was no way forthe Indonesians to enjoy their brief moment of freedom before the Dutch returnedin earnest to retake the archipelago by force.Thus, there followed another five years of armed conflict between the Dutchcolonizers and the Indonesian nationalists. Sukarno was the more charismatic ofthe revolutionary leaders and had identified himself and his cause with NaziGermany and Imperial Japan during the war. Many Indonesian nationalists wereambivalent about fascism and Nazism; while they could sympathize withnationalism in general, their longing was more towards re-creating theindigenous empires of old: Srivijaya or Majapahit. There had been flirtationswith fascism in the development of new Indonesian political movements, such asthe Partai Fasis Indonesia (PFI) the “Indonesian Fascist Party,” and within theIndonesian National Party (PNI). The Indonesian nationalists did not see anybenefit in helping their colonial masters—the Dutch—fight against the Nazis whohad invaded Dutch territory in Europe. Why would they side with their oppressorsto fight a man—Hitler—who clearly had all the colonial powers on the ropes?Sukarno was probably less of a true fascist than an opportunist and anationalist. It is hard to understand nationalism in the post World War Two eraas anything other than fascism and Nazism on one side, or as Communism(admittedly more an international than a national movement) on the other. Bothmovements fought rampant capitalist hegemony and supported anti-colonialmovements everywhere. In Europe, Nazi Germany declared as its enemies the verycolonizers with whom Asia had the most problems: the English, the French, andthe Dutch and, later, the Americans in the Philippines. The Communists werefighting the French in Indochina, as well as establishing a liberated China.Sukarno, himself, was in serious flirtation with China and with the IndonesianCommunist Party, the PKI, when he was deposed in 1965–67. Perhaps Sukarno'scase, more than any other, illustrates the ideological and philosophicalconundrum resulting from a nationalism that puts nationhood and nationalidentity and freedom above all other human values. In the case of Nazi Germany,Hitler's brand of fascism—the Nazism represented in his major work, MeinKampf—is a kind of “revenge politics”: revenge against the Bolsheviks, againstthe businessmen, landowners and landlords, against the academics and scientists,and against the Jews and all other non-German peoples, for what had happened toGermany at the end of World War One (and also for what had happened to Hitler inhis personal life, which was a catalogue of rejection). Revenge politics resultsin a kind of euphoria over vanquishing one's oppressors, but it will beshort-lived. The anti-climactic period is one where the true character of anation will be tested. At a certain point, there has to be more depth to apolitical program than a single idea, even the single idea of anti-colonialismand liberation from colonial powers.Unfortunately, this phase of national growth does not happen in a vacuum. Thereis usually not enough time to contemplate the creation of a model state whenthere are other forces in the world that threaten a new nation's survival. AsSukarno tilted against the superpowers in his famous Bandung Conference of 1955,to which the leaders of the non-aligned nations were invited, it was a throwngauntlet. The United States began looking for ways to thwart Sukarno'spopularity with the Non-Aligned Nations, nations that seemed to include aninordinate number of socialist-leaning governments. There was also the idea inthe back of Sukarno's mind of creating an international bank that would be theNon-Aligned Nations's equivalent of the World Bank or the IMF—both of whichSukarno viewed as puppets of the superpowers and especially of the UnitedStates. The creation of such a financial institution—independent of the WorldBank and hence independent of Western control— would be viewed by the West withconsiderable alarm.Who suggested this course of action to Sukarno? Who would have a vested interestin seeing Indonesia financially strong—it was already the strongest of theundeveloped nations in Asia—and taking on the Western powers at their own game?If there were a financial mastermind behind this bold idea of Sukarno, one needlook no further than the same financial mastermind who helped create the bankingstructure and economic power of the Third Reich and who allowed Germany tore-arm in spite of the strictures of the Versailles Treaty: Hjalmar Schacht.As we have seen, Schacht had been President of the Reichsbank and Minister ofEconomics for the Third Reich until his ouster in 1937 over policy differenceswith Hitler—although he remained on salary as a Minister Without Portfolio until1943. He helped to finance the German industrial giant, I.G. Farben —theexploiter of slave labor during the war and the manufacturer of Zyklon-B, thegas that was used in the gas chambers in the death camps. Schacht was one of thegroup of industrialists that petitioned Hindenburg to appoint Adolf Hitler asChancellor of Germany, a goal that was attained on January 30, 1933. He alsotried to form an alliance with China—rather than Japan—which was favored by manyNazi leaders who saw in the Chinese Nationalist movement an impulse similar totheir own. However, Schacht and his clique of pro-Chinese Nazis lost to thepro-Japan bloc (championed by Ribbentrop), and the rest is history.Schacht was arrested on suspicion of having been involved in the July 20, 1944assassination plot against Hitler and wound up in Dachau. As the war came to anend, he was transferred to a prison camp in the South Tyrol, which is where hewas found and arrested by the Allies. He stood trial at Nuremberg but wasacquitted, and went on to become a consultant to international bankinginstitutions. He even formed his own bank in 1953.Prior to that, however, he would be found in Jakarta, Indonesia in 1951.That year Hjalmar Schacht was interviewed by author William Stevenson at theHotel Capitol in Jakarta. Schacht had been nervous about the interview, but ithad been arranged by a family friend. The fact that Schacht's friend was OttoSkorzeny, Hitler's commando, the rescuer of Mussolini, and a leader of theworldwide Nazi underground, meant that Schacht would take the call.The conversation in Jakarta revolved around the danger that Indonesia was in ofgoing communist, and of how men like Schacht—with experience in piloting theship of state through perilous economic and political times—could help. Schachthad been instrumental in helping re-arm Germany at a time when doing so was inviolation of international treaties set in place at Versailles after World WarOne. Schacht had engineered complicated financial transactions that ensuredGermany could still buy much-needed resources from abroad, even though she owedhuge amounts in foreign debt. Schacht knew how to deal with Communist threats toa new country, as he had done with tremendous success in Germany and now hopedto do for Indonesia. Schacht's only problem came when Martin Bormann decidedthat he was a rival, and did what he could to manipulate circumstances in such away that Schacht was forced out of government. That Schacht was a committed Naziand anti-Semite is beyond doubt. The fact that he did not directly participatein war crimes is what got him off the hook in Nuremberg, even though theRussians had every intention of seeing him hang.Now, in Jakarta in 1951, Schacht was plotting another major coup. Indonesia'sstatus as an independent nation had just been achieved the previous year withthe end of the National Revolution. There were separatist movements in Maluku,Sumatra, and Sulawesi during this time that threatened the newborn regime.Groups like Darul Islam favored an Islamist state, while others representedvarieties of socialist, communist, and democratic ideals. Schacht was trying toconvince Sukarno that he should create a kind of financial and political MaginotLine out of his archipelago that would provide a buffer against the spread ofCommunism from China and Indochina—one that would then extend “in a vast Islamiccrescent from Australasia to the Arab nations of the Mideast.”73[../Text/part0019.html#c9-aft73] This is a preview of what later would appear asthe khalifa or caliphate dreams of the Islamic fundamentalists of the 1970s,1980s, and down to the present day: Islamists who want to create just such an“Islamic crescent” from Southern Thailand, through Malaysia, Indonesia, and thePhilippines. To start. To think that this might have been suggested—or at leastsupported in its very early stages—by former Nazi Economics Minister HjalmarSchacht is almost surreal.It also prefigures exactly what General Willoughby would tell the HUAC membersin 1957: that the “Malay Barrier” would be an effective blockade againstCommunist influence from China. Schacht in 1951 and Willoughby in 1957—the mindsof these two devoted anti-Communists and fascists worked remarkably alike. Thedifference was that Willoughby thought like a general, and Schacht thought likea banker.The idea that had come to Sukarno (possibly from Schacht) at about this time wasnothing short of revolutionary: to create an international bank that wouldcompete head-on with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Both ofthese institutions had come out of the Bretton Woods meetings that tried todecide the disposition of Nazi funds being held in Switzerland by the Bank ofInternational Settlements. Ironically, Sukarno would “prime the pump” of hisnewly-imagined bank with gold that had recently arrived in Jakarta, courtesy ofthe Bank of Portugal, where it had been held for the account of ODESSA.But Sukarno proved to be too intransigent, too immune to overtures from the Naziunderground. They saw him going over to the Communist side. They could notafford their investments to disappear into a Communist-designed fiscal blackhole. Thus Sukarno was removed and a more flexible regime—that of GeneralSoeharto—put in his place. Once that was accomplished and the dust settled, in1968 the West German government sent Dr. Hilmar Bassler as its ambassador toJakarta. Bassler—an exceedingly dictatorial and unpopular ambassador whoseintroduction to the Indonesians had been his official car running over andkilling a small child—had been a member of the Gestapo and the SD(Sicherheitsdienst, the Nazi secret service) during the war. Bassler had been incharge of East Asian propaganda for Ribbentrop's Foreign Office. (In thatcapacity he knew Hewel personally, since Hewel had excellent first-handknowledge of the region. Bassler reported directly to Ribbentrop.)74[../Text/part0019.html#c9-aft74]Of course, the CIA wanted Sukarno removed as well, and tried several differentapproaches to have him taken out of commission prior to 1965, including thefamous attempted coup—at least partially organized by CIA—in 1958. Sukarno'smove to the Left worried the Americans as much as it did the Nazis with whomthey had made common cause. One such alliance between American intelligence andNazi survivors was the Gehlen Organization (the Nazi spy group that served asthe CIA's Eastern European and anti-Soviet operation for a number of years,until it was determined that working with your former dedicated enemies was notnecessarily an efficient way to go about spying on another set of enemies).Operation Paperclip was another. And there were other alliances with “former”Nazis in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East: alliances that remained inplace at least through the 1980s and possibly even later.It was into this pressure-cooker atmosphere replete with espionage and intrigue,Nazis and Communists, that two Europeans, two dedicated servants of the Reich—aman and a woman, a husband and a wife—disembarked in Jakarta from their oceanliner after a two week journey from Rotterdam, and an eight-year life on therun.And just in time for the 1955 Asian-African Conference in Bandung.60 [../Text/part0019.html#c9-ft60] Vol. XCVII 38.02.

They had been discovered by an Indonesian doctor andArmy officer, Dr. Sosro Husodo, who wrote about it in a privately-printeddocument he circulated among a few people in the Indonesian government. SosroHusodo had been traveling with the American hospital ship, USS HOPE, in 1960 andhad disembarked at Sumbawa, where he encountered the strange “German” doctorwith the Charlie Chaplan moustache.Years later, when news of the identification and extradition of Klaus Barbiemade world headlines, and the Hitler's Diaries hoax was exposed at the sametime, Sosro Husodo read the accounts in the local newspapers and magazines. Heput two and two together: the “German” doctor—whom he referred to as “DoctorX”—and his wife were not what they appeared to be. They were, in actuality,Adolf Hitler and his wife, Eva.The wife eventually left Pöch alone on the island and returned to Europe. Pöchhimself remarried. Sulaesih was a local woman, and Pöch—like so many otherNazis—converted to Islam in order to marry her and took a Muslim name. Sulaesihbecame a source for much of what we know about her husband, and documents shehad in her possession wound up in the hands of Dr. Sosro Husodo. From there,after Sosro's death, they were passed to a Chinese man in Singapore who will notlet them out of his sight, not even to permit authentication of the documents orclarification of their contents. It took me six months in Singapore before Icould manage to see important portions of those documents, but even then keyelements were withheld.Instead, I read everything I could find on this case—which was not much, andmoreover was in Bahasa Indonesia, the language of that beautiful and captivatingcountry—and made my way to the cemetery where Doctor X was buried, in the exoticport city of Surabaya in East Java. I noted several anomalies in the tombstoneitself, most especially the lack of dates for birth and death, as if (like a badjoke) no one was really sure who was buried in Pöch's tomb.The only comprehensive account of the affair was in a local language pamphletwritten and published by an Indonesian arms dealer who spoke fluent Russian.There were odds and ends of interviews in the Indonesian press and some of theseaccounts made it online. Basically, however, I was on my own.I know considerably more about the Pöch couple today than I did when I wroteRatline. The reason for this is several people have come forward with additionalinformation, including the person in Singapore who has possession of what isleft of the original documentation. I have seen Georg Anton Pöch's passport, aswell as what I call the “Testament” of Georg Anton Pöch that was found scribbledin Gabelsberger shorthand in his address book.That the two people who alighted from an ocean liner in January of 1954 wereactually Georg Anton and Hella Pöch and not two other people—Adolf Hitler, say,and Eva Braun Hitler—cannot be proven definitively at this time. What is certainis that the documents left behind by the man calling himself Pöch are documentsthat belonged to the real Georg Anton Pöch no later than 1954. In other words,what I had at my disposal that were original documents—the passport and parts ofthe address book—were dated to before the Indonesian period. The passport wasissued shortly before the trip to Indonesia, and the address book had been keptfrom the late 1940s to perhaps no later than the early 1950s ... at least, theentries that I saw all dated from that period.The upshot of this is that all I know for certain is that these are genuine Pöchdocuments. They could have been in the possession of other parties sincethen—they certainly belonged to Sulaesih, and then Dr. Sosro, and then thecurrent Singaporean owner in a chain of custody from 1970 to the present day—andthere is no guarantee that the real Georg Anton Pöch had them in Indonesia. LikeKaltenbrunner's fake doctor papers, they could have been used by other criminalsto escape justice. To be fair, I am leaving that door open for it would bedishonest of me to claim with any degree of certitude that it was Georg AntonPöch who died in Surabaya that January of 1970, or that it was definitely GeorgAnton Pöch who lived on Sumbawa in 1960. All we know for certai is that the manwho lived there called himself Pöch.Whether or not this was the real Pöch or an impostor is almost immaterial atthis point since the story is compelling enough as it is. The Pöch documentsopen a window onto the world of the Ratline, showing us the extent to which Naziwar criminals worked with each other on the run. They kept in contact,communicated, stayed current with names and addresses all over the world, and—atleast in the case of Pöch—were bitter at their fate and maintained asteadily-burning hatred for their enemies, even decades after the end of thewar. The Pöch documents are unique. They tell that story better than anyhistorian can hope to equal. It is the story of highly-educated, accomplishedpeople, professional people, with enormous credibility among their peers, whoparticipated in—and in some cases instigated—the worst crimes against humanitythe modern world has ever seen. The Pöch address book is the 1940s equivalent oftoday's Facebook page, replete with a self-description and friends list, alongwith the occasional wry comment and the odd exclamation point, but minus thesmiley faces.For now it is important to know just who the Pöch couple was. Did they survivethe war and wind up in Indonesia? Or were they some other couple, using thepapers of Georg Anton and Hella Pöch in order to escape as far away as possiblefrom their fellow Germans, their fellow Austrians, their fellow Nazis?While not much is known about Georg Anton Pöch, considerably more is known abouthis more famous wife, Hella Pöch. Hella was born Hella Schürer von Waldheim in1893 in Austria. She had been a student of Rudolf Pöch (1870–1921), one of thefathers of modern anthropology and ethnography, and one of the first to usemodern technology—video and audio equipment—in the field. Although she wastwenty-three years his junior, they were married a few years before he diedprematurely at the age of 51.Rudolf Pöch had been involved in what would later turn out to be a verycontroversial practice of buying corpses in Africa and shipping them back toAustria for study and display. In some cases, he was accused of stealing thecorpses from their graves. Then, during the First World War, Pöch saw theprisoner of war camps as excellent places to gather data on ethnicity, due tothe various ethnic groups that comprised the prisoner population.It was this cavalier attitude towards human beings—seeing them as specimens tobe studied, with no actual humanity of their own—that set the stage for the kindof hideous experimentation that would take place later in the death camps of theThird Reich. Robbing graves in Africa, measuring the skulls of prisoners ...treating human beings (non-German, non-Caucasian human beings) as objects to beexamined—dispassionately and with no regard for any kind of socialcontext—seemed like the height of the scientific method. The lack of emotionalidentification, of empathy, is a prerequisite for this type of approach. Thebodies of dead Africans had no value beyond that of specimens for the laboratoryand museum. The value of Slavic prisoners was limited to what their bonestructure could tell of how the races had intermingled and evolved. That thesesame prisoners would suffer terrible deprivations in the camps, some of thembeing killed or tortured, was of no interest to the calm objectivity of the racescientist. It was irrelevant.It could be argued that the father of modern ethnography made a sinistercontribution that has not been recognized. While he broke new ground in usingmotion picture cameras and phonograph recording devices in the field to capturethe speech of Bushmen in Africa (for instance), he also established a kind oflegitimacy for the “scientific” approach to race that allowed the scientist totreat his subjects like butterflies stuck with a pin to a board. Germans (andAustrians) were at the forefront of all the sciences in the early twentiethcentury, and were major contributors in the fields of philosophy, psychology andtheology. They were giants in their respective disciplines who commanded therespect and even the awe of their colleagues from other countries, and RudolfPöch was at the forefront. There is today a Rudolf Pöch Institute at theUniversity of Vienna where his massive collection of studies of non-Germanpeoples is still studied and evaluated.Rudolf Pöch began with a mission to Bombay (now Mumbai) India at the end of thenineteenth century to study the plague. He had been educated as a medicaldoctor, and it was through the study of disease in India, and his work incombating malaria in Africa, that he became interested in physical anthropology.In 1901–1906, Pöch was conducting field research in Australia and in Papua, NewGuinea (in the areas once claimed by Germany and Great Britain on the easternside of the island; the western side is claimed by Indonesia today but was Dutchterritory until the 1960s). He is credited with the first scientific evidencefor the existence of pygmies. He made over seventy recordings of Papuan speech,songs, and music which are still studied today.Gradually, his attention began to turn to race science and race hygiene and hebecame one of the founders of the movement to study races with a view towardsdetermining which races were more “evolved” and which were “mongrelized” togreater and lesser extents. This led to the classification of European races, aswell as of non-European races in Africa and Asia. Some Europeans were declaredto be “eastern,” which became a pejorative for non-Aryan. These included Slavsand other Eastern European ethnic groups. The determinations were made onvarious observations of the shape of noses, cheekbones, other skull details,hands, feet, hair and eye color, etc. It was this type of research thateventually evolved into the “science” of determining paternity based on racialcharacteristics, with their associated “positive” and “negative” associations.This was the kind of research that would later inspire monsters like JosefMengele, the “Angel of Death” at Auschwitz, who experimented on the eyes ofprisoners in an effort to turn them blue and thereby more “Aryan.”There is no space to go into detail on the research and methodology of RudolfPöch and his peers in the German and Austrian anthropological circles of hisday. It is important to remember that his research assistant became his wife,Hella Pöch, and that she worked with him in the Austrian prisoner of war campsand learned his anthropometric and ethnographic techniques. When Rudolf Pöchdied in 1921—shortly after the end of World War One—much of his researchmaterial was inherited by his former assistant, University of Vienna ProfessorJosef Wenninger (1886— 1959). Wenninger was a committed National Socialist inAustria at a time when the Party was banned in that country. His researchassistants were all Nazi Party members.75 [../Text/part0020.html#c10-aft75]Hella Pöch continued with her growing interest in paternity studies, which wouldprove to be so valuable to the Reich in identifying who had Jewish ancestry.This obsession with identifying “Jewish” characteristics led Hella Pöch to oneof her more controversial research proposals.It was understood that most studies of European Jews were of the Ashkenazic, orWestern, Jews. These were Jews who had come from Eastern Europe andwho—according to Hella—could be differentiated from the Sephardic (or “Eastern”)Jews who were largely found in Spain and Portugal as well as in the Middle East.It was therefore important—in order to be thorough when it came to identifyingJews for the Reich—that both types of Jews had their racial characteristicsstudied, evaluated, and made available for ready identification by the properauthorities. When the war broke out and the Third Reich was in full swing, the“proper authorities” meant the Race and Settlement Main Office of the SS whichwould make the final determinations when it came to protecting the Aryan racefrom Semitic pollution.But there were not many Sephardic communities in Europe, and virtually none inGermany or Austria with enough “material” for comprehensive research. So Hellalooked eastward, to the Netherlands.As an Austrian anthropologist who had worked with Rudolf Pöch, Josef Wenninger,Martin Hesch, and many others, she also knew Artur Seyss-Inquart. Seyss-Inquartwas a fellow Austrian who had belonged to the outlawed Nazi Party in Austriasince its earliest days. In that capacity, he knew Wenninger and the circle ofacademics around him who were, for the most part, all Nazi Party members aswell. After Anschluss, Seyss-Inquart rose in prominence in the Nazi hierarchy.After the invasion of the Netherlands in 1940, he was made Governor-General ofthat country, overseeing the complete eradication of its Jewish community.Before he could complete the “cleansing” of the Netherlands of all Jews,however, he was approached by his old friend Hella Pöch who wanted to conductsome anthropometric studies on the Sephardic Jews in the Dutch camps.The Netherlands was practically alone in western Europe when it came to having alarge Sephardic community. Based mostly in Amsterdam, they had come to theNetherlands at the end of the fifteenth century from Spain and Portugal—whenKing Ferdinand launched his Inquisition against the Jews at the same time thathe was ridding his country of the last Islamic caliphate in Grenada. The Dutchhad no laws restricting Jews and had become independent from Spanish rule, somany Jews and crypto-Jews (Jews who had converted to Catholicism to save theirlives but who practiced their Jewish faith in secret) made their way from thenow-hostile Iberian penninsula to safety behind Dutch borders.That meant that the Sephardic community in the Netherlands enjoyed a kind offour hundred-year-old unbroken line of genetic “purity” that Hella Pöch couldstudy with benefit. She could study whole families of Sephardic Jews and derivemuch-needed data from these prisoners in the concentration camps, all of whomwere scheduled to be deported to the death camps for “final processing.” Thisdata would help the Reich uncover further evidence of Jewish blood in subjectspreviously thought to be free of Semitic origins.She put the proposal to Seyss-Inquart, who approved it immediately. She and hernew husband—Georg Anton Pöch, a medical doctor like her first husband and chiefmedical officer of the Salzburg Gau—would accompany her on the research trip.Between his medical knowledge and her anthropological training they would beable to conduct a thoroughly professional—if equally hideous—program of study onhelpless prisoners about to be sent away for execution. Hella could imagine theghost of her first husband smiling down at her, congratulating her for havinglearned so much during her first research work in the prisoner of war camps inAustria during World War One. Now, a second World War would provide her witheven greater data, and she could see her name lauded in the peer-reviewedjournals of her profession as she made discovery after discovery.Publish, or perish. Especially in Nazi Germany.But, alas, the project was not to be. Seyss-Inquart was in a tearing hurry torid the Netherlands of all Jews. Before Hella and Georg could pack theirsyringes and calipers most of her potential research subjects were being shovedonto transports for the trip to Auschwitz.When the smoke had cleared, it was learned that the Netherlands had lost nearlyall of its over 100,000 Jews. Of the 140,000 “known” Jews in that country, only30,000 had survived the war. One who did not survive was Anne Frank, who was onthe last train out of the Netherlands headed for the death camp.At the end of the war, Seyss-Inquart was hauled before the Nuremberg court andsummarily hanged.We do not know much about the other activities of Hella and Georg Anton Pöch inthe period of 1940–1945. Prior to the war, however, Hella Pöch was doing a lotof traveling herself, to South Africa and the Middle East. She had made friendswith a number of adventurers and explorers, following in her first husband'sfootsteps, retracing some of his travels, and expanding upon his research. Shealso became the chairperson of the Vienna Anthropological Association,maintaining her relations with the foremost Nazi academics of the day.When it comes to her second husband, Georg, however, we are left pretty much inthe dark. While the life and career of Hella—and of her first husband Rudolf—iswell-documented, at least through the decades of the 1920s, 1930s and early1940s, what we know of Georg Anton Pöch is rather limited. There are referencesto his role as chief medical officer in Salzburg during the Nazi regime, and theassumption that he was involved in euthanasia programs, as well as whatever elseNazi doctors did to amuse themselves. It seemed that, when put next to RudolfPöch, Georg Anton was a bit of a stick in the mud. We don't see extensiveforeign travel by Georg, or a slew of important papers under his name. There area few, here and there, dealing with the etiology of disease, but it's tame stuffcompared to the far-reaching race studies of his wife. We have some evidencethat he went to the United States in the 1920s, for his name shows up on aship's manifest heading for New York. We also have a statement he made to anAmerican tourist visiting Indonesia in the late 1950s that he had a medicaldegree from Johns Hopkins in the States.76 [../Text/part0020.html#c10-aft76]However, a search through the records of that venerable medical school does notreveal the name of Georg Anton Pöch at any time, although the ship's manifestdoes suggest he traveled to the States about the same year he claimed hegraduated.We know that his medical acumen was recognized by at least one Americancolleague, for they co-authored a paper. Charles N. Leach of the RockefellerFoundation co-authored, with Georg Anton Pöch, “A Diptheria ImmunizationCampaign in Austria” for The American Journal of Public Health (February, 1935).Dr. Leach (1885-1971) was a major figure in the Rockefeller Foundation's medicalresearch program and served as the Foundation's director in the Philippines inthe 1920s, with particular emphasis on the etiology and treatment of hookworm inthe islands. Thus, the interests of Leach and Pöch intersected in the area ofpublic health issues; but Leach could not have known that in 1935 his Austriancolleague was already involved with the illegal Nazi Party in Austria along withhis famous spouse. When Pöch got a chance to really shine in the area of “publichealth,” it was only a few years later as the Nazi official in charge of “publichealth” in the Salzburg Gau. This is probably not the path Leach anticipated hisco-author would follow. This is especially poignant when we discover that Dr.Leach was in Manila when that Philippine city fell to the Japanese in 1941, andwas interned, returning to the United States in December of 1943 as part of aprisoner exchange program.77 [../Text/part0020.html#c10-aft77] Other medicalresearch personnel that had been caught in Manila at the time of the Japaneseinvasion were still in Japanese custody at the time, and all the records of theRockefeller Foundation in Manila were destroyed by the invaders. Leach had lostthirty pounds while in Japanese captivity, but that did not stop him. He wouldlater put on a British uniform and try to help prisoners of war at the notoriousBergen-Belsen concentration camp after its liberation in 1945.Charles N. Leach first served in World War One as an ambulance driver and at aMASH-type field medical unit. He was sent by the Rockefeller Foundation to JohnsHopkins to get a degree in public health, and went on from there to becomedeeply involved with the International Health operation of the RockefellerFoundation, serving with the Foundation in China and Japan as well as thePhilippines before the war broke out in 1941. Parenthetically, he served inVienna immediately after the end of World War One, and it is possible that thisis where he met Pöch for the first time. He would return to Austria in 1956 towork at a Hungarian refugee camp.It is tempting to look at the two careers—Charles Leach and Georg Pöch—side byside and come to some obvious conclusions. Leach was a genuine medical hero,working tirelessly in very dangerous circumstances to bring health care andeducation to countries around the world. His co-author, on the other hand, was adedicated anti-Semite and Nazi whose idea of health care was contained withinthe euthanasia programs of the Third Reich. It is true (at least, on paper) thatPöch eventually found himself in Indonesia, in a very remote area, handlinghealth care for the poor and disadvantaged on Sumbawa. If this is true, it mighthave been a search for redemption—an unconscious (?) emulation of his formercolleague, a man, who had suffered from the Axis Powers as a prisoner while Pöchthrived as a Nazi officer. How ironic, then, that Leach would eventually findhimself walking among the desperate prisoners of one of the Reich's ownconcentration camps ... concentration camps whose raison d'etre was put intoplace and legitimized by Hella Pöch, Georg Anton Pöch, and their academic peers.Again and again we find Pöch rubbing shoulders with actual medical men andwomen, with doctors whose primary concern is the healing of the sick. FirstCharles Leach, and then Sosro Husodo, and who knows how many others?For a few years the Pöch couple lived in the city of Eisenstadt, the capital ofthe district of Burgenland in northeastern Austria. It is not certain at whichpoint they moved—if, indeed, they did move—to Salzburg, where Georg Pöch had hisofficial posting. The Russian Army occupied Eisenstadt in 1945, whereas theAmericans occupied Salzburg at the same time. This may be relevant when it comesto a statement that Pöch made to his second wife Sulaesih, that the Russians hadcome to his house and that he had to hide behind a door to escape them.However, as the Testament reveals, both Georg and Hella Pöch were living inSalzburg when they were questioned by the American CIC. Possibly the Pöchs fledEisenstadt and made for Salzburg; but this is doubtful, as it would have beenextremely difficult to break through the Russian lines when the troops wereindiscriminately killing, looting and raping their way through the areas ofAustria—including Vienna—that they controlled.At this point, it will be beneficial to quote as much of the Testament aspossible. It is contained on two pages of the address book, written inGabelsberger shorthand. One of the questions that hovers around analysis of theaddress book is the purpose behind the use of Gabelsberger. Was it only becauseit was easier and faster for Pöch to write in shorthand, or was it an attempt towrite some of the information in code? As Gabelsberger was in common use amongeducated Austrians and Germans at the time, its use as a coding system wouldhave been limited. Thus, it is my opinion that Pöch used shorthand simply as afaster way to record his thoughts, and possibly also as a means of saving spacein the very small address book.What Georg Anton Pöch has done is write down the circumstances of his flightfrom Salzburg to Italy. Parts of this Testament were reproduced in a bookentitled Hitler Mati di Indonesia by the Solonese prince (and arms dealer)Soeryo Goeritno, and also appear in my previous work, Ratline. It was translatedfor Doctor Sosro by the German expert Hans Gebhardt into the German language. Itwas then translated—presumably by Sosro—into the Indonesian language. I haveused the German original as provided in Goerit-no's book and translated the textinto English directly. Thus, any errors are my own.The TestamentShort chronological representation of personal prosecution by the Allies andlocal “authorities” in Salzburg 1946.While the two of us, my wife and I, had been affected relatively little inSalzburg in 1945 (except for an altercation with a Jew who insulted my wife andcame to the apartment with the remark that we should not remain here any longer)the united persecuted group, which consisted of blacks and Jews, about April1946 began—by way of a newspaper article in the communist newspaper inSalzburg—to call the attention of the occupying power, the CIC, to ourselves. Wewere attacked because of the paternity tests and me, especially, because of myjustification towards dismissal from the civil service. There now followedinterrogations by the State Police, the Metropolitan Police, twice with thereason that I had made false statements concerning my membership in the partyand for collaboration with Nazi organizations. Personal freedom of movement wascompletely restricted within the barrier zone until mid-September 1946.Beginning in October 1946 there were visits from a CIC minion named “Topic” (ofcourse, a code name for a Jewish subject, as what these crooks turned out tobe). There were the basic charges, which were obtained both from the Jew Adrowand also the Jew Kohr, which were composed by a Jewish lawyer. Five times we gottogether with the minion of the CIC, sometimes at home and at other times at theCIC itself. His interrogation method began in an ingratiating and seeminglybenevolent manner, but once he let the copy of his own draft indictment fallopen, it was revealed that because of the forgery of my questionnaire and of warcrimes—probably because of alleged persecution of Jews—I was to be taken to CampMacorr.Certainly, personal documents incriminated me which had been dug up from theoffice of the state government, or likely put at his disposal, by Mr v. Kurz, avery inferior subject who eked out his existence by ignominious denunications,doing everything he could to take revenge on me personally. He was certainlyvery much used even by the Judo-Americans because he was the typical, morallyinferior being that was not hard to find, especially since all such tactics arealways built on such foundations.What is interesting is that, until April of 1946, the CIC had no knowledge ofthe Pöchs or of their involvement in the Holocaust until they were informedupon. Thus, my earlier insistence—in Ratline—that the Pöchs were not wanted anddid not appear on any known list of war criminals is justified.Then, on my own, I was able to identify Camp Macorr, something that had beenbothering me since I first saw the name mentioned in the Goeritno book. Camp“Macorr” as referenced in the Pöch Testament is Camp Marcus W. Orr, a POW campset up by the Americans in Salzburg which served as the headquarters of the CIC(the Counter Intelligence Corps), in charge of denazification (at least untilabout 1947). Pöch's remarks in this early part of the Testament is riddled withallusions to “Jews” and he certainly seems to have been a rabid anti-Semite.78[../Text/part0020.html#c10-aft78] How he would have managed to avoid arrest andpossible conviction seems difficult to say once the CIC had his complete dossierat their disposal. The reference to a Mr. v. Kurz is still mysterious, but itseems to have been someone in the Health Office of the Salzburg Gau who had anaxe to grind with Pöch.Then, just before the indictment against Pöch comes down, he decides he has toescape. He can no longer stay in the American zone, which means he has left therelative safety of Austria for a place known only as “J.”79[../Text/part0020.html#c10-aft79] He first goes with his wife to “G,” a city inAustria, where they stay with her relatives while they find a way to get out ofthe country. This information comes from the pamphlet published by SoeryoGoeritno and is based on the complete text of the Testament to which he hadaccess.“G” is Graz, and indeed, is where Hella Pöch has her relatives. An exhaustivesearch through archives has revealed that the family Schürer von Waldheim stillhas members in Graz, and did for decades after the war. It seems from hisstatement that while both are in danger, Pöch feels he is the more obvioustarget and must get away first. The indictment he refers to does not seem tomention his wife, but is only focused on his own role as a Nazi medical officer.Again, according to Goeritno's account of the Testament, he then goes to an area“geographically and strategically difficult.” By analyzing the possible escaperoutes from Graz (as opposed to Salzburg, from where originally I believed theyhad escaped), it is clear that Pöch traveled across the border from Graz toYugoslavia. A look at the map will show that this was the most obvious— althoughquite dangerous—route to take if one wanted to avoid the American Zone. I findmyself agreeing with Sosro that the “J” in this sentence refers to “Jugoslawien”which is the way Yugoslavia is written in German.It seems that his wife was not able to make the initial crossing into Yugoslaviawith her husband but only met him later. Pöch makes his way to “B.” “B” isprobably Bolzano (Bozen), which was the headquarters for a major element of theRatline, and where he would have stayed for quite some time.In December of 1946 he states that they have to go to “R” to get identitydocuments. It can be assumed that “R” means Rome. In any event, he obtains aGerman passport from the German embassy in Rome, but not until 1951. Prior tothat he might have had papers issued by the Vatican, via Draganovic. This iswhere the mystery deepens, for why would he have a passport made out in his ownname if he was wanted by the authorities?There is still a great deal we don't know about Pöch.So the question remains: can this still be Hitler?It is not a Hitler memoir by any means. It is a Pöch memoir. But who was thelast person to own it before Sulaesih? Was the Pöch memoir only one of a set ofdocuments and artifacts (such as the passport), that another escaping Nazi usedonce the Pöchs were carefully disposed of? We can't discount this possibilityyet. Until more information comes in, we are left with the possibility that Pöchmight have been Hitler. But the evidence in the Pöch memoir clearly describesGeorg Anton and Hella Pöch, thus suggesting that they escaped justice in 1946and wound up safely in Italy at the end of that year.Between 1946 and 1953, when someone using the Pöch passport sets sail toIndonesia, anything could have happened. As we have seen, Ernst Kaltenbrunnerhimself was using a real doctor's identity papers—even carrying a medical bag—inhis attempt to escape the Allies from the Salzburg region—the same region fromwhich Pöch has to flee. While the suggestion seems incredible, it is stillwithin the realm of possibility that whoever left the Netherlands for Indonesiain 1953, they were not Georg Anton and Hella Pöch.Why this single-minded goal of reaching Indonesia, with the result that once helanded there he would never leave? We have no evidence that Pöch had ever setfoot in Indonesia before. However, the Pöchs did have friends among high-rankingNazis in the Netherlands (the colonial power ruling Indonesia until about 1950).It is possible that he would have heard a great deal about Indonesia at thattime. That is still not enough motivation to decide to leave Europe forever. Wasthis more Hella Pöch's idea than his?He also spent an inordinate amount of time in the Italian border town ofBolzano, a town full of Nazis on the run, and one of Draganovic's major centersof operation. What was he doing there from 1946 to 1953, a full seven years? Didhe, at that point, become involved in an intrigue the nature of which we do notknow as yet?Once Pöch landed in Jakarta on January 9, 1954 he would never set foot in hisnative land again. In fact, he would never leave Indonesia for the rest of hislife.Before we proceed further, it is useful to look at another document—this one notby Pöch but by an anonymous author of a small notebook. An American traveler inthe region of Sumbawa, Bali, and Flores recorded his meeting with Pöch in thespring of 1956 while on his way to see the Komodo dragons. At this time, Pöchwas living in the town of Dompu on Sumbawa (before his move to Sumbawa Besar).The note-taker states:“150 German doctors brought to Indonesia 3 years ago, mostly in smallcommunities.”It would seem that this was told to the writer by Pöch himself. However, thereis no evidence that what Pöch said is true. If it were true, it would be quiteinteresting. Where would Indonesia get 150 German doctors?80[../Text/part0020.html#c10-aft80]The writer then goes on to describe his travel across the island of Sumbawa, andnotes the prevalence of snakes everywhere—including a fifteen foot python—andmonkeys, and “rolling hills—winding road. Rough as hell! ... Fat goats. Velvethats. ... Snakes slither across road. ... Jungle noises heard over jeep motor.”Then he talks about his meeting with Pöch in Dompu.Pöch tells him that he has been in Indonesia (or specifically on Sumbawa, it'snot clear) for nineteen months. He also says he attended Johns Hopkins from1922–1923. He then goes on to state:“Dr. Pöch says no doctor for Sumbawa's ½ million people until 2 or 3 years agowhen he, Dr Erfenstein [sp?] and an Indian doctor in Bima brought out by govt onthree year contracts.“Endemic malaria and yaws here.“Complained no one teaches natives to grow fruit and vegetables to supplementvitamin deficiencies.“Result people undernourished.“Said only one or two Europeans a year come through here. Last ones from ICA inJakarta.”81 [../Text/part0020.html#c10-aft81]There is no mention of Hella Pöch in the notebook, and the writer continues onwith observations about Sumbawa in general, no longer referencing Pöch.There are a few problems with the notes. The first is identifying the otherGerman doctor, which I have so far been unable to do. This may be a problem withthe writer using a phonetic version of the name. Also, as I have pointed out, Ihave been unable to find any record of Pöch having attended Johns Hopkins in theyears listed.ICA in Jakarta refers to an American economic aid program that was in place bythat time in Jakarta and which was developing financial assistance programs forspecific projects based in the countryside. This is in itself suggestive of amuch larger circumstance, as the ICA—or the International CooperationAdministration, as it was known—was a US State Department program, a forerunnerof the US Agency for International Development, USAID, that was used as avehicle for CIA operations overseas. Created by John Foster Dulles ICA onlylasted a few years (1955–1961) but managed to employ one of the more notoriouspersonalities of American history—Georges de Mohrenschildt—the White Russianbenefactor of accused Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.De Mohrenschildt was working for ICA in Yugoslavia in 1957, ostensibly as partof a geological survey but was accused by the Yugoslav government of spying onmilitary fortifications. He was debriefed on his return to the United States bythe CIA. This may mean nothing, but it is worth noting since the ICA comes up, apropos of nothing, in the notebook composed by this American tourist who wentout of his way to see Pöch. The Doctor tells him that the last “Europeans” whocame through were working for ICA in Jakarta.ICA did indeed have an Indonesian “desk” (the Administration was run along thesame lines as the State Department), and funds were allocated for variouspurposes ranging from agricultural to medical; but the ICA was an Americanprogram, run by the State Department, and somehow employed “Europeans”including, of course, George de Mohrenschildt in its operations. There may bemore to this story, but files pertaining to US-Indonesian relations during theperiod in question are still mostly classified. We are forced to rely onscattered eyewitness testimony and those documents that have managed to escapethe classification process.It still begs the question: who was Dr. Georg Anton Pöch, really? Was he anotherof these mysterious “Europeans” working for ICA in the 1950s? Pöch was a Nazi;de Mohrenschildt was refused direct employment by the US intelligence agenciesbecause of suspicions he had been a Nazi during the war. As a White Russian, itis possible that he was, indeed, a Nazi or at least pro-Nazi. His involvementwith Lee Harvey Oswald—as many authors have noted—had all the elements of anintelligence operation: an anti-Communist intelligence operation on behalf of acabal of rightwing fanatics, perhaps.Sadly, De Mohrenschildt committed suicide on March 29, 1977 on the same day hereceived a request for questioning concerning his relationship with Lee HarveyOswald by an investigator for the House Select Committee on Assassinations.One implication of the notebook is that Pöch at this time spoke English wellenough to have communicated all this to the American traveler passing through.Indeed, Pöch was willing to talk to him. He may have felt safe enough by thistime.But the timeline is a bit problematic. Pöch states that he was there fornineteen months. This was in March of 1956. We know he landed in Jakarta inJanuary of 1954, which represents a period incountry of twenty-six months.Possibly he was in Jakarta for a long period of time—six or seven months,perhaps for some orientation or other training—before being sent to Sumbawa, butwe have no evidence of this as yet.Just as this book was being finished, however, one of those strange coincidencestook place that sometimes happens to researchers. A friend of mine, who is a TVproducer in Hollywood, met a woman—a photographer for national magazines—whosemother knew Hella Pöch. In fact, she had in her possession a valuable additionaldocument: a “Wanted” notice that appeared in Salzburg on September 23, 1946,offering a reward for information concerning the whereabouts of “Dr. Georg Pöchand his wife Hella” last known at Karolinenplaz 2, in Salzburg. That documentappears in the photographic section of this book. The person or agency whoplaced the notice is not identified, giving only an address at the local ticketoffice in the Old Market in Salzburg. Thus, we have further confirmation thatthe Pöch Testament is correct in every respect, for it substantiates Pöch'sclaim that he was on the run in September of 1946.Another document from the same collection indicates that Hella was working fornone other than SS-Captain Kurt Mayer (1903–1945), Director of the ReichGenealogical Authority, who committed suicide at the end of the war. Mayer'soffice was concerned with determining racial purity: an important requirementsince the implementation of the Nuremberg Laws of 1935. The law denied Jews, andother undesirables, positions of influence within the German government,educational institutions, and other areas where they could conceivably pollutethe racially-pure. The document in question is a decision signed by Mayerthat—based on Hella Pöch's findings (she is referenced twice in the two pageletter)—a certain individual has been determined to be Jewish. The letter isdated January 12, 1943, Berlin.Finally, there was the strange meeting in Surabaya.Dr. Pöch—who hated to leave Sumbawa for any reason— would go to Surabaya onJanuary 14, 1970, ostensibly to accompany a patient to a hospital in thatcity.82 [../Text/part0020.html#c10-aft82] He had his heart attack on that date,and died the following day.Why did he go to Surabaya? The report that he was accompanying a patient doesnot make much sense. There is no further evidence that this was the case, andwhy would the Doctor abandon his clinic for the long and exhausting trip to theport city of Surabaya instead of assigning someone else to go? Was he summonedby someone with a claim on his attendance that was too important, too dangerousto ignore? After all, he died the following day.This is, of course, pure speculation: but if someone wanted Pöchdead—retribution for war crimes, perhaps—it would have been quite difficult tokill him on Sumbawa, where a foreigner (or any stranger) would be visible formiles and the subject of endless gossip. On the other hand, Surabaya is a large,bustling, and very busy seaport. Anonymity would have been guaranteed there to adegree unobtainable on Sumbawa.In fact, is there more to the story of Georg Anton and Hella Pöch than meets theeye? The relevance of this story to the larger issue of the Hitler Legacy is tobe found in one of two possibilities: in the first instance, it reveals insomewhat anecdotal form, the flight of a Nazi war criminal to the most populousMuslim nation in the world, a flight consistent with those of other Nazis whowound up in the Middle East, and the conversion of that Nazi to Islam, which isalso consistent. As described in Ratline, Pöch also made a very intriguing visitto the island of Bali during the Year of Living Dangerously, when there was anenormous crackdown on suspected Communists by the army. Bali, itself, sufferedthe massacre of thousands of civilians at the time the enigmatic Austrian doctorwent to visit. He claimed to his new wife, Sulaesih, that he had gone to seeKonrad Adenauer there (an impossibility since Adenauer had never been to Bali inhis life and was no longer Chancellor of West Germany at the time). Thereference to Adenauer is interesting since the former Chancellor was known tohire many former Nazis and place them in positions of prominence in hisgovernment. But if Pöch did not go to see Adenauer, as seems obvious, whom didhe see, and why? What role did Nazi agents have in the overthrow of theseemingly pro-Communist Sukarno regime? Was Pöch, for whatever reason, a part ofthis operation?The second possibility is, of course, the most outrageous: the relevance of thePöch material to the larger question of the Hitler Legacy is the idea that Pöchwas, indeed, what Dr. Sosro Husodo claimed he was. Adolf Hitler himself.As described at length in Ratline, there is no physical evidence to prove thatHitler died in the Berlin bunker on April 30, 1945. In fact, there is so muchbadly planted evidence as to suggest that the suicide story was a completefabrication. Add to that the strange actions of Russian military intelligencepersonnel who transported what were supposed to be the bodies of Hitler and EvaBraun through several East German towns, burying them and then digging them upagain, over and over, and we have what appears to be a cover-up effort ofenormous implications. And then, only a few months after the death of Pöch inSurabaya, Indonesia in 1970, the KGB decides to dig up the “Hitler” body onelast time (after twenty-five years in the ground) and cremate it in a secretoperation, scattering the ashes into a nearby river.Like the cremation, perhaps, of a Hindu ascetic whose ashes are scattered intothe Ganges.75 [../Text/part0020.html#c10-ft75] Wenninger was another Nazi academic who didnot suffer imprisonment or discomfort after the war but who was allowed toregain his position at the University of Vienna as early as 1945.76 [../Text/part0020.html#c10-ft76] I am indebted to Katarina Matiasek for thisinformation and for the copy of the notebook in question, “Komodos, BeyondBali,” as well as for other background information on Hella Pöch.77 [../Text/part0020.html#c10-ft77] Rockefeller Foundation Annual Report, 1941,p.6. and Science, March 31, 1944, vol. 99, no. 2570, p. 260.78 [../Text/part0020.html#c10-ft78] There actually was Jewish translator workingfor CIC in Austria at the time (1946–1948).

I did not see the South African entry for itpointlessly was withheld from me, but I did manage to see the Tibetan entry.Thus, I can attest that Dr. Pöch did indeed have the address of someone who wasliving in Tibet at the time the address book was compiled.That an Austrian Nazi would have a friend or friends in Tibet is not as unusualas it may seem. There had Nazi expeditions to Tibet—I wrote about the mostfamous of these in Unholy Alliance: the SS-Tibet Expedition of 1938—and therehad been a romantic fascination with Tibet on behalf of northern Europeans forat least a century. The Swedish explorer Sven Hedin had traveled in westernChina close to the Tibetan border, and as we will see he was a Nazi sympathizerwho signed his letters “Heil Hitler!”. In fact, there was a Sven Hedin Instituteset up by Heinrich Himmler in admiration for the remarkable travels andadventures of this indefatigable explorer.Other travelers such as Madame Helene Blavatsky and Alexandra David-Neel wroteobsessively about Tibet and the traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, captivating ageneration with tales of mystic powers and the extreme isolation of the HiddenKingdom.But perhaps the most famous traveler to Tibet in the last half of the twentiethcentury was the Austrian mountain climber and SS man, Heinrich Harrer, author ofthe famous memoir Seven Years in Tibet. Escaped from a British prison camp innorthern India, Harrer (1912–2006) would trek across the Himalayas with hisfriend Peter Aufschnaiter (1899–1973). The event would become immortalized inthe film starring Brad Pitt in the role of Harrer.Harrer became a tutor to the young Dalai Lama, teaching him English as well asvarious lessons concerning the way of life in the outside world. Harrer was withthe Dalai Lama up until the Chinese invasion, and left soon before the DalaiLama himself was forced to flee to India.The English-language edition of Seven Years in Tibet bears a foreword by PeterFleming. This in itself is rather interesting, for Fleming was James Bondcreator Ian Fleming's older brother, and the man who got Ian Fleming into theBritish Secret Service. Peter Fleming was a member of the Special OperationsExecutive (SOE) during World War Two, based in Asia, and had met many OSSpersonnel during his sojourn in India at that time. Thus Peter Fleming was atraveler and adventurer who had written his own books, and was experienced inintelligence work, as well as in the culture and history of the Indiansub-continent. He seemed like an excellent choice to introduce Harrer's work onTibet, but was there another agenda?In 1950, China invaded Tibet although its hold over the kingdom was not yetcomplete. There was the Korean War to the east that had just begun, with theUnited States throwing its support behind the South Koreans and conducting whatit called a “police action” rather than a war, a euphemism that fooled no one.China had gained its liberation in 1948 with the ascendance of Mao Zedong andthe Chinese Communist Party. Indonesia had just proclaimed its own independence;the government of President Sukarno would fall fifteen years later due tosuspicions of a Chinese Communist presence influencing his administration.In June of 1951—according to declassified State Department memos—the elderbrother of the Dalai Lama, Thubten Jigme Norbu, known as Taktse Rinpoche, metwith the U.S. Consul General Evan M. Wilson, his attaché Robert H. Linn, twovice consuls, as well as George Patterson (referred to as a “missionary,” whichwas hardly the reason for the presence of this famous explorer at this meeting).The subject of the meeting was, “organizing of resistance in Tibet [and] theprovision of military and financial assistance ...” to the young,sixteen-year-old, king. It should be noted that Heinrich Harrer was still inTibet, at Lhasa, at this time and would have known about the meeting with USofficials from the Dalai Lama himself, since he had become such a close personalfriend of the monarch, if his books are to be believed. (It should also be notedthat the United States was in talks with the government of the Dalai Lama asearly as 1943, via OSS Captain Brooke Dolan, who had impetuously offered theDalai Lama the recognition and support of the US Government, something he wasnot empowered to do and, indeed, this support never actually materialized. Byrecognizing the Peoples Republic of China, the United States is unable torecognize the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile in India, just as it is unable torecognize the Republic of China, based in Taiwan.)Thus we have the strange tableau of an SS man and committed Nazi in Lhasa, atthe same time that his friend, the Dalai Lama, is officially in contact with theUS government concerning the Chinese situation. What did Heinrich Harrer know ofthese negotiations? How much did the Dalai Lama himself know at this time? Evenmore to the point, was American intelligence—in the form of the CIA and theState Department—aware of Harrer's presence in Lhasa and the influence he hadover the king?Harrer would remain a close friend and ally of the Dalai Lama for the rest ofhis life. As a Nazi and a member of the SS as well as of the SA (the SturmAbteilung or Storm Troopers), Harrer would have been a devoted anti-communist,and would have seen in the struggles of the Tibetan people against ChineseCommunism an echo of his own country's fight against the Soviet Union. Harrer,as someone with a demonstrated and intimate knowledge of the landscape, culture,languages, and environment of northern India and Tibet would have been anexcellent choice for American intelligence as an asset to run operations againstthe Chinese. After all, the CIA had hired the Gehlen Organization at the end ofWorld War Two to run ops against the Russians from eastern Europe. ReinhardGehlen was a Nazi intelligence officer who bartered his way to freedom fromprosecution by offering his services (and those of hundreds of his closepersonal friends in the SS, Gestapo, and SD) as an anti-communist fighteragainst the Soviets. It would have made perfect sense to hire Nazis who hadexperience of Asia in the fight against Chinese-style Communism.In fact, as Thomas Laird reveals:Only during the past ten years, State Department documents have beendeclassified that show Harrer may have been involved with several covertoperations for the Americans after he left Tibet.83[../Text/part0021.html#c11-aft83]Tibetans were seen as one of those peoples of Inner Asia—along with Mongols andthe Khazaks—who could be useful in the fight against Communism in that part ofthe world. It would require the weaponization of Buddhism, just as the Cold Warin Central Asia and the Middle East required the weaponization of Islam, but itcould be done. Harrer had the right connections, and as a Nazi, former SS and SAmember as well, he had the anti-Communist credentials. In fact, he had alreadybegun supplying CIA with maps of Tibet, knowing full well that if he was caughtby the Chinese he would be executed as a spy.84[../Text/part0021.html#c11-aft84] Once this relationship with CIA wasestablished, it is likely that he would have been used in future projects—suchas the time he spent in Indonesia in 1962, ostensibly as an explorer, asrecounted in his book I Come From the Stone Age, first published in German in1963. The story as told by Harrer in this volume was so patently false that someacademic reviewers were of the opinion that Harrer had gone to New Guinea forreasons totally unrelated to exploring or ethnography. One such reviewer, DeniseA. O'Brien, went so far as to claim in a review of the book for AmericanAnthropologist that it was “wildly inaccurate,”85[../Text/part0021.html#c11-aft85] saying, “Harrer was either misinformed or hasmisrepresented certain government and mission activities,” and “Ethnographicallyit's useless.” It is the misrepresentation of government and mission activitiesin this book that begs the question of whether or not he was guilty of similarmisrepresentations in Seven Years in Tibet.Then we have Peter Fleming. With his intelligence credentials and his experiencewith espionage operations in India and Southeast Asia, Fleming's friendship withHarrer might inadvertently reveal another aspect of the Harrer story. Was Harrerthen not working only for American intelligence but for the British spy agency,MI6, as well? Great Britain had hired former Nazis for their own purposes,though perhaps not to quite the extent that the Americans and the Russians did.Harrer might have seemed like a safe choice for he had excellent cover. Due tohis fame as an author, and his travels as an adventurer, he was suitably placedto use his profession as a cover for intelligence work.Harrer, of course, was not the first Nazi to visit Tibet. He was not the lastNazi to befriend the Dalai Lama. This story perhaps is upsetting to those whosee in the Tibetan king and priest an icon of peace and of deep spiritualillumination. Nevertheless, it is well-documented. The reader may be excused ifthe implications of this research seem to undermine everything about the DalaiLama and Tibet that he or she has been told or has read over the past fiftyyears or so.Welcome to the club.When the author was first researching the book that would become UnholyAlliance, he was confronted with a mass of documents—stored at the NationalArchives in Washington, DC—of Heinrich Himmler's pet project, the SS-Ahnenerbeor “Ancestral Heritage Research Foundation.” This organization was a boondogglefor crank academics of all sorts, from anthropologists and archaeologists tometeorologists and astronomers. Their brief was to research pre-Christian andnon-Abrahamic religions and cultures, and to prove the existence of the “Aryan”race. In some cases, like that of SS officer Otto Rahn, they were expected tofind hidden relics such as the Holy Grail (among others).One expedition mounted by the SS-Ahnenerbe, and with the specific blessing ofHeinrich Himmler, was the 1938 SS-Tibet Expedition led by Ernst Schäfer andincluding the anthropologist Bruno Beger among the expedition members. While theDalai Lama was only three years old at the time of this expedition, the PanchenLama was available to greet the Nazis to the Himalayan kingdom and to providethem with texts (including the 108-volume Tibetan scripture, the Kangjur),animal and plant specimens, and photographic footage to take back with them. Inaddition, Beger conducted ethnographic and anthropometric research among theTibetans, measuring their skulls with calipers, for instance. Photographs ofthis expedition are still extent and examples of it are found in thephotographic section of this book, including a famous photo of Beger measuringthe skull of a smiling Tibetan maiden.It is possible that one of Ernst Schäfer's missions in the expedition was toform an alliance with the Tibetans against the British in India. Hitler hadintentions of bringing his armies across the Suez, meeting up with Arab armiesto take Central Asia and to invade British-controlled India. Hitler had formedan alliance with Subhas Chandra Bose, the Indian nationalist leader who viewedHitler as an avatar of Kalki: the god who would come out of the North to wreakvengeance on the immoral and unclean world. Had Hitler been successful in hisill-advised Russian campaign, he would have been able to do support Rommel inNorth Africa and to seize the Suez Canal, thus crippling the world's economy andgaining control over the flow of oil. The Arab nationalists would have welcomedHitler as their liberator from the colonial powers of England and France, andwould have rallied around the Nazis as they made for India. Whether they wouldhave been successful that far is anyone's guess and, indeed, the logistics ofcrossing from the Middle East through to Afghanistan and what is now Pakistan,might have given even a German-Arab alliance pause. Nevertheless, that was theplan, and Tibet could have played a role in keeping some of the British forcesin north India occupied and unable to come to the defense of the country in thesouth.To the extent that the Nazi Party was not a political party in any normativesense of the word but a cult, it's members would have found common ground withTibet. Tibet, after all, was a theocracy. The Dalai Lama was the secular ruleras well as the sacred ruler of Tibet. In this, he was not so different from theFührer of the Third Reich, who was the spiritual as well as the political leaderof Germany and the Germans. They both relied on the heavy use of symbols andrituals to maintain power over their populations and—as each of these kingdomsfell to the onslaught of their enemies—it was revealed that this power waslargely illusory.Be that as it may, by the time the SS-Tibet Expedition arrived back in Germany,the Second World War was just beginning. Bruno Beger—the anthropologist with thecalipers—found himself gainfully employed in building an ethnographic museum ofthe human race, moreover one which would demonstrate the superiority of theAryan over the Semitic peoples. In order to do this, he needed a representativesampling of human skulls for his collection.Eighty persons were murdered at Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp tosatisfy this requirement.After the war, Beger was denazified. While he was convicted of the murder ofmore than eighty individuals for the express purpose of building his skullcollection, he never served a day in prison. In fact, he remained a close friendof the Dalai Lama all his life, just as his old SS colleague Heinrich Harrer.And then there was Miguel Serrano.Readers of my Unholy Alliance will be familiar with the name of Serrano. Aformer Chilean ambassador to Austria and India, among other postings, Serranowas one of the earliest members of the Nazi Party in Chile. In the 1930s and1940s he edited a magazine called La Nueva Edad or “The New Age,” which wasfilled with articles on spiritual and political subjects—a kind of SouthAmerican version of Order of the New Templars founder Lanz von Liebenfels'sOstara magazine that so captivated a young Adolf Hitler in Vienna.Serrano developed close friendships with such leading lights as Carl G. Jung,the famous Swiss psychiatrist who has been characterized as pro-Nazi by some ofhis critics, and the German author Hermann Hesse (Siddharta, Steppenwolf Journeyto the East), and wrote a book about these relationships. What many admirers inthe United States and Europe did not realize, however, was that Serrano was anunrepentant Nazi to the end of his days. His other works—many of which are sofar untranslated from Spanish into English, and thus unavailable to the wideraudience that would be horrified to learn of his allegiances—include Hitler: elultimo avatar and El Cordon Dorado: works that combine Indian spiritual conceptsand occultism with emphatically Nazi race science—Rassen-kunde—and Nazipolitical ideology. To Serrano and to many of his followers Hitler was el ultimoavatar or “the last avatar”: a demigod appearing on earth to pave the way forSerrano's “New Age.” This combination of Asian spiritual and esoteric conceptswith patent Nazism was not unique to Serrano, as authors such as NicholasGoodrick-Clarke have pointed out. Indeed, early copies of the Asian-inspiredworks of Mme. Helena Blavatsky—founder of the Theosophical Society—bore theswastika on their covers, not as a nod to Nazism (which did not exist when herbooks were written) but to the ancient Asian use of the symbol whichnevertheless was adopted by the Nazis as emblematic of the Aryan race Blavatskydescribes.Serrano was fired from his post as ambassador when the Socialist SalvadorAllende Gossens was elected President of Chile in 1970. Declassified documentsfrom the Nixon White House reveal the extent to which Nixon and Kissinger hadplotted the overthrow of the democratically-elected Allende even before theinauguration, and with their financial, moral, and military support they wereable to do so on September 11, 1973. What may come as a surprise is the factthat Allende was more than a doctrinaire Socialist. During World War II, he hadbeen an outspoken opponent of Nazism and of his countrymen's allegiance to Naziideals, countrymen like Miguel Serrano.Photographs of Serrano with the Dalai Lama are as numerous as those of BrunoBeger or Heinrich Harrer with the Dalai Lama. Serrano had met the Tibetan leaderduring his tenure as ambassador to India, and later adopted many Tibetanconcepts in his own works. There is an almost childish fascination of Naziideologues with Tibet, as if the romantic stories of Alexandra David-Neel andother famous travelers to the Himalayas had summoned dreams of an ancient andmystical race, dwelling high in the snowy mountains, aloof from the trials andtribulations of the world, concentrating on meditation and the development ofparanormal powers. Some of the responsibility for this romanticism concerningTibet is due to popular writers such as Blavatsky and David-Neel, of course, butalso to the Swedish explorer and adventurer Sven Hedin (1865–1952).The author in Unholy Alliance has written briefly about Hedin and his connectionto the Third Reich. Hedin had traveled extensively in Asia and wrote even moreextensively about it. He was one of those early twentieth-century explorers incompany with some of the other individuals mentioned in the Pöch address book.Hedin ventured deep into the deserts of China and Mongolia, and crawled allthrough Central Asia and across the Himalayas into Tibet. He was a hero to manya European schoolchild, and his exploits were the stuff of legend. An expert onTibet and on the unmapped places of Central Asia, he was in demand as much forhis intelligence value to the Great Game as he was for his spectacular reportson ancient cities lost in the sands of the Gobi, the Taklamakan Desert, andMongolia. Today, his detailed geographical studies and maps of Central Asia arestill in use, most recently by US forces in Afghanistan. Yet only a smallportion of his extensive documentation, books, field notes, photographs, andother resource materials have been studied—so voluminous was his output and sowide-ranging his explorations. Hedin spoke many Asian and European languages anddialects, and this makes a competent and thorough analysis of his work agargantuan task.But Hedin also had a dark side, and this is referenced in Unholy Alliance.Documents have surfaced from the Sven Hedin Institute for Inner AsianResearch—an organization formed by the Nazis—with Hedin's signature and “HeilHitler!” prominently above it. This Institute became part of Heinrich Himmler'sDeutsche Ahnenerbe, the Ancestral Heritage Research Division of the SS. Swedenofficially was neutral during the war, but supplied the Reich with much-neededmachine parts and steel. Sweden was considered almost as Aryan as Germany, sothere was no particular advantage in alienating the country's sympathies with aninvasion. By acknowledging Hedin as a hero and worthy of his own institute, theNazis were incorporating the Hedin body of work into their own repertoire.Although there is evidence that Hedin interceded on behalf of Jewish prisonersin the concentration camps—particularly those who were friends of his—hiswillingness to write articles and books praising the Third Reich and its ideals(admittedly under pressure from the Nazis as a kind of extortion in order tosave his Jewish colleagues from execution) cast a long shadow over his otherwiseillustrious career.To be sure, Hedin was sympathetic towards the Nazis and met with Adolf Hitlerseveral times, even receiving awards and decorations from the Führer. Hedinshared Hitler's aversion to Russia and believed that the peoples of Sweden andGermany should stand shoulder-to-shoulder against the threat from the East. Likeothers we have discussed, his pro-Nazi stance was largely fueled by a fear ofCommunism that was tainted with a racist viewpoint of the presumed barbarism ofthe Slavs. Hedin was an enemy of democracy, preferring instead the dubiousbenefits of a strong monarchy. In this, he would have found a friend in theDalai Lama.I'm always against violence. But the Tibetan guerrillas were very dedicatedpeople. They were willing to sacrifice their own lives for the Tibetan nation.And they found a way to receive help from the CIA.—The Dalai Lama, New York Times interview, 11/28/1993Analysis of recently-declassified documents on the flight of the Dalai Lama fromTibet to freedom in India reveals the extent to which the Tibetan leader wasused by American intelligence as a propaganda tool against Chinese Communism. Inreturn, the Tibetan leader asked for military assistance to support an armedresistance movement against the Chinese ... one that would use Tibetanmonasteries and temples as “safe houses” and part of an underground intelligenceand support network. In other words, the Tibetan equivalent of the RomanCatholic “monastery route.” The parallels between post-war Europe andpost-invasion Tibet are striking.Both Hitler and the Dalai Lama were secular rulers of their respectivecountries. Both had been the spiritual rulers of their peoples as well. Bothrevered the swastika as a symbol of their identity. And both were fightingCommunism: Hitler against Russia, and the Dalai Lama against China. And just asNazi officers were incorporated into the US and British intelligence operationsagainst Russia, so were Tibetan political and military leaders incorporated intoAmerican intelligence and paramilitary operations against China. The followersof both Hitler and the Dalai Lama were (and are) moved by ecstatic worship oftheir leaders and dreams of a paradisiacal future.While the position of the Dalai Lama appears to have mellowed somewhat in recentyears, in the 1950s and 1960s he was a prominent anti-Communist who lent hissupport to American efforts to resist Chinese hegemony in Asia. The CIA trainedTibetan troops in the state of Colorado during this period, sending them back towage a doomed guerrilla war against the Chinese; but the Tibetan troops becameseconded to the Indian Army for direct military action against Bangladesh aswell.This might have been consonant with an esoteric tradition in Tibet, enshrined inthe seminal work of Tibetan Buddhism, the Kalachakra Tantra. In this work,mention is made of the Kalki: a kind of God-King that will storm out ofShambhala (the secret, hidden kingdom in the Himalayas made famous by the filmShangri-La) and put to waste all non-Buddhists, in a jihad worthy of the mostinsane fantasies of frustrated terrrorists everywhere. The Dalai Lama is knownto be fascinated with the machinery of war, as he himself mentioned during theNew York Times interview above-referenced.It would be a stretch to accuse the Tibetans of the same type of war crimes ofwhich the Nazis have been charged. There is no indication of genocide or “ethniccleansing” as a result of Tibetan policies, for instance. However, if wesubtract genocide from the political inclinations of both the Nazis and theTibetans as represented by the Dalai Lama, we are left with the uneasy feelingthat there was much they had in common. Both the Nazis and the Tibetan Buddhistsrepresent religions that are non-Abrahamic in nature. The Nazis embraced a kindof neo-paganism as their spiritual resource, and with it a rejection of theethical and moral ideals of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.It should be noted, however, that the Kalachakra Tantra—which forms the backboneof the type of Buddhism promulgated by the Dalai Lama—includes similar ideas.There is a patent rejection of non-Buddhist religions and the promise of theappearance of the Kalki: an avatar of Vishnu and the last ruler of the Kali Yuga(the dark age in which we presently live). Kalki was associated with Hitler byMiguel Serrano, and by the Indian nationalist leader Subhas Chandra Bose, amongothers. The Kalki would come out of his mystical kingdom of Shambhala at somepoint in the future and cleanse the world of non-Buddhists in a major,apocalyptic-style conflagration. This seems a trifle inconsistent with theconcept of “mercy.” The Dalai Lama is considered to be an incarnation ofAvalokitesvara, the Indian God of Mercy and Compassion; perhaps something islost in the translation.We do not see the Dalai Lama sitting down and smiling benignly with Communistleaders, of course. We do see him embracing Nazis. One can assume that the Seaof Compassion that is the Dalai Lama has managed to bestow mercy on even theseunrepentant war criminals and fear-mongers, and perhaps that is the lesson hewishes to teach us; but it is not a lesson he has the moral right to teach.Just as it wasn't the moral right of the Catholic Church to extend mercy toAdolf Eichmann, Klaus Barbie, Franz Stangl, Josef Mengele ... the list goes onand on. Mercy and forgiveness are the prerogative of the victim, not a bystanderor a co-conspirator. But in each case the “Church”—whether the Catholic Churchin Europe, or the Tibetan “Church” in Asia—extended the hand of friendship tosome of the worst criminals and violators of human rights the modern world hasever known.The declassified Tibet memos show a pattern of collaboration between the Tibetanleadership and the CIA spanning decades.In 1952, the Dalai Lama was warned specifically:“We believe that if you should return to China your life will be in jeopardy.... they will murder you the moment your usefulness to them is over. ... If youleave Tibet and if you organize resistance to the Chinese Communists, we areprepared to send you light arms through India.”A little later that same year:“Gyalo and Shakabpa with DL's knowledge seriously considering forming secretorganization infiltrate Tib from Ind and possibly Nepal using Tib monasteries ascenters anti-Commie resistance, propaganda first, weapons later.”In 1955, the year of the Bandung Conference, the US Department of State reportedthat they would use something called the Tibet Flood Relief Committee, “forpropaganda coup against Chinese Communists, and buttress position Tibetanresistance groups.” It should be noted that the Dalai Lama was in China duringthe Bandung Conference, and had what appeared to be a cordial relationship withPremier Zhou En Lai—who, it is said, was the target of CIA assassinationattempts at the time. In other words, the Dalai Lama was playing a double gamehimself. Of course, this is understandable and forgiveable, as China had invadedhis country and, to all practical intents and purposes, had deposed him as anational leader. But it does indicate that the Tibetan leader was a pragmaticpolitician who was not above shaking hands with Premier Zhou one moment andfomenting an armed resistance against him the other.By 1958, the Tibetan Resistance Army was formally established, with aid andtraining from the CIA.And by March 1959 the Dalai Lama left Tibet on his celebrated journey out of thecountry to India, which granted him and his government-in-exile asylum. A notefrom an aide to the Dalai Lama reads, in part:“The Dalai Lama and his officials arrived safely at the India border March 31.They will arrive at Tawang on April 3. ... You must help us soon as possible andsend us weapons for 30,000 men by airplane.”That level of support did not materialize, however, although there was anairdrop in January of 1961 that served to arm 800 men instead of the requested30,000.This is mentioned in a State Department memorandum for “Special Group/1/” datedJanuary 9, 1964, with the subject line “Review of Tibetan Operations” where itis revealed that:“The CIA Tibetan Activity consists of political action, propaganda, andparamilitary activity. The purpose of the program at this stage is to keep thepolitical concept of an autonomous Tibet alive within Tibet and among foreignnations, principally India, and to build a capability for resistance againstpossible political developments inside Communist China.”In addition, it is revealed in this important memo that the CIA“... is supporting the establishment of Tibet Houses in [less than one line ofsource text not declassified] Geneva, and New York City. The Tibet Houses areintended to serve as unofficial representation for the Dalai Lama and tomaintain the concept of a separate political identity. The Tibet House in NewYork City will work closely with Tibetan supporters in the United Nations,particularly the Malayan, Irish, and Thai delegations.”The Tibet House in New York City is well-known to the author, as he availedhimself of their resources when researching Unholy Alliance. It is closelyconnected to Hollywood celebrities such as Richard Gere, and to such illustriousTibetan scholars as Robert Thurman (father of actress Uma Thurman). The factthat it is a CIA front may have been common knowledge among its supporters, butat the time he was there researching the SS Tibet Expedition in the early 1990s,it wasn't known to your demonstrably naïve correspondent.A memo from the US Embassy in New Delhi, India dated February 11, 2010 gives usthe following statistics:“... approximately 6,000 Tibetans now serve, and over 30,000 Tibetans have beentrained, in Establishment 22, a joint Tibetan-Nepali border force within theIndian Army that reportedly emerged in 1962 following a failed Tibetan uprisingin China. Membership in Establishment 22 was compulsory for Tibetan studentsgraduating from Tibetan Children's Village (TCV) schools until the late 1980s.... They fought in the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 that created Bangladesh and inOperation Meghdoot during the 1999 Indo-Pakistan fighting in Kargil.”In other words, Tibetan students were drafted into Establishment 22 from 1962until the late 1980s, and fought in wars that had nothing to do with Tibetanindependence. Conditions at the TCV were squalid in the extreme—when visitorsfrom outside the community were allowed to inspect it; and all these childrenhad to look forward to after a rudimentary education was forced militarytraining and assignment to various Indian wars against Pakistan and Bangladesh.And, of course, the Indian Nationalist movement had been sympathetic to Hitlerfor precisely the same reasons that Palestine had been: they were both coloniesof the English and saw in Hitler the Kalki Avatar: a semi-divine being whosecoming is foretold in the Kalachakra Tantra, a warrior who will rid the world ofevil.None of this is particularly unique to fascist or Nazi regimes, obviously.Communist countries and democratic countries can be accused of the same, orworse. But it is the disconnect between the popular image of Tibet as aspiritually-advanced Buddhist paradise (at least, before the Chinese invasion),and the reality of pointless and ineffective armed struggle, the drafting ofchildren to fight the wars of other countries, and the close collaboration ofthe Tibetan leadership with the CIA and with Nazi academics and war criminalsthat makes one pause.Once we realize that the world is really not what it seems, that a realisticappraisal of international politics and military adventures necessarily leadsone to understand that most of what we learn in school and in the media ispropaganda and manipulation, we can better come to grips with such seeminglyoutrageous claims that Hitler escaped to Indonesia, or that there was a shooteron the Grassy Knoll, or that 9/11 was an inside job. This doesn't mean that wehave to believe six impossible things before breakfast, but it does requireus—if we are to maintain any degree of intellectual integrity—to questioneverything we hear. This applies not only to government press releases andfront-page headlines, but also to the conspiracy theorists and the madmen onboth sides of every political aisle.Heinrich Harrer was just as comfortable in the company of Hitler as he was withthe Dalai Lama. He stood at a nexus between what we believe was the most evilman of the twentieth century and the holiest man of the twentieth century. Howwas this possible? Was Harrer some kind of psychopath in need of intensivetherapy, or is the therapy better applied to ourselves—who so naövely believe insuch convenient dualities as “good” and “bad,” “right” and “wrong,” Nazi andCommunist, war criminal and saint? Perhaps Harrer achieved that kind of advaitaor non-duality that is the goal of Tibetan Buddhism—represented in his balancingact between Hitler and the Lama—bringing them together in his fractured soul assome kind of Unity.

As the abovequotation demonstrates the Japanese Zen community realizes that they werecomplicit in the Asian version of the Holocaust. This one was aimed at theChinese, Koreans, and other nationalities in the Asia Pacific theater ofoperations during what Westerners call World War Two, and the Chinese call theGreat Imperialist War of Aggression.This is a relatively new branch of religious studies, one that is controversial.It is sure to be upsetting to many people as they realize that one of the mostrevered authors on Zen Buddhism—D. T. Suzuki (1870–1966)—was, in fact, a devotedfascist who glorified the role of the Japanese warrior in the conquest of China.What may come as a surprise to many others is the fact—amply supported bydocumentation—that one of the Western world's most respected interpreters of ZenBuddhism, Karlfried Graf Dürckheim, was a Nazi Party member, SA man since 1933,and the head of Nazi propaganda in Japan, reporting directly to Reich ForeignMinister Ribbentrop. A committed Nazi, Dürckheim was eventually arrested byAllied forces after the fall of Japan and sentenced to sixteen months in prison.These two men—Suzuki and Dürckheim—became fast friends for the duration of thewar. They had a great deal in common, and Zen was the glue that bound themtogether. Bushido—the “way of the warrior”—had resonance for both the Nazis andthe Japanese nationalists. The latter were slaughtering their way across thelength and breadth of Asia. Zen Buddhism, like Islam, had become weaponized.The critical point to take away from this discussion is the fact thatreligion—religious organizations, influential clergy, even religioussentiments—could become the servant of the state. Spirituality, often consideredthe highest form of human experience, becomes relegated to being another tool ina government arsenal designed for causing the violent end of another human beingand the victory of the state over another nation, ethnic group, or religiousentity. This is, after all, what a “holy war” is: men and women united under onereligion, sect, or denomination slaughtering men and women united under another.It becomes difficult to differentiate whether religion is the cause or themedium for violent conflict; from the point of view of both the victims and theperpetrators, it probably doesn't matter.In the case of Buddhism, it seems counter-intuitive that a philosophy whose mostexalted practitioners refuse to eat meat or to harm any living thing could berecruited to convince a lay population to take up arms and invade anothercountry, murdering its inhabitants, and claiming that this is consistent withwhat the Buddha taught. Yet, this weaponization of religion is precisely whattook place in the twentieth century under the influence of extreme nationalismin Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Japanese nationalism was seen as analogousto—if not identical with—the nationalist movement in Germany, and observers andcommentators noted this similarity favorably.Brian Daizen Victoria has been writing about this phenomenon in a number ofpeer-reviewed journals—notably The Asia-Pacific Journal—and has published anumber of books on the subject. Speaking Japanese and having access to thepreviously-unknown war writings of D.T. Suzuki and many other Zen masters, hehas revealed—not without controversy—the understanding of Zen initiates thatBushido (the “way of the warrior”) and Zen Buddhism are inextricably linked.Further, that mindless devotion to the state and following its orders—no matterwhat they are—constitute the highest form of Buddhist selflessness. The writingsof these Japanese monks and scholars on the subject of suicide, and thewillingness to face death and lose one's life in the service of the Empire, canbe compared to those of Islamist suicide bombers and terrorists, with littledistortion between the two. What difference, after all, is there between aPalestinian in a suicide vest and the Kamikaze pilots of Japan? We may say thatthe former are non-state actors (in the current parlance of terrorism studies)and therein lies the difference, but the key motivation that makes it possiblefor a human being to fly a bomb into a ship is the same as that which inspiresthe suicide bomber to ignite his vest. They are both losing their lives for ahigher cause, and causing as much human devastation as possible in the process.Unfortunately, this higher cause has been defined and codified by other humanbeings with ulterior motives, cynical men and women who are undestandablyreluctant to follow suit. The manipulation of spiritual beliefs and sentimentsby state and non-state actors alike is nothing less than what they used to call“mind control” back in the 1950s and 1960s. The weaponization of religion is ameans of controlling (and weaponizing) the human psyche on a massive scale,using terminology and symbolism that are widely recognized by the masses and notspecific to any individual. Religious feelings are strong, but they are alsoambiguous and largely resistant to logic and verbalization, and thus subject tore-interpretation and redirection by a competent leader. It is the religiouspassion itself that is the food of the political and military commander; itmatters little whether the outward manifestation of that passion is devotion toJesus or Marx, Buddha or the Emperor. It is the closest emotion to love, andlove, as we are reliably informed, conquers all.Karl Friedrich Alfred Heinrich Ferdinand Maria Graf Eckbrecht vonDürckheim-Montmartin (1896–1988), to show him in all his Teutonic glory, wasborn in Munich to aristocratic but impoverished parents. He served withdistinction in World War One, seeing action at Verdun and the Battle of theSomme, and was awarded several honors. Returning to Bavaria after the war, hejoined a Freikorps brigade. This in itself is very revealing, for the Freikorpswere the militias that fought against Bolshevism in the streets of Munich.Composed of former soldiers of the defeated Kaiser's army, they roamed throughthe city like heavily armed gangs. Many of the men who would later becomeprominent in the Third Reich had been members of one Freikorps brigade oranother, such as Ernst Röhm and Heinrich Himmler.It was during the tumultuous period of the Weimar Republic in Germany thatDürckheim got his first taste of Asian religion. He had come across a copy ofthe Dao De Jing that his future wife was reading. A passage in the book causedDürckheim to experience a sudden and brilliant illumination, a kind ofsatori—setting him on the path he would follow for the rest of his life.In 1923, Dürckheim received a doctorate in psychology, and by the early 1930s hewas on intimate terms with the Reich's foremost geopolitical theoretician (andfellow Bavarian) Karl Haushofer. Haushofer (1869–1946) had been a general in theKaiser's army during World War One. Depressed by Germany's defeat, he becameobsessed with finding a solution to his nation's ills. This led to hisdevelopment of geopolitics, and the insistence that Germany become more aware ofthe global political situation and its role within it. Haushofer developed theidea of lebensraum—or “living space”—that was used to such great effect by theNazis to legitimize their conquest of Eastern Europe.The bond between Dürckheim and Haushofer was most likely their sharedappreciation of Asian religion and culture. Haushofer had spent years travelingin Japan as well as through parts of China, Korea, and Southeast Asia in theyears before the First World War. He recognized the natural affinity betweenJapanese nationalism and the growing German nationalism represented by the NaziParty, and sought to create political bonds between the two countries, in partbased on their mutual abhorrence of Communism, and their glorification of thewarrior as the best symbol of national identity. His philosophy had tremendousimpact on the ideas of Adolf Hit-ler—who adopted lebensraum and othergeopolitical ideas created by Haushofer—as planks in his party's platform.Haushofer's son Albrecht would later be implicated—rightly or wrongly—in theJuly 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler's life and was executed by the SS.Haushofer himself was captured by the Allies, interrogated, and then in March of1946 committed suicide, together with his wife. After his death many rumorsflourished about the mysterious philosopher, including that he had been a memberof the Thule Gesellschaft, had created his own secret society, had been astudent of Gurdjieff, etc. none of which has been proven. He did, however, havea long friendship with Rudolf Hess, who served as the second-most-powerful manin Germany until his bizarre flight to Scotland in May of 1940, on what has beendescribed as an abortive peace mission. Hess had his own esoteric credentials,of course, having been born in Alexandria, Egypt and become fascinated withoccultism and astrology. It is said that the date of his flight to Scotland hadbeen determined through the use of a horoscope—thus leading to the arrest andimprisonment of astrologers throughout Germany once Hess's flight had becomeknown. It has been claimed that Haushofer knew in advance of Hess's intentionand this might have been another reason for his falling out of favor in the lastdays of the Reich.Thus in Karl Haushofer, as well as Karl Dürckheim, we have ardent Germannationalists and war veterans with a deep and abiding interest in Asia andspecifically Japan. In 1933, Dürckheim joined the Nazi Party and the SA(Sturmabteilung, or Storm Troopers). He was sent briefly to South Africa wherethere was a large German colony with the mission to urge the local Germans tosupport the Reich. During this period he made contact with the Nazi undergroundin that country. (There was a South African reference in the Pöch address book,as mentioned, as well as in the Rudel address book.)A problem arose, however, when it was discovered that Dürckheim'sgreat-grandmother was Jewish, the daughter of Salomon Oppenheim. Incredibly,this means that Dürckheim was related to Max von Oppenheim, the creator of theconcept of global jihad. The services of the German doctor were too valuable tojettison, however, and in 1938 he was sent instead to Japan as a special envoyof Ribbentrop rather than lose his status within the Party. As a Mischlinge, ormixed blood, it is conceivable that under normal circumstances, he would havebeen dropped from the Party rolls and would have found it difficult to findwork.Instead, Dürckheim flourished in Japan. He met D.T. Suzuki and the two mendeveloped quite a friendship. He was under orders by Ribbentrop to develop Nazipropaganda in Japan, and he did that by emphasizing the correspondences betweenthe Nazi warrior ideal and that of Japan—which was by now fully engaged inManchuria. By 1937, Japan had invaded China with devastating results.Dürckheim's exposure to Suzuki had profound implications for generations ofspiritual seekers in the West. After the war, when the psychologist foundhimself back in Europe developing his own method of analysis, it was he whointroduced the concepts of Zen Buddhism—and specifically those of his friend,D.T. Suzuki—to America and Europe. He was a friend of Alan Watts, and this pavedthe way for the writings of Suzuki to become better known. It is now safe to saythat these two men, more than any other, introduced Zen Buddhism to a wideaudience in the Western world and made it fashionable and even trendy.And they were both Nazis. Dürckheim was a card-carrying member of the Party anda Storm Trooper, working for the Reich's Foreign Ministry, and promotinganti-Semitism as well as German nationalism around the world. Suzuki was afellow-traveler, an admirer of Hitler and the Nazi Party, who agreed that thesimilarities between Bushido and Zen, on the one hand, and Nazism, on the other,meant that the two countries were on the same page both politically andspiritually.Suzuki was not the only Zen scholar who felt that way, but to Western eyes hewas easily the most important, since he was the author of seminal works on Zenthat were widely read in America and Europe. Other Zen masters also chimed inwith their appreciation of Nazism, but especially extolling the virtues of thewarrior's way and the spiritual beauty of fighting and dying for your country.Partly this was due to a Japanese government proclamation in 1937 calling for“the total spiritual mobilization of the people.”87[../Text/part0022.html#c12-aft87] Based on the understanding that “total war”included enlisting not only factories and farms in the war effort but religionas well, this proclamation was a call to arms for Zen Buddhist teachers andmonks to instill in the Japanese people an almost supernatural desire to fightand die for the Emperor. This was carried out with alacrity, as more and moreZen scholars chimed in with their support of Japan's invasion of China and thebrutal suppression of an entire race.Suzuki himself had direct experience of Nazi Germany and its programs, for hewent to Europe in 1936 to deliver a set of lectures on Zen. While in Germany helistened to many people discuss their admiration for Hitler and their hatred ofthe Jews. Thoughtfully recording his thoughts on these conversations, he wrote:The fact that they have no country is karmic retribution on the Jews. Becausethey have no attachment to the land and are wanderers, it is their fate tointrude into state structures created by others. ... In the case of today'sGerman people they find it extremely difficult to accept their country beingdisturbed by a foreign race.88 [../Text/part0022.html#c12-aft88]This is essentially the Nazi Party line. In fact, as Brian Daizen Victoria notesin the same article from which the above quotation was extracted, the editor whowrote the foreword to Suzuki's book on Bushido published in 1941, claimed: “Dr.Suzuki's writings are said to have strongly influenced the military spirit ofNazi Germany.” It would be astonishing indeed, and not a little demoralizing, todiscover that Zen Buddhism had made the Waffen-SS even more courageous, morebrutal, more dedicated than they already were. Perhaps it was the relationshipbetween Suzuki and Dürckheim that gave greater impetus to the pollenization ofthese ideas in both cultures.A related article,89 [../Text/part0022.html#c12-aft89] this time by Dr. KarlBaier of the University of Vienna, gives careful attention to those ofDürckheim's writings that are more closely focused on Nazism, texts that are noteasily accessible to American readers and which have not yet been translatedfrom German. They are revealing of the way that the German Zen aficionado feltabout National Socialism, and its role in tapping into the unconsciouswellspring of the German Völk in order to achieve spiritual enlightenment. Thisemphasis on the Völk—the German people themselves, considered as a whole racialunit—is exclusionary on its face, and would not include members of other ethnicgroups no matter how long they may have lived in the country. In this rendering,the German people are those with the deepest connection to the land itself.Those with no such relationship—such as the urban Jews—could not possibly hopeto understand, much less participate in, this type of mystical union. It wassynonymous with the “blood and soil” mystique of Nazi philosopher Walther Darré,who was in charge of German agriculture under the Reich, as well as some of itsmore pagan elements.As Suzuki says above, the Jews are wanderers without connection to the land. andare therefore a “disturbing” foreign element in Germany. This was, of course,the basis for the complaint against Soviet-style Communism—in that it was a“foreign element” that was not indigenous to either Russia or Germany, but anartificial creation by people who had no bond with the soil, and therefore couldagitate for such imaginary constructs as human rights, workers unions, and theseizure of land and property that was not “theirs.” This is a point of view thateasily can be ported to other political positions, such as the rejection ofcolonialism that is the hallmark of Islamist activism.To quote Dürckheim from a work published in Japan in 1942:The accusation of harshness, which is time and again levelled against NationalSocialism, is a typical statement of a sort of mankind that cares aboutindividuals and has lost sight of the superior whole.90[../Text/part0022.html#c12-aft90]This defense of Nazi brutality was echoed by Suzuki, when he defended Germany'streatment of the Jews on the basis that Germany was in a state of crisis and hadto take extreme measures to defend itself. The jibe at the “sort of mankind thatcares about individuals” is an indictment of the theory of human rights, whicheven Marx characterized as a “Jewish” invention to guarantee a level of survivalfor themselves in a hostile world.91 [../Text/part0022.html#c12-aft91]It is this acceptance (if not worship) of extremism in any form— political,military, even religious—that is one of the defining characteristics of bothNazism and the kind of Bushido or Zen warrior philosophy represented by Suzukiand Dürckheim. It is part of the warrior principle that sees no value inanything less than supreme effort and extreme conduct, even to the point ofdeath (your own, or others'):German soldiership could well be the starting point of a comprehensiverealisation of the German mind.92 [../Text/part0022.html#c12-aft92]This is consistent with Bushido philosophy, especially in the way it wasinterpreted at the time by Suzuki and other Zen scholars, who saw in thisquintessentially Japanese practice all the best characteristics of what it meansto be Japanese. In an era of total war, every human being is a soldier; andtherefore every human being is a warrior hero, achieving his or her apotheosison the battlefield, dying selflessly in an ecstasy of spiritual union with theDivine.In this concept, the individual achieves completeness through sacrifice for thegood of the community, what Dürckheim calls Gemeinschaft. The community, in theDürckheimian sense, can only be composed of individuals who share a commonorigin, even a common ancestry. There is no voluntary “joining” of such acommunity; you are a member by virtue of your blood. In spilling that blood, youreaffirm your membership, your social identity; because your blood is not yourown but the product of the race that bore you, which itself comes from the landthat nourishes the race:As the centre of this faith we find the breakthrough of the great subjectGermany within the individual. ... the inspiring force coming from the joyfulexperience of a higher whole, that resides within you and wants to becomereality through you—and this with such a power that one cannot help but to servethis higher will and sacrifice everything that is only personal.93[../Text/part0022.html#c12-aft93]This exclusionary principle rejects the scientific fact that the percentage ofgenetic difference between a member of the Nordic “race” and a member of theJewish “race” is negligible, and that all humans are products of the same planetand share the same earth. Yet, how can Dürckheim show respect for the Japanesewho are not, after all, German Völk?To him the Japanese represented a different—but just as racially-pure—Völk. Theyare a product of their land, with an ancient history and continuity that demandsrespect from the only other pure race on the planet, the Aryan. Both Germany andJapan, according to Dürckheim, are higher cultures that have taken foreigninfluences (Christianity and Buddhism, respectively) as creative challenges,enabling each to discover within themselves their true Völkisch identities.94[../Text/part0022.html#c12-aft94] What is left is not Christianity or Buddhismin their original forms, for these religions are international in scope (likeCommunism) and therefore repress the natural racial characteristics of thepeople they try to convert. (This same argument can be used to describe howNazism was at once National and Socialist.) Both Germany and Japan valued thesoldier, the warrior, the hero above all other cultural archetypes. The bravehuman being who is so dedicated and spiritually pure that to risk everything,even life, for the sake of the community, the Gemeinschaft, the Völk, theEmperor, is a joy and a duty. Obviously this has resonance with the suicidebomber and the terrorist who die for their religion, too, theoretically out ofidentification with a different type of Völk—the coreligionist—but which isreally a reaffirmation of the same ideals as the Nazi storm trooper and the Zenmartyr. Both Nazism and the type of militant Zen we are discussing wereemotional responses to the effects of military or cultural defeat by foreignpowers (the humiliation of the German defeat in World War One, the effects offoreign subjugation of Japan during the Meiji Restoration). Both countriessuffered the agony of what was perceived to be moral and spiritual decadence anddecay, as a result of gross materialism and abandonment of spiritual valueswhich had weakened each nation and made them vulnerable to foreign influences.In order to overcome the effects of this degradation it was necessary to returnto the old ideals that had served the empires—and the caliphates—so well. Thisis in line with every popular Islamic reformer from Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab(the eighteenth century founder of Wahhabism) to Sayyid Qutb of the MuslimBrotherhood, (whose two years spent in the United States on a scholarshipconvinced him of the emptiness of Western values and of the need to return to afundamentalist approach to Islam; and which led him to attempt the assassinationof Nasser in 1954 when he realized the Egyptian president would not turn hiscountry into a theocracy).This return to one's roots is echoed in Dürckheim's glowing description ofJapan's return to its primal nature, it's “völkisch power.”95[../Text/part0022.html#c12-aft95] Baier goes on to state that, according toDürckheim, “the primal source of Japan's power was the politicizing of itsoriginal faith.”96 [../Text/part0022.html#c12-aft96]In 1940, and writing under a pseudonym, Dürckheim would clarify what he meanteven further:The righteous man does not revolt out of selfishness. But if his honor isconcerned, if his nation is in danger or God's concern is violated withinhimself or within the World, then this calls him to fight and transform him intoa sword.97 [../Text/part0022.html#c12-aft97]Dürckheim would be released from prison after the war and return to take up hisformer profession as a psychoanalyst in Germany in 1947. His books andconferences blending Zen Buddhism with depth analysis and what he called“Initiation Therapy” became quite popular, and he began to develop close tieswith Western commentators on Asian religions, such as Alan Watts, AlbertStunkard, and Philip Kapleau. At his suggestion, some of them began to make thevisit to Japan to seek out Suzuki, his old mentor, and the explosion of Zenliterature and practice in the West began.Dürckheim—Nazi Storm Trooper, psychoanalyst, and popular-izer of ZenBuddhism—died in 1988 at the age of 92. D.T. Suzuki had died much earlier, in1966, but not until he had changed the discourse in the Western world concerningZen. His fierce nationalism and defense of the Japanese invasions of Korea andChina were not well-known at all outside of Japan, and even then to only a smallcircle of like-minded scholars. The exception would be his student, Dürckheimhimself, who held identical views. Both of these men, responsible for thetremendous interest in Zen in the West in the post-war period, kept this secrethistory to themselves. Like Heinrich Harrer, they lived in a state of denialconcerning their Nazi (and Japanese nationalist) past. That is not to say thatthey disavowed their beliefs for they did not. Whatever their later views orjustifications, by 1945 the damage had been done. An entire generation of Germanand Japanese soldiers represented the politicization of religion by the state,the weaponization of spiritual beliefs by secular governments. This tactic wouldbe taken up again and again in the decades that would follow, by American spies,extremist zealots, and Islamist jihadists.Dürckheim's psychotherapeutic system, perhaps unconsiously, mimics his politicalbeliefs. His “wheel of metamorphosis” represents this perhaps as well asanything else. In this system there are three stages to psychological change.The first stage is described as “All that is contrary to essential being is tobe relinquished.” The second stage involves “dissolving” that which has beenrelinquished. The third stage involves the development of a new core of beingthat is free of those elements that were “contrary to essential being.”Taken as a description of Dürckheim's and Suzuki's views on how the “Jewishquestion” should be handled in the ongoing purification of the Völk, it isremarkably consistent. There is no mention of integrating disparate elements ofone's personality, for instance, but only of removing those elements that arenot identified as being part of one's essential being, i.e., of purifying thecore and ridding it of foreign influences. Thus, even some forms ofpsychotherapy are not immune from what we have been calling the Hitler Legacy.86 [../Text/part0022.html#c12-ft86] As referenced in Brian Daizen Victoria,” Zenas a Cult of Death in the Wartime Writings of D.T.

It wasentitled Hitler Mati di Indonesia (“Hitler Died in Indonesia”) and was writtenby Soeryo Goeritno, a man described as a prince of the Solo Sultanate, as wellas a fight promoter and a member of a band called Equator.What the author bio does not state, however, is that Soeryo Goeritno is an armsdealer.His date of birth is given as January 30, 1943. In 1964 he began studying at theGubkin Oil and Gas Institute in Moscow. This was during the last years of theSukarno era, when the Indonesian leader had developed ties to Communist regimes.Sometime during his Moscow period he met and married Lyudmila Alexandrovna, whobore him two sons.He returned to Indonesia with his wife and sons in 1971, but that was during theearly stages of the Soeharto “New Order” era, and his connection to the SovietUnion was not appreciated at the time. He held a variety of odd jobs, includingtaxi driver, until 1980 when Soeharto resumed relations with the Soviet Union.People with Goeritno's background, training, and fluency in the Russian languagewere suddenly valuable commodities. He began arranging technology transfers onbehalf of the Indonesian government.We are not certain when his involvement in the arms trade began, but by 1993 hehad formed PT Novanindro and the arms deals began in earnest. PT Novanindro wasGoeritno's brainchild, and he used it as a facility to buy weapons from Russiabut also from other countries and sources. At one point he even claimed that hesold weapons to the Taliban in Afghanistan.These were not limited to small arms. PT Novanindro was involved in everythingfrom AK-47s to helicopters and rocket launchers, and the sales were notrestricted to Indonesian military or political requirements. His company wasapproached by separatist movements in Indonesia as well, such as the rebels inAceh (with whom he says he declined to trade).He has maintained his close links to Russia even after the fall of the SovietUnion, as is obvious from the timeline. His ability to move easily into theworld of arms trading reflects contacts he made in Moscow while still a studentthere, with fellow students who went on to occupy positions in the Russianmilitary and intelligence services. At the same time, due to his influence inthe Indonesian government, he also has extensive contacts in that country'smilitary and intelligence services, as well as with its leading politicalfigures. Goeritno is proud to point out that he has been personally acquaintedwith every president of Indonesia since Soeharto.Short in stature, bearded, and wearing his trademark cowboy hat, Goeritno becameinvolved in a series of other projects that had nothing to do with arms. Hebecame involved with a rock band, called Equator (about which not much is known)and as a fight promoter, representing Chris John. It is as if his early daysscrounging around Jakarta, looking for work after his return from Moscow, hasscarred him for life, and he seeks out things to do that are unconnected to eachother.Like pursuing the Pöch story.It is not known exactly when Goeritno became interested in this affair, or why.What we do know is that he wrote (or, as the author believes, hired someone elseto write) the book that became a kind of Indonesian bestseller on the subject.He did this with some limited access to the original Pöch documents now beingheld in Singapore. It is assumed that he had photocopies of many of these (morethan this author had at his disposal) as well as the Sosro memoir, for he quotesfrom the memoir extensively without attribution. The book has some informationon Hitler, Klaus Barbie, and the escape routes—but these are almost completelycribbed from the Sosro memoir, which themselves are taken from popularjournalistic accounts of the mid-1980s. Clearly, Goeritno's thesis is that Pöchactually was Hitler, and he refers to him as “Hitler” throughout the text.Goeritno deviates from the Sosro memoir in two places in particular. In thefirst he references the discovery—made in 2009 by Dr. Nick Bellantoni—that theskull the Russians claim is Hitler's skull is actually that of an unrelatedfemale. That discovery caused ripples in the international press where it waswidely reported. It was this single event that triggered a landslide ofspeculation as to the lack of forensic evidence that Hitler died in the bunker;and cases were made for the Führer's escape to Spain, Argentina, and—with theSosro memoir—Indonesia. It became the foundation of a Mystery Quest special forthe History Channel on “Hitler's Escape,” a well-done piece of journalism thatfollowed Dr Bellantoni to Moscow, where he examined the skull in front of thecameras and then managed to bring a small piece of it back with him for forensictesting in Connecticut.I had had the good fortune to have spoken with Dr Bellantoni by phone in theearly 1990s concerning another sensational case with which the StateArchaeologist of Connecticut was involved—the famous “vampire cult” discoverythat took place in eastern Connecticut near the Rhode Island border. When thenews broke of the Moscow skull—and as it dovetailed nicely with my own researchon Pöch—I phoned him again and asked for his opinion. He very kindly spoke to mefor awhile about the case. It was his opinion that Hitler was too sick to havetraveled out of Berlin in the last days, and that he had probably died in Berlinduring the Soviet advance on the city.When I asked him if it would be necessary to dig up the Pöch grave in Surabayato ascertain if the body was indeed that of Pöch or Hitler, the question of DNAcame up. The only Hitler DNA in private possession was obtained unethically, hetold me, and the surviving members of Hitler's family do not wish to cooperatein any way with this type of research, so we were at an impasse.Then he told me that perhaps one of the more important things to look for—incase the body in the Pöch grave was ever exhumed—was the height of the body. Ifthe height was off, he said, there was no way it could be Hitler's.As it turns out Pöch's height, as shown in the passport, closely matchesHitler's known height.The second piece of information not contained within the Sosro memoir wasGoeritno's own research undertaken (by himself or by an associate) in SumbawaBesar. He managed to locate some individuals who had known Pöch and his secondwife Sulaesih, and interviewed them for the book. There is not much in theinterviews that adds to our understanding of the case, but the original researchindicates that Goeritno took the project seriously enough that he spent the timeand money necessary to follow up every available lead: in Bandung, in Sumbawa,and in Surabaya.His book ends with photographs of himself standing over the Pöch grave in theSurabaya cemetery.Hitler Mati di Indonesia was published in 2010, hot on the heels of theBellantoni revelations concerning the “Hitler” skull. It appeared just as I wasdoing my own independent research on the case, and the information contained inthe volume was helpful and frustrating at the same time. Goeritno—or hisghostwriter—had little understanding of the context of the war in Europe andmade a number of incorrect assumptions, which I was at pains to correct. Also,only scraps of the Sosro memoir were provided, including some of the PöchTestament that only added to the confusion. The German translation in theGoeritno book was replete with typographical errors, and it seemed theIndonesian language translation was similarly degraded. In addition, whilephotocopies of some of the relevant documents were reproduced in the book, theirquality was so poor that it was difficult to make out the texts.Still, with all of that, it was a useful guide insofar as it went, but I wishedI had more.The question that lingered long after I had finished writing Ratline was thecharacter and motivation of Goeritno himself. He was wealthy and was still beinginterviewed concerning Indonesian policies and military matters long after hisbook was published. He was a mover and shaker in the world of Indonesian—andinternational—politics and, of course, the global weapons trade. Why would heidentify himself so strongly with the Pöch case?Was there another agenda?As he became older in the first and second decade of the twenty-first century,he found himself becoming more cautious. One newspaper interview with Goeritnohas him staying away from windows, admitting he was afraid of snipers. It seemsmelodramatic, but the sense one gets from the news reports is that Goeritno hadbecome paranoid about people wanting to do him harm. He may have been correct inthat assumption, for in mid-2012, Soeryo Goeritno had been summoned to Moscowfor a last minute meeting.It was a quick trip, and unusual for Goeritno. There was none of the usualwining and dining that normally takes place under these circumstances. He wascalled to Moscow, and then was back on a return flight the same or the followingday. As he passed through Customs and Immigration at Jakarta's Sukarno-HattaInternational Airport, he suddenly fell to the floor in a seizure.He has been in a wheelchair since that day, unable to speak. The cause of hisseizure is unknown.Was there a hidden agenda to Goeritno's uncommon interest in the Pöch affair?I learned, during the course of this investigation, that before his stroke orseizure or whatever it was that had silenced him, Soeryo Goeritno had formed ajoint venture with Singapore's most prominent corporation—Temasek—for thepurpose of mining for gold.On Sumbawa.The money aspect of this case is the thread that ties all of these disparateelements together. Our other arms dealers—Skorzeny, Genoud, and Mertins, forexample—were dedicated Nazis as well as businessmen involved in trading guns formoney all over the world. It is entirely possible that their paths would havecrossed with Goeritno's at some point, for the world of the arms dealer is quitesmall. This becomes especially true when markets overlap, such as in Afghanistanwhen American, Russian, and Chinesemade arms competed for share.However, I have not been able to uncover any declassified files on Goeritno.This may be due to the fact that he was primarily a dealer for the Indonesiangovernment and had ties to the Soviets, and, later the Russian Federation.Whatever files may exist on Goeritno's business dealings or that of hiscorporation, P.T. Novan-indro, would be deeply buried with bullet-proofclassifications.Yet, the project with Temasek intrigued me. It had been buried in a news reporton Goeritno. The off-hand manner in which it was mentioned was enough to make mesuspect there was much more to the story.There were rumors that contained within the Pöch documents is a map. This may beone of the reasons why the current owner of these documents is so reluctant toshow them to anyone, fearful of losing access to what might be a fortune in goldwhose location may be indicated on this alleged map. It would explain Goeritno'sinterest in the Pöch affair, a circumstance which is otherwise inexplicable.Did the strange Nazi doctor bury gold somewhere on Sum-bawa? Or did he discovergold indigenous to the island? Was there any evidence that Nazi gold made itsway to Indonesia during or after the war?The answer to that last question, at least, is “yes.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEENSUKARNO'S GOLDAs we have seen, the Indonesian military is all over this story. First, withDoctor Sosro Husodo who was a Lt Col in the Indonesian Army. Then with SoeryoGoeritno, an arms dealer. Dr Sosro also worked for Pindar, an Indonesian weaponsmanufacturer (and in that capacity may have met Goeritno, although Goeritno doesnot mention this connection at all).I learned that the Indonesian Ministry of the Interior had quashed ajournalist's story on Pöch and Sosro back when the dictator Soeharto was stillrunning the government. Sosro had insisted that there were mysterious agenciesof foreign countries that would be after him once his memoir was published.There thus would seem to have been more to Sosro's tale than even the claim ofthe former Nazi dictator living peacefully on a remote tropical island.Much more.This aspect of the story may prove to be the most unbelievable, and yet it isthe only aspect that solves some of the outstanding questions on the obsessionof so many people where the Pöch affair is concerned. In order to understand thecontext and to realize why this may be relevant, we need to look back once againat the very end of World War Two and the scramble of the Axis powers to savetheir lives and their wealth, in order to finance a rebirth of their movement atsome future date.We have to discuss Sukarno's gold.In 1997, a rather exotic individual by the name of Dr. Edison Dam-anik died inthe United States after having disappeared months earlier from his home inJakarta, Indonesia. The circumstances of Damanik's death, as well as of hislife, are shrouded in mystery. His role in the affair we are about to describehas been characterized as a sham and a hoax by some, and by others as evidenceof one of the darkest secrets of World War Two and its aftermath: a secret thatsome of the world's most celebrated political leaders want kept hidden.It is important to understand from the outset that, where possible, this storyhas been thoroughly documented. Admittedly there are elements of the story thatcannot be verified and these are identified in the narrative. We may bediscussing fraud on a massive scale, or we may be talking about a series ofcrimes perpetrated upon some of the world's most populous nations, nations thatsuffered greatly during the Second World War. In either case, and whatever thereality of the events that follow, one thing seems certain: it was belief in thetruth of this story that attracted some of the less savory characters to thePöch documents.Here is what we know:Dr. Edison Damanik was a real person. Born on November 30, 1930 in Pematang inNorth Sumatra, he was a former Indonesian police officer with the rank ofInspector, and was an adviser to Indonesian President Soeharto and a consultantto his government. The details of his consultancy or how he advised Soehartohave not been revealed. What has been revealed is that he was the chairman ofsomething called the PT Galaxy Trust, on Jalan Rawa Kepa VI, in the Tomang areaof Jakarta.He was married to Etty Purnama-Damanik who survived his death. In the monthsleading up to his disappearance from his home in Jakarta, two rather strangepersons were known to be living near him and keeping his house under some kindof surveillance. These two have been identified as one Frederick Robinson, anoil industry executive whose base was in Bangkok, Thailand. The other was PaulV. Morse, who was staying in the nearby Citraland Hotel for the eight monthsprior to Damanik's disappearance.Both men have been described in various places as agents of the CIA, but that ofcourse has never been confirmed.The story that has been told of Damanik and PT Galaxy Trust is complicated andinvolves a widespread rumor that there existed—in the name of PresidentSukarno—a vast fortune in gold, most or all of which represented the fruits ofJapanese and German war crimes: the seizing of art, jewelry, antiques, as wellas gold, and its disposition in hidden places around the world for eventualre-use. Much of this gold, and art treasure was buried in caves throughout thePhilippine islands—where some of it has actually been found— and the rest inother areas of Southeast Asia, notably in the Indonesian archipelago. What isnot certain is whether or not Damanik actually had what he claimed he possessed:genuine gold certificates worth billions of dollars at today's prices,certificates representing accounts in foreign banks in the name of Sukarnohimself.This, then, is the story of Sukarno's gold. Whether one chooses to believe inthe story or not is irrelevant; what is relevant is that many people did, andstill do, believe in the story and they have taken steps to acquire thesecertificates and have them honored by the banks in question. What is bizarre isthe reaction of the banks (and governments) when confronted with thesedocuments. The certificates are almost never honored, but the owners of thecertificates are often arrested and thrown in prison ... only to be let outwithout explanation. Some of the “owners” have suffered persecution because oftheir proximity to the certificates; others have simply disappeared, or diedunder mysterious circumstances.As the war came to an end, there was a scramble by the Nazis and the Japanese tohide as much of their war loot as possible from the Allies. This had begun asearly as 1944 when it was obvious the war was lost; some sources claim an evenearlier date. We know that some of the Nazi-looted art and valuables was hiddenin the salt mines near Salzburg, where Pöch lived and from where he escaped inSeptember of 1946. Salzburg is also where the CIC headquarters in Austria wasbased, and it was where many of the top Nazis made their way as the war waswinding down and they needed an escape route to the Italian Tyrol.Some of the Nazi art and gold was loaded onto transports and sent to Spain andPortugal. From there, some of it made its way to South America by ship orU-boat. But it was revealed in the 1990s that forty tons of “Black Eagle” goldhad been shipped to the Portuguese colony of Macau, near Hong Kong, in what isnow China. And twenty tons of that gold wound up in Indonesia.98[../Text/part0024.html#c14-aft98]As reported in the New York Times in 1997 and in the years since then, more than400 tons of Nazi gold made its way to Portugal during the war as payment formuch-needed tungsten, an essential component of steel. While we know of fortytons of that gold that made its way to Asia, the disposition of the rest of thegold is still unknown. It is believed that much of it still lies beneath thestreets of Lisbon in the vaults of the Bank of Portugal, but there has been somuch traffic between officially “neutral” Portugal and Nazi Germany, as well asbetween Portugal and Latin America and its colony in Asia, Macau, that anaccurate record of the amount of gold and its current whereabouts is impossibleto verify.Black Eagle gold was so called because it was gold that had been derived fromeverything from gold trinkets and tableware to the gold teeth pulled fromvictims of the Holocaust, and then smelted down into bars and stamped with theBlack Eagle insignia used by the Nazi Reichsbank, and given a registrationnumber.At today's prices of about one thousand US dollars per ounce, twenty tons ofgold would be valued at over 600 million dollars. And this was only one shipmentof which we have any information.In addition to this single Macau lot of Black Eagle gold, there were othershipments—mostly from Spain—to points around the world. At the same time thatthe Nazis were shipping gold out of Europe, the Japanese were burying gold allover Southeast Asia and shipping the rest to South America. They could not risktaking the gold back to Japan where the Allies would most likely sieze it, sothey followed the iconic example of pirates everywhere and resorted to the“buried treasure” model. Using caves and tunnel systems in the Philippines andIndonesia, the gold was buried, and the workers who did the hard labor ofdigging the holes and transporting the gold were murdered to keep the locationssecret. Maps were created, encoded, and hidden. By the time the war was over andthe last bar of gold buried there were fewer than a few dozen individuals (andpossibly even fewer than that) who had access to the maps. Fewer still who coulddecode the maps and locate the gold.In addition to the Nazi “Black Eagle” gold, there was gold that had been shippedout of Southeast Asia by the colonial powers themselves when they saw theJapanese invasions about to take place. The Dutch government in Indonesia beganshipping its gold to America and Australia from Java; the Americans shipped tonsof gold and valuables out of the Philippines, some of it reaching San Franciscovia Hawaii, and the rest seized by the Japanese at Corregidor and shipped toJapan. The man in charge of the evacuation of the Philippine gold was our oldfriend Major General Charles Willoughby.Willoughby, as we have seen, was born Adolf Tscheppe-Wei-denbach in Germany. Heattended the University of Heidelberg, after which he moved to the United Statesin 1910, and changed his name to the more American-sounding Charles Willoughby.During and after World War Two, Willoughby was in charge of all intelligenceoperations in the Far East under General MacArthur. He was a devotedanti-communist who flourished during the McCarthy Era. He consulted with theHouse Committee on Un-American Activities and was a member of a variety oforganizations with pro-fascist and, one might even say, pro-Nazi viewpoints. Hesupported Franco in Spain and praised Mussolini in Italy. He was a member of theInternational Committee for the Defense of Christian Culture, and the YoungAmericans for Freedom, as well as the Shickshinny Knights of Malta: a groupfounded in the 1950s by one Charles Pichel, who had Old Catholic Churchconnections and a desire to replace the Sovereign Order of the Knights of Maltawith his own group, headquartered in the town of Shickshinny, Pennsylvania. TheShickshinny Knights became a cabal of extreme right-wing military andintelligence men plus a gaggle of Russian nobles who had lost their lands (andpossibly their minds) after the Russian Revolution of 1917.Willoughby had a specific interest in Indonesia, as revealed in the report toCongress we already discussed (see chapter nine [../Text/part0019.html#c9]). Inthis report he characterized the 300 year Dutch occupation of Indonesia as“successful” and “humane,” and wrote that the Dutch proposal for returning toIndonesia to rule it as before was “suited to the limitations of the averageIndonesian.” He disparaged “Merdeka” (Freedom) as a phony propaganda slogan, andclaimed that trying to unite the many Indonesian ethnic groups into a singlecountry was doomed to failure, and would open up Indonesia (and by extension therest of Asia) to Communist rule.He likened Russian designs on Asia as identical to Japanese intentions duringthe War, and claimed that people like Indonesian nationalist leaders Sukarno andHatta were cooperating with the Soviets just as they had formerly cooperatedwith the Japanese. What does not seem to have occurred to Willoughby is that ifa leader can work with the Japanese imperialists one day and the Soviets thenext, it should be obvious that this leader is an opportunist and not anideologue for either fascism or communism.The more likely explanation, however, is that Willoughby was not as naïve as heappeared. At the end of the war, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS, wartimeforerunner of the CIA) was finally allowed into the Pacific theater ofoperations (MacArthur had forbidden the OSS any access to the theater during thewar, restricting OSS activities to China, India, Tibet and Indochina). Theiragents reported back that Sukarno and his colleagues were just that: politicalrealists who were not ideologically committed to Communism at all, but who werededicated nationalists finding their way towards a democractic form ofgovernment unaligned with their former colonial masters.99[../Text/part0024.html#c14-aft99] This, however, was not what Washington wantedto hear, and operations against Sukarno began, with the intention of upsettinghis position as president of Indonesia and replacing him with leaders who wouldbe more pro-American and anti-Soviet.As an aside, one of those sent to Indonesia in the late 1950s as part of theoverall plan to disrupt the Indonesian political process was none other thanalleged assassin of President John F. Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald.I have no clue if this fact is relevant or not to the overall case of Pöch,Hitler, Sosro, etc., but the connection of not only Oswald but also CIAoperations in Indonesia in the 1950s is certainly relevant. Fletcher Prouty isan impeccable source. He worked for years as liaison between the intelligencecommunity and the military, and he was probably the most credible critic of theWarren Commission Report on the Assassination of President Kennedy, having knownmany of the players for decades before the assassination. He was a consultant onthe Oliver Stone film of the assassination, JFK, and made several appearanceswith Stone at press conferences to discuss the case. Oswald's service recordcertainly puts him in both the Philippines and Japan during his career as aMarine, however, and that is where the rest of our story takes place.There is no space to go into all the ramifications of what has become known asthe Black Eagle Trust. The tentacles of the treasure reach into many countries,and have affected the political lives of hundreds of millions—if not billions—ofpeople around the world. There are influences at work in virtually everyAmerican presidential administration since Truman, and in covert action in SouthAmerica, Africa, the Middle East and Asia where the gold was used to financeoperations that could not appear on the books of Congress or of thedemocratically-elected houses of other nations. It would seem that the story ofthe buried treasure of World War II is the record of a vast slush fund. And acase has even been made that the attacks of September 11, 2001 in the UnitedStates were the result of a frantic effort to destroy financial records, andeven to murder investigators who were hot on the trail of what would only be ascandal of epic proportions.This author has his doubts about the 9/11 theory, as may be imagined, since 9/11was itself a scandal of major proportions. If the conspiracy theorists arecorrect when they connect the Black Eagle Trust (or whatever its more moderndesignation may be) to the events of 9/11, then “overkill” would seem to be theoperative term. In fact, this may be an attempt to deflect more sober analysisof the phenomenon: the complex and bewildering trail of gold, gold certificates,banks acting badly, and false imprisonment and even death that surrounds anydiscussion of this matter.As fantastic as this story of Black Eagle Gold sounds, it has been verified andwell-documented. The work of Sterling and Peggy Seagrave is probably seminal inthis regard. Interested readers are advised to read their copiously-sourced GoldWarriors: America's Secret Recovery of Yamashita's Gold for all the sordiddetails..All we can do at this point is to summarize some of the material here,supplemented by what I have learned in the course of this increasingly bizarreinvestigation.As one example:The trial took place in a US Court in Hawaii in 1996. It awarded the heirs ofone Rogelio Roxas—a Filipino locksmith—a judgement of US$ 43 billion against theestate of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos: the largest civil awardin US history. The story of Mr. Roxas is incredible, but it is part of thepublic record as are the trial transcripts of the case.In January of 1971 Rogelio Roxas—an amateur treasure hunter—discovered a tunnelbehind a hospital in the town of Baguio, a former WW II headquarters of JapaneseGeneral Yamashita Tomoyuki. The tunnel contained a 28-inch tall Burmese statueof Buddha weighing a ton of solid gold, and thousands of smaller gold bars. Theyhad found the discovery of the century. ... but not before dealing with theoverwhelming stench of dead bodies that had lain in the airless tunnel entrancefor more than twenty-five years, workers slain to keep the location of the cachesecret.A few months later, in April of that year, armed men with a search warrantarrived at the Roxas home and at gunpoint removed the Golden Buddha, the goldbars, and a large amount of diamonds and precious gems that had been hiddenwithin the Buddha. They beat Roxas's brother with gun butts when he tried tointervene.The warrant had been signed by a local judge who had been asked to do so by hisnephew, who just happened to be President Ferdinand Marcos.When Roxas attempted to raise a hue and cry over the affair, he was arrested byplainclothes officers and beaten, tortured with electric cattle prods, andblinded permanently in his right eye. In the meantime, they found one of the menwho had helped Roxas find the hidden tunnel, and tortured him to discover itslocation by pulling out his teeth. When they finally got the location pinneddown, they returned to the tunnel in force and made off with the rest of theburied treasure. The estimate of the booty by one observer is said to be roughly10,800 gold bars weighing 75 kilos each.100 [../Text/part0024.html#c14-aft100]That's over 800,000 kilos for a total of roughly US$ 28 billion at today'sprices (approx US$ 1,000.00 an ounce). The Golden Buddha alone would be worthUS$32 million today.In the end, Roxas escaped to an undisclosed location where he lived in secrecyuntil the day Marcos was deposed and democracy came to the Philippines. That iswhen the machinery was put in motion to sue the Marcos family for the gold thathad been stolen from Roxas, which, as it turned out, was a drop in the bucketwhen compared to the other gold and valuables the Marcos regime had discoveredburied by the Japanese in caves in the years since the Roxas find.The Golden Buddha hoard was only part of what has become known as Yamashita'sGold. This was the name given to virtually all the gold that was hidden by theJapanese as the war was winding down, although Yamashita probably was notinvolved in all the gold burials in Southeast Asia. It has been claimed thatstories about Yamashita and his frantic burials of gold and other treasures allover the Philippine islands was a legend and purely imaginary ... until a USCourt decided otherwise. The amount of documentation supporting Roxas's claimwas staggering, including photographs of the hoard, eyewitness testimony, andmore. In fact, the Marcos defense team did not challenge the story as given bythe Roxas prosecution and allowed it to stand.This event is pointed out because it illustrates one very important fact. At thetime of the Roxas affair, the official word from the Philippine government wasthat there was no gold; that the story of Yamashita's gold was a fiction; thatthere had never been any such gold found in the Philippines, etc., etc. That wasthe consenus view. That was reality. That was the story that was reported in thepress. The “official word” carries a lot of weight, and if it weren't for a verywell-documented find, we would have never heard of Rogelio Roxas and he wouldnever have been awarded forty-one billion dollars.101[../Text/part0024.html#c14-aft101]The gold that had been found in Baguio represented the tip of a proverbialiceberg. And not all of that gold was hidden in the Philippines. There is ampleevidence to suggest that other caches of gold were hidden in the Indonesianislands before the war was over.The archipelago stretches for more than three thousand miles and consists ofmore than seventeen thousand islands of which only about six thousand areinhabited. The Japanese had effectively controlled all of it, even includingIrian Jaya (Papua) and Lombok, Bali, Flores ... and Sumbawa. As an example, theNagara class Japanese cruiser Isuzu was sunk off the coast of Sumbawa in April,1945, after having dropped off troops at the city of Bima, Sumbawa only the daybefore. The Isuzu had participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and had beensent to Surabaya for repairs in December of 1944 before making its way toSumbawa. We do not know why troops had been brought to Sumbawa this late in thewar when it was obvious Japan was losing. An educated guess might be that theywere on a mission that had nothing to do with winning the war or consolidatingtheir position in Indonesia.The Japanese did not leave Indonesia until after the end of the war in thePacific and, in some cases, were still fighting in Indonesia as late as October,1945 due to the confused state of affairs that existed between Japan, thevictorious Allies (American, Dutch and British), and the rise of Indonesiannationalist groups. The Japanese had tried to temper the hideous nature of theirbrutal occupation by cutting deals with nationalist leaders in some areas, whileceding authority to the British in others. What this means for our narrative isthat the Japanese presence in Indonesia was strong enough, even by the end ofthe war, to permit them to use the islands of the archipelago as hiding placesfor gold: whether Yamashita's or gold of the Black Eagle variety.The Indonesian prince, Soeryo Goeritno, had published his book on Pöch in 2010.He began harrassing the family of Doctor Sosro in 2011,102[../Text/part0024.html#c14-aft102] and attempted to cut a deal for the Pöchdocuments in 2011 and 2012. The only explanation for why he would continue to beinvolved in such an aggressive fashion over the documents—many of which hadalready appeared (albeit poorly reproduced) in his book—indicates an ulteriormotive.One of the documents to which Goeritno did not have access was the map.Basically, no one knows what the map reveals. It remains one of the best-keptsecrets of the entire Pöch affair. The map—plus the address book—taken togethercould be the key that Goeritno for which was searching. By 2007, he hadannounced that he was the local partner of Singapore's largest and mostvenerable multinational corporation—Temasek—for the purpose of gold mining onSumbawa.There are no public records available to measure the success or failure of thatenterprise, but if the Sumbawa venture was coming up dry, the existence of atreasure map formerly in the possession of Sumbawa's most famous (and probablyonly) Nazi might be the break Goeritno needed. After all, Pöch had lived onSumbawa without visible means of support other than whatever salary theGovernment of Indonesia was paying him. However much it was, it seems to haveenabled Hella Pöch to make multiple trips back to Europe during a ten-yearperiod.The one aspect of the Pöch affair that no one has addressed is the financialaspect. How did the Pöch couple manage to live—and by all accounts to livewell—during their Sumbawa sojourn? Of course, the cost of living on the islandwould be much less than the same lifestyle in Jakarta, and much less than thatin any of the European capitals, but that still doesn't answer the question.From photographic and other evidence it can be construed that the Pöchs werepeople of some means.Did Pöch have his own secret slush fund? How was he able to access it while onSumbawa in the days before Internet banking and ATM machines? How did Hella Pöchmanage to pay for all those trips back and forth to Europe?The Indonesian widow of Georg Anton Pöch—Sulaesih—managed to retire to Bandung,and live in a compound near the university there. It is well-guarded and quitesecure. When two local Indonesian reporters tried to visit her, they wereprevented from doing so, and instead could only provide an aerial photograph ofthe compound in their book. This is quite different from a house in the wilds ofSumbawa, replete with snakes on the road and monkeys stealing your lunch.So what was the story of Pöch's hidden wealth?In the Straits Times of Singapore, on January 24, 1987, the story of Sukarno'sgold made headlines.The story reads, in part:“The Indonesian government has announced it will use every means available totrack down a secret fund that might contain billions of dollars left over fromformer President Sukarno's administration. Cabinet Secretary Moerdiono confirmedthat the government had been investigating the so-called “revolutionary fund”for the past year to see how much money was left and whether it was recoverable.Mr. Moerdiono told reporters that former Foreign Minister Subandrio, now servinga life sentence in connection with a communist coup attempt in 1965, hadnotified the government of the fund's existence and offered to help recover themoney. The fund was officially set up in 1960 by the flamboyant PresidentSukarno to finance special projects, with money reportedly deposited in Swiss,Dutch and London bank accounts.The deputy chairman of the ruling Golkar Party, retired Brig-Gen. Suhardiman,said last month the Sukarno government had deposited millions of dollars worthof gold at the Union Bank of Switzerland in Geneva in 1960 as a “revolutionfund.”He estimated that with interest accrued over the years, the fund should be worthmore than US$ 1 billion (S$ 2.1 billion). ...”103[../Text/part0024.html#c14-aft103]This is another one of those impossible stories that nevertheless, at least inthis case, has the stamp of authenticity. A former Sukarno cabinet minister, inprison for life because of the events of 1965, wants to cut a deal by revealingthe location of Sukarno's gold; and the Indonesian government takes itseriously, even getting corroboration from a brigadier-general in the IndonesianArmy and deputy head of the ruling political party. This is not just anotherlegend whispered between bored expatriates amusing themselves in a Singaporebar. This is a statement verifying that Sukarno had, indeed, set up a“Revolutionary Fund” during his tenure.The rumors that I heard during my long experience in Asia were, like mostrumors, contradictory, and sometimes unbelievable in the extreme. But thoseconcerning Sukarno and his fabled treasure were remarkably consistent. Accordingto the generally-accepted version, President Sukarno was intent on creating aRevolutionary Fund. It would help support Indonesian works projects and othermeasures to improve the economy of his country in outlying areas that normallydid not enjoy great attention from the central government in Jakarta. It wouldalso help to support programs in other—non-aligned—nations. At the famousBandung Conference of Non-Aligned Nations, Sukarno had thrown down the gauntletto the world and said, essentially, a “plague on both your houses.” Heexperienced first-hand the tremendous pressure brought to bear by Westerncountries on the developing nations to adhere to Western ideas of capitalism andeconomic progress, or face the consequences. A truism of the time held that ifyou were not pro-Western or pro-American, then you must be Communist. There weresimply no other paths to follow during that period known as the Cold War.Sukarno realized that the colonial powers had not given up on their desire tocontrol their former colonies—if not militarily or politically theneconomically. The corollary to this was the impor-tace of having an independentsource of financial support that did not depend on the largesse of the Westernnations—neither the World Bank nor the International Monetary Fund, both ofwhich were viewed as puppets of the American government. The Revolutionary Fundwould help developing nations stay independent of foreign demands that theyfollow a strict capitalist system, or that they support the interests of theWestern powers.But it was also important to remain non-aligned where Communist nations wereconcerned as well. While the Soviet Union paid lip-service to supporting“indigenous” people's revolutions, this also came at a price. The Communistsexpected that the developing nation would allow Soviet military assistance andadvice in the country, making it another Soviet satellite in the global chessgame Russia was playing against the United States, Great Britain, and the otherWestern powers.Thus Sukarno, perhaps naïvely, thought that the developing nations could andshould remain aloof from these power-plays and control their own separatedestinies. Sukarno had no interest in exporting an Indonesian concept ofpolitical or military philosophy (other than his very general Pancasiladoctrine104 [../Text/part0024.html#c14-aft104]). Indeed, Indonesia was still inthe process of developing its own organizing principles. However, both theUnited States and the Soviet Union were engaged in a kind of missionary activitytowards the developing nations—trying to convert them to their ideologicalpoints-of-view and re-arranging their political (and military) systems toreflect their own ideas as to how the world should be run.Such patronizing attitudes by the technologically more advanced nations towardthe developing nations of Latin America, Africa, and Asia were rejected. Theywere seen as another form of the colonialism the developing nations had foughtwars to erase from their borders. The competing major powers refused toacknowledge there could be more than two positions—either Communist orCapitalist. Both were determined to impose their views on as much territory aspossible.The Bandung Conference pulled attendance from the very countries in Africa andAsia that the United States feared would swing towards Communism. The basicpremise of the conference was the rejection of colonialism and neo-colonialismin all its forms—which meant that the Soviet Union found itself censured as wellas the United States (which did not send an official representative to theconference). Even China's premier Zhou En Lai took part in the conference afternarrowly escaping an assassination attempt on his way to Indonesia. With itsemphasis on an end to colonialism and the need for self-determination for allnations, it appeared to the West that what Sukarno called the “Newly EmergingForces” could constitute another front in the Cold War.As moves were being contemplated and implemented to get rid of Sukarno who,because of his enormous popularity and charisma, was managing to bring togetherrepresentatives of at least one-quarter of the world's population in a bloc thatcould prove difficult if not impossible for the West to control, the Indonesianpresident was formulating the idea of the Revolutionary Fund.Sukarno knew as well as the other Southeast Asian leaders that the Japanese hadhidden large quantities of gold and other valuables throughout the region. TheUnited States had been engaged in an ongoing covert mission to find and acquireas much of this gold as possible, through operatives such as Willoughby and CIAagents, like the well-known veteran of many Asian intelligence campaigns, EdwardLansdale. Their focus was on the Philippines, whose government had aconveniently pro-American attitude, and on Japan itself whose government wasvirtually a creature of the United States. Japan had become important during theCold War as an ally against the Chinese, and as a logistical rear area forKorean operations. Okinawa would remain in American hands for decades after theWar, and Atsugi airbase (where Lee Harvey Oswald was stationed) would become avital link in the U2 spy plane missions flown over the Soviet Union. Thatenormous infusions of capital were made to support sympathetic Japanesepoliticians, military officers, and organized crime leaders (sometimes all threein the same person) was no secret to anyone.But Indonesia was a different case. The United States had very little leveragein the archipelago, and indeed had been running covert operations in Indonesiasince the early 1950s with the goal of insuring that Communism would not gain aserious foothold in the nation. As early as 1953, the US State Department'sOffice of Intelligence Research had prepared a 569 page report entitledCommunism in the Free World, which was declassified and released by the CIA onlyin the year 2007. This report included an analysis of the strength of theCommunist Party of Indonesia (PKI) and the degree to which it had infiltratedlabor unions, youth and women's groups, and government ministries. The UnitedStates was obviously concerned about the spread of Communism in Indonesia, andas the developments of the next few years would demonstrate, the CIA wouldbecome involved in serious efforts to undermine the Sukarno regime. One wondersif secret knowledge of the extent of the buried gold in the country was onemotivating factor, especially as Sukarno was making noise about creating his owninternational bank.But the United States did not have the ability to go around digging up buriedtreasure in the archipelago. Sukarno, however, did. A cache of Nazi and Japanesegold bars could be the jumpstart that his economic plan needed. His dream of aRevolutionary Fund that would bring financial independence for Indonesia and forother Newly Emerging Forces in the non-aligned world could become a reality ...if the Western powers and the Soviet Union let him live and the gold remain inhis possession. But moving tons of gold around and getting cash in return is notas easy as one might think. Revealing the existence of the gold could causeserious repercussions in world financial markets. If enough gold was suddenlydumped on the banks the price of gold would plummet, and the value of the goldreserves of the United States and other countries would be cut dramatically,plunging the world into economic chaos. The gold would have to be handleddiscretely. It would have to remain hidden, and shares of the gold sold likegovernment bonds. Some of the gold could be taken out of hiding and shipped tobanks abroad for safe-keeping and as collateral for the certificates, but therewould always be the problem that the banks could not be trusted and would in theend deny that the gold ever existed. As the world has seen in the past tenyears, banks are not necessarily as safe as churches. In fact, even churches arenot as safe as churches.One of the ways in which Yamashita's gold was hidden and the money laundered inthe post-war period was through the same channels that allowed Nazi warcriminals to escape: the Church. The Roman Catholic Church was just as much abulwark against Communism in Asia as it was in South America and Europe. Thesame facilities could be used to help Nazis escape to Asia as well as Nazi goldto make it safely through the system from its hiding places in the caves of thePhilippines and Indonesia. One of the primary actors in the search forYamashita's gold and Black Eagle gold was an agent who worked for the Vatican:Severino Garcia Diaz Santa Romana, known as “Santy.” As the Seagraves reveal intheir book,105 [../Text/part0024.html#c14-aft105] Santy was a member of thefanatical Catholic military order Opus Dei (made famous in the Dan Brown novel,The DaVinci Code) in the Philippines. He was one of those (along with the CIA'sEdward Lansdale, mentioned above) who tortured General Yamashita's formerchauffeur in an effort to locate the 170 sites in the Philippines where gold wasburied. The chauffeur gave up 12 of these.During the war, Santy ran an underground network of clergy and Catholiclaypeople throughout the Philippines as a resistance movement against theJapanese, taking note of which churches and other buildings owned by the Churchwere being used as places where gold was being hidden. The Philippines is apredominantly Catholic country, so churches, convents, and monasteries areabundant and plentiful and make excellent hiding places for buried treasure,riddled as they are with secret passages, catacombs, and other creative designfeatures. While the story of Santy and the Black Gold traffic is far beyond thescope of this book, let us take a leaf from the Seagrave material and apply itto our case in Indonesia.Both Doctor Sosro Husodo and Soeryo Goeritno were Catholics. Goeritno, in aninterview for an Indonesian newspaper, admitted that he was Catholic (which mayseem somewhat strange for the son of a Sultan, but which is not so unusual inpractice). During the mass violence that accompanied the overthrow of Sukarno in1965, the Catholic Church was a major player. As an opponent of Communism, theChurch took an active role in assisting the anti-Sukarno forces, and Catholicpriests were known to have been present during some of the bloodletting thattook place. Soeharto— who organized the overthrow of Sukarno—had Catholicsupport against the PKI. Thus, he trusted the Catholics as much or more than theIndonesian Muslims—who could, at times, work against his “New Order” policies.If this seems familiar, there is a reason for it. The Catholic Church played anactive role in the opposition to Communism in Europe since at least the 1930sthrough to the collapse of the Soviet Union, often working side by side withNazis to do so. The Church's position remained the same, regardless of where inthe world it was located. The same was true in Latin America, where the Churchsided with the oligarchy against Communism and against any kind of people'srevolutionary movement. Juan Peron of Argentina was as dedicated a Catholic ashe was a fascist and anti-Communist. This is the same paradigm wherever we findit.Thus, it should come as no surprise that this cabal of Roman Catholics,anti-Communists, and Indonesian military officers and arms dealers would beinterested in finding (and securing) Sukarno's Revolutionary Fund forthemselves, and for their work against the forces that threatened theirstability.After the death of Sukarno, it was widely believed that he left instructions asto the disposition of the Revolutionary Fund with trusted advisers and not, asit turned out, with family. In addition to the instructions there were theactual gold certificates themselves. There have been many efforts by familymembers (and the Indonesian government) to gain access to the funds, but all tono avail. The line of succession is murky, but occasionally someone surfaces whohas documents that seem to be genuine gold certificates: statements on officialbank stationery, like stock certificates, giving details as to the ownership ofmillions of dollars' worth of gold deposits in Sukarno's name. The certificateshave been virtually impossible to negotiate, for banks react immediately totheir appearance by claiming they are fraudulent. They rarely claim that thecertificates are forgeries: to do so would be to admit that such certificatesexist in the first place, and that they cannot or will not do.Instead the bearers of these certificates are routinely harrassed, threatened,arrested, imprisoned ... or worse. As an example, according to one informant, aman who had one of these certificates and was attempting to broker it wound updead in a hotel room in Singapore.The certificates are quite unusual in design and execution, and seem to argueagainst being hoaxes by virtue of the fact that there are very clearlytypographical errors that seem intentional. For instance, a certificate can bebeautifully printed on heavy, embossed paper with a flurry of stamps andsignatures—all perfect and verifiable—as well as account numbers and otherdetails concerning the value of the certificate. Then, oddly after all of thiswork, the name of the beneficiary will be deliberately misspelled. Ironically,this is considered proof that the certificate is genuine. This is because aclever forger would not have made the mistake of misspelling the beneficiary'sname. In order to guarantee the authenticity of the certificate, the name wouldbe slightly misspelled as a kind of coding system, verifying that thecertificate was genuine. It seems counter-intuitive but then the bestcryptography often is.If this sounds insane, it gets worse. Much worse. The world of internationalgold transfers and certificates is surreal and frought with danger andcomplexity. The amounts are simply staggering and the effect of negotiating themon the global money supply (even at ten cents on the dollar) would be enormous.Only those previously entrusted with the certificates are able to negotiatethem; they cannot be brokered or sold to third parties, for if they are thebanks will simply seize them and call the police. The certificate will vanishand no one will be the wiser, except for the innocent man or woman who naïvelytried to cash it in at their local branch and who now find themselves accused ofall sorts of felonies.That is not to say that fraud in the world of gold certificates is non-existent.The stories that swirl around Yamashita's gold, the Black Eagle Trust, andSukarno's Gold have made it easy for confidence men to create phoneycertificates and then “broker” them to unsuspecting customers for a smallpercentage (paid in advance, of course). So the actual market in goldcertificates has created a fake market in gold certificates, thus allowing thebanks to act as if every certificate is fake. It also enables district attorneysand federal prosecutors the leeway they need to arrest and prosecute both theknown criminal and the genuine broker alike.Thus, the safest approach to take is to ignore the gold certificates altogetherand literally “go for the gold.” According to one source,106[../Text/part0024.html#c14-aft106] some of the gold that was used to backSukarno's Revolutionary Fund is buried on Irian Jaya (today's Papua) inIndonesia. Like the Roxas find in the Philippines, this is a cave system in thejungles with crates of gold and documents giving account numbers and quantitiesin meticulous lists. Papua is a remote and forbidding island, half of whichbelongs to Indonesia, and the other half which enjoys a certain degree ofindependence. It is a land of headhunters and pygmies, and it is an island wherethe Catholic Church is strong.It is also the island visited by former SA and SS man Heinrich Harrer in theyear 1962, two years after Doctor Sosro's visit to Doctor Pöch. How strange thatthese two Nazis could be found in the same country, at the same time, on theother side of the world ... and on an island where it was believed Nazi gold hadbeen buried ... and at a time when Sukarno was arranging for that gold to be thebedrock of his Revolutionary Fund. As we have seen, the mission of Harrer toPapua in 1962 is controversial, with experienced anthropologists claiming thatHarrer's visit had less to do with ethnography and exploration and more to dowith a covert operation.Was this one of the reasons why Soeryo Goeritno was obsessed with Pöch, Sumbawa,and gold? Pöch lived on Sumbawa: an island occupied by Japanese forces at theend of the war. Sumbawa is on the way to Irian Jaya from Jakarta, as the crowflies, but the Pöchs could have met Harrer in Surabaya which would have beenmore convenient for Harrer. The close proximity of the two men in 1962 is almosttoo good to ignore, but alas we have no reliable information that they did meetat that time.So what then of Sukarno, his gold, Sumbawa, and Soeryo Goeritno? To address thatlet's go back to the beginning of this chapter and our mysterious Dr. Damanik.Dr Damanik claimed that he had been approached by a member or members ofSukarno's family who desired to negotiate the gold certificates that were intheir possession. This is the essential problem: these are not bearer bonds orbank checks, or even personal checks. These are basically statements that suchfunds exist, that they have the requisite account numbers, and that the banksverify that these funds exist. In essence, the bank acts as a witness to theexistence of the gold or cash—and will act as a kind of intermediary in somefuture transaction that is covered by an arcane and complex set of rules thatwere established at the time the accounts themselves were established. Similarto the idea of a Swiss bank account that can be numbered and anonymous, butaccessed by a person with the right codewords or code numbers, these documentscan only be negotiated by the people or agencies—commonly referred to as“trustees” but sometimes, as in the Sukarno case, as “gurus”—listed in thedocumentation attached to the certificates.These gurus were not necessarily Sukarno family members. Unless they were listedas trustees or gurus, family members would not have access to the accounts, noteven under laws of inheritance. Dr. Damanik was not one of the assignedtrustees; he was acting as a middleman on behalf of the genuine trustees or“gurus” who could not negotiate the documents in their own country (Indonesia)for a variety of reasons, not all of them very clear. Dr. Damanik then went tothe United States in an attempt to negotiate these instruments in good faithwith the US Federal Reserve Bank, but instead wound up arrested and imprisonedfor fraud.There are two versions as to how he died. One version has it that he died in theUnited States after being released from prison. Another version is that hereturned to Indonesia and died there. Whatever the truth of the matter, it seemsthat he had tried to enlist others in his attempt to have the certificatesauthenticated and then negotiated. One of these people was an Australian, PeterJohnston, who wound up imprisoned for fraud, even though he had not attempted todefraud anyone. He had merely stored one of the famous gold certificates with abank for safe-keeping, only to discover that the bank manager had phoned theauthorities because of his concern that the document was a forgery. While thebank never affirmed that it was a forgery, and Johnston had never attempted tomove the certificate, he was nevertheless charged and convicted. Damanik andJohnston were accused of being accomplices in a massive scheme to defraudinvestors and banks, but it was never proven. As in the case of Damanik, thecharges were inexplicably dropped with no explanation.Another man who was not so lucky was Tommy Lee Buckley of Arizona, who took itupon himself to try to get the Damanik gold certificates authenticated andnegotiated. To help finance his twenty-year mission he published a newsletterdocumenting his progress and promised his subscribers a percentage of the awardif and when he was successful. It is important to know that he presented one ofthese certificates to the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas in 1991; in otherwords, he was not attempting to defraud anyone, but was approaching the Fed todetermine whether or not the certificate was genuine. He was arrested by theSecret Service at that time but soon released. He claimed that the certificatesin his possession were worth trillions of US dollars, and that some had beenmade out to such world leaders as Saddam Hussein. The misspellings in the namesof the leaders were taken as evidence that Buckley had forged the documentshimself, even though the rest of the certificates were pristine.For some reason his twenty-year attempt to have the certificatesauthenticated—and raising money from newsletter subscribers to help him in thisproject—was considered a federal crime, and he was tried and convicted. He neverwent to prison, however, because he committed suicide before sentencing. Thatwas in June of 2011, at the same time that Soeryo Goeritno was actively seekingaccess to the Pöch documents.One problem with this entire story of gold certificates worth trillions ofdollars is that the instruments themselves are unique. They are not normalbanking instruments, but instead were created for a special purpose: to controlthe movement and ownership of large stores of gold and other valuables thatwould be held outside the standard banking channels and used only by and for aselect group of insiders. The treasure had been stolen—by the Nazis, by theJapanese—and would not be returned to their rightful owners. In fact, as thegold had been melted down into solid bars and “biscuits,” it would have beenvirtually impossible to determine provenance. The source for the treasurespanned nations and continents and eras. Paintings and sculptures could beidentified and their rightful owners located; the gold and the jewelry wereanother matter. One can almost see the wheels turning in the brains of American,Indonesian, Filipino, and other military and political leaders as they gazed onthe piles of shining wealth—deciding that these were the spoils of war, spoilsthat could be put to better use to prop up dictatorships, overthrow unfriendlyregimes, and enrich a select group of insiders who had been blooded by war andrevolution. In fact just such a situation existed in April, 1945 after thediscovery of the Merkers Mine treasure in Germany.According to official US Government reports, this enormous find included, “8,198bars of gold bullion; 55 boxes of crated gold bullion; hundreds of bags of golditems; over 1,300 bags of gold Reichsmarks, British gold pounds, and French goldfrancs; 711 bags of American twenty-dollar gold pieces; hundreds of bags of goldand silver coins; hundreds of bags of foreign currency; 9 bags of valuablecoins; 2,380 bags and 1,300 boxes of Reichsmarks (2.76 billion Reichsmarks); 20silver bars; 40 bags containing silver bars; 63 boxes and 55 bags of silverplate; 1 bag containing six platinum bars; and 110 bags from various countries.”It was understood at the time that the find confirmed, “previous intelligencereports and censorship intercepts indicating that the Germans were planning touse these foreign exchange assets, including works of art, as a means ofperpetuating the Nazism and Nazi influence both in Germany and abroad.”Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower, Omar Bradley and George S. Patton met at the siteto determine what to do with the hoard. Patton wanted information about the sitekept secret and not communicated to the media. When asked why, Patton respondedthat they should bury the gold until such time as they needed to buy additionalweapons once peacetime broke out and military budgets were reduced.107[../Text/part0024.html#c14-aft107]If the ends justified the means, and it was permissible to assassinate politicalleaders in order to ensure that the “right” people were running the show, whywould the theft of billions of dollars be any less acceptable?In the early 1950s, before Sukarno conceived the idea of a Revolutionary Fund,he received the advice of former Nazi Reichsbank president Hjalmar Schacht.Schacht's close friend, as we have noted, was Otto Skorzeny, the man responsiblefor managing the Nazi underground—along with his friend Hans-Ulrich Rudel,another Nazi adventurer—and for running the illicit traffic in stolen treasure.Shortly thereafter, the idea of an “anti-bank” is created, an institution thatwould rival in power that of the World Bank and the IMF.108[../Text/part0024.html#c14-aft108] Sukarno, knowing that his huge extendedfamily would be unreliable where managing this vast treasure was concerned,appointed a small group of “gurus” to manage the Fund; but rumors of itsexistence began to circulate. In 1987, a former member of Sukarno's cabinet—hisForeign Minister—claimed he knew the location of the gold and of the accountsrepresenting the gold. At the same time, a retired Brigadier-General, and deputyhead of the country's most powerful political party, admitted that theRevolutionary Fund existed. Ten years later, the Indonesian attorney EdisonDamanik—in his attempt to have some of these certificates authenticated andnegotiated—was thrown into a US prison for his pains and died soon thereafter.Recently, the Indonesian press reported an interview with Sukarno's most famousdaughter, Rachmawati Sukarnoputri, concerning a news report in the Austriannewspaper Kronen Zeitung of December 17 and 19, 2012. The report claimed thatefforts were being made by a Gustav Jobstmann to recover US $180 million fromthe Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS, the bank whose name pops up most regularlyin these cases). This was in connection with a putative member of the Sukarnoclan, a man named Seno Edy Soekanto, whose name figures prominently in theSukarno Gold affair. But Ms Rachmawati claimed she had never heard of him, or ofthe treasure. However, she stipulated that if it did exist it was to be used forthe Indonesian people ... a puzzling statement if she had no knowledge of thefamous Revolutionary Fund.In another statement—this time by an irritatingly anonymous source referenced byresearcher David Guyatt—we discover the claim that Sukarno's gold was buried incaves in Irian Jaya (Papua today), as well as on “other islands” in theIndonesian archipelago. The “guru” in this case was a Filipino associate of thelate President Sukarno who controlled access to the treasure. Damanik himselfmade the connection between Sukarno's gold and Ferdinand Marcos of thePhilippines, as well as to Black Eagle gold from Nazi booty.More smoke? More mirrors? There is so much documentation available on thesecases—from hundreds of pages of signed and sealed bank statements,official-looking documents from government agencies, and the certificatesthemselves—that it seems the hoax (if such it is) is truly massive in scale, andyet with very little payback. No bank, no government, seems willing to verifythe authenticity of these documents. If it is a hoax, then why? Who is beinghoaxed and to what extent? And why would someone go to all the trouble ofcreating beautifully designed and printed bank certificates only to misspell thenames of the beneficiaries in childish ways? And why are those in possession ofthese documents being sentenced to lengthy prison terms, far out of proportionto their “crimes”?Soeryo Goeritno worked with Temasek to mine the gold on Sumbawa island. A fewyears later, Goeritno receives a summons from Moscow and is laid low by a strokethe following day. Was he a victim of what Sosro had called the agencies offoreign countries who would be all over him once his memoir was published? Washe another victim of Sukarno's Gold?98 [../Text/part0024.html#c14-ft98] As reported by Eduardo Gonçalves, in TheObserver, 2 April 2000, “Britain allowed Portugal to keep Nazi gold” and byMarlise Simons, “Nazi Gold and Portugal's Murky Role,” in the New York Times,January 10, 1997.99 [../Text/part0024.html#c14-ft99] One of these OSS agents who reported back onSukarno was Jane Foster Zlatovski, a friend of television chef (and former OSSagent) Julia Child. Jane Foster was one of the first to interview Sukarno,Hatta, and many other Indonesian nationalists immediately after the end of thewar and her impression was that they were ardent nationalists and notCommunists, men who wanted to improve their relations with the United States andrenew the international trade and exports that had been disrupted by the war.Zlatovski's warning was that if the US did not help in the anti-colonialmovement there would be a string of revolutions throughout Asia that wouldthreaten American interests in the region. She was, of course, proven right, butthat did not stop the US Congress from indicting her as a Communist agent and asubversive.100 [../Text/part0024.html#c14-ft100] For this and most of the Roxas “GoldenBuddha” story, see Sterling and Peggy Seagrave, Gold Warriors: America's SecretRecovery of Yamashita's Gold, Verso Books, London, 2005, pp. 141–146.101 [../Text/part0024.html#c14-ft101] While the court had awarded Roxas US$ 41billion, the Hawaii Supreme Court reversed the decision in 1998, but only interms of the amount of gold that allegedly was stolen by Marcos and not the factthat it was stolen: a crime that no one denies took place.

Today, securityofficials in many countries are concerned about the rise of the lone wolfterrorist since they operate without discernible links to a larger, morevisible, organization and are thus harder to identify and impossible to predict.As terrorism expert Jeffrey D. Simon reminds us, there have been lone wolfterror attacks by both neo-Nazis and Islamist sympathizers in many countriesaround the world and the threat continues to grow.110[../Text/part0025_split_003.html#c15-aft110]One could say there have been so-called “lone wolf” operators in every country,every age. It is a term that is used with very little attempt at a cleardefinition. Any person operating alone and committing a political act—ofterrorism or assassination—could be said to be a lone wolf. One wonders whatdifference there may be between a lone wolf and the “crazed lone assassin” ofmodern conspiracy lore. What does the term “lone” really mean in this context?When we write of a “crazed lone assassin” such as Lee Harvey Oswald was said tobe, we imply that this is an independent actor with no affiliations, operatingunder his own steam and fueled by his own desires and motivations. Basically,not part of a group. The Mad Bomber who terrorized New York City in the 1930swas one of these; Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, was another.A lone wolf, however, is a semi-autonomous operative acting under direction ifnot control by an outside agency. If the lone wolf were completely autonomous,he would not be considered a lone wolf but put into a category like that of theUnabomber. Instead, a lone wolf belongs to a specific ideology and hasallegiance to a specific group, and undertakes his actions under what we maycall a strategic umbrella: that is to say, the general, overall strategy of thegroup is known to him and he undertakes his actions in accordance with thatgeneral strategy. The tactical decisions are his alone.That was the idea behind the creation of the Werewolf campaign at the end ofWorld War Two, when the defeated Nazi military apparatus created cells ofindependent operators who were expected to wage a disorganized guerrillacampaign against the victorious Allies. These “lone wolves” were scatteredthroughout Austria and Germany and expected to cause as much havoc as possible.Nothing much came of the Werewolf campaign and it may have been designed todistract the Allied forces from what was really taking place: the expatriationof assets and personnel through the ratlines to countries outside of Alliedcontrol.In the present era we now face a resurgence of the Werewolf concept in thephenomenon of the lone wolf terrorist. These are indoctrinated actors with(usually) limited resources, living “off the land” so to speak who carry outterrorist acts on their own initiative. They are usually tied back to a terrorcell or training camp somewhere in the world which is where they received theirtraining and their ideology. They are not in constant contact with superiors;there is no discernible chain of command. In this, they are no different fromtheir Nazi ancestors and it is entirely possible that the Nazi Werewolf was themodel for the current spate of Islamist “lone wolves.”Although lone wolf terrorism usually does not require access to large sums ofcash and the secret means for moving it, the organizations that inspire the lonewolves do. There are logistical concerns to address as well as coordinatedpropaganda and recruiting efforts that are multi-national in scope. In the caseof the Nazi Underground, there was no end of funding for operations ranging fromassassinations and bombings in Europe and Latin America to the printing anddisseminating of anti-Semitic and other racist literature, foreign travel forimportant functionaries (such as Skorzeny and Rudel), and the supply of weapons,explosives and other materiel. Most of these operations were well-coordinatedattacks, and experts such as Stefano delle Chiaie and “Carlos the Jackal” weresupplied with whatever they needed to carry out these attacks. Even the 1976assassination of former Chilean ambassador Orlando Letelier and his assistantRonni Moffitt was carried out in Washington, D.C. by an American agent of theChilean secret police with assistance from anti-Castro Cubans recruited for thepurpose: a well-planned and carefully-crafted plot that required access tosubstantial funds. (In fact, both Michael Vernon Townley—the Americanassassin—and Stefano delle Chiaie—the Italian terrorist responsible for severalbombings in Germany and Italy, as well as attempted assassinations of politicalleaders—were employed by DINA, the Chilean secret service operating under theaegis of Operation Condor.)The techniques required for funding terrorist activities are as arcane andbyzantine as those for other illegal endeavors such as drug running and armsdealing. In fact, quite often the same methods are employed by drug dealers,Islamist terrorists, and the Nazi Underground and often make use of the sameinternational monetary facilities."},{"pageContent":"THE INITIAL INVESTMENTSThe international terrorist phenomenon of the post-World War II era wasjump-started by the smuggled gold coming out of Europe that had its origins withthe Reichsbank and other financial institutions and organizations based in NaziGermany—and its occupied territories (such as the Netherlands), and its“neutral” allies (such as Spain). Much of what we know today about the transferof funds and other assets from the Third Reich to safe havens abroad comes fromthe research conducted by the “Gold Team” created by the Clinton Administrationin the late 1990s. The findings are incredible even as they are frustratinglylimited in scope.For instance, we learn111 [../Text/part0025_split_003.html#c15-aft111] that aslate as March 1945 the Reichs-bank—through the auspices of the Bank forInternational Settlements (BIS) under its American president Thomas McKittrick—transferred the incredible amount of 500,813.00 kilograms of fine gold for theaccount of the Bank of Brazil. Five hundred thousand kilos represents 1,100,000pounds of gold. Each pound consists of sixteen ounces, making 17,600,000 ounces.Using a conservative value of around US $1,000.00 per ounce that means thissingle transaction would be worth today US $17,600,000,000.00 or an amount inexcess of seventeen billion US dollars. Tantalizingly, that data was obtainedfrom a declassified US government file dated May 15, 1945, in a box labeled“Vatican City (Correspondence File).” One can only imagine what the relationshipwas between this gold transfer to the Bank of Brazil and Vatican City.That gold and other assets seized or owned by the Nazis made their way abroadwhere they would be out of reach of the Allies is not in dispute. The actualamounts are often debated and, of course, much of the relevant paperwork waseither lost or destroyed or, in some cases, never existed in the first place.Considering for a moment that a substantial fortune did escape—and not only intangible assets such as gold, jewelry and artworks, but also in the transfer oftechnology to friendly regimes, as well as the massive distribution of funds andexpertise throughout the German industrial empire that extended throughout theworld, survived the war, and was therefore considerably protected from anyattempt by the Allies to confiscate it or control it—we must speculate on howthat fortune was controlled, invested, disguised, and distributed.We have already seen that Nazi financiers such as Genoud and Schacht had theirplans in place, and were active in moving among Nazi sympathizers in variouscountries and continents after the war. They were experts in setting up foreignbanks, and in arranging wire transfers and other instruments, that would movemoney across international borders. Genoud was openly supporting anti-colonialregimes in North Africa as well as the Palestinian movement: support that wasmade possible by the Nazi gold he controlled in numbered Swiss accounts.As the post-war years became the post-war decades, however, did that fortune dryup? How was the money invested? Who was managing it? Who was distributing it?"},{"pageContent":"THE GROWTH OF AN INDUSTRYWe know that Klaus Barbie, from his sanctuary in Bolivia, was involved in gunrunning and drug smuggling. These were excellent methods for creating vastfortunes in wealth—if you were already a seasoned military officer with noscruples and a strict personal code, who was capable of commanding a small armyand enforcing obedience. Barbie—with his bizarre underground cadres of formerNazis known as the “Fiancés of Death”112[../Text/part0025_split_003.html#c15-aft112]—made a considerable fortune workingfor Operation Condor, a fortune that was invested in the ODESSA network. USmilitary assistance to countries in Latin America that were fighting Communism,such as Argentina and Chile, took the form of financial support foranti-Communist (or simply anti-leftist) terrorist operations and assassinations.The money was laundered through the armies and intelligence agencies of thosecountries.Considerable funds were laundered through Colonia Dignidad in Chile, as oneexample, and these funds were used to develop chemical and biological weapons,as well as to run the torture and interrogation center at the Colony after theoverthrow of Allende. The Colony itself was part of both Operation Condor andODESSA. This is, by now, well documented by Chilean government investigations aswell as by eyewitness testimony, and can be viewed on a number of documentaryfilms that have come out in the past few years as Chile comes to grips with thisscandal within their own borders.By far the best source of funding for the post-war German renaissance came, ofcourse, from German industry itself. Companies such as Thyssen had diversifiedtheir holdings worldwide in the years before the German defeat and managed tosafeguard their assets with considerable American assistance. It is discouragingto learn that some of America's most influential businessmen and politicianswere deeply involved with this effort, and in helping protect these assets fromAllied attempts at securing reparations—and in divesting German industry of anyassets that could be used to develop a war capability in the future. On thecontrary, political and economic dynasties such as the Bush-Harriman-Walkernexus saw to it that American companies that were engaged in questionable, ifnot treasonous activities, during the war were protected and allowed to thrive.In order to do this, they also had to protect the German corporations whichowned all, most, or a considerable percentage of the shares of the Americancompanies. Most Americans are not aware that Standard Oil began its life as aGerman company, and that its most important board member was also a member ofthe Freundeskreis Himmler: Emil Helfferich. Or that the estimable Schroeder Bankwas actually the bank owned and controlled by Baron Kurt von Schroeder, of thesame Freundeskreis Himmler. The Union Banking Corporation (UBC) that was socrucial in moving funds for the Reich, and whose assets were seized by the USGovernment under the Trading with the Enemy Act, was actually a creation of theAmerican firm Brown Brothers Harriman as a strategy for holding the shares ofthe Thyssen bank, Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart, N.V. These were thecorporations (along with Henry Ford, ITT, IBM, and so many others) that hadbacked Hitler from the earliest days. Just as the Nazis did not abandon theirideals with their military defeat, the American supporters did not abandon theNazis.As the Soviet Union began to crumble, some of the same personnel we firstencountered during the Cold War began to focus their attentions on a differentenemy. Said Ramadan, who was instrumental in the operations of the MuslimBrotherhood in Europe, became involved with the Al-Taqwa Bank of Switzerland.One of the founders of Al-Taqwa was none other than the Swiss Nazi and IslamistAhmed Huber, who met with Muammar Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein, the AyatollahKhomeini, and many other Middle Eastern despots. It should be remembered thatJörg Haider—the Austrian politician and fascist we met in the opening of thisbook—had been receiving financing from Gaddafi and Hussein as well. Thus, theNazi-Islamist networks were running as late as the year 2008, more than sixtyyears after the end of World War II, and almost one hundred years since the ideaof global jihad first occurred to the amateur archaeologist Max von Oppenheim.Some of the methods of earning and laundering money by the Islamist groups werebased on the same methods used by ODESSA. The opium crops of Afghanistan arebeing used to finance terror groups today just as the cocaine fields of LatinAmerica were used to help finance ODESSA through the Barbie operation. In fact,the no-man's land that exists in a triangle of geography between Argentina,Paraguay and Brazil is a haven for drug-smugglers, human traffickers, Nazis andtheir sympathizers, and Islamist groups.113[../Text/part0025_split_003.html#c15-aft113] Thus some of the money that is usedto finance Islamist terror organizations comes from the same region notorious asan underground railroad for ODESSA.As the Soviet Union fell, one of the banks that was used by CIA to launder moneyduring the infamous Iran-Contra operation, was the Bank of Credit and CommerceInternational (BCCI). Set up by a Pakistani financier in the late 1960s, withconsiderable investment by the Bank of America and the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi,ownership of the bank by the 1980s was held by several prominent Saudiintelligence officials, among others. Revelations of the bank's involvement incriminal activities—as well as its acting as a conduit for intelligence agencyfinancing including the movement of funds during Iran-Contra—led to the bank'scollapse in 1991, as several of its overseas offices and branches were raidedand closed down, its assets liquidated. At its height, BCCI was the seventhlargest bank in the world.A similar financial institution was Nugan Hand Bank, founded by an Australianlawyer and a former US Green Beret. The bank had considerable intelligenceconnections, including what appeared to be large loans to CIA Director WilliamColby, among others. The bank seemed to function as a CIA conduit for much ofits existence, like Castle Bank and Trust (registered in the Bahamas), that wasused to fund anti-Castro operations from a base on Andros Island. Accountholders at Castle Bank and Trust included the Nationalist Chinese warlord ChiangKai-Shek, as well as organized crime figures."},{"pageContent":"THE SHADOW FUNDS TRANSFER SYSTEMBy far the most insidious form of international monetary transaction is known ashawala (Arabic for “transfer”).114 [../Text/part0025_split_003.html#c15-aft114]This is an efficient yet invisible system that requires little or no officialpaperwork and whose transactions are virtually untraceable by outsiders. Hawala“dealers,” or hawaladars, can be official money-changer establishments or evenjewelry shops or other neighborhood outlets that are known to the users throughword of mouth, in areas where such transactions are illegal. One goes to thehawaladar in the United States (as an example) and passes an amount of cash tothe hawaladar, along with a code number or other identifier. In Pakistan, oranother country where the same system is employed, a notice is given to thelocal hawaladar and the recipient merely shows up with the code number or otheridentifier to pick up the cash. This is similar to a common wire transfer exceptthat there is no paper trail outside of the internal bookkeeping of thehawaladars themselves. Since there are often no banks involved, it is adifficult system to monitor and its transactions enjoy a great degree ofanonymity. It is an ancient system of sending money around the world that hasbeen in existence since medieval times, It has been used to finance drug, arms,intelligence, and terror operations in the last fifty years or longer. No moneyis actually transferred between hawaladars for each transaction—but the debt maybe settled at the end of each accounting period, using different commoditiessuch as gold, drugs, arms, electronics, or other valuables. It is an honorsystem, and employs familial, tribal, and other relationships to ensureefficiency. A small percentage is taken from each transaction, and it is usuallymuch cheaper than using more conventional methods of sending money. Further, itoperates well in areas—like Afghanistan—where conventional banking networks maybe non-existent.Since the hawala system has been around for centuries it cannot be consideredsolely in terms of terror financing or money laundering. Most hawalatransactions are innocent and involve persons sending money home from abroad, orfinancing the purchase and sale of consumer goods, etc. across borders. However,the attraction of hawala for criminal and terror groups is undeniable,particularly where the drug trade is concerned. The biggest problem in runningdrugs is moving and laundering the enormous amounts of cash involved. It isestimated that a large percentage of hawala transactions in Afghanistan involvesfunds that were derived from the opium trade, which is that country's largestand most valuable export. Drug money is known to have been a major source offinancing for the Taliban as well as for the Northern Alliance, and this fundinghas also made its way into Al-Qaeda's coffers.In some cases, money that has wound up in regular bank accounts in the UnitedStates and elsewhere had its origins in the hawala system, which makes itvirtually untraceable even when the money is deposited into a legal institution.Hawaladars can use formal wire transfer systems to send money, but they do socognizant of local strictures. For instance, in order to avoid scrutiny by theUS government, wire transfers may be broken up into several individualtransfers, each less than US $10,000, and may be sent to different accounts indifferent countries before they wind up aggregated at the destination site. Someof the funding used to finance the 9/11 operation passed through accounts in theSunTrust Bank of Florida, for instance, and can be traced back only a step ortwo before the trail disappears.While I have no evidence that ODESSA is using the hawala system, it is clearthat its colleagues and partners do: from drugrunning in theArgentina-Brazil-Paraguay triangle to arms dealing in North Africa and theLevant. It provides another level of security at a time when the movement ofmoney comes under increasing scrutiny by the world's governments. The wiretransfer system that relies on an extensive paper trail, incorporating a greatdeal of personal identification and verification at both ends is thus supplantedby a method where members of a specific community use an honor system to movemoney without official paper, and often even without actually moving the moneyitself. In a system such as this, “follow the money” becomes less a tacticalprocess of investigation than a quaint memory of a simpler time. Nevertheless,the much-touted war on drugs (had it actually ever been undertaken in a seriousway) would have revealed the extent of this and other financial methodologies.It would have traced such methods back to the initial funding of terrror byODESSA since the 1950s—using gold that had been smuggled out of Europe—whichthen made its way around the world, propping up dictators and armingassassination and terror squads, long before “Islamist” and “jihad” becamehousehold terms.As we have seen, Allied intelligence at the close of the Second World War wasconcerned about the Werewolf organization. There had been everything from vaguerumors about its existence to open declarations by Goebbels and others. SSofficer Ernst Kalten-brunner was sent to the Salzburg region of Austria withspecific instructions by Himmler to oversee the Werewolf operation. SeveralNazis were apprehended by the Allies in the months after the war, and were foundto be Werewolves who had been plotting terrorist acts against Allied positions.Their sole motivation and agency was determined by their own oaths of loyalty tothe Führer and the commands they were given to continue the fight, even at therisk of their own lives. The deployment of lone wolf operators is cheap anddeniable—much more cost-effective than the elaborate plots hatched in CentralAsian caves or Southeast Asian apartment buildings—and much more secure. Theyalso perform an important additional function: they tap the resources of Westernintelligence agencies, forcing them to chase ghosts, while deeper and moredangerous operations are being planned, involving greater numbers of actors.Modern terror organizations have learned much from the lessons provided by Nazileaders, commandos and ideologues. In many cases, the terrorists of the 1980sand 1990s were trained directly by Nazi security personnel and SS officers, withwhom they found common cause. As we have seen, not only did the Westernintelligence agencies and politicians turn a blind eye to this phenomenon, inmany cases they openly supported and encouraged its development. It is becausewe refused to take the Nazi threat seriously after the war (or because many ofour leaders in the military, intelligence agencies, and at the highest levels ofour governments welcomed the collaboration for their own agendas) that we nowface the greatest threat to global security since the rise of the Third Reich.109 [../Text/part0025_split_000.html#c15-ft109] Discussions on asymmetricwarfare include Ekaterina Stepanova, Terrorism in Asymmetrical Conflict:Ideological and Structural Aspects, Oxford University Press, 2008; and IvanArreguín-Toft, “How the Weak Win Wars: A Theory of Asymmetric Conflict”, inInternational Security, Vol. 26, No. 1 (Summer 2001), pp. 93-128.110 [../Text/part0025_split_000.html#c15-ft110] Jeffrey D.

Infield115 [../Text/part0026.html#c16-aft115]The above quotation is from Infield's biography of Otto Skorzeny, published in1981, and the facts are as true today as they were then. Infield writes of therelationship that existed between Skorzeny and Yassir Arafat, for instance, andreminds us how Skorzeny advised the PLO and Al-Fatah from his base in Cairo.Infield knew and interviewed Skorzeny, and his biography of “Hitler's Commando”is relevant to any contemporary study of the origins of modern terrorism.What the world has been experiencing since at least 2001 and certainly for yearsearlier than the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon has been whatanalysts refer to as “asymmetrical warfare” conducted by “non-state actors.”This is a technique that was developed to perfection by Skorzeny and the otherleaders of what we have called ODESSA. The fact that the Western intelligenceagencies turned a blind eye to Skorzeny's activities has contributed to ourinability to confront and defeat what we have called Islamist terrorism.Arms dealing, covert international banking systems, targeted assassinations,terror bombings, the “strategy of tension” as it was described and defined byfascist terrorist Stefano della Chiaie, already existed as part of anunderground terror network long before al-Qaeda was born.After World War II, the American people thought that Nazi Germany had beendefeated and the “war” was over; this book demonstrates that it never was.Instead, we were told that Communism was the new threat and we had to pull outall the stops to prevent a Communist takeover of the country. And so ourmilitary and our intelligence agencies collaborated with surviving Nazis to goafter Communists. We refused to pursue worldwide right wing terror groups andassassins. After all, they were killing Communists and leftists; they were doingus a service. Like Hoover and the Mafia, the CIA refused to believe a NaziUnderground existed—even as they collaborated with it (via the GehlenOrganization and the like).The whole thrust of this book has been that American leaders in business,finance, media, and politics collaborated with Nazis before, during, and afterthe war. The West's share in the “blame” for Al-Qaeda, et al, goes back a longway—before Eisenhower—to a cabal of extremist US Army generals and émigréEastern Europeans who didn't have much of a problem with Nazism since theyfeared Communism more. The Church, the Tibetans, the Japanese, the Germans, theCroatians—and the Americans—all felt that Communism was the greater danger, longbefore WW II. We enlisted war criminals to fight on our side. We appropriatedthe idea of global jihad from the Nazis and their WW I predecessors. We amped uptheir plan to weaponize religion and convinced Muslims, who hated each other, toband together to fight Communism. And when Afghanistan was liberated and theSoviet Union was defeated?September 11, 2001.Our cynical exploitation of religion has delivered a hideous stream of blowbackthat threatens the world still.With the Nazi diaspora, the leaders of the Third Reich who had survived—who wereeither living underground, or were “denazified” and living freely aboveground—constituted a government-in-exile. They remained in contact, reinforcedeach other's beliefs, provided logistical support where possible, and kept thefaith alive. They became involved in political and military intrigues around theglobe, always with the goal of causing an imbalance in global power structures.Motivated by anti-Semitism, they collaborated with Arab leaders and guerrillaorganizations in attacks against Israel, even going so far as to develop weaponssystems in Egypt. They wrote propaganda against Israel and against Jews ingeneral, repeating the same libels as before. They formed “neo-Nazi” groups inEurope, Latin America, North America, and elsewhere, cultivating a fawning newgeneration of followers on every continent. They support Holocaust deniers andright-wing extremists everywhere, even when they do not agree on all points.They found official positions within extremist governments in the Middle Eastand Latin America.They also constitute an army-in-exile. They trained troops, instructed securityforces in interrogation and torture, ran guns. They conspired to assassinateobjectionable leaders in various countries, as well as those who betrayed theirown network. They developed weapons of mass destruction long before theidentical claim was laid at the door of Saddam Hussein.They are “non-state actors” like Al-Qaeda, with the difference that theyrecently had a state. They conduct “asymmetric warfare” because they can nolonger field battalions made of tanks and planes and submarines—and no longerreally need to do so. Using terror as a weapon has proven to be far moreeffective.They move money silently and unseen through the world's financial institutions.People like Schacht and Genoud wrote the book.And they are loosely organized. Individual units possess a certain degree ofdeniability, something that newer terror groups have copied.Al-Qaeda, Hamas, Hizbollah, Fatah, Jemaah Islamiyyah, Lash-kar-e-Taiba, etc. areall children of ODESSA. The pact between Nazi anti-Semitism and Arabanti-Semitism was made with Hajj Amin al-Husseini all those years ago—and hasbeen renewed every decade since—with refinements as necessary to reflectemerging political realities in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union.Skorzeny, al-Husseini, Genoud: one big happy family.Emboldened by the defeat of the Red Army in Afghanistan, aided and abetted byCIA, the militant forces of that remote yet deadly landscape turned theirattention on the West. Repudiating Western decadence and liberalism, the Talibanenforced strict and even idiosyncratic interpretations of syariah law.Proponents of the Third Way, the Taliban were equally disgusted with Sovietatheism and Communism, and with American materialism and liberalism. Yet, theywon the war against the Soviet invasion using asymmetric warfare. They were notable to field armored divisions, but had to wage a long and exhausting guerrillawar against helicopter gun-ships, tanks, and rockets.Asymmetric warfare is usually defined as the conflict between two, dramaticallyunequal, forces. The war of the United States in Vietnam is given as oneexample, where the vastly superior (in terms of economy, numbers, and militarystrength) US forces fought the guerrilla forces represented by the Viet Cong,and the regular North Vietnamese forces represented by the Viet Minh. Often theIsraeli-Palestinian conflict is given as another example, with the army and airforce of the Israeli military opposed to the various guerrilla factionsrepresented by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), plus those ofHamas and Hizbollah.In most, if not all cases, of asymmetric warfare of the last hundred years orso, it has often been that of a powerful western country embroiled in a conflictwith numerically and economically weaker non-state actors, which the currentproblem with Al-Qaeda and ISIL seems to represent. In these cases, the non-stateactors are fighting for their own territory, language, ethnic identity, etc.,often against a colonial or former colonial power, such as England, France, theNetherlands, Spain, etc.There is one type of asymmetric warfare that is usually not recognized orincluded in studies of this phenomenon, however: it is when a powerful stateloses its power yet continues to fight the forces that defeated it, using thesame means as non-state actors— such as terrorism and assassination. There is tomy knowledge only one such example in the modern world, and that is NaziGermany.As pointed out in studies of terrorism and asymmetric warfare, nationalist andethno-nationalist groups are those most likely to engage in this type ofprotracted and violent conflict. That is not to say that leftist,“internationalist” groups do not, and have not, also been involved in asymmetricwarfare; of course they have. The number of violent incidents involving leftistgroups is actually larger than those perpetrated by nationalist groups; howeverthe number of fatalities is substantially greater in those incidents perpetratedby the nationalists and ethno-nationalist, anti-colonial groups.Nationalism is a hallmark of the type of terrorism we have come to experience inthe post-World War Two period. It was actually given a form and an agenda by theNazis who created the Werewolf concept: a stay-behind guerrilla force that woulduse asymmetric tactics to wage war against the Allies. This was an example of astate that refused to cease hostilities even after defeat.Another type of asymmetric actor is the religious ideologue. As has been pointedout in studies of terrorism—especially since the events of September 11,2001—this new type of adversary may not be identified with a single ethnicity orgeographic territory. Even though the origins of the violent religious terroristmay be found in the post-colonial period, the nature of the conflict has changedconsiderably since then.What many fail to realize is that the ideology of the Nazi Party— particularlyas refined by the SS—was essentially a spiritual ideology. I have made the pointelsewhere that the Nazi Party was a cult. To try to understand it as a purelypolitical entity (in a modern, American context) is to make a grave mistake.The Nazi network that was formed in the last days of the war and which hasexisted, in one form or another in the seventy years since then, is comprised ofboth a nationalist and a religious agenda. The Nazi Party has its origins inesoteric Aryanism, such as represented by the writings of Guido von List andLanz von Liebenfels, as well as occultist groups such as the Armanenschaft, theGermanenorden, and the Thule Gesellschaft. These groups combined racist ideologywith spiritual, mystical ideas and practices, some of which were adapted frommore mainstream esoteric groups such as the Theosophical Society and thewritings of its founder, Helena Blavatsky. The Social Darwinism that is one ofthe hallmarks of the Nazi regime is the “outer court” of the spiritual Darwinismthat is clearly elucidated in Blavatsky's works. What this means is that Nazismis just as much a spiritual philosophy as it is a political one.Thus the basic components of the non-state actor in asymmetric warfare arepresent in the Nazi Underground (what we have been calling ODESSA). Theterrorist acts perpetrated by this Underground are precisely those of the modernnon-state actors with which we have all become familiar. The motivation forODESSA runs parallel to that of “Islamist” terror organizations: a spiritualviewpoint that both organizations wish to impose on the world through the mediumof terrorism, assassinations, and the like. Both ideologies are exclusive ratherthan inclusive; both are anti-Semitic; both are anti-American and deplore whatthey see as Western “decadence.” (One could make a very good case that Hitler'sobjection to modern art, modern music and modern culture in general is virtuallyidentical to the point of view of Islamist critics concerning the same.)In addition—and this may be more important than it seems at first glance—manymembers of the SS and the Wehrmacht converted to Islam after the war, and foundemployment and residence in Muslim countries. In some cases, they activelysupported Arab regimes in their opposition to the State of Israel by providingtechnical expertise, engineers, and training in interrogation, espionage, andrelated arts of war.I believe this provides an important perspective into the current terroristphenomenon, as it shows a continuity of purpose combined with tactical andoperational methods that have their origin in the murky world of the first daysof the Cold War—when a cynical manipulation of religion using non-state actorstook place under the aegis of a decades-long and often poorly thought-outcampaign of state-sponsored anti-Communism.During the course of many years of research (from about 1968–present) into theorigins of religious violence I have come into personal contact with both thePLO and Jemaah Islamiyyah (JI), as well as with North American racialist andwhite supremacist groups such as the National Renaissance Party (NRP) and the KuKlux Klan (KKK) among others, as well as with the South American Nazi sanctuaryand nexus for Operation Condor, Colonia Dignidad in Chile. I lived in Malaysiafor seven years, in an apartment that was only a few blocks from where the 9/11attacks were originally discussed, and in Indonesia where I met Abu BakrBa'asyir, the architect of the Bali Bombings in 2002, and founder of JI.I have also been on intimate terms with a number of conventional andnon-conventional religious organizations spanning various forms of Judaism,Christianity and Islam as well as Buddhism, the religious of India,Afro-Caribbean religions, and modern so-called “New Age” movements such asWicca, Satanism, and the secret societies of Western Europe and America. Ibelieve it is this unique perspective on both religion and politics that informsmy thesis that the choices we made as a country in the immediate post-war periodhave resulted in the current state of affairs where terrorism, “Islamism,” andother forms of asymmetric conflict are concerned.To quote Infield again:It has become evident during recent years that major wars in the nuclear agewill be fewer than those in the past but individual and group terrorism willincrease steadily. Skorzeny and his commandos during the Third Reich andSkorzeny and his ODESSA members during the postwar years were leaders in modernday terroristic tactics. Skorzeny's followers and students adhere to histeachings today.116 [../Text/part0026.html#c16-aft116]It was Skorzeny and his colleagues in ODESSA who, as early as 1950 and theoutbreak of the Korean War, proposed forming a bloc of non-aligned nations inAsia, Africa, and Latin America to stand up to America and Russia: exactly thesame position taken by Sukarno five years later. The position of the Islamisttheoreticians of today is not dissimilar: the difference is that the SovietUnion has already fallen.While China may develop into a threat, Uzbek and other activists in westernChina are creating another Muslim front with the intention of destabilizing thatregime. Seen as both Communist and Capitalist, China could be an interestingadversary for the Third Way position of contemporary Nazism. China is at leastas nationalist as its former enemy, Japan.As for Japan itself, it has recovered remarkably since the devastation of theSecond World War and two atomic bombs. Japan and Germany are economicpowerhouses. Even though Japan has been struggling in recent years, it is stillone of the most prosperous nations in the world.As for Germany, it has developed exactly as planned so long ago. It is reunitedand the leader of the European Union, easily its most powerful and influentialmember. It is true that growing numbers of immigrants from Eastern Europe andespecially Muslim immigrants from Turkey, the Balkans, and North Africa, areproviding an environment where questions concerning German identity andresponsibility are being raised. But as German cities have been rebuilt,industrial growth is strong, and memories of the war are fading with each newgeneration, it is doubtful whether any serious soul-searching will occur. Withtensions rising in Europe over the fate of Ukraine and the Russian annexation ofCrimea, it may be that the world will look to Germany again to provide thebuffer between a newly-aroused Russia and the much more vulnerable nations ofEastern and Southern Europe.It is doubtful whether the world will once again be confronted with jack-bootedstorm troopers wearing swastika armbands, singing the Horst Wessel song; butthat does not mean that Nazism has disappeared. It has merely changed uniformsand moved to a different theater of operations. I do not wish to deprive theIslamic groups of agency in their present conflict with the West, but it isimportant to emphasize that they were as manipulated and exploited by theGermans in two World Wars as they had been by the colonial powers. The conceptof global jihad was foreign to Islam until created by a German spy—of Jewishancestry, no less—with a view towards using Muslims as proxy soldiers inGermany's fight with the Allied forces of England, France, and Russia. And whenthe Cold War began, they were manipulated once again: this time by Americanintelligence efforts to weaponize Islam against the Soviet Union. To continuethe struggle against the Western world that was begun by Westerners themselvesfor motives that had nothing to do with Islam or with genuine jihad is tocooperate in Western strategies that only will result in the destruction of moreMuslim lives and the desolation of more Arab lands.This is especially true with regards to Palestine. The Palestinians themselvesmust realize that no assistance is coming their way from the vastly wealthierand populous Arab world. The devastation of Gaza and the ongoing occupation ofthe West Bank is the legacy of decades of Arab indecision and manipulation. Itis obviously far more beneficial to have the Palestinians live in squalor anddie in refugee camps than to have the Arab nations work together to create amore productive solution. The Arab leaders have long since realized that theNazi and Zen ideals of heroic death on the battlefield are dated notions,suicidal and non-productive, that can only end in annihilation. Yet theytolerate and even encourage the raging anti-Semitism of Hitler, Goebbels, andvon Leers because it directs Palestinian anger towards Israel (and the UnitedStates), and away from the Arab leaders themselves who have found themselves inan increasingly vulnerable situation since the revolts of the Arab Spring.Palestinian suicide bombers, however, have looked towards Hitler and Hajj Aminal-Husseini as avatars of the New Islam, of the desire to create a caliphatethat will stretch from Jerusalem and Mecca all the way to Southeast Asia. ToKuala Lumpur, and Jakarta.And, yes, even to Sumbawa.We are still fighting World War One, and we will continue to fight it. We areredrawing the world map once again in lines of blood and steel. America shouldbe at the forefront of the fight to end these conflicts, but our moralleadership has been called into question again and again. We made mistakes atthe end of World War Two: we sided with the colonial powers when we should havemade common cause with the indigenous peoples of the Middle East, Africa, andAsia who looked to us as their natural allies. We enlisted the aid of Nazis andNazi war criminals to accelerate our space program and to field espionage agentsagainst the Soviet Union. We allowed dedicated and committed anti-Semites with ahistory of violence and bloodshed against civilian populations to run freely inthe developing nations, training torturers and assassins.We acted out of fear; we co-opted our values, trading them for greater security.This, too, is the Hitler Legacy. We thought we could control the Devil that wasthe Nazi Party and the SS, using them to protect ourselves against Russia. Weused the strategies developed by the Germans in two world wars to coerce andcajole Muslim believers to declare a holy war—a holy war that would one day beaimed at us.We lived up to the charges made against us by the Islamists—that we were withoutfaith, bereft of spirituality, obsessed with materialism, cold enough to thesummons of the soul that we could contemplate weaponizing religion: seeing it asjust one more tool, one more element in our ever growing arsenal of destruction.We could urge Muslims and Buddhists to risk their lives in attacks against ourenemies, willing to fight to the last drop of their blood, using their faith—andclumsy, awkward protestations of our own—as the motivation for deadly, violentaction when we had no moral, no legitimate right at all, to demand this of them.Is it any wonder, then, that the blowback was so severe, the hatred soconcentrated?The networks still exist, transforming softly from time to time, changing withevery new political development on the world stage. There are names in theaddress book of ODESSA chief Hans-Ulrich Rudel of people who are still alive asthis is being written: people scattered all over the world, devotees, truebelievers, carrying the torch in a virtual Nuremberg Rally, feeling more andmore comfortable by the day.New groups are being formed, new leaders chosen from among the faithful.Xenophobia is at an all-time high in Europe and increasingly in America. TheInternet has provided new and improved means of communication. Arab systems ofmoney transfer such as hawala are used to defeat the strictures of theinternational banking system, made more severe after the events of 2001. Thehysteria we used to feel about secret Communists has been replaced by hysteriaover terrorism. We lost our way, briefly, in the 1950s over Communism; andinnocent people were ruined, reputations destroyed. Now again we are equallyparanoid to the extent that TSA agents pat down the elderly and infants instrollers. We are increasingly made to disrobe before we can board a plane, andwe are thankful because this means we will be safer.But, if we want to, we can walk across the border into Canada or Mexico.As the political life of every country becomes more and more polarized between“right” and “left,” the men of ODESSA can only laugh at our discomfort. When theBerlin Wall came down many thought that the world had become a safer place. Theydid not realize that this was only phase one of the overall plan, the one thatmight have been hatched in Strasbourg in 1944 at the Maison Rouge Hotel. Or not.But it was the plan.And when the Soviet Union fell, many patted themselves on the back thinking thathistory was at an end, that all serious conflict was over, except maybe for alittle clean-up here and there. Nothing to worry about. Our side won.Dream on.On the sixth of June, 1948 Savitri Devi—the woman historian NicholasGoodrick-Clarke called “Hitler's Priestess”—met the venerable old Swedishexplorer Sven Hedin. Distraught over the destruction of the Reich and theexecutions at Nuremberg, she asked him:“And I'd like to know, can we have any hope?”He said, “Why do you say, ‘Can we have any hope?’ Do you have no hope?”She then replied, “Those of Nuremberg, they have killed them.”Sven Hedin said, “Don't fear. Germany has more such men.”“Yes, but when will they appear?”“They'll appear in time.”“What about the Führer? Is he dead or alive?”“Whether he's dead or alive, he's eternal.”117[../Text/part0026.html#c16-aft117]115 [../Text/part0026.html#c16-ft115] Glenn B.

We find from other sourcesthat Oswald was still interested in Indonesia even after his return to theUnited States from the Soviet Union. So, Indonesia is somehow on Oswald's radarfor whatever reason.The German aspect, though, is equally inscrutable and perhaps it does not beginwith the address book but considerably earlier.As is well-known, after Oswald got out of the Marines he defected to Russia soonthereafter. What is not so well-known is the fact that he applied to a bizarrelittle college in Switzerland first. This was the Albert Schweitzer Collegelocated in the tiny village of Churwalden, in the Alps. At the time he applied,the village itself had only about 500 inhabitants and the local people had noteven heard of the college.Surprisingly, Oswald's application to the college and correspondence he receivedfrom the college on their stationery including the envelope recently went toauction and earned more than ten thousand dollars. (What these documents weredoing in private hands and being auctioned off is anyone's guess, but it isborderline criminal considering the ongoing controversy in this case.)In any event, it seems that the college was the dreamchild of a few Unitariansin the United States who were working for the US government in variouscapacities. This included Perceval Brundage, who was chief of the Bureau of theBudget under President Eisenhower. Incredibly, he was also on the board ofProject HOPE, the program that sent the hospital ship of the same name toIndonesia in 1960 and from which Doctor Sosro Husodo disembarked to find ourDoctor Pöch.The college did not advertise and indeed only ever had as many as fifty studentsper semester, mostly by word-of-mouth. Yet, Oswald knew of the school and was soenthusiastic over this unknown college that he sent the sum of twenty-fivedollars (a lot of money in 1959) to reserve his place for the April 1960semester. Even more surprisingly, he was accepted without demur. Anyone havingany experience in applying for college understands how strange this is,particularly considering Oswald had no academic record to speak of.However he never made it to the school, instead winding up in Moscow when he wassupposed to be in Switzerland studying German, among other things, and the restis history.Later, after the assassination, his address book was discovered to contain thecontact information for a German teacher in Russia as well as some rudimentaryGerman vocabulary. This indicates that as late as his defection to Moscow he wasstill interested in learning German. Why?On another page is the entry that has conspiracy enthusiasts most interested. Itis the address of the American Nazi Party in Hollis, Queens, New York and thename of Dan Burros (1937-1965) who was the aide to Party founder George LincolnRockwell.Burros was secretly Jewish, and when news of his Jewish ancestry was made publiche committed suicide, on Halloween, 1965 at the home of Roy Frankhouser inReading, Pennsylvania.Readers of my Unholy Alliance may remember that I knew Frankhouser personallyand went to his Klan office and home in Reading where I was confronted by “RiotRoy” who placed a Luger on the table between us after unceremoniously kickinghis mother down the stairs outside. I was met there by James Madole and hisentourage, of the National Renaissance Party: the quasi-mystical Naziorganization that Madole headed and which had formed an alliance with the KuKlux Klan.Seeing the address of the American Nazi Party as well as the name of Dan Burrosin Oswald's address book was something of a shock. How much more so to learnthat Oswald's mother was being represented by none other than H. Keith Thompson.Thompson (b. 1922) is a well-connected and well-placed figure in Nazi circles.Born in New Jersey he nevertheless became a member of the SD (Sicherheitsdienst)in 1941 due to his support of the Ger-man-American Bund and America First. Thelist of his contacts in the American, Latin American and European Right isextensive, from fascist theoretician Francis Parker Yockey to George Sylvester Viereck (a colleague of Aleister Crowley during the First World War when Crowleywas involved in spying on the Germans) to Otto Skorzeny, Hans-Ulrich Rudel, SSGeneral Otto Remer, Cuba's President Batista, Nazi Germany's “Last President”Admiral Dönitz, and even James Madole of the National Renaissance Party whomThompson investigated on behalf of ODESSA to determine whether or not theorganization was reliable.Thompson was registered as an agent of Otto Remer's Socialist Reich Party, andwas also an agent for Johann von Leers's Der Weg at the time the periodical wasbeing published by Leers in Argentina. He was also involved in providing weaponsto Batista, and arranging funding for various extreme-right causes. His contactsin ODESSA were so extensive that there exists a substantial FBI file on him.Therefore to find him representing Marguerite Oswald— the accused assassin'smother—was a little startling, to say the least. When asked by a researcher whathe knew of the Kennedy assassination, Thompson actually pleaded the 5thamendment and would not comment.Did Oswald have some connection, however tenuous, with Nazism either as asympathizer or as a spy for some other agency, American or Soviet? What was hisinvolvement in the proposed Indonesian coup of 1958? We know now that bothPresident Eisenhower and John Foster Dulles—who created the ICA in 1955—weredetermined to oust Sukarno. We know that U2 overflights above Indonesia weregathering intelligence to facilitate an invasion, and that these flights wouldhave been known to Oswald since most likely the flights would have originatedfrom Atsugi Air Base in Japan where he was stationed. We also know that thededicated anti-Communist and White Russian Georges de Mohrenschildt was workingfor ICA, possibly spying on Yugoslavia for the US government. Further, as astatement by Oswald acquaintance William K. Stuckey, dated November 24, 1963reveals, Oswald was reading books about Indonesia and believed that “Sukarno wasonly an opportunist who was using the Communists, not a Communist himself.” Aremarkably prescient observation and one that matched exactly what an OSS agenthad written years before.Additionally, we have the testimony of Delphine Roberts who worked in the officeof former FBI agent Guy Banister in New Orleans (the office associated withOswald and his phony Fair Play for Cuba operation). A white supremacist andanti-Semite herself she knew Banister well, and claimed that he was a member ofthe American Nazi Party and got their material through the mail. In fact,according to a sworn statement dated February 20, 1968 before the New OrleansDistrict Attorney's office by former Banister investigator Jack S. Martin,Banister even arranged bail money for George Lincoln Rockwell when the latterwas arrested for picketing the movie Exodus. Thus he was closer to Rockwell thanwe might have imagined. Did Oswald simply pick up this information around theoffice?Even more suggestive is another name found in the Oswald address book, this timeof Henry Warner Kloepfer. Kloepfer (1913–1982) was an important eugenicist andmember of various societies devoted to genetics and a regular contributor totheir publications. His wife Ruth admitted she knew the Oswalds and that shealso knew Clay Shaw. In fact, in 1963 the Kloepfers were living in an apartmentbuilding in New Orleans owned by Clay Shaw. In the 1950s Kloepfer made severaltrips to Cuba and later to Mexico City, and his daughter visited Moscow in 1963.The data on Thompson, Oswald, Burros, and Banister plus the mystery surroundingthe Albert Schweitzer College in Churwarden, Switzerland (which never reallyrecovered from being linked to the assassination and closed down a few yearslater) as well as the strange entries in the Oswald address book as usual raisemore questions than answers, but the questions all seem to come from the samebasic source: the presence of a racist, pro-Nazi element in the shadows of theKennedy assassination. We know of the extensive right-wing opposition to Kennedyand the accusations that he was soft on Communism, had ruined the Bay of Pigsinvasion against Cuba, and had cut too many deals with Russia. He and hisbrother, Robert F. Kennedy, had come down hard against extreme right-wingGeneral Walker when he tried to start a riot over the forced integration of theUniversity of Mississippi. Ads in Dallas that fateful day in November by otherright wing extremists had called for Kennedy to be arrested for treason.Could this possibly be another inheritance of the Hitler Legacy?"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX THREETHE HANS-RLRICH RUDEL ADDRESS BOOKSection OnePage One(This is what appears to be a breakdown of payments to individuals andorganizations.)Image [../Images/00060.jpeg]This is followed by a paragraph in German which is illegible, and then four moreentries, as follows:Image [../Images/00061.jpeg]The bottom of this page has a notation “Rudel”Page Two(Thus begins a straightforward address book.

The second sectionbegins alphabetically with “A” and is written in a different hand, as notedpreviously. The discrepancies include a totally different way of writing thenumerals 1 and 4. The longhand script is much neater and clearer, andconsiderably tighter. This leads me to believe that these two sections are bytwo different authors. As the names in the second book include Hans-Ulrich Rudeland Otto Skorzeny, as well as a misspelled Sedlmaier, it is my contention thatthis second section does not belong to any of these individuals but may verywell be Mengele's own address book or of someone close to all of theseindividuals. To clarify the listings, I have made parenthetical notations mostlyto identify the countries where they are not so identified in the original text.Question marks are mine, and indicate places where the handwriting is illegibleand where I have made a best guess.

He was an SSGruppenführer and Generalleutnant of the Police, among his other titles. He wasone of the last to leave the Berlin bunker in 1945, and was later captured bythe Soviets and held in detention for ten years before being released, only tobe arrested by the French and imprisoned for two more years. He had a plan tofly Hitler out of Berlin and had a plane standing by, ready to evacuate him, butHitler suggested he save himself and Martin Bormann that way. Hitler was thebest man at Baur's wedding in 1935.9 This is Arthur R. Butz, a professor of electrical engineering at NorthwesternUniversity who also wrote The Hoax of the Twentieth Century, a book denying theHolocaust took place.10 A town in Bavaria11 A town in Bavaria12 This is the famous Belgian Nazi, Leon Degrelle, who was part of the Naziunderground with Rudel and Skorzeny.13 This is Col. Robert Dilger, USAF (ret'd), a combat ace from Vietnam andcolleague of Pierre Sprey, q.v.14 This is the Wehrmacht veteran and WW II historian (1924–1993) who died inWurzburg.15 Possibly a reference to a family member of Richard Walther Darré, theMinister of Food under Hitler and advocate of the Blood and Soil philosophy ofthe Third Reich. Darré was born in Argentina.16 This is a member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Germany, in thiscase in Haltern am See. The CDU was the party of Konrad Adenauer as well asAngela Merkel, and developed after the end of World War II. While considered a“center right” conservative party, it also attracted a number of Nazis andneo-Nazis to its ranks in the 1960s and 1970s. As late as 2013, Dreckmann was aharbor master at Haltern and member of the Sailing Club of Haltern-am-See.17 Dyckerhoff and Widmann is a construction company in Germany that usedconcentration camp labor during the war.18 This is a town in Bavaria whose famous castle was heavily bombed by theAllies during the war.19 This is the only Rudel in this section of the book. The name Hanns arguesagainst it being Hans-Ulrich Rudel, as “Hanns” is a familiar given name thatwould not be confused with Hans.20 This is General Martin Harlinghausen (1902–1986), a highly-decoratedLuftwaffe commander during the war who also served in the West German Luftwaffefrom 1957–1961.21 Ernesto Hamann (1914–2008), an employee in some capacity for the NationalAtomic Energy Commission (CNEA), Atomic Center of Bariloche, Argentina.22 The only Holzers I have been able to find in this region—Oberaudorf, a suburbof Kiefersfelden—are tax consultants, Anton and Stephan Holzer.23 This is Ilse Hess (1990–1995), widow of the infamous Hitler aide Rudolf Hess,at her home in Hindelang, Bavaria. Mrs Hess was a committed Nazi her entirelife, and wrote for right-wing publications in Europe and corresponded regularlywith a coterie of Nazi admirers.24 This might be Major Karl Heinz Hoffmann (1912–1975), the former head of theGestapo in Denmark who was expelled from that country after serving only a fewyears in prison, and settled in Koblenz, Germany, and who was also a witness inthe trial of Adolf Eichmann. There is no indication, however, that HeinzHoffmann ever lived in South America, so this is a mystery still. He is not tobe confused with the East German general of the same name who built the BerlinWall.25 Possibly Walter Albert Huss who was a specialist in animal nutrition, and whohad gone on an expedition to Southwest Africa with the anthropologist Dr. H.Walter in the late 1930s. Huss's war record is murky, but he did receive hisdoctorate at the University of Stuttgart in 1944 which indicates that eventhough he is considered a “war veteran” he was able to continue his researchduring the war.26 This is the town and phone number for a Paul Krones and Elisabeth Krones. Nofurther information is available.27 This is Wilfried Kernbach, a White Supremacist and associate of Ben Klassen(author of many supremacist books and the originator of the term RaHoWa or“Racial Holy War”) as well as of Dr. William L. Pierce of the National Alliance.It was Kernbach's “Friends of Germany” organization, based in Rochelle Park, NewJersey, that raised funds to sponsor a visit to the United States by Hans-UlrichRudel and Otto Skorzeny in 1972, and engaged in a campaign to free Rudolf Hessfrom Spandau Prison.28 Most likely this is the same Dimitri Kakabadse who was an Ecuadoriangovernment official as well as Rotary Club president of Ecuador (1964–1965).Members of the Kakabadse family had attended German schools in Ecuador in thetwentieth century, and there was at least one Dimitri Kakabadse who was involvedwith a pro-German political party in Ecuador during World War II (but possiblyas an infiltrator, and further identified only as of Byelorussian descent).29 Possibly related to Alban Krug.30 Kurverwaltung means “Spa Authorities.”31 DTZ is the acronym for Deutsche Zentrale fuer Tourismus, the German Tourismboard.32 Krankenhaus is German for “hospital.”33 Formerly the Kahler Grand Hotel, this is the nearest hotel to the famous MayoClinic in Rochester, Minnesota where it is known Hans-Ulrich Rudel went fortreatment.34 A Dr Romeo Acosta was Paraguay's UN Ambassador in 1947 who voted in favor ofthe State of Israel. It is not certain that this is the same man, of course.35 This is Klaus Barbie, using his false identification as Klaus Altmann. Theaddress is the same as that for Barbie. Barbie was extradited from Bolivia in1983, thus this listing must predate 1983.36 This is a “golf resort hotel” not far from Rosenheim, which seems to be acenter for many of the names and addresses in the book, close as it is to theTyrol.37 This is Pierre Clostermann (1921–2006), a famous and highly-decorated WW IIpilot for the French Air Force and during the Algerian war of the 1950s. He wasalso a Member of the French Parliament, and expressed admiration for the pilotsof the Argentine Air Force who fought against the British in the FalklandIslands campaign of the 1970s. The address is in a small town on theFrench/Span-ish border in the Pyrenees. He was born in Curitiba, Brazil.38 This is William A. Curry (1947–2013), a Vietnam war veteran, Green Beret,paratrooper and member of the Special Operations Association. He moved toAsuncion, Paraguay in 2008 but returned to Columbus, Nebraska in 2013 and diedshortly thereafter. Presumably, Curry came into contact with whoever owned thisaddress book before his move to Paraguay in 2008 since the address book isconsiderably older than that. Thus, it could be speculated that whoever ownedthe book was in contact with Curry for decades before Curry's move to Asuncion,and that his move was due in part to this contact.39 This is Banco Continental, in Asuncion, Paraguay.40 This is Gladys Almada Caceres, a professor law in Asuncion.41 This is Jorge Carlos Carrettoni, Argentine politician who sits on numerouscorporate boards.42 This is H. Cramer Verlag, publisher of books on World War II.43 This is possibly Gabriel Paes de Carvalho on Rua Paulo Cesar de Andrade, aBrazilian businessman with many German clients, especially in the 1960s and1970s.44 This is Raul Calvet, a famous Paraguayan Air Force pilot and later head ofthe Paraguayan national airline, Linea Area Paraguaya (LAP). He was a friend ofAlfredo Stroessner, and rescued Nicaraguan dictator Somoza in 1979, flying himto Paraguay. Later, in 1987, his airline was discovered to have shipped 253 lbsof cocaine to Belgium leading to a general scandal and revealing the extent towhich the drug trade had penetrated Paraguayan society.45 Associated with the Hospital Centre del IPS, Asuncion, Paraguay.46 This word means “hairdresser.”47 A Gartnerei is a nursery or garden market.48 Siemens, of course, is the giant German electronics firm. Gabler ispresumably the patronymic of a Siemens employee. No more is known about thisperson.49 This is a prominent member of a Mennonite community in the Chaco area ofParaguay. It is known that Stroessner, Mengele and Rudel traveled frequently inthe region.50 This is Lisbeth Grolitsch, born in 1922, a fanatic neo-Nazi and former Gausub-leader of the League of German Girls, with a base at this address in Graz,Austria with her partner Herbert Schweiger, a former Untersturmfuhrer SS withthe Liebstandarte Adolf Hitler, arrested several times in the 1990s for pro-Naziactivities. They were both close associates of dedicated Nazi and WehrmachtMajor General Otto Remer, himself arrrested for treason because of his outspokenNazi views after the war.51 Gordon Gollob (1912–1987) was a famous Luftwaffe ace during the war, born inVienna. He was a committed Nazi and remained so until he died.52 Hermann Giesler (1898–1987), a Nazi architect and with Albert Speer one ofthe two most famous and influential in the Third Reich. He supervised slavelabor from the Muhldorf concentration camp, building weapons in undergroundfactories as director of the OT-Einsatzgruppe for the Gaue of Bavaria and theDanube. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for war crimes, but in 1952 he wasreleased and began writing his memoirs and pro-Nazi commentaries.53 There is a Dr. Gerhard Giss at this address in Freiburg.54 This is Hans-Joachim Göhring, an attorney who has defended Nazi clients inwar crimes trials (such as former SS officer Kurt Franz, a deputy commander atTreblinka, in 1965).55 This is Francois Genoud (1915–1996), a Swiss financier of the Naziunderground who was also involved in the arms trade and financed the legaldefense of Klaus Barbie, Adolf Eichmann and others. He was also accused of beinginvolved in the illegal shipments of Nazi “Black Eagle” gold and other assetsout of Germany at the end of the war, and was a major contributor to Arabnationalist causes beginning with that of Emir Al-Husseini and continuingthrough to the PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine) and toCarlos, the assassin known as “the Jackal.”56 This enigmatic reference is to an office building in downtown Asuncion, theEdificio Yegros, about a block from the intersecion of Calle 14 de Mayo andIndependencia. I have not been able to identify “Gut” either as a name or as anacronym.57 Otto Skorzeny and Hans-Ulrich Rudel were known to frequent the Canary Islandsduring the post-war period.58 This may be Otto Hantel, former Gestapo officer indicted for war crimes inLuxembourg and who was stationed for several years in Austria, at Innsbruck,where his wife's family lived during the war. The CIA had considered—as late as1963—using him in some capacity, but according to declassified CIA files it wasdecided not to do so due to his war crimes indictment (it is not certain whetherhe was ever convicted) and his membership in the SS and the Gestapo. For severalyears he served in the “anti-Catholic” and “anti-Jewish” department. It isperhaps coincidental that as the war ended he was given false papers in the nameof HENTSCHEL, which happens to be the name preceding his in the address book,and for which we have no further information. He was not a major, however, butthe highest rank he attained was equivalent to that of second lieutenant; yet,his whereabouts after 1950 or so are unknown and he may have obtained employmentwith a military or police organization since his career until that time had beenas criminal inspector.59 The phone number for Hochtief is in Essen and is the number for a Dr. Hermannin the Haus Hochtief. Hochtief is Germany's largest construction company, andwas responsible for building the Führerbunker in Berlin, as well as the Wolf'sLair and other Nazi construction projetcs, using slave labor from the camps. Itwas also responsible for moving the temples of Abu Simbel in Egypt, a massiveand controversial undertaking designed to rescue the site from the flooding dueto the Aswan Dam.60 This may indicate President Stroessner's son-in-law, Humberto DominguezDibbs, living in one of Stroessner's apartment buildings in Miami. The phonenumber today is for a cell-phone provider's retail office on Bird Road in Miamiand thus may be assumed not to be that of Humberto Dominguez Dibbs.61 Today this phone number belongs to a dentist in Itzehoe; however, there is anEgon Geyer in Itzehoe who is also a dentist.62 Guanes is a common Paraguayan patronymic. Without further information noidentification is possible at this time.63 This is possibly Gustavo Stroessner, the President's son.64 This is a South African of German descent who lived his whole life(1932–2009) in South Africa. He can be discovered on the My Heritagegenealogical website where one learns that his idol was Hans-Ulrich Rudel.http://www.myheritage.com/site-family-tree-141398351/otto-und-hanna-kassier[http://www.myheritage.com/site-family-tree-141398351/otto-und-hanna-kassier].(last accessed November 5, 2013) One wonders if that is the only reason VictorKassier appears in this address book. Did Rudel—or whoever owned thebook—consider anyone who liked them a suitable candidate for inclusion?65 This is the first of many Rudels listed in the address book.66 This, of course, is historian and indicted Holocaust denier David Irving, whohas many contacts among the Nazi underground, including the widow of WalterHewel, Francois Genoud, and many others.67 There is not enough information to identify this listing. There is a ChacoBoreal street near Calle Dr Telmo Aquino in Asuncion, and this may be an officebuilding.68 This may be another reference to someone who works at Siemens, the Germanelectronics giant.69 There is no further information on this name. The address is now an autoparts and service shop in Frankfurt, Germany. There was a Ferdinand Lammeyer whowas an artist in Germany during the war, but not much more is known about him.70 This could be a law firm, but so far unidentified.71 This is the founder of the Liebherr Group, a Swiss construction equipmentconsortium with global business based in Bulle, Switzerland and with their cranemanufacturing operation based in Biberach, Germany.72 This is Rohde and Liesenfeld, a shipping, transport and logistics companythat was founded in Germany in 1933 and which now has operations worldwide.73 This is probably Jochen von Lang (1925–2003), a well-known journalist andauthor who specialized in World War Two history and in biographical studies ofEichmann, Bormann and Baldur von Schirach.74 Probably the Commander in Chief of the Argentine Air Force, not otherwiseidentified.75 This is still the address of Siegfried (1917–2001) and Edith Leesemann, inKassel on Elbeweg 6. No more is known about this couple.76 There are many Horst Langes in Germany and at least forty in the Schwerteregion, so without more information we cannot identify this gentleman further.77 Without a first name we cannot be sure of this identification. Schliersee isa hotbed of neo-Nazi activity due to its long Freikorps history. The phonenumber today is that of a kite-flying club.78 This is Linea Aerea Paraguayana, the Paraguayan national airline.79 This is the father of Inge Morath (1923–2002), the famous Austrian-bornphotographer and wife of American playwright Arthur Miller. Her father, Werner,was a scientist who worked in Berlin specializing in wood chemistry.80 Vicente Lopez is a district in Buenos Aires, and the address is that of theSecretaria de Inteligencia (SI), the intelligence service of the Argentinegovernment. It is not known who Moritz may be, but the address is in the FederalDistrict near the Casa Rosada (the presidential palace). The phone number is anolder version; today phone numbers in Buenos Aires typically have eight digits.81 This is the phone number for Alfred and Doris Muller, at Englschalkingerstr203 (not 20) in Munich, with the later version of the number as 089931885. It isnot known what the relationship is between the Mullers and the owner of theaddress book. It is possibly Alfred Muller (1915–1997), a general of theWehrmacht who also served with the West German army in the 1950s. It is temptingto think it is Alfred Muller who had been the head of the Nazi Party inArgentina and who was a member of the German Embassy staff in Buenos Aires (whowas briefly arrested by the Argentine government in 1940 when it was claimedthat the Nazis had written a position paper on seizing Patagonia, among otherArgentine assets). Unfortunately, not enough is known at this time of either ofthese persons to identify Alfred Muller in Munich as it is a very common name.82 Impossible to know who this is, or where this person is located (country,city, etc).83 It is not known who this is, but if the address is in Schweinfurt it is theheadquarters of the government's Tax Office.84 This is an address in what is today Namibia in Africa. “SWA” referred to itsolder designation as “South West Africa” also known then as “German South WestAfrica.” The exchange 0026461 is correct for Windhoek. Heinz Marting had boughtthe house in Windhoek in 1950. Not more is known about him, save that he is ofGerman descent and lived in the German colony there. He is possibly anotheradmirer of Hans-Ulrich Rudel, like Victor Kassier (above).85 This is Willibald Mattern, and the location is Santiago, Chile. Mattern wentto Chile from Germany in the 1920s and in 1974 wrote a book about Nazi secretweapons and UFOs for the underground publisher Samisdat, run by Ernst Zundel(who also appears in this address book). Zundel would go on to publish works bySavitri Devi (the Greek woman who became a staunch pro-Nazi and supporter ofAryan mysticism, as well as a friend of Hans-Ulrich Rudel and other prominentNazis).86 This is Irmingard Mairhofer, at Kaiser Franz Josef Allee 15, 83088Kiefersfelden, Germany.87 This may be the same Hans Mezger who is a famous German automobile engineerand responsible for much of the Porsche technology. Porsche is based inStuttgart, and Leinzell is a suburb of that city. However, the phone numbermarked “apotheks” would seem to indicate a drug store or apothecary, and I donot know how this would be related to anything having to do with Porsche's HansMezger.88 There is a landscaper with this name in Neckarwestheim.89 This is the address for a home for the mentally disabled. I do not know whoHermann Medari is.90 Erna Moll wrote articles for the neo-Nazi publication Recht und Wahrheit, amagazine connected to Otto Ernst Remer and other post-war Nazi propagandists. Itis the official publication of the Deutsche Freiheitsbewegung (DDF): the GermanFreedom Movement Association, whose honorary chairman is Otto Remer. Themagazine is a compendium of anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial, and anti-Americanmotifs and sentiments.91 This is Capt. Ernst August Niermann, a fellow pilot of Hans-Ulrich Rudel, andone who used the Ratlines to escape to Argentina, first using documentationprovided by Mgr. Krunoslav Draganovic and by the ICRC. He hid in Bozen (Bolsano)since 1946 and eventually applied for the exit papers in 1948 along with fellowpilot Werner Baumbach. Their applications were filed with the ArgentineCommission in Genoa, the same Commission whose address appears in the Pöchaddress book. It should be noted that Pöch himself was hiding in Bozen from1946, but mysteriously stayed in Italy until the end of 1953 (long after mostothers had already left, including Klaus Barbie).92 This is Werner Naumann (1909–1982), a prominent Nazi in Goebbels's Ministryof Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, a member of the Freundeskreis Himmler(along with Schacht, Ernst Schäfer, Emil Helfferich, etc.) and one of the lastto leave the Führerbunker in April of 1945. Naumann fled to Argentina after thewar where he edited a neo-Nazi magazine, Der Weg. He was later arrested (1953)for his involvement with a group of Nazi sympathizers (known as the “NaumannCircle”) who were intent on infiltrating or overthrowing the West Germangovernment and replacing it with a Nazi regime. Naumann was an intimate ofSkorzeny, Rudel, Degrelle, and British fascist and pro-Nazi Oswald Mosley.93 This is Karl Nicolussi-Leck (1917–2008), a highly-decorated captain in theWaffen-SS who fled to South America but who returned to his native Tyrol in theearly 1950s. (Sigmundskron is in the Bolzano area, a region favored by Nazirefugees during the war.) He became heavily involved in Tyrolean arts andculture and was responsible for founding several museums and institutes devotedto South Tyrol arts.94 Holger Nauroth was the co-author of the monograph The Defence of the Reich:Hitler's Night Fighter Planes and Pilots and thus it can be presumed that he wasa friend of Hans-Ulrich Rudel.95 This is Oie and Boris Allikivi and the address of the Estonian CulturalCentre in Adelaide, Australia.96 This is an intriguing listing for someone in Egypt, but it has not beenpossible to identify Dr Oernest.97 This is General Pereira Porfirio Ruiz Diaz (1926–2012), a Paraguayan militarycommander and head of the Army Corps of Engineers who served as the Mayor(Intendente) of Asuncion, Paraguay from 1976–1989 under Stroessner. He was also,of course, a member of Stroessner's Colorado Party.98 Priller was an officer of the Association of Reservists of the German ArmedForces.99 This is General Alcibiades Britez, head of the national police underStroessner.100 No clue.101 This is, of course, the office of the President of Chile who, at the timethe address book was presumably written, was General Augusto Pinochet who tookcontrol of the country during the overthrow of Salvador Allende in 1973.102 This is Margarethe (“Gretl”) Platzer, the “first female master locksmith ofStyria”, employed by Anton Paar Co. with headquarters in Graz, Austria.103 Another in the list of Rudels in the address book, this one with a phonenumber in Dusseldorf. The address and even the given name are illegible.104 This is an interesting listing, for the address is that of the Danish andGreenland consulates in Asuncion, Paraguay and Rasmussen is Caruto RasmussenNiedergesas, the Consul-General of Denmark and an important businessman inParaguay with fingers in many pies.105 This is Haus Richberg and for a time was the home address of West Germanneo-Nazi terrorist Manfred Roeder.106 This is Hubert Pölz, a famous Luftwaffe Stuka pilot (like Rudel) who wentmissing in Spain in 1994.107 Of course, this is a phone number for the office of the President ofArgentina in Buenos Aires (Baires).108 A Christian Identity minister who is referred to as “Doctor Potito” by hisadmirers, Oren F. Potito (1931–1995) published the white supremacist NationalChristian News.109 This is a cement manufacturing company located in Beckum, Germany and whichis now part of Thyssen-Krupp. “Diehl” however is a munitions manufacturingcompany.110 A company called Aspersion Api (a manufacturer of irrigation equipment) islocated at this address in Buenos Aires. It is a small, two-story building witha shop on the ground floor and an apartment upstairs. “Pertussi” is Ing. AlbertoPertusi, a Peronist and fanatic right-wing Argentine patriot.111 This is the school Zoilo Rodaz-Ortiz in Paraguay. Nothing else is knownabout the school.112 This is the address of the Italian-Slovak Chamber of Commerce.113 This is the phone number and town for one Apollonia Rummel. Her significanceat this time is unknown.114 This, of course, is Walter Rauff (1906–1984), SS Standartenführer (Colonel)and inventor of the mobile gas van for extermination of prisoners by carbonmonoxide fumes, the forerunner of the gas chambers used in the death camps. Helived out his days in Chile and was given a Nazi funeral by his friend MiguelSerrano (q.v.). A rabid anti-Semite, he followed Rommel's Afrika Korps to NorthAfrica, rounding up Jews in the captured territories as he went. He later becameanother cog in the wheel of the Nazi underground and one of its most prominentleaders, protected by the Pinochet regime and acting as a consultant toPinochet's government. Rauff—and Rudel—were frequent visitors to ColoniaDignidad.115 There is an Erich Reiter in Dillingen/Saar who is a construction consultant.116 Hans-Ulrich Rudel's son, Johann-Christoph Rudel.117 This is Hans-Ulrich Rudel's wife.118 While a Rudel, Wolfram (b. 1918) seems to have been involved with Jewishsurvivor issues and was in contact with the Association of Jewish Refugees. Ibelieve this to be Hans-Ulrich's younger brother.119 May be an associate working for Varig, the Brazilian national airline.120 Hans Reichert (1920–2007) was born in Austria and seems to have come to theUnited States in 1955, spending 6 years in Rhode Island and then the last 46years in Chicago. He owned a string of German-themed restaurants – the LinzerHof and the Frankfort Hoffbrau Haus—as well as the Belmont Lounge. He was also amusician, and president of the North Side Chess Club. His friends, Jeannie andVinnie DiFalco, own a jewelry manufacturer in Rhode Island and shared a vacationhome with Reichert in Florida. His connection to the Nazi underground (if any)is unknown at this time. The DiFalcos have not answered my attempts to contactthem.121 Of course, this is Hans-Ulrich Rudel himself. His listing in this addressbook mitigates against it being his, for who writes his own name and address inhis own address book, and alphabetically at that? Yet, there are so manyLuftwaffe pilots and aviation specialists in this address book that there is agood chance it is, indeed, Rudel's.122 This is Hans-Ulrich Rudel's partner in “Multisports Kierspe GmbH”: a gym andsports sanctuary in this small German town. Siegfried Rudel is also the authorof a number of books on sports (skiing), self-improvement and educationincluding works on Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy and the Waldorf School.123 I have not been able to identify this Cincinnati, Ohio listing.124 I have not been able to identify this listing so far.125 This is Ernst Straka, who now has a different address in Frankfurt but thesame phone number (in updated form). It is not known what Straka's connection isto the owner of the address book.126 This is an interesting listing, for it is that of Hans Sedlmaier, JosefMengele's go-between. Sedlmaier worked for the Mengele family business all hislife, and went frequently to South America to visit Josef Mengele, bringingletters, hard-to-get German delicacies, etc. His home was raided by the WestGerman police on several occasions; on the last one, the police discovered atrove of Mengele disjecta membra: diaries, an address book, letters. The phonenumber here has a Gunzburg exchange, which is where the Mengele operation waslocated and where Sedlmaier lived. The problem with this listing is that thename Sedlmaier is misspelled. This implies (a) that it is not Sedlmaier's ownaddress book and (b) most likely not Mengele's address book, for it could beassumed that Mengele would known how to spell the name of this most importantperson in his underground existence.127 Evidently a relation of President Stroessner, for Stroessner's father wasborn in this town.128 Possibly SS Mitglied Ernst Sander.129 President Stroessner's eldest son (1945–2011), implicated in the financingof Operation Condor: the secret collaboration between South America's militarydictatorships in the assassination of political enemies. Gustavo Stroessner wasan air force colonel and also heavily involved in the cocaine trade betweenParaguay and Europe, along with the Paraguayan national airline which was usedto transport hundreds of kilos of cocaine to Belgium in one particular incident.However, the address given here is Asuncion, and the Stroessners fled Paraguayfor Brazil in 1989, another indication that the address book cannot date muchlater than the mid-1980s (or about the time Barbie was extradited to France, andthe time Mengele's death in Brazil was reported and confirmed and Sedlmaier'shome in Gunzburg raided).130 Hans-Ulrich Rudel lived in this hotel for awhile ca. 1975.131 Miguel Serrano was Chile's most famous Nazi. A former ambassador of Chile toAustria, Yugoslavia and India he was also friendly with C.G. Jung as well asHermann Hesse. He believed Hitler to have been an Avatar of the Indian god Kalkiwho had come to cleanse the earth and usher in a New Age. It was Serrano whoemceed the funeral for N azi murderer Walter Rauff in Chile, and who praisedColonia Dignidad as a kind of Shambhala of the Andes. He was also one of thenodes in the Nazi underground and communicated regularly with fugitives such asMengele, Barbie, Skorzeny and Rudel.132 This is a phone number in Baden-Baden, Germany and may simply be that ofanother Siemens employee.133 The private telex number for President Alfredo Stroessner in Asuncion.134 The famous Dutch Nazi and member of the underground, Willem Sassen, who cameto prominence due to his exclusive interview with Adolf Eichmann.135 Of course, Otto Skorzeny, one of the leaders – with Rudel – of the Naziunderground, with his phone numbers in Madrid and Zurich.136 The Motor Vehicle Bureau of the German town of Viersen.137 Not certain what this indicates. The Saurer company of Switzerland – withbranches in Germany and Austria—is a manufacturer of trucks and busses and mostfamously built the vans that were used—under Walter Rauff's direction—for theextermination of prisoners.138 Undetermined. There is a car repair company in Viersen with this name.Viersen is also the location of the Motor Vehicle Department mentioned above.139 These Slabbers are a bit of a mystery. They are concentrated in and aroundViersen (except for the address in St Johann in the Tirol) and they all seem tobe involved with cars. This address is for Wolfgang Viersen and his website iswww.autopartk-viersen.de [http://www.autopartk-viersen.de]. Viersen is a town onthe Netherlands border.140 This is Rodrigo Diaz Sitjar, a right-wing author, who wrote that Jewishbankers “have made a pact with the devil” in a 1993 article entitled “TheInvisible Government of the World” in the magazine Más allá de la ciencia(“Further than Science”) which mixes Nazism and anti-Semitism with New Agetopics such as UFOs and Egyptology, ancient aliens, etc.141 This is Pierre Sprey, aircraft designer and defense analyst (and jazz recordproducer) who was one of the small team that created the F-16 and the A-10.Fluent in German, he interviewed Hans-Ulrich Rudel as part of his researchconcerning optimum design criteria for jet fighters.142 A member of the Naumann Circle and a co-conspirator in the plannedinfiltration and eventual overthrow of the West German government, Schütz(1913–1999) was a member of the Waffen-SS and a number of Nazi support groupsafter the war. A journalist and publisher, he specialized in extreme-rightpublications.143 This is an SS Obersturmbannführer, formerly an adjutant to Foreign MinisterJoachim von Ribbentrop.144 This is Margot Hartwig Schneider, an apothecary in Eschweiler.145 Alexander Schirger (1925–2013) wrote for a review of metaphysics. The MayoClinic, however, is where Hans-Ulrich Rudel would go due to ongoing and chronicproblems with his health.146 Dr Andreas Schwarz organized SS reunions and was chairman of a veteransassociation for infantrymen.147 Runs a Luftwaffe photo archive.148 This is Raymond F. Toliver, World War II historian who has interviewedseveral Nazis.149 A member of HIAG, this former SS officer was friendly with Generals Baur,Mohnke, Wolff and others and was involved in the Hitler Diaries hoax through hisfriend Gerd Heidermann of Stern.150 This is Hans Weinsheimer, a printer.151 A manufacturer of industrial plant equipment. Employer of Plano Zschernack,q.v.152 Tony Weissteiner (1921–2012) was a member of the South Tyrol VeteransAssociation.153 Possibly Klaus Weidenmann, involved with the Evangelical-Lutheran Church,based in Haan (a suburb of Düsseldorf where this address is found).154 This is the address of Helga (sometimes Hulda) and Georg Wilhelm Wagner(1890–1970?), in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Georg Wagner was a member of the Club Hipicosince January 18, 1967 but seems to have died circa 1970. Thus, this would bethe contact information for his widow.155 An IT engineer for the firm Dyckerhoff-Widman (q.v.).156 This is the Goethe School in Asuncion, a German-Paraguayan institution withwhich Wölfel is affiliated.157 This address is at Bahnhofpl. 2A, 9500 Villach-Innere Stadt, and Winklerworks with a group supporting war victims and the disabled.158 Probably Walther Wenke (1900–1982), the youngest general in the Wehrmachtduring World War II.159 This is the daughter of Klaus Barbie. Her husband is Heinrich Messner.160 Jacques Vasseur was a Nazi collaborator during the war.161 Slightly confusing, as Vallemi is a town in Paraguay. It is likely that DrNuñez can be found there.162 Possibly meant for Varig, the Brazilian national airline.163 A five star hotel in Buenos Aires.164 An institution that specializes in cell therapy, it was created by PaulNiehans, a man with “pronounced Nazi sympathies” who treated – among othercelebrities – Pope Pius XII (who died soon thereafter).165 This is Paraguayan Minister of the Interior Edgar Ensfran, a friend of bothHans-Ulrich Rudel and Josef Mengele.166 An inventor of safety equipment for industrial environments, he worked forWalther & Cie. (q.v.)167 The full address includes 40 Loftus Crescent in this small Australian town.Zappenfeld was “geb. Muckner”, meaning that Muckner is her maiden name. There isa Rudolf Muckner in the address book (q.v.) who lived in Germany,168 Most likely Ernest Zaugg is intended: a Boston journalist who coveredVietnam, Algeria and other and who moved to Munich for awhile to run his ownnews agency, the Hometown Feature Agency. He was hardly a pro-Nazi, however, andwas critical of Holocaust revisionists.169 This is Ernst Zundel, the owner of Samisdat (a neo-Nazi publishing house),and intimate of Willibald Mattern (q.v.) as well as of members of the Naziunderground including Savitri Devi, Hans-Ulrich Rudel, and others. Zundel wasbased in Canada but used a Buffalo mail drop in the United States as well. Heran afoul of the Canadian authorities as a Holocaust denier."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 4TERROR TOURISMThis is an account I wrote shortly after my visit to the pesantren or religiousboarding school in Solo, Indonesia where I met Abu Bakr Ba'asyir, the man whomore than any other represents terrorism in Indonesia through his creation ofJemaah Islamiyyah, considered an Al-Qaeda affiliate by US intelligence. Shortlyafter this meeting he was arrested again and at the time of this writing is inprison.For the most part, names of attendees have been redacted for their protection.Instead, I have identified their country of origin.June 19, 20072:30 pm"},{"pageContent":"VISIT TO AL-MUKMIN PESANTRENThe pesantren is about 20 minutes from our hotel by tour bus, and is close tothe Hotel Indah Palace in Solo. We leave the hotel about 1:45 pm or so. Thewomen are told to wear hijabs. We had been waiting for permission to visit thepesantren since we arrived in Solo two days ago. The arrangements were allthrough Yayah Khisbayah, who kept us abreast of the developing story (“Maybethis afternoon; maybe tomorrow”). She told us that we were going to meet AbuBakr Ba'asyir. Most of those present (from the United States) had no idea who hewas. As the writer had lived in Malaysia at the time of the Bali Bombings ofOctober, 2002, he knew very well who he was and was intrigued by the possibilityof actually meeting the man many insist was the architect of those bombings. Aco-founder of terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah, Abu Bakr Ba'asyir (or ABB as hewas referred to by Yayah) is a notorious figure in terrorism studies. A staunchsupporter of the concept of hilafat – revival of the Islamic Caliphate thatextended from Thailand through the Malay and Indonesian archipelago to thePhilippines – he is an unapologetic anti-Semite and anti-westerner.The Australians among our group refused to attend this meeting, due to theirunderstandable reluctance to be in the same room as the man who inspired themurder of more than a hundred of their countrymen.Our bus stops at the side of the road. We have to walk about 300 meters down anarrow, winding street to the pesantren, and arrive about 2:15 pm. We make abizarre sight: mostly white men and women (the women in some form of headscarf)jauntily parading down the street to the religious boarding school whose mostfamous faculty member is ABB. As we turn a corner to face the entrance to thepesantren we are met by a horde of photographers (mostly still, but a few videocameras are also in evidence). They are furiously taking photos of everyone inour party.We number perhaps thirty, or less. We are held up outside the school untilsomeone appears to allow us in but only after informing us that the women mustcome in last and sit in the back of the room. Yayah is doing the translating andthe negotiating. This is causing some heated reaction from the women in ourgroup who see this as a form of discrimination. Odd, that these internationalpeace-keepers were unfamiliar with traditional Muslim practice in a holy place.Many are objecting to the presence of the photographers. Yayah is doing her bestto get rid of them, but has only managed to get rid of the greater part of thecrowd. Some photographers will stay behind as long as they can until they, too,are told to leave by the pesantren officials but not before we are all capturedon film.We are led into a classroom—women in the back, men in the front—where we waitfor ABB to show up. We take photos ourselves of everything in sight, includingeach other. Time on our hands. A person sitting next to me is obviously dazzledby this event, and asks me, “Bashir is a simple man. What do you think?” Irespond that this is what I came to find out.A kind of emcee shows up, dressed like a priest in a black tunic and sporting awispy beard. He's maybe 5′5″ and roughly 30 years old. He carries a microphone.Everyone stands as ABB arrives, at about 2:40 pm.One of the students opens with Assalaam aleikhoum and a brief prayer. We arewelcomed to the pesantren. (Yayah translates everything from here on to the endof the visit.)The head of the school—Usta Whahayuddin—is introduced and describes ABB as the“supervisor” of the school. He then goes on to say that the pesantren is theoldest form of educational system in Indonesia. The three aspects of a pesantrenare: teacher—compound—students.There are three types of pesantren: traditional—modern—combination. Thisparticular pesantren was established in 1972. Students at al-Mukmin come fromdifferent parts of Indonesia and include junior high school, high school,teachers' school, and higher education students as well as madrassah. Themission of the pesantren is to educate the next ulama “cadre”.We are briefly interrupted by the azzan, whose call to prayer comes over theloudspeaker.Whahayuddin goes on to say “We educate them to be ulamat in their communities.The ideal is to establish a Muslim community ready to implement all theteachings of Islam, viz:Pure monotheismIbadah (ultimate submission to God)Sound moralsPhysical soundness and healthGrowth of knowledgeIndependence (entrepreneurship)Fighters in the way of AllahUseful to the community and to themselvesWe break for prayers. During the break, we wander around relativelyunsupervised. The writer takes a few pictures of the classrooms, the compounditself, a jihadist poster, a cartoon mocking the US military, etc.After prayers, we return to the classroom and ABB entertains questions from theaudience.The first question is from Ms. ...(from Malaysia):“Why is Bashir accused as a terrorist? And why is this school so feared andaccused if the purpose is to create a better person?”A: (Bashir) “It was not the government of Indonesia who accused me of terrorism,but the USA and the Jews, and Singapore and Australia and the Indonesiangovernment [sic]. I give the true teaching of Islam according to the Qur'an andthe Sunnah to my students, and this teaching is feared by the Jews. I demand theimplementation of Islamic law, but I can't be arrested for that. So they accusedme of terrorism. The true teaching of Qur'an should be implemented byindividuals and groups but also at the national level, but hilafat on theinternational level is feared by the Jews, Bush and Lee Kuan Yew. I was notproven to be involved in terrorist activity.”This sounded like a canned speech, something created by a lawyer. It was theonly time ABB sounded as if he was reciting something from a script.Q. (from Ms. ... Indonesia) “What is your opinion about implementation ofhilafat if Indonesia is not an Islamic state?”A. (Bashir) “All Muslims are required to live under hilafat. If it does notexist, Muslims should strive to accomplish it. It is forbidden to live in acountry that is kaffir. So Muslims should leave the kaffir state. There are twoduties for Muslims: dawat and jihad.” (NB: dawat is an Arabic term meaning“proselytizing”.)Q (Ms. ... American) “We are here as peacemakers. What do you have to sayregarding terror? What does religion have to offer for peacemakers?”A. (Bashir) “Islam never forces non-believers to embrace Islam, only throughpreaching. If they accept peaceful coexistence then Islam will accept with oneexception: that the kaffir allow Muslims to practice their religion. In Islam tolive is not to become rich or reach higher position, but to live in accordancewith religion.“Terrorism is forbidden in Islam. The issue of terrorism was created by Bush todefeat Islam. Armed struggle—such as in Afghanistan, Iraq—and trying to destroyIslam from within—these are the two methods used to destroy Islam. The bombs inIndonesia are counter-terrorism, not terrorism. There is no terrorism inIndonesia. The youth who explode bombs in Indonesia were misled but they hadgood motivation. They should not have used bombs in Indonesia which is not aconflict area.”Q (Ms. ... Philippines) “Do you believe in the future that people of differentreligions can live peacefully on earth, even Jews, Muslims, Hindus, etc.?”A. (Bashir) “People from different religions can live peacefully so long asMuslims are given the right to implement their religion fully. So peacefulcoexistence is possible only under the rule of Islam. Muslims cannot live fullyunder non-Muslim rule.”Q (Mr. ... Indonesia) “What is the ideal Muslim government which can serve as amodel? We have Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, etc. but theirperformance may not be Islamic. How do you mean to destroy Islam from within?”A. (Bashir) “The ideal Islam is during the era of the Prophet. This is what wewant to emulate, especially in justice, peace, moral dimensions. In terms ofteaching, we must learn from others. There is no Islamic state; they are allsecular, including Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, etc. Crime is higher in Indonesiathan Malaysia due to the degree of Islamic teachings in those countries. InIndonesia, the teaching of Islam is not implemented. In the USA, crime is higherthan in Saudi Arabia. We do not use economic indicators to determine if acountry is successful or failed, but moral standards. Muslims should not useother indicators to decide what is a good state. Indonesia has failed because ituses outside standards and not Islam. Western countries will collapse becausetheir morals declined.“Regarding destruction of Islam from within, I think our judgment is the Qur'anand Sunnah, which teaches us about the Islamic state and about the life ofMuhammed. If we exchange opinions in an honest way we can reach an agreement.”Then it was ABB's turn to ask some questions.Q. (Bashir) “What do your governments tell you about Islam, since the USA andothers are controlled by Jews?”A. (Ms. ... US) “My government is secular and has nothing to say about Islam,only government issues and not religious issues. I hope you hear our point ofview. I want us to live peacefully together, for a more just world.”Q. (Bashir) “Have you heard that your government asked the Indonesian government(during the Megawati administration) to send me to Guantanamo? What do you thinkabout that?”A. (Mr. W. ... US) “I am personally very upset with my government regarding thedetainees at Guantanamo and the actions of our government in ignoring the GenevaConvention. We say Bush does not have a war on terror, but a war of terror.”(Ms. ... US) “Many Americans do not support the actions of our government. Peacethrough dialogue is more about listening than talking.”(Mr. ... US) “We have multiple voices in the USA, extreme voices for violence,for peace, moderate voices in between. We hope you can bring moderate voicesfrom Islam to talk with us for social justice.”(Bashir) “Thank you very much for coming. I pray God gives you strength toachieve peace in the world. For non-Muslims I ask you to learn about Islam andto embrace Islam so you will be saved. That is what the Prophet taught us. Ihope and pray God gives you a nice and safe trip home. For Americans andAustralians, please convince Bush and Howard to embrace Islam.”The last sentiment was greeted with laughter, as one might imagine. ABB thenstood up and seemed to be waiting for a photo op but no one took him up on it.We made our way out of the pesantren and back up the road to the tour bus, afterwhich we were taken to a batik factory! Terror tourism.There was consternation at the batik factory as many of the conference attendeeswere noticeably upset—bordering on hysteria—as to the visit to the pesantren andbegan blaming Yayah for having put them in that position. Some members wereafraid that they would incur problems in returning to their own countries, orthat they would wind up on a watch list, or worse. They were frightened ofphotographs of the meeting appearing in Indonesian newspapers and television(which did, in fact, take place)170[../Text/part0031_split_001.html#app4-aft170] or, worse, in media in their owncountries. The writer found this startling. These were people who made it theircareer and mission in life to go to conflict areas and try to arrange peacefulresolution, yet they were clearly disoriented by the visit to ABB'sheadquarters. The Australians who did not attend the meeting with ABB asked meif I thought it was safe to remain in Solo; I assured them that it was, thatthey were invited guests and that it was Islamic etiquette not to endangerguests. Nonetheless, the Australians contacted their embassy in Jakarta foradvice, and were told that they had nothing to worry about from the Australiangovernment, at least.The next morning was a virtual riot as several of the conference attendeesopenly confronted Yayah for having brought them to the pesantren. Of course,they had been told repeatedly in advance where they were going and whom theywere going to see; Yayah assumed they understood the situation when, in fact,they did not. These were psychologists, so they spent the morning “processing”the visit and their emotional reactions to it. (Yayah later confessed to thewriter her misery at the way the conference attendees attacked her over thisissue. We spoke about it at length on the last day of the conference, at adinner held at the Prambanan temple outside Yogya.)The writer left Solo for Yogyakarta that day in order to attend to otherbusiness (he was still taking courses at CRCS) and missed the sessions of June20, 2007.170 [../Text/part0031_split_001.html#app4-ft170] The visit was covered by atleast five newspapers: Berita Koran, Radar Solo, Kompas, Solopos, and Jawa Pos(this includes two local Solo papers and three national papers, but not theEnglish-language Indonesian press) and by three local television stations,including Metro TV."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 5A REAL ODESSA FILEImage [../Images/00087.jpeg]Image [../Images/00088.jpeg]Image [../Images/00089.jpeg]Image [../Images/00090.jpeg]Image [../Images/00091.jpeg]Image [../Images/00092.jpeg]Image [../Images/00093.jpeg]Image [../Images/00094.jpeg]Image [../Images/00095.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe list of people whose contribution—actual or virtual—to this endeavor is along one, indeed.

For her faith in the project, and in me, she mustbe acknowledged here.To Jim Wasserman, for all the usual reasons and perhaps more so for this book!To Prof. Sita Hidayah, whose understanding of Indonesian life and politics wasso useful in providing a context for this endeavor. Indeed, it was Prof. Hidayahwho first brought the Pöch story to my attention.I'd also like to include my friend the filmmaker J. Lyle Skosey, whoseserendipitous meeting with a woman who actually recognized the name of HellaPöch and who had documents to that effect was a bizarre and startlingdevelopment that took place as the book was nearing completion but which woundup corroborating the Testament and much else besides.Katarina Matiasek was a great help in providing some additional backgroundmaterial on Georg Anton and Hella Pöch, for which I am truly grateful.Claudia Kunin, for graciously allowing me to reproduce the “Wanted” poster inthis book.I want to thank Pierre Sprey, now in the music business, for his reminiscencesabout Hans-Ulrich Rudel and the conversations he had with the ace fighter pilot.Ian Punnett of Coast-to-Coast AM: he has been unfailingly polite and supportivein giving me a broadcast forum from time to time to update listeners on myvarious projects. He has a knack for interviewing and asking intelligent,probing questions and he actually reads the books whose authors he interviews! Arare and wonderful contributor to a medium often hijacked by hystericalmonomaniacs.I want to thank Chandriana, the daughter of Dr. Sosro Husodo, for a brief phoneconversation in the spring of 2013 in which she confirmed the high strangenessaround her father, government officials, and mysterious persons from Germany whowanted to pay millions of dollars for the Pöch documents back in the 1980s.Thanks also go to my friends at a hotel lounge bar in Singapore that is not tobe named, to protect the guilty as well as the innocent, but I must mention theindefatigable Irene Marie Lin—the “godmother”—who kept her sense of humor duringlong hours and days and weeks of investigation. She and all the regulars were awelcome antidote to what was at times a poisonous miasma surrounding thematerial in this book.I also wish to show gratitude to all those Muslims I have met in the course ofthe past decades, in Asia and Europe and elsewhere. They are shining examples ofhow Islam is lived in beauty and in peace. Image [../Images/00096.jpeg]One also wants to thank—last but certainly not least—one's family, and one'sfriends, for their patience and understanding during this overly-long andarduous undertaking. I was away from home for many months at a time, duringwhich no one knew if I was dead or alive. Even now, they are not entirelyconvinced of either condition!"},{"pageContent":"SOURCES AND BIBLIOGRAPHYThe primary source material supporting the contentions made in this book comefrom declassified American (and some British) intelligence files as well as USGovernment publications where noted in the text. In addition, the address bookof Hans-Ulrich Rudel proved to be invaluable as a guide to the Nazi Undergroundas it existed up to the time of his death in 1982. I was also fortunate to haveaccess to the “wanted poster” for the Pöch couple and was able to view some ofthe Pöch documents including the address book and passports during my researchtrip to Singapore in 2012 and 2013.Recourse was also had to a burgeoning secondary source literature on terrorism,asymmetric warfare, terror financing, and related issues. There is also adeveloping academic literature around the Nazi-Islamist nexus, as well as theNazi-Zen relationship.My own direct experience of white supremacist hate groups in the United States,as well as Nazi front organizations such as the National Renaissance Party,aided me in the selection process of what source materials could be consideredreliable as well as valuable. It seems incredible to me now but looking backover the course of several decades of research I realize I have come into directand personal contact with Colonia Dignidad in Chile, James Madole of theNational Renaissance Party (on several occasions), Roy Frankhouser of the KuKlux Klan, Abu Bakr Ba'asyir of Jemaah Islamiyyah (the Southeast Asian Al-Qaedaaffiliate), Dr. Izzat Tannous and Saadat Hassan of the PLO, several religiousorganizations that served as fronts for American intelligence operations, andmany other groups and individuals that have become part of the Nazi Undergroundwe sometimes call ODESSA.Further, my long career in international trade has brought me into the sphere ofcorporate leaders and CEOs in America as well as in many countries abroad,including those in Europe, Latin America and of course Asia. This ongoingcontact has demonstrated to me that racism, anti-Semitism, and elitism as wellas a grudging respect for the principles of the Third Reich, thrive just belowthe surface smiles, starched shirts and hearty handshakes of many of our mostesteemed captains of industry.This indicates that the Nazi Underground is much closer to all of us than wemight imagine.Archival SourcesBundesarchiv BerlinLibrary of Congress, Washington DCNational Archives and Records Administration, College Park, MarylandSecondary SourcesAndrew, Christopher & Mitrokhin, Vasili, The Mitrokhin Archive: the KGB inEurope and the West, London: Penguin, 2000Arreguín-Toft, Ivan, “How the Weak Win Wars: A Theory of Asymmetric Conflict,”in International Security, Vol. 26, No. 1 (Summer 2001), pp. 93-128Artucio, Hugo Fernandez, The Nazi Underground in South America, New York: Farrar& Rinehart, 1942Baier, Karl, “The Formation and Principles of Count Dürckheim's Nazi Worldviewand his interpretation of Japanese Spirit and Zen” in The Asia-Pacific Journal,Vol. 11, Issue 48, No. 3, December 2, 2013Basso, Carlos, El ultimo secreto de Colonia Dignidad, Santiago (Chile):Editorial Mare Nostrum, 2002Bellant, Russ, Old Nazis, The New Right, and the Republican Party, Boston: SouthEnd Press, 1991Bennett, Geoffrey, The Pepper Trader: True Tales of the German EastAsia Squadronand the Man who Cast them in Stone, Jakarta: Equinox Publishing, 2006Black, Edwin, IBM and the Holocaust: The Strategic Alliance between Nazi Germanyand America's Most Powerful Corporation, London: Little, Brown 2001Blum, Howard, Wanted!

The rumors were persistent; the evidence suggestive.Was it possible that the world's greatest symbol of evil had actually escapedBerlin in 1945? As the author began his research, more information came tolight. In December of 2009, it was revealed that the skull the Russians claimedwas Hitler's—salvaged from the bunker in 1945—was not that of Hitler at all. Thenews made headlines around the world. Then in 2010, files from the Office ofSpecial Investigations of the Justice Department were declassified, revealing ahistory of American intelligence providing cover for Nazi war criminals.How did the Soviet KGB, the Catholic Church, and governments around the worldcollaborate in the escape of this mysterious and most-wanted fugitive? Ratlineis the documented history of this escape, and the mechanisms by which thousandsof war criminals fled to the remotest parts of the globe. It is the story of howthe Soviets lied about Hitler's death and continued to lie and change theirstory for decades to come. Its the story of a man who died quietly in Indonesiain January of 1970 ... and how a body was dug up from a German military basefour months later and cremated. Ratline raises questions ... but more thananything else–in a time of citizen distrust of its own institutions in Europe,America, and Asia—it demands answers.$26.95 • Hardcover • ISBN: 978-0-89254-170-6 • 256 pp. • 6 × 9 • includes 8pages of glossy photographs"},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00097.jpeg]"}]
