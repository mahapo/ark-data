These werethe efflorescence of psychiatry as an important medical practice, and aturn-of-the-century occult revival that reached a crescendo in the 1920s.Taken together, these events conspired toward unforeseen ends, not the least ofwhich was the conversion of the American heartland into a laboratory experimentin “psychological warfare.”As Peter Levenda, the author of this extraordinary and deeply scary book, pointsout, the term is a translation of a German word, Weltansschauungskrieg(literally, “world-view warfare”). By way of example, one battle in this war gotunder way in 1953, when the Central Intelligence Agency convened “a prestigiousgroup of scientists” (watch out, dear Reader, whenever you see that phrase) todiscuss the problem of UFOs. There were waves of sightings at the time, andpeople, in and out of government, were getting nervous about them. Meetingbehind closed doors, with CIA security guards at the ready, the so-called“Robertson Panel” (named for Dr. H.P. Robertson, a physicist and weapons expertat Caltech) studied the Tremonton sightings and other films of lights in thesky, and listened patiently to the reports of experts from the private sector,the Air Force and Navy.Soon, it became apparent that the experts were in disagreement. Some claimedthat the lights could be explained in terms of natural phenomena (e.g., sunlighton the wings of sea-gulls). Others, such as the Navy’s Photo-InterpretationLaboratory, insisted that, on careful study, the same objects appeared to be“self-luminous,” and therefore intelligently guided.So it was a question of seagulls or rockets or spaceships. Or something.No matter. Since the experts could not agree on the meaning of the evidence infront of them, the scientific problem was redefined in political terms. Whateverwas zipping around in the skies over America, it hadn’t killed anyone (at leastnot yet, at least not directly). So there didn’t appear to be a military threat.Or was there?The question arose as to what might happen if the Soviets tried to exploit thephenomenon, preying on the superstitions and weaknesses of the man in thestreet. A “War of the Worlds” panic might easily result. “Mass hysteria” wouldset in, and emergency reporting channels would be overloaded. Air-defenseintelligence sources would be compromised.The Reds could walk right in! If not to Washington, then West Berlin. Somethinghad to be done.It was decided, therefore, that the subject had to be “debunked.” That is tosay, UFOs needed to be made intellectually disreputable in the hope that theywould eventually become unthinkable. In this way, the problem (if not the lightsthemselves) would be made to disappear.So it was that a covert operation was mounted, with the Ozzie & Harriet world ofMiddle America as its target. Celebrities such as Arthur Godfrey were enlistedto make fun of the subject and ridicule those who were interested in it. UFOwatchdog groups, such as Wisconsin’s Aerial Phenomena Research Organization(APRO), were placed under surveillance and infiltrated. The Jam HandyOrganization, which produced World War II films for the American Army, wasretained, along with the Walt Disney organization. Journalists working for Lifeand the Saturday Evening Post were dragged into the fray, as was the Navy’sSpecial Devices Center on Long Island.It took a while, but UFOs eventually became a kind of in-joke among those whohoped to be taken seriously. To raise the issue in public was to invite ridiculeand trigger snickers. By 1960, curiosity about mysterious lights in the sky wasregarded by many as evidence of mental “instability.” While an expression ofinterest in the subject would not be enough to get you committed, neither wouldit enhance your resume.Other psy-ops followed, at home and abroad. Levenda discusses many of them,including Gen. Edward Lansdale’s manipulation of the vampire myth in thePhilippines, and the CIA’s scheme to eliminate Fidel Castro by persuading hisconstituents that he was, in fact, el Anticristo.The JFK assassination was, of course, a focal-point in the world-view war wagedby the CIA. Just as the Agency conspired to make curiosity about “flyingsaucers” a litmus test for an addled mind, excessive interest in the President’smurder was made to seem “ghoulish” and trivial. For a journalist or historian towrite critically about either subject was professional suicide.Eventually, psy-ops like these combined to redefine the parameters of acceptablediscourse in America. Principal among the notions placed beyond the Pale was thepractice and theory of “conspiracism”—which soon came to include criticism ofmainstream reportage. More than a matter of seeing cabals behind every murder,it was a way of thinking, a stance toward the networks, the press and the feds.Anyone who looked too deeply into events, or who asked too many questions, wasdismissed as “a conspiracy-theorist.” (This, after MK-ULTRA, Iran-Contra, BCCIand the destruction of the World Trade Centers.)In some ways, it is as if the century itself has been encrypted, so that if anhistorian would be honest, he must also become an investigator reporter. Failingthat, we are left at the mercy of ambitious academicians and journalists,stenographers to power who are themselves complicit in an astonishing string ofcover-ups and atrocities that stretch from Dealey Plaza to Watergate, Waco to9-11. Pier Paolo Pasolini, the Italian poet and film director who was stomped todeath by a street-hustler in 1975 (unless, as some insist, he was beaten todeath by a gang of fascists) understood. Fascinated by the 20th Century vectorsof politics and violence, Pasolini despaired of the way in which the age hasbeen encrypted. Writing in Corriere della Sera, a left-wing newspaper, hedeclared,> I know the names of those responsible for the slaughters...> I know the names of the powerful group...> I know the names of those who, between one mass and the next, made provision> and guaranteed political protection...> I know the names of the important and serious figures who are behind the> ridiculous figures...> I know the names of the important and serious figures behind the tragic> kids...> I know all these names and all the acts (the slaughters, the attacks on> institutions) they have been guilty of...> I know. But I don’t have the proof. I don’t even have clues.> Well, here they are: the clues, seething in the evidentiary equivalent of what> the French call “a basket of crabs,” in the first volume of what promises to> be a virtual encyclopedia of clues. Levenda calls Sinister Forces “a> grimoire,” or manual for invoking demons.Certainly, there are demons enough in its pages: Charles Manson and RichardHelms, Aleister Crowley and David Ferrie, Jack Parsons and the Son of Sam. The“usual suspects,” you say? Well, yes, of course. But the suspects are served upwith an entourage of angels and demons you may never have heard of: Arthur Youngand C.D. Jackson, Andrija Puharich and The Nine, not to mention a claque of“Wandering Bishops” and the proprietors of Music World in Wilder, Kentucky(surely the model for the nightmare-cantina in Quentin Tarantino’s “From DuskTil Dawn”).But that’s just for openers. Levenda’s study is broad and deep, a life’s workthat runs to volumes. What distinguishes it from other efforts, such as those ofPasolini, is not merely its comprehensiveness. Rather, it is Levenda’srealization that a matrix of politics and violence is incapable of explainingthe demented century that shuddered to an end in Manhattan, not so long ago.What’s needed is a third dimension, and that dimension, he tells us, is “theoccult.”By this, Levenda means something broader than a mix of magic and religion. Whenhe writes of the occult, he means to include whatever is secret, hidden, orunknown. Add this dimension to those of politics and violence, and the centuryshivers into focus. Sinister Forces is about evil in what is now the digitalage: Evil 2.0.Time magazine long ago, and famously, posed the question: “Is God Dead?”Implicit in Levenda’s study is a related inquiry: Did the Devil survive Him? Ifhe did not, then how are we to explain a century of recreational homicide andpolitical mayhem?Perhaps with reference to what seems to be a Fortean element: the pattern ofcoincidence that enfolds these highly strange events, adding a distinct “woo-woofactor” to Levenda’s study. Whether it is Lee Harvey Oswald’s habit of hangingout at the Bluebird Cafe in Atsugi, Japan (“Bluebird” was the code-name of a CIAmind control program to produce “programmed assassins”), or the famous chain ofcoincidences surrounding the Kennedy and Lincoln assassinations, (eg., Lincoln’ssecretary named Kennedy and Kennedy’s secretary named Lincoln each warned thePresident not to make his fatal sojourn). It seems almost as if an early warningsystem is embedded in the passage of time itself, or in what Carl Jung calledthe Collective Unconscious. And that system would seem to be sending a stream ofwarning signals, enciphered as synchronicities.Exploring topics like this is what makes The Nine one of the darkest and mostprovocative books that you are ever likely to read (pending publication of BookII). That said, it also one of the most enjoyable, easy to pick up (startreading on any page), and hard to put down. Levenda’s intuitions are a delight,and his choice of subject-matter unerring. Both a compendium of 20th centuryevil and an investigation of it, Levenda’s study is deep, intuitive (and, often,droll).It is, in other words, parapolitics at their most bizarre and, I suspect, theirmost illuminating. Like UFOs, conspiracies and assassination, serial killers,mind control and the occult, “evil” isn’t something that serious people aresupposed to think about. If they did, the emergency reporting system would soonbe overloaded. And you know what happens when that occurs.All hell breaks loose."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00038.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION:A STUDY IN SCARLET> “There’s the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of> life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of> it.”> > > > > > — Sherlock Holmes in A Study in Scarlet, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,> > > > > > 1887August 25, 2000 Rome It is the centenary of the death of Friedrich Nietzsche, but I am in Rome. Aweek ago, I was in Turin, standing in the plaza where Nietzsche went insane inJanuary, 1889. He saw a horse being whipped and—out of all character—was somoved to compassion that he threw his arms around the horse’s neck and suffereda nervous breakdown on the spot. Since then, psychiatrists have been of theopinion that this spontaneous gesture of compassion was so alien to Nietzsche’sown writings that it precipitated the breakdown.1 Compassion, that mostun-Darwinian of emotions, went against everything Nietzsche thought he stoodfor.What blond beast, its hour come round at last…I am thinking of Nietzsche now, in the intense, unforgiving sun of St. Peter’sSquare in a relentlessly hot August, escorting an American executive (myemployer) and his fiancée on a tour of Rome. In a way I am coming full circle tomy childhood from this moment in time, nearly fifty years after my birth and,like Nietzsche, I am confronted with my antithesis. It is not a whipped horse Isee before me, however, but as we descend into the crypt below the high altar itis a small casket said to contain the bones of St. Peter himself, the first Popeand the small rock on which Christ is said to have built his church.Ecce Homo. Nietzsche’s last work, finished in the months before he went mad,titled after Pontius Pilate’s famous words to the crowd as he asked them tospare the accused Jesus Christ: Behold the Man. St. Peter was murdered, and dieda martyr’s death. This pilgrimage to make contact with his remains—remains overwhich the entire edifice of Roman Catholicism has been built—is for me aconfrontation with the Enemy. And, like all true Enemies, in his face I see myown.Christ was executed, according to the official version of the story (althoughthis has always been in doubt, both among historians and among members ofWestern secret societies). His chosen successor, Simon Peter—in whose Basilica Inow stand—was also executed, and in fact crucified upside-down. St. Peter’sCross is a reverse crucifix, such as those the Satanists wear, perhaps markingthem as more Christian than they would be comfortable knowing. St. Andrew wasalso crucified, he of the X-shaped cross. And every Catholic church must havethe mortal remains of some saint present in the altar stone. It is, with itsgruesome crucified Jesus and saints missing eyes and being roasted alive or tornto pieces, a bloody religion: a faith built on aggression and murder, madnessand sacrifice. The Passion. The early Christians met in catacombs, in cemeteriesand in darkness. And now I pass lines of sarcophagi containing the remains ofdead Popes buried beneath the nave of St. Peter’s Basilica. More death: death ineverlasting rows, quiet chapels and candles burning alone, in silence. And thereis the sarcophagus of Pope John Paul I. He was Pope for a month, and then hedied. Mysteriously, to be sure. There is evidence to suggest he was murdered.Volumes of evidence and, as in the Kennedy assassinations, the spoor ofconspiracy and hatred.“A first class relic is a piece of the saint’s flesh or blood or bone. A secondclass relic is something the saint is known to have touched, such as clothingworn. A third class relic is something touched to a first class relic.” I amdescribing Catholic ritual and religion to my guests. They are Lutheran andMethodist, respectively. The woman has wanted to visit the Sistine Chapel sinceshe was twelve. We have already done that, me standing aside and staring up atthe Creation, and Adam and Eve in the Garden, not looking too closely at thehuge Last Judgment, not being the type who slows down on the highway to gaze ataccident victims.If the blood and bones of saints are relics, what are the blood and bones of thecommon person: the murder victim? the suicide? the casualty of war? What secretpower lies forgotten in their graves, their dump sites, their formaldehyde jarson a serial killer’s shelf?What Great Beast, its hour come round at last…Everywhere around me are images of pissed-off prophets: Moses, forever thetype-A executive, smashing and smoting and scolding everyone in sight, taking onthe Egyptians, a man who has the balls to ask God for a photostat of the TenCommandments after he, Moses, smashes the first set in anger at his own people.You’ve got to be on pretty intimate terms with the Creator to go up the mountaina second time. Moses, on some statuary, is shown with horns on his head. Andthen there are Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, full of dire warnings andfrightening predictions. John the Baptist, not the sort you would want to inviteto your GOP fundraiser. Danger is all around us. Trust no one. The presence ofSatan is everywhere implicit. But who is he?Bogeyman. The word comes from the Russian, bog, meaning “god.”I stand a little apart as the executive and his fiancée approach the glasswindow that opens out onto St. Peter’s own resting place. It was to Peter thatJesus said, “Get thee behind me, Satan!” I am nervous. The crowds are too thick,this being a Jubilee Year and what the Italian papers are calling La Woodstockdel Pape. There is no possibility of silent contemplation of St. Peter’sremains, no chance for a psychic connection with the founder of the Christianorganization. I glance to my right. There is a metal box there. Peter’s Pence,it says. You’re supposed to make a donation.Even St. Peter’s Basilica is not immune. Not even the bones of Peter himself.There is no way to avoid the collection plate, the thick envelope, theoutstretched, manicured hand. A few feet away, John Paul I lies in a plain,unassuming box, while all around him the bodies of Popes who went along to getalong are buried in carved marble splendor.Get thee behind me, Satan.I am thinking of Nietzsche again as we make our way over to the gift shop toorganize the purchase of a poster of the Sistine ceiling, or il volto as theysay in Italian. The vault. A souvenir of the journey for the fiancée, whobelieves in vampires and crystals and the Knights Templar and Rosslyn. Shealready has a poster of that famous scene from the Chapel, the one where Godleans over and almost—but not quite—touches the languid fingertip of Adam. Isometimes wonder if Adam and God are actually pointing at each other,challenging the other to take the blame for what can only be a pretty messed upCreation. There is supposed to be tension in that painting, the tension of a gunabout to go off. As I once wrote, long ago,I have respect for God, the same respect I have for a loaded gun, or the handthat holds it.2 and God is the only safe thing to be.3And Nietzsche wrote,> We should reconsider cruelty and open our eyes… Almost everything we call> “higher culture” is based on the spiritualization of cruelty, on its becoming> more profound: this is my proposition. That “savage animal” has not really> been “mortified”; it lives and flourishes, it has merely become—divine.4 and> The great epochs of our life come when we gain the courage to rechristen our> evil as what is best in us. 5“Rechristen our evil” …an unintended irony?We find a taxi to take us back to the Hotel Hassler, that ornate pile atop theSpanish Steps. We are lucky; the day is hot and the pilgrims many. Getting ataxi at St. Peter’s Square is no mean feat; I know, I have struggled many timesin the past in all kinds of weather. The visit has been overwhelming: too manystatues, too many paintings, too many rooms. But the effect has been to bring meback to my childhood, to the smell of stale incense and dusty cassocks, to Latinconjurations and exorcisms, to the roll call of the dead—the murdered and thesuicides—that I have known and survived. To the plots and counterplots andsubplots that I have been assiduously recording for the past thirty years. Andto that Catholic specialty, guilt.As I bid the other Americans good evening and take the elevator to my room, Iwonder if I can start writing the book I have put off for years, as I did onemore bit of research, sought out one more lead, read one more dry volume onpsychology, or criminology, or assassination. I feel stronger, more capable,articulate in a way writers have to be.But in the back of my mind glows the small casket of St. Peter’s remains, asilvered shadow of Satan, and that last crazed moment of Nietzsche in Turin,embracing a startled horse and asking for forgiveness. And love. And goinginsane.Like all journeys of a thousand miles, this one began with a single step. It wasan article in the Village Voice by Craig Karpel, entitled “PatrioticWitchcraft,” and it was in two parts. The Voice is a weekly newspaper, and Iwaited eagerly for the following week’s conclusion. It was the time ofWatergate, and I was wallowing.I worked during the day for the Bendix Corporation, at their InternationalMarketing Operation on Broadway in midtown Manhattan. At night, I was astruggling writer. I wrote short stories, poems, and novellas, working my way upto the novel. I had no illusions, though; I knew that getting paid for writingis virtually impossible, so I was relatively content to write “for the drawer.”I had no social obligations, I was single, answerable only to myself. I spentmore money on books than on any other item in my modest studio apartment inBrooklyn Heights. I treated friends to meals and long, stately coffee sessionson Montague Street, when I had the money, and we would talk about Vietnam, andthe Kennedy assassinations, and Watergate, and the Middle East, and World War IIand its aftermath. Across the East River from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, wecould watch the doomed World Trade Center towers going up. A few blocks fromMontague Street is Atlantic Avenue and the Arab Quarter, and we spent at leastone day a week eating at the Lebanese or Syrian or Moroccan restaurants there,and attending parties—replete with belly dancers and bromides—that raised moneyand consciousness for Palestinian charities. It was a time of paranoia andinnocence, a kind of national adolescence.The Watergate revelations were coming fast and furious, and I was amused by thestartled and shocked expressions of my friends as each new character took thestand with his or her briefcase full of scandals. None of it surprised me. Iread three newspapers every day, and did not own a television set, so Iconsidered myself better informed.And then the Voice articles, and something ignited inside me.Karpel was writing about some of the odd dimensions to Watergate that had so farescaped the notice (or fell beneath the contempt) of mainstream journalists. Thefact that convicted Watergate “plumber,” and former CIA agent and Bay of Pigsofficer, E. Howard Hunt was a part-time novelist who had three occult novels tohis credit (á la the Cigarette Smoking Man in the X-Files2 television series).Or the fact that Richard Nixon had “rushed to judgment” in the case of CharlesManson, declaring him “guilty” while the trial was still under way (a fact thatshould have caused a mistrial, but didn’t). And the odd set of coincidences thatlinked Nixon’s resignation date with the death of Marilyn Monroe, and theopening of the Haunted House at Disneyland.Indeed, it was the very juxtaposition of those words “patriotic” and“witchcraft” that caused some kind of subconscious chain reaction, resulting inthe cortical fission that became the idea for this book. Manson, Nixon, Hunt,occultism, Monroe, politics… witchcraft. It was delicious, a kind of RobertLudlum on LSD experience. Throw in the Church of Satan, Rosemary’s Baby, TheManchurian Candidate and the Kennedy assassinations, and the allure isirresistible.To what degree does mysticism (including occultism, religious organizations, andsecret societies) influence politics? Can it be demonstrated that there is noreal separation of church and state, despite most Americans’ belief? Can we showthat the world’s political leaders are motivated by (at times bizarre andoutrageous) religious or spiritual convictions, thus threatening at the leastthe very nature of the American way of life… and at the most American lives ingeneral?Is politics a science? Is it an art?Or is it religion?Armed with these uneasy questions, I set out to investigate as much humanhistory as possible to see to what extent—if any—religious or spiritual ideas,convictions, or even regulations have influenced the political lives of nationsand contributed to happiness or suffering, peace or war, under the control ofvisionary leadership. I began with the study of Nazi occultism, since rumors ofthat were very much in the air at the time. I visited the National Archives inWashington, D.C. and the Library of Congress and fell upon a treasure trove ofdocumentation showing Nazi fascination with occult themes… to the extent offinancing research in Tibet and hunting down the Grail. This became the centralsubject matter of my last book, Unholy Alliance. Here was a perfect example of anation being ruled by what were called—in any other age—occult leaders and“spiritual” visionaries. From the swastika to the SS, the Nazis were little morethan the 20th century’s best organized (and best dressed) cult. A politicalparty? Please.Simultaneously, I set out to “deconstruct” the Manson phenomenon. I readeverything available on the Tate/LaBianca killings, on Manson’s childhood andupbringing, and the backgrounds and relationships of his followers. I reviewedManson’s history in California with the Beach Boys, and with Angela Lansbury’sdaughter and other minor celebrities. Manson’s connection to the Church of Satanand to The Process was also important to my research. And then, a strange thinghappened (one of many that will be mentioned during the course of this book): Irealized that my first real job in New York was with a company whose owner,Willy Brandt, had a son (gossip columnist Steven Brandt) who was questioned bythe police in connection with the Manson killings and who subsequently committedsuicide—some say in abject fear that he would be the next victim of the“Family.” In other words, I was only two handshakes away from the Tate/LaBiancakillings myself. (It was at this same company that I later discovered I was onlytwo handshakes away from the Howard Hughes disappearance and the Clifford Irvingaffair. Coincidence piled on coincidence, until I finally realized thatcoincidence itself is an important, although neglected, factor in history, as weshall see.)I thought I had all this pretty much nailed, until I decided one day to drive tothe town where Manson grew up. I found that a relative of Manson’s had beenmurdered in Ashland a few months before the Tate/LaBianca killings took place. Akitchen knife had been the weapon used, stabbing Darwin Scott nineteen times andpinning him to the floorboards of his apartment. Clearly there was more to bediscovered, and a trip to Manson’s “home town” was in order.Ashland, Kentucky is not a place where nice New York City boys like me hang out.Although it is well-known as the birthplace of Naomi and Wynonna Judd, and ChuckWollery of The Love Connection, it is a small town dominated by the petroleumand chemical refineries that bear Ashland’s name. I noticed that serial killerBobby Joe Long came from Kenova, West Virginia, which is a smaller town only afew miles from Ashland, and that serial killer Henry Lee Lucas was born in aVirginia town on the West Virginia border. I wondered what it was about thisparticular location—this Bermuda Triangle of depravity—that seemed to breedserial killers and mass murderers. Was it the water?So I rented a cool, cherry-red Ford Mustang convertible and made the drive fromNew England to Ashland, Kentucky, stopping off first in Washington,D.C. and then in the hollers of rural West Virginia during a thunderstorm. Thetale of that trip comes later in this book. Suffice it to say that I found morethan I bargained for in Ashland: * > Ancient “Indian” burial mounds in the center of town; * > A large house that was moved entire from its original site to one a few > streets over, directly on a line with burial mounds and sporting a pair of > griffins on its roof, mythical creatures—according to the town’s own > brochure—designed to ward off evil spirits; * > The Ashland Tragedy and Massacre: a savage killing of three children on a > Christmas Eve in the late nineteenth century, the subsequent arrest of > three suspects, and a massacre of townspeople by militia detailed to > protect the suspects from a lynching; and * > Oddest of all, the fact that a Manson relative and sometime petty > crook—Darwin Scott—was brutally murdered with a kitchen knife in Ashland a > few months before the celebrated Tate/LaBianca killings… a murder case that > has never been solved.It is said that “Kentucky” is an Indian word that means “dark and bloodyground.” I wondered if it was true, if a physical place could be evil, couldhold a curse that would affect generations of residents to come. Did the Indiansknow something we didn’t? Or did we unconsciously suspect that the earth heldsome sinister secret? Indeed, the name first proposed for the Commonwealth ofKentucky was… Transylvania.And then I remembered the words of Cotton Mather, he of the Salem witch trialsin seventeenth century Massachusetts, who said that America had been the Devil’sland before the Europeans came, and wondered if he meant more than simply thatthe Native Americans were not Christians.And then there were the stories of H.P. Lovecraft, the father of Gothic horror,who felt that there was something ancient and evil beneath the hardscrabble NewEngland soil, a concept amplified by Shirley Jackson in her stories of NewEngland haunted houses and depraved villages.After all, America has had its share of misery and tragedy, regardless of thebeautiful words and even more beautiful intentions of the Declaration ofIndependence and Constitution. Why would a fertile and bountiful land, colonizedby pious and fervent European Christians of every variety, descend into thatmaelstrom of civil war, slavery, mass murder, assassinations, and day-to-dayviolence that shocks the rest of the world, even as the rest of the world hashad to deal with its Kaisers and Hitlers and Mussolinis and Stalins and Maos andHirohitos? Do we have more than our share of violence, or is it simply that weget more PR?Was the answer to be found in unraveling the skein of violence itself, like thescarlet thread of murder in the very first Sherlock Holmes story, runningthrough the fabric of our history like a timeline? …Was I wrong to look atreligious history? Occult history? It bore such interesting and convincing fruitin my Nazi study. Yet surely the roots of American violence and American evilcould not grow from the same metaphysical soil?And as I poked through the debris of American history—the autopsy photos and thepolice reports and the political manifestos and the trial transcripts and theconfessions and the lies and the declassified documents and the bureaucraticmemoranda—I saw that American history could not be separated from my own historyor from world history, that, as Americans, we can’t look objectively at our ownstory. Like that famous conundrum in quantum physics, the observer changes theevent observed. Is the Kennedy assassination a particle, or a wave?During the Watergate era a somewhat unsettling revelation was made: that fortwenty-five years (or more) the CIA had conducted psychological experimentationupon both volunteers and unwitting subjects—both at home and abroad—to find thekey to the unconscious mind, to memory, and to volition. Their goal was tocreate the perfect assassin and to protect America from the programmed assassinsof other countries. This project was known by the name MK-ULTRA, but it had itsorigins in earlier forms of the same “brainwashing” agenda: Operations BLUEBIRDand ARTICHOKE. To me, this was astounding. A US government agency was conductingwhat—to a medievalist—could only be characterized as a search for thePhilosopher’s Stone, for occult power, for magical spells and talismans. Indeed,some of the CIA’s subprojects included research among the psychics, the mediums,the magicians and the witches of America and beyond. And the Army was not farbehind in its mind control testing, as we shall see.What was even more disturbing was the revelation that nearly all records of thisincredible and superhumanly ambitious project were destroyed in 1973 on ordersof CIA director Richard Helms himself. In his testimony, he claimed thatMK-ULTRA did not come up with anything worthwhile, and that the project had beenterminated. Then why were the documents shredded?We do not know who the test subjects were. We don’t know what was done to them.We don’t know how they have been programmed, if at all. We don’t know what theymight do.Or what they have already done.We do know, however, that some of our more colorful criminals have spent time atthe same institutions receiving CIA MK-ULTRA funding for this “special testing.”People like Charles Manson and Henry Lee Lucas, for instance, as well as“Cinque,” the leader of the Symbionese Liberation Army that kidnapped heiressPatty Hearst. It is entirely possible, given the evidence at our disposal, thatconvicted serial killer Arthur Shawcross is also such an example.As I stood in the park at Ashland, staring at the ancient burial mounds andlooking up at the house with the griffins, I realized that I was standing at anexus of American history and culture: Charles Manson, unsolved homicides, mindcontrol experiments, mass murder and massacres… and I wondered what Indianburial mounds and griffins, movie stars and spies, witches and Washington, evenUFOs and occultists, had to do with any of it.Our culture in the West—formed as it is by a faith in science, a reliance on thetechnological—has convinced us to ignore the unseen. There is a web ofconnections between visible events and visible, measurable phenomena that wecannot see, cannot measure—so our response has been to ignore this web in favorof what we can see and measure. The blind leading the blind. The drunk lookingfor his keys under a lamp post because the light is better there. We know—candescribe—the stages of growth of flowers, animals, people… but not the lifeforce itself, the drive: what engineer, inventor and mystic Arthur Young called“the quantum of action.” Of this we know nothing, and are happy to know nothing.And thus we become victims.University of Chicago Professor Ioan Culianu was able to show that the techniqueof secret links and correspondences between objects and events discovered by aRenaissance magician—Giordano Bruno—are applicable to mind control andpsychological warfare today. Charles Manson declared himself to be areincarnation of Bruno, 6an oddly sophisticated choice for the nearly-illiterateconvicted murderer. Professor Culianu himself was murdered in 1991, anothercrime that has never been solved.The people we trust are those who can measure the measurable. The people wedistrust are those who point to the invisible and shout to get our attention.Our world is marching calmly to an obscure and unknowable end because we, thepeople, hear the drum, feel the beat, know our place in line. That’s better,somehow, than jumping off the path into the dark forest where God dwells like ahungry tiger. There is too much personal responsibility in jumping out of line,and if you then try to jump back in, you will find you have lost your place andyour fellow marchers no longer want you to join them. You are dirty; you arecrazed; you have seen what they are afraid to see.In order to conduct this investigation I would have to dig very deep, below thesurface of official reports, trial transcripts and conspiracy theories. I wouldhave to dig deep below the surface of the American psyche, and trace pieces ofevidence back down through several layers of meaning and relevance to find theconnective tissue that would make sense of our history, our politics, ourcollective weirdness. This would have to be nothing less than a deconstructionof our most cherished beliefs and ideals.Academia frowns upon historians who get “involved” with their subjectpersonally. It is believed such activity ruins objectivity, makes thehistorian’s findings suspect. The “New Journalism” changed that somewhat forjournalists, but not for historians. Yet, it is virtually impossible for anyAmerican my age—born in 1950—to approach such subject matter as the Kennedyassassinations or the Manson killings with pure, detached objectivity. We livedthrough it all. We either marched on Washington or marched in the jungles ofSoutheast Asia. We know where we were when Kennedy was killed—and when the WorldTrade Center went down. We are connected to these events and cannot extricateourselves from them, even when we let the documents and the primary sourcesspeak for themselves. For there are documents, and there is blood. Politics andreligion both are born of documents and of blood. And both documents and bloodform the primary sources of the following investigation.This is a book about evil. Evil ordinary and extraordinary. Evil vigilant. Evilmilitant. Evil triumphant. Evil ancient and modern, violent and discrete,beautiful and obscene. Evil in the face of God, of man and woman, of children.The evil of vainglorious men and their hollow minions. Evil unseen and fierce.The evil of bodybags and spent cartridges. Of mass graves and crematoria. Ofcrimes against nature and against heaven. The evil of death and derangement, ofmurder and madness, of suicide and satanism. This is the evil that is older thanhumanity, but reflected in our children’s eyes. The evil we can’t grasp, cannotpunish, cannot destroy. The evil that contaminates souls as well as bodies,nations as well as people. This is a book about the evil spirits that hauntAmerica. About the sinister forces that rule the world of our dreams, ournightmares, and our sober, trembling, waking reality.If it is true that the gods of one religion become the demons of the one thatreplaces it, then we in America must deal with generations of demons onceworshipped here who now wander the countryside, the city streets, the interstatehighways and dead end roads, the theme parks and fast food restaurants, theshopping malls and parking lots, the peepshow parlors and cathedral aisles, likehungry ghosts on a mission from Hell. We gaze with horror on their crimes, anddon’t understand. We stare into the eyes of their hideous creatures, and don’tunderstand. We clean up the crime scenes and mop up the blood, and don’tunderstand. We imprison, institutionalize, execute to make it all go away… anddon’t understand.This book is an attempt at understanding. The premise is one that has beenembraced by psychoanalysts like Jung and physicists like Pauli: the existence ofanother mechanism in the universe that binds together events seeminglyunrelated. The perspective offered is unique, dangerous, incredible, possiblyoffensive. The subject matter—serial homicide, genocide, assassination,terrorism, multiple personalities, satanism, sexual savagery, demonicpossession, depravity, insanity—makes it impossible to be anything else. Wecannot begin to heal until we have identified the disease; we cannot identifythe disease until we have studied the anatomy of the body politic. Freud, inorder to understand the workings of the human mind, focused on its pathology.We, in order to understand America—and America’s place in the world—must do thesame. We must plumb the depths of the American psyche, the American unconscious,and dredge up whatever we find before it’s too late.How late is it? Listen in the middle of the night. Turn off the television, theradio, the CD player, the computer. Unplug the telephone. Turn off the lights.What do you hear? Beneath the silence and the stoic beating of your humbleheart, what do you hear? Can you hear your soul singing?Or is it Satan laughing? _______________________________________________________________________________________________________--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 See, for instance, Anacleto Verrechia, “Nietzsche’s Breakdown in Turin,” inNietzsche in Italy, edited by Thomas Harrison, Anma Libri, Stanford University,19882 Levenda, Citadel, unpublished novel3 Ibid.4 Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, 1966, Vintage Press, NY p. 158 5 Ibid., p. 866 Charles Manson, “The Black/White Bus,” in The Manson File, edited by NikolasShreck, Amok Press, NY, 1988, ISBN 0-941693-04-X "},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00043.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION ONE:DEEP BACKGROUNDIn the colonial period, when religious creeds, institutions, and communitiesexerted a major impact on life and work, there was bound to be some spilloverinto politics.

The summits are too rounded andsymmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and sometimes the skysilhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars withwhich most of them are crowned. — “The Dunwich Horror,” H.P. Lovecraft 1> Lovecraft was writing in the 1920s, when most of his more famous stories werepublished. He was writing of a New England that, in his imagination, had ancientroots in unknown cultures; where Druidic circles and pagan chants would infestthe countryside; where a kind of subterranean culture existed, parallel to theworld of our own reality. He peppered his stories with references to the worksof archaeologists and anthropologists (some real, some fictitious), andconnected the American Indian culture to the worship of strange, perhapsextraplanetary or extradimensional beings who viewed humans as little more thanundercooked hors d’ouevres. His work has attracted a great deal of attention inthe past 30 years or so, oddly enough in France where—like the films of JerryLewis—he is an adopted obsession, but also certainly in America where hemaintains a cult status even now, more than sixty years after his death. He hasattracted serious, albeit fringe, attention from academics and historians ofboth literature and mysticism, and has even been graced with an anthology of hiswork prefaced by no less a literary light than Joyce Carol Oates.2 The blindArgentine author of many essays and stories on the macabre—Jorge Luis Borges—haswritten in the Lovecraftian mode in homage to the cranky Yankee master.3 Inaddition, there are several hard-core occult organizations in Europe and Americathat owe allegiance to the bizarre principles outlined in his works. They havetaken their names and identities straight from his published work, with cultslike Dagon and Cthulhu, and occultist emeritus Kenneth Grant has writtenextensively on the relation between the works of Lovecraft—an author of gothichorror fiction—and the rituals of modern ceremonial magic and communication withextraterrestrial intelligences. 4Part of the reason for Lovecraft’s popularity among serious occultists is due tothe fact that many of the ideas he put forward in his stories have found somebasis in reality: in historical, archaeological, anthropological reality. Whilethere is no evidence at this time for the existence of the beings of which hewrote—Cthulhu chief among them, but let’s not forget Yog Sothot or ShubNiggurath—there is evidence that America was visited, and possibly inhabited forsome time, by peoples who are not racially (or, at least, culturally) identicalto the Native American “Indian” tribes that exist today. The schools of thoughtover this are contentious and emotional in defending their respective positions.The group most consistently under attack are the Diffusionists (whose mostfamous proponent was the late Harvard Professor Barry Fell), who adhere to theidea that America was not settled by a single group of wanderers from Asiaacross the Bering Straits, but by different groups of people from differentparts of the globe. There is growing archaeological evidence that people fromEurope and North Africa settled in North and South America thousands of yearsago, bringing with them their languages, their culture, and their religious andmystical beliefs. And therein lies a tale. We will examine all of this in detailin Chapter Two. For now, though, let us look at some well-known stories, butfrom a different perspective and with additional data that bear directly on thetheme of this work. Seen in this sometimes unsettling light, they provide abasis for the revelations that will come. But before we examine thearchaeological evidence, let us look at the purely historical, the evidence thatcan be supported by unimpeachable, primary sources.1492Lost Americans learn very early in their primary school education that Americawas “discovered” by Christopher Columbus on October 12, 1492. Some of themremember that he was supposed to be finding a more direct route to India—bygoing west instead of east—and that is why we call Native Americans “Indians” tothis day: the result of Columbus’s blunder in believing that the small Bahamianisland he discovered was part of the Indian subcontinent. In the following weekshe would similarly “discover” Cuba and Hispaniola, the island now comprising theDominican Republic and Haiti.What is not well-known is the real reason for his expedition.Yes, he wanted to find a fast route to India and China. At that time, the greatseafaring nations of Europe—in particular Portugal, but also Holland and othermaritime powers—were going south along the African coastline, rounding SouthAfrica at the Cape and going north and east to reach India. Columbus—based onwhat are believed to be faulty geographic measurements and a faith in some ofthe apocryphal books of the Bible—thought he could make it to India much morequickly by going due west from the European coast. The Portuguese had turnedthis idea down, realizing that his math was faulty, and the Spanish at firstrejected him as well, but he later had an audience with King Ferdinand of Spain,who agreed to fund his expedition and to grant him titles, land and a tenth ofwhatever precious metals he found: an agent’s commission.This much is consistent with what our schoolchildren know.However, Spain in 1492 was in the middle of one of the greatest upheavals in itshistory. To understand what Columbus was doing, and the hidden agenda of hisvoyage—and thereby to begin to understand American history from a Europeanperspective (most Americans being, after all, descendants of Europeanancestors)—we need to understand a little of what was happening in Spain.And to understand Spain, we have to understand the history of Islamic“imperialism” and its stormy relationship to Europe in general and Christianityin particular.While such a topic deserves much more space and much more attention to itsdetail than the author can ever hope to provide in these pages, we can summarizethe situation as follows. Interested readers are urged to follow up with theirown research, and several very good texts are recommended in the bibliography.Essentially, we must address the birth and expansion of Islam.Muhammad, the prophet who created the religion known as Islam, had a vision ofthe Angel Gabriel while meditating in a cave in what is now Saudi Arabia. He wasforty years old, a tradesman, a pagan, and troubled by hearing Jewish andChristian tradesmen and others around them discussing their respectivereligions. Monotheism was a new concept, and the year was 610 A.D.The vision of Gabriel ignited something in Muhammad’s heart and soul. He beganpreaching a personal and unique amalgam of Jewish, Christian and native Arabmythology and religious and moral principles to anyone who would listen. Theseprinciples included better treatment of slaves and women, a life of moderation,a “surrender” to the one true God (the word “Islam” means “surrender”), andother spiritual doctrines. Abstinence from alcohol and the eating of pork werealso included, the latter a probable borrowing from Jewish law.The people in his native Mecca found Muhammad to be something of a problem,because his doctrines interfered with trade and with the status of the socialelite. Much as Christianity had evolved from a Messianic Jewish cult to a worldreligion and was about to conquer much of Europe as a political power, so tooMuhammad and his followers were seen as a political and economic threat to thestatus quo.Muhammad escaped a murder plot in Mecca and, with some of his followers, fled toMedina. This was in the year 622 A.D., the year of the “flight,” the Hegira fromwhich year Islam now counts its calendar.Muhammad found a slightly better reception in Medina, settled several tribaldisputes, and gradually converted many of these tribes to his new religion. Hetried to win the allegiance of the Jews in Medina, but the Prophet was anilliterate Arab tradesman, and the Jewish elite scorned him and his new religionwhich they found at odds with the Torah. Although Muhammad initially had hisfollowers face Jerusalem when they prayed, and made them adopt the practice ofthe Yom Kippur fast, his experience with the Jews in Medina led him to changethese practices. The Muslims now face Mecca, which is the site of an ancientArab relic, the Qa’aba (at the time of Muhammad a pagan shrine containing 360idols and a piece of black, probably meteoric, rock), and they fast for theentire month of Ramadan. Thus, Islam became gradually more “Arab,” as Muhammad’sinitial desire to wed Judaism, Christianity and indigenous Arab religious ideasand forms met opposition on all sides. Due to this very early contact withJewish religious and economic leaders, the Koran has many citations specificallytargeted against the Jews.5 Thus, some modern-day Muslims feel they havereligious approval—if not an out and out license—for their antagonism againstIsrael.As his religion grew in numbers, so did Muhammad grow in political power. At thetime of his death, Islam was virtually the state religion in Saudi Arabia.During the next hundred years after his death, Arab armies would give the ideaof missionary work a new meaning as they conquered—with fire and sword—nationafter nation, extending their faith and the Arab culture as far afield asFrance, where they were finally defeated by Charles Martel at the Battle ofTours in the year 800 A.D. They had to fall back to Spain and Portugal in thewest, and in the east as far as Samarkand, Tashkent and Turkey. Europe wouldhear again of the Arab legions when the Ottoman Empire reached its height in thesixteenth century A.D., going as far inland as the outskirts of Vienna andrunning over the Balkans, Romania and everything in between.It would be nearly another three hundred years after the Battle of Tours beforethe first Crusades were mounted by the Catholic Church to “take back” the holycity of Jerusalem. Jerusalem was also sacred to the Muslims, due to a traditionthat Muhammad had ascended to heaven from a site in Jerusalem that was alsosacred to Jews and Christians: the site of King Solomon’s Temple. This scenariomay be a borrowing from the legend of Jesus and some stories of the VirginMother and of the prophet Elijah, who were all bodily carried into heaven.Muhammad’s descendants—both familial and spiritual—then fought over the growingIslamic empire. Europe saw Islamic forces on their soil within a century afterthe death of Islam’s founder. And, in Spain, it would be another eight hundredyears before the last Islamic rulers would finally leave their country.Specifically, in the year 1492.TALES OF THE ALHAMBRA> In the spring of 1829, the author of this work, whom curiosity had brought to> Spain, made a rambling expedition from Seville to Granada in company with a> friend, a member of the Russian Embassy at Madrid.

Accident had thrown us together from distant regions of the globe (hefrom North Carolina, me from my temporary base in Malaysia), and a similarity oftaste and a tightness of schedule led us to hire a car and drive across Spain insearch of Granada and the fabled palace of the Alhambra.My Spanish is okay, my driving ability perhaps less so, yet I found myself doingall the driving that day, getting us out of Seville at an early hour and makinggood time to Granada. As was the case with that earlier tour to Rome in companywith another such executive, I found myself less of a chauffeur and more of atour guide and ad hoc historian as we wandered the fabulously decorated hallsand courtyards of one of the most striking examples of Arab architectureanywhere. It is always interesting for me to watch American executives abroad,and to marvel at how little they really know of the world outside their borders.This case was no exception.The executive in question has a mother who is fascinated by church history, andwho has a passionate attachment to the Holy Land and especially to Jerusalem andto the Holy Sepulcher, the site where Christ is supposed to have been laid torest after the Crucifixion. Yet, her son—a tall, self-important man of heroicproportions, with paranoid demeanor and somewhat lacking in social skills—seemedrelatively unaware of Arab conquests in Europe, even though he had accompaniedhis mother on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and is the beneficiary of her knowledgeof the subject. I found myself filling in odd gaps in his understanding of thestormy relationship that has existed between Muslims and Christians virtuallysince the death of Muhammad, and particularly since the “Moorish” invasion ofEurope in the eighth century A.D.It was a revelation to stand in the Alhambra, in Spain, and realize that therehad been an Islamic government in charge of large parts of the country for eighthundred years. That is nearly as long as the time since the Norman conquest ofEngland in 1066, and is certainly much longer than the time elapsed sinceColumbus’ landing on San Salvador in 1492 and… the present. The cities ofSeville, Cordoba, and Granada are testimony to the once-strong but now fadinglegacy of the Caliphs of the Alhambra.Washington Irving—the American author perhaps better known for his frighteningLegend of Sleepy Hollow and the somewhat comical and perceptive story of Rip VanWinkle—in his celebrated combination of short stories and travelogue Tales ofthe Alhambra makes justified recognition of the generally benign rule of theMoors in Spain, a reign that was famous for learning, science and the arts, andwhich attracted scholars and artists from all over Europe in its time.Nonetheless, it was an alien transplant in Europe and—surrounded as it was byhostile Christians on every side and separated by sea and land from itsspiritual home in the Middle East—it eventually succumbed to pressure fromwithout and within.The Moors were vanquished, finally, in January of 1492, the same year thatColumbus set sail on his first voyage to the New World, and that was not a merecoincidence. King Ferdinand was triumphant in removing the last vestige ofMuslim political influence from western Europe… and began to dream of anotherconquest.This is what American schoolchildren never learn, and what scholars have beenslow to report. From the Diario of Christopher Columbus, then:> And [Columbus] says that he hopes in God that on the return that he would> undertake from Castile he would find a barrel of gold that those who were left> would have acquired by exchange; and that they would have found the gold mine> and the spicery, and those things in such quantity that the sovereigns, before> three years, will undertake and prepare to go conquer the Holy Sepulcher; for> thus I urged Your Highnesses to spend all the profits of this my enterprise on> the conquest of Jerusalem, and Your Highnesses laughed and said that it would> please them and that even without this profit they had that desire. 7The conquest of Jerusalem and the Holy Sepulcher. In other words, anotherCrusade.The discovery of America and the subsequent voyages of Columbus had as theirgoal the recapture of Jerusalem. Indeed, one of the most important reasons forfinding the “fast” route to the East was to provide Ferdinand with a differentstrategy for retaking Jerusalem, for if Columbus was right and if India andChina could be reached by traveling due west, then so could Jerusalem. Ratherthan send an army of Crusaders across the Mediterranean or via land throughhostile Muslim territory, Ferdinand believed he could instead attack Jerusalemfrom the eastern side. No one would expect a Crusader force coming from the landeast of Jerusalem, when all previous attacks had come from the western approach.Ironically, then, American history begins in the sands of Palestine, in thesolemn stones of Jerusalem and King Solomon’s Temple, the Holy Sepulcher and theDome of the Rock, where so many have fought and suffered and died for religion,and still do.Much has been made in conspiracy literature of the possible connections Columbushad with the outlawed Knights Templar. It is said that his fleet—the famousNina, Pinta and Santa Maria—bore the red Templar cross on their sails as a signof the real mission of the Genoese-born Columbus and his Spanish patrons.Although the Templars had been suppressed two hundred years previously, there isevidence to show that some members of the Order had escaped to Portugal andScotland, among other places. We can easily see how their descendants would haveprivately rejoiced in such a Grail-like quest. “Jacques de Molay, thou artavenged.” We should also remember it was Columbus’ patrons—King Ferdinand andQueen Isabella—who created the Spanish Inquisition in 1478. At first, it wasdesigned to root out heresy among the Marranos, the Jews who had converted toChristianity, usually through social or other pressure. It was then extended tothose who had converted from Islam. At its height, the Grand Inquisitor was alsoresponsible for the American territories conquered by Spain: Mexico and Peru,the lands of the Aztecs and the Incas respectively. In the case of America,however, the Inquisition was concerned less with heresy, and more withwitchcraft and sorcery.In addition, and most importantly, we should realize that the SpanishInquisition was not run by the Church. Authority was given by the Pope to theKing to run the Inquisition, thereby making it a governmental organization, eventhough the Inquisitors themselves were usually Catholic churchmen, predominatelyDominican monks. This mechanism would be followed two hundred years later inSalem, Massachusetts during America’s own witch trials, when religious authoritygave way to secular, and witches—practitioners of spell-casting, Satanworshipping, and other such acts considered anti-Christian—were arrested,indicted, tried and executed by the secular courts. Heresy is tantamount torebellion where there is a State Church, and therefore it became the State’sbusiness to discover and punish—and torture and execute—heretics. They were,after all, de facto traitors. Private beliefs became matters for publicprosecutions.And finally we should not forget that the Pilgrims, the Puritans and theHuguenots—some of the first settlers in North America—were religious refugees,fleeing oppression in their native lands, to practice their faiths freely in theNew World. It is no indulgence in hyperbole to suggest that the modern originsof America are spiritual (or, at least, religious) in nature, and that Americahas spent the last five hundred years trying—usually unsuccessfully—to ignorethat fact.In light of the events of September 11, 2001 in the United States, manyAmericans have a dim view of Islam, and suspect all Muslims of harboring illintentions towards their country. In spite of all the rhetoric denying this,there is some truth to the suspicion that devout Muslims are hostile to theWest. Islamic rulers have had a long and well-documented history ofanti-European aggression, beginning with the invasions in the eighth centuryA.D., long before the first Crusade against Jerusalem. Particularly since theend of World War I, when the five hundred-year-old Ottoman Empire was finallydestroyed by Western forces, and when the betrayal of the Arab revolt was etchedin stone at the peace talks in Versailles—thus paving the way for the creationof a Jewish state in the midst of Arab Palestine—Muslims have been angry at theWest and at what they perceive to be Western decadence and immorality (anattempt, perhaps, to raise a visceral sense of humiliation at the hands of thetechnologically-advanced nations to a higher spiritual plane). Although in thepast Christians and Jews fared better, oddly, under Muslim leaders than underChristian administrations, it would be naïve to believe that most Muslims arefriendly to the West in general and to the United States in particular,especially in light of America’s role in support of Israel. Islamicfundamentalism has been on the rise worldwide, and the only thing stopping thecreation of a new Ottoman Empire is chronic disunity among Muslim nations.But it was not always thus.As I stood in the Court of the Lions at the Alhambra, while my colleaguewandered back and forth snapping photographs and asking endless questions forwhich he rarely stood still for an answer, I was reminded—with a kind ofnostalgic sigh—of the words of Washington Irving, describing the fall of theCaliphate:> Never was the annihilation of a people more complete than that of the> Morisco-Spaniards. Where are they? Ask the shores of Barbary and its desert> places. The exiled remnant of their once powerful empire disappeared among the> barbarians of Africa, and ceased to be a nation.

The Crusaders found themselves in the midst of a military adventurein Italy, and the dream of retaking Jerusalem in the wake of the ouster of theIslamic government in Granada never materialized. But in the same year, 1492, hemanaged to forcibly expel from Spain all Jews who would not convert toChristianity. In a reign worthy of admiration by Christian fundamentalistseverywhere, Ferdinand had managed to defeat Islam, expel the Jews, and mount aCrusade against the Muslims in the Holy Land... all in one year. He was alsoresponsible for the infamous Spanish Inquisition (immortalized in Edgar AllenPoe’s “The Pit and the Pendulum”). However, to American schoolchildren, KingFerdinand is pictured as a relatively anonymous or even benign influence, a manwho helped Columbus in his quest for a western passage to India, a hero of the“round Earth” theory.The year 1492 for some scholars—including the brilliant historian Dame FrancesYates in her The Occult Philosophy In The Elizabethan Age—also marked thebeginning of the Renaissance, as Spanish Jews fled to Italy with their science,art, and mystical writings, even as others mark the Renaissance as beginningwith the fall of Constantinople to the Turkish Empire in 1453.As for Columbus himself, alas, his succeeding three voyages were cursed with badluck, violence, and death. He managed to visit what is now Trinidad and a littlefarther on, Venezuela and the mouth of the Orinoco River, finally realizing thathe had discovered a new land that was not on the maps. But in the meantime hisattempts to convert the Native Americans to Catholicism—warlike Caribs andpeaceful Arawaks, for the most part—had failed miserably, and in some cases theNative Americans rose in revolt and slaughtered their European visitors, only tobe slaughtered themselves in return, thus instituting a pattern of attack andcounterattack that would plague European/Native American relations forcenturies. Indeed, it was Columbus who brought the first Native American slavesto Europe, about two hundred of them, many of whom died of disease on thevoyage. This was a pattern that was to be followed by the Spanish who followedhim to the New World, as they captured native peoples and enslaved them to workon their plantations in the American Southwest, the Caribbean, and LatinAmerica.Finally, Columbus was put in irons and sent back to Spain in disgrace. What hehad accomplished, however, would long outlive him and far exceed his wildestexpectations. Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, English and French expeditions wouldbe mounted over the course of the next hundred years to take as much of the “NewWorld” as possible, regardless of the opinions of the Arawaks or any of theother Native American peoples. And, even as America was discovered by accidentwhile a Spanish King and an Italian navigator plotted a new Crusade to take backthe Holy Land, they and their descendants committed atrocity after atrocity uponthe pagan peoples they found there.But the Arawaks would have the last laugh. It would take them exactly twohundred years—almost to the day—but they would have the last laugh.THE CRUCIBLE…the rumours of devil-worship were partly justified by a peculiar secret cultwhich had gained force there and engulfed all the orthodox churches. It wascalled… “The Esoteric Order of Dagon,” and was undoubtedly a debased,quasi-pagan thing imported from the East a century before… — “The Shadow OverInnsmouth,” H.P. Lovecraft9> Eventually, Spanish explorers did find gold and all manner of treasure in theNew World. The names of Pizzaro, Cortez and Ponce de Leon are familiar toAmerican schoolchildren as the illustrious Spanish conquistadores and explorerswho spread out from Florida and Cuba to Mexico and Peru, Colombia and Venezuelaand up to California and the American Southwest. Their legacy lives on in thearchitecture, the culture, the language and especially the predominantlyCatholic religion of Latin America. By the mid-sixteenth century, the greatAztec empire that was headquartered in what is now Mexico City had beensubjugated to the Spanish crown with fire and sword… and missionaries.The “Journey to the West” begun by Ferdinand and Columbus in 1492 wouldculminate four hundred years later, after the conquest of not only much of LatinAmerica but also the Philippine Islands. Revolutions instigated by Simon Bolivarand Bernardo O’Higgins in South America would eventually free the continent fromdirect control by Spain, but the Crown would hold on to Cuba, Puerto Rico, thePhilippines and other territories until the Span-ish-American War and TeddyRoosevelt’s famous charge up San Juan Hill.In the meantime, however, strange things were taking place in North America, ashort ride from H. P. Lovecraft’s home town in Providence, Rhode Island.When they hear the word “Salem,” many Americans automatically think of eitherthe cigarette or witchcraft, both potentially lethal phenomena to be sure.Ironically, they do share a common origin, at least in popular American history,and we will come to that in a moment. Disregarding King Tobacco for now, let’sfocus on what we know about Salem witchcraft, because its popularity has notdiminished with time, and the town of Salem, Massachusetts boasts an officialWitch as well as a Witchcraft Museum, a witchcraft shop, and a lot of rathersilly bumper-stickers.Essentially, the story is that a few young girls in Salem were being told ghoststories by a Black slave, Tituba, who had been brought to Salem from her nativeBarbados. These stories, full of sorcery and spells, enticed the girls and theybegan either to practice these forms of folk magic or to focus on them sointensively that they started to exhibit drastic personality changes. This, inturn, both terrified the villagers and instigated similar behavior in othergirls to the point that witchcraft was suspected. The girls, brought to trial,started naming names as those responsible for “bewitching” them, and eventuallydozens of people were accused of witchcraft and many were executed.The year was 1692.Recent scholarship, however, has shown that Tituba was not an African slave, buta Native American, a member of the Arawak people who had been brought out ofVenezuela to Barbados, where she was bought by Samuel Parris, the tradesman andfuture minister who figures so prominently in Salem history. And a close readingof the trial transcripts and of the records made by observers at the scenereveals that what was taking place in Salem in 1692 was not purely the result ofoveractive imaginations and what psychiatry used to like to call “hysteria” (aterm with rather offensive origins in that it implies that the womb—hyster isLatin for “womb”—is the source of emotional instability in women, with acorresponding implication that men are incapable of such a state). Instead, someof the accounts of demonic possession ring strangely true, accompanied as theyare with reports of paranormal phenomena, intense rage and blasphemy, etc. WhenI say “strangely true,” I hasten to clarify that these states are virtuallyidentical in every respect to those accounts of modern day possession, asreported by Catholic and Protestant clergymen in Europe and the United States.Many have insisted that there was no witchcraft at Salem, but the evidencereadily available proves otherwise.The other assumption that is often made is that the Salem witch trials were thefirst and last in the United States. Nothing could be more wrong. America hasbeen home to accusations of witchcraft since the earliest Colonial days, as wellas to alchemists, astrologers and occultists of all types. In fact, thesituation was becoming so serious that in the late seventeenth century theclergymen of Massachusetts were issuing warnings to their flocks about thedangerous attractions of occultism in the Colony.Yet, the history of European-style occult practices in the American coloniesbegins earlier than that. There are records of witchcraft accusations and trialsall over the East Coast and particularly in New England from the mid-seventeenthcentury on. In a book published by Scribner’s in 1914—Narratives of theWitchcraft Cases 1648-1706 by George Lincoln Burr, ed.—we read of ElizabethGarlick of Easthampton, Long Island (then a Dutch colony, although settled byEnglish) who was “indicted for witchcraft and sent to Connecticut for trial” inthe year 1658. 10Another two cases—those of Ralph Hall and his wife and ofKatherine Harrison—cropped up in 1665. The accused were acquitted of thecharges, except that in the case of Ralph Hall’s wife, Mary, the court did find“some suspitions [sic] by the Evidence, of what the woman is Charged with, butnothing considerable of value to take away her life.”11 The couple were accusedof having used witchcraft to cause the deaths of a George Wood and the infantchild of one Ann Rogers. This occurred at what is now City Island, in theborough of the Bronx in New York City.Indeed, a look at the record for witchcraft cases in New England in theseventeenth century (which is the earliest for which we have documentation)shows that accusations, indictments, prosecutions and even executions weretaking place since 1638 and extended through 1697. The earliest execution forwhich records can be found is of Alice Young, executed in Windsor, Connecticutin 1647, followed by those of Elizabeth Kendall of Cambridge, Massachusetts andMargaret Jones of Charlestown, Massachusetts (the latter person executed in1648). All in all, we can find a total of 132 persons accused of witchcraft inNew England alone in the seventeenth century, not counting those at Salem. Ofthese 132 persons, four actually confessed, twenty were convicted, and fourteenwere executed. Again, this is in addition to the nineteen who were executed atSalem. The accused were overwhelmingly female, more than 100 of the 132. 12In all fairness, though, Salem was a special case: 156 accused, 30 convicted, 44confessed, and 19 executed. Another prisoner was pressed to death during tortureand interrogation, bringing the Salem death count to twenty, and several moredied in jail.Witches in the classical sense were not the only “alternative religionists” inthe Colonies. A strange case that has rarely made it to the general histories ofAmerica is that of Thomas Morton, and his infamous Maypole at what is nowQuincy, Massachusetts (not far from Salem). It was May Day, 1637 (and a yearbefore the first recorded witchcraft case in New England). Thomas Morton decidedthat they should celebrate the day after “old English custome: prepared to setup a Maypole upon the festivall day of Philip and Jacob; & therefore brewed abarrell of excellent beer, & provided a case of bottles to be spent, with othergood cheer, for all comers of that day…. A goodly pine tree of 80 foot long, wasreared up, with a pair of buckshorns nailed on, somewhat neare unto the top ofit…” 13Morton also had the assistance of the Native Americans of the vicinity, who weremore than happy to join in the celebration, even though it was intended tocommemorate the renaming of the area from Pasonagessit to Merry Mount. But, asMorton continues:> The setting up of this Maypole was a lamentable spectacle to the precise> separatists: that lived at New Plymouth. They termed it an Idoll; yea they> called it the Calf of Horeb: and stood at defiance with the place, naming it> Mount Dagon… 14(Shades of H. P. Lovecraft!) But that wasn’t the end of the story.Apparently, the English were taking slaves and indentured servants fromMassachusetts to Virginia and selling or renting them off. Morton, in theabsence of the traders, then appealed to the remaining Native Americans, slavesand servants that they should band together and resist the efforts to expatriatethem, as it were. The Maypole was the first official attempt at organizing notonly a pagan festival but an armed resistance to the English officials in chargeof the slave trade. In addition to welcoming Native Americans—and especiallythose of the female persuasion—to the feast, and “consorting” with them andhaving all sorts of drunken revels, Morton trained them in the use of firearms.When an English lieutenant arrived to take charge of the rapidly deterioratingsituation, he was thrown out of the settlement and evidently had to beat aretreat for England.Morton’s experiment began to attract a lot of attention from the Englishauthorities, as could be imagined. No less a figure than Captain Miles Standishhimself—and a force comprised of eight men from “Pascataway, Namkeake,Winismett, Weesagascusett, Natasco, and other places where any English wereseated”—was sent on orders of the Governor to put down the uprising, butStandish’s army was met with a force of arms by Morton’s merry men.The resistance did not last long, however (William Bradford says that they weretoo drunk to effectively resist) and eventually Morton was captured and put inirons and sent to England… but he avoided any prosecution by the Crown andinstead took the time off to compose a New English Dictionary. (He was, afterall, a friend of dramatist Ben Jonson.) Another worthy, one John Endecott, wasinstalled in Quincy in his place, a no-nonsense sort who had the Maypole struckand the locals chastised.By that time, however, the damage had been done. The “Indians” now had modernweapons, and instruction in their use. As William Bradford, one of the earlychroniclers of the period, despairs:> O the horribleness of this villainy! How many both Dutch and English have been> lately slain by those Indians, thus furnished; and no remedy provided, nay,> the evill more increased, and the blood of their brethren sold for gaine, as> is to be feared; and in what danger all these colonies are in is too well> known. Oh! That princes and parliaments would take some timely order to> prevent this mischief, and at length to suppress it, by some exemplary> punishment upon some of these gain thirsty murderers, (for they deserve no> better title,) before their collonies in these parts be over thrown by these> barbarous savages, thus armed with their owne weapons, by these evill> instruments, and traitors to their neighbors and country. 15Scholarship suggests that the reasons the Puritans reacted so strongly toMorton’s cult was twofold: In the first case, it was obvious that Morton and hismen were sexually involved with Native American women (a charge that would bemade against one of the accused at Salem fifty-five years later). This in itselfwas bad enough; but giving their men firearms was the last straw. This meantthat they were now on a roughly equal footing with the Puritans, could hunt aswell or better, and could control the trade in beaver skins and other exportableitems. Morton was open about both these practices. He had written poemsencouraging dalliances with Indian lasses, and conducted firearm instruction andtrading with Indian men. Of course, the repercussions from Morton’s trade andinstruction in firearms were to be long-lasting. The “Indians” now had weaponsand could more effectively resist the white settlers. The New England Indianwars began:> The Pequot War, 1637.> The Narragansett War, 1643-45.> King Philip’s War, 1675-1676.By the time of the Salem Witch Trials in 1692, the white settlers had come tosee themselves as surrounded by hostile forces, and to characterize these forcesas “savages” at best, and as demonic beings at worst. It was a crucible, indeed.WONDERS OF THE INVISIBLE WORLDThe New Englanders are a people of God settled in those, which were once theDevil’s territories; and it may easily be supposed that the Devil wasexceedingly disturbed, when he perceived such a people here accomplishing thepromise of old made unto our Blessed Jesus, That He should have the utmost partsof the earth for his possession. — Cotton Mather 16> Dame Frances Yates—the aforementioned historian, of the University of London,the British Academy, the Warburg Institute, and the Royal Society ofLiterature—has written extensively on the Elizabethan period and theRenaissance, with a particular focus on occult literature, thus elevating thestudy somewhat above its usual relegation to the attention of cranks andpublicity seekers. In her The Occult Philosophy In The Elizabethan Age she makesan interesting, if daring, claim that the Puritan movement owed much to occultideology current in England at the time, with connections to Pico dellaMirandola, Cornelius Agrippa, and other saints of the occultist canon. This formof occultism—known as Christian Cabala to historians—was an amalgamation of theJewish Cabala with Muslim and Christian elements; in other words, an attempt tointegrate the three religions by focusing on some basic, mystical elements thatthey had in common. Among these was the belief in a sophisticated form ofnumerology where letters have numeric equivalents, and in the rituals ofinvoking angelic forces. Eventually, this intellectual and spiritual movementcame to be represented in such organizations as the Rosicrucians and the Masonicsocieties, and to embrace various other occult disciplines such as alchemy andceremonial magic.What may cause some New Englanders no small degree of astonishment—if not, insome cases, amusement or even alarm—is the fact that no less a personage thanGovernor John Winthrop, Jr. was a practicing alchemist during his administration(1659-1676). It is noted that his library contained some “275 books on alchemyand the occult.” 17He was well-versed not only in these arcane matters, but alsoon the subject of the Rosicrucians, a putative secret society (like theFreemasons and the Templars) whose existence was proclaimed at the verybeginning of the seventeenth century, probably by occult scholar Robert Fludd.During Winthrop’s tenure, in fact, many people were accused of witchcraft, andthree were executed: Rebecca and Nathaniel Greensmith of Hartford and MaryBarnes of Farmington.Alchemy and the study of ceremonial magic as well as the medical theories ofParacelsus were considered gentlemanly pursuits in the seventeenth century, andindeed we know that many esteemed scientists of the day were also practicingoccultists of some type. As D. Michael Quinn notes in his excellent andexhaustive Early Mormonism and the Magic World View,> Many of New England’s practicing alchemists were Yale and Harvard graduates> who continued their experiments into the 1820s. These alchemists served as> chief justice of Massachusetts, president of the Massachusetts Medical> Society, president of Yale College, and president of the Connecticut Medical> Society. 18Such historically important scientists as Isaac Newton, Roger Bacon, Liebniz andmany others were enthusiastic practicing occultists and members of occult secretsocieties. Newton’s interests have been thoroughly outlined in Michael White’sIsaac Newton, the Last Sorcerer, a book which caused no little controversy uponpublication, since modern science has been at pains to disparage the paranormalin general and organized occult activity and beliefs in particular. Todemonstrate that the “father of modern physics” had deeply held mysticalbeliefs—which may have influenced his thinking in science—was simply too muchfor some members of the scientific establishment to bear. At the time of theSalem trials, Newton was in the throes of a kind of nervous breakdown, hard atwork at trying to decipher the Bible on the one hand, and involved withalchemical experiments on the other. (As we shall show in a later chapter,Newton had a twentieth century counterpart in Nobel Prize-winning physicistWolfang Pauli.) Yale University Professor Jon Butler, in Awash in a Sea ofFaith: Christianizing the American People, gives a valuable synopsis of thereligious, mystical and occult milieu in seventeenth century America, includingthe scientists, lawmakers, ministers and other community leaders who werethemselves involved in alchemy, ceremonial magic, Rosicrucianism and otheroccult practices and movements. Large libraries of occult books, secretcorrespondence with like-minded occultists or members of secret societies, andavant-garde religious sentiments—particularly in a political context, andincluding such American Founding Fathers as Washington, Franklin andJefferson—defined the spiritual atmosphere of the intellectual class of thecolonies; divining rods, shew stones, and magic charms and talismans as well asbasic astrological lore defined the approach of the lower and middle classes.Yet both groups shared a common belief in the actions of invisible forces in theworld, forces which could be manipulated or cajoled into cooperation for mundanegoals. Forces which could be summoned by magic white and black, by priestlymagicians in the shadow of the Church or by evil witches in the farms, villagesand back alley lanes of the common people.This, then, was the environment in which the good villagers of Salem foundthemselves in 1692. Two hundred years after the discovery of America by would-beCrusader Christopher Columbus and his crew—many of whom had fought the Muslimsin Spain—the English colonists found themselves facing a pagan enemy in theirmidst... and alchemists, astrologers and magicians hidden among their churchmen,their governors, their doctors. In fact, the Indians themselves might very wellbe demonic beings and not humans at all; at the very least, they were believedto be Satan worshippers. Cotton Mather insisted that the Devil himself hadbrought the Indians to America, since there was no mention of their race in theBible. Thus, when Lovecraft wrote his fanciful stories of pagan cults in NewEngland he was touching a deeply buried memory of the very land in which helived. Columbus—and his Dutch, French and English followers in NorthAmerica—brought the Cross and the Sword, in a blaze of neo-Templar fury, to beardown upon the Red Man, to convert him or to kill him. The hatred of the Puritansfor deviation of any kind would inevitably turn inward and begin killing themoff from within. And the instrument of that social suicide would be none otherthan another Red Man or, in this case, Red Woman. Her name was Tituba, and shewas an Arawak whose ancestors lived in Guyana, Venezuela and elsewhere in theCaribbean; whose ancestors had welcomed and trusted Columbus; and who had paidthe price of that trust with their lives.The Arawak are famous for two exports. Tituba—and the ensuing Salem witchcraftcase—is one; tobacco is another. It was once again brother Columbus who, in1492, saw the Arawaks smoking tobacco in a kind of tube they called tobago, andhence smoking—and the word “tobacco”—came to the white man from the Arawak. Infact, even the word “cannibal” comes from the Arawak language.Tituba’s ancestors came from what is now Guyana, the South American country thatwould later become famous as the site of the Jonestown massacre. She herself waspurchased as a slave from Barbados, by Samuel Parris: a minister and centralfigure in the Salem witch trials. Her story is covered in Elaine Breslaw’sTituba, Reluctant Witch of Salem, and her testimony is analyzed and“deconstructed” with a view to sorting the Arawak and Amerindian mythology andmagic from the Puritan version.Professor Breslaw mentions a native Guyanese belief in the “evil stranger,” thekenaima, who causes evil things to happen in a village and who can take variousforms (such as other humans, animals, etc.). This is always a stranger, someonefrom outside the village, and Tituba in her testimony before the magistratesbegan to point a finger at evil outside influences behind the witchcraft covensin Salem. She claimed that the ringleader of the witches was a “man in black”who lived in Boston, that she and the other Salem witches attended meetings inBoston in spirit form, and that they received their instructions to return toSalem and hurt the children living there.In addition, perhaps the greatest controversy over how the trials were conductedwas the issue of “spectral evidence.” It was this type of evidence against whichCotton Mather warned time and again, but usually in vain. Although ReverendMather believed in the existence of witches and in paranormal phenomenagenerally, he doubted the admissibility of testimony based on people’s visionsof demons, evil spirits, and other phenomena which could not be witnessed by thejudges in a courtroom. In other words, it was enough for someone to say that “soand so bewitched me” in spirit form. If the accused was sitting in the dock,peacefully at rest, but the “victims” cried out that he or she was tormentingthem by occult means and then fell over in fits to demonstrate the fact, manyjudges tended to credit that as evidence. In this case, the spectre or spiritualform of the accused was doing the tormenting, even though no one other than thevictim would see it. The Guyanese kenaima could, of course according to legend,assume any form, animate or inanimate. So in the context of Arawak magic andwitchcraft, the stories about shape-shifting witches and ghostly appearances ofone’s neighbors in the middle of the night or in a dream were perfectlyacceptable. What is remarkable—as has been noted by Professor Breslaw andothers—is that the Salem Puritans would adopt much of this tradition as theirown, with suitable changes and amendments as they integrated these beliefs intotheir Christian system.In the final analysis, what we have here is probably the first recorded instanceof what would become the satanic survivor craze of America in the 1980s. Infact, many of Tituba’s “memories”—as well as those of her “coconspirators”—wereslow in coming, and memory disorders, real or imagined or feigned, were part ofthe Salem experience. Recovered memories, tortured children, witch covens, asatanic network spanning the Northeast… welcome to Geraldo Nation. Add to thismixture the figure of the “man in black,” and we can tie all of this in nicelywith the UFO phenomenon. Indeed, Tituba’s account of leaving her body at nightand traveling to the meetings, and then returning again before dawn, soundseerily similar to some accounts of alien abductions. The existence of witchmarks—odd bruises on one’s body suggestive of pacts with the Devil, etc.—havetheir correlates with the stories of alien surgery and alien implants. In fact,Tituba first claimed that she flew to Boston through the air in both body andsoul, but amended this fact later to state that she only appeared in Boston inthe spirit.(Compare this historical event with satanic cult survivor syndrome, and wonderif the stories of a network of satanic cults breeding children for humansacrifice—along with the confessions of persons who claim they were breeders, orhad been pressed into cult service while children—are in any way different fromthose of the Salem case. Then wonder a little further, and ask: if there wassmoke in the Salem case—and evidence of at least a small fire—and if someclergymen, politicians, and scientists in New England in 1692 were involved inserious occult studies and research, then perhaps there was a fire beneath allthe smoke of the satanic cult hysteria of three hundred years later, and perhapssome of our own clergymen, politicians and scientists in America of 1992 werealso involved in serious occult research. Is it simply a recurring phenomenon,or is there a link between the events of 1692 and those of present-day America?)Washington Irving—mentioned above as the author of a series of tales about theMuslim palace, the Alhambra, in Spain (in which palace, in fact, he lived for awhile)—is also the author of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. In this Halloween taleof headless horsemen and unrequited love, we have Ichabod Crane: aschoolteacher. One of Ichabod’s claims to fame is that he “had read severalbooks quite through, and was a perfect master of Cotton Mather’s history ofNew-England Witchcraft, in which, by the way, he most firmly and potentlybelieved.”19 It would be hard to overestimate the importance of Mather’s workamong the population of the Northeast in the late seventeenth and earlyeighteenth centuries. Cotton Mather had been present at the Salem witchtrials—and at the trials and investigations of numerous other witches andpurported cases of witchcraft—and is a somewhat trustworthy observer of whattranspired. It was he who gave us the wonderful concept of the Invisible Worldas the domain of the evil spirits, and it is to this domain that we will returnagain and again in one form… or another.> We have been advised by some credible Christians yet alive, that a malefactor,> accused of witchcraft as well as murder, and executed in this place more than> forty years ago, did then give notice of an horrible plot against the country> by witchcraft, and a foundation of witchcraft then laid, which if it were not> seasonably discovered, would probably blow up, and pull down all the churches> in the country.

The witches have decided to attack Christianity at a place namedafter Jerusalem, the City of Peace, in a land which the Puritans had hoped wouldbecome the New Jerusalem after the irretrievable loss of the Old. (America,after all, was discovered during an attempt to finance a new Crusade to takeback the original Jerusalem. Failing that, a town in America was named after itwhich has now, ironically, become synonymous with witchcraft!) The site of theattack therefore has deep symbolic and spiritual ramifications. It is both the“firstborn” of the settlements, and a place named after the sacred city of Jews,Christians and Muslims. The attack is being waged by “invisible hands,” thefirst wave of a plot that was in existence forty years before the Salem trials,that is, sometime in the 1650s. The allusion by Mather to a person convicted ofwitchcraft and murder in Salem and executed at about that time is mysterious, asit does not come up in any of the documents I have been able to locate. Yet, theinsistence by Mather that the occurrence of witchcraft in Salem is the result ofa plot by devil worshippers to take over the country is worth considering forseveral reasons.In the first place, such an accusation would serve to rally the people togetherby making witchcraft a threat to everyone and not only to those afflicted bytorments and curses. It is a master stroke, and reminiscent of Hitler’scastigation of a Jewish plot against Germany.In the second place, it implies that the witches are well-organized and havebeen setting this up for over forty years. In other words, it is impossible toknow who your friends are. People you have known all your life may, indeed, bepart of this ongoing plot to destroy Christianity in the New World. If they aretruly operating by invisible means, then normal systems of defense are hopeless.In the third place—and perhaps most importantly of all—the “malefactor” of fortyyears ago was also a murderer as well as a witch. This linking of supernaturalpowers and religious rebellion with actual murder is very important. As in thecase of the satanic cult survivor syndrome of the 1980s, satanic cults are notdeemed threatening or even newsworthy unless they have been killing people. Thismay be an early result of the Church coming to terms with science. When thethreat of diabolic powers and unholy worship is no longer enough tofrighten—being deemed more the domain of fairy tales and legends than the realworld of physics and chemistry—then murder is enough to bring the subject ofsatanists and witches back to the front burner. Remember, also, that thesemurders were the result of black magic and not .44 calibre bullets. A poppetstudded with pins, hidden in a wall or buried in the garden, coupled with acorpse, was enough for a conviction. It satisfied means and opportunity, if notalways motive; but if the motive is the plot to overthrow Christianity, then nofurther evidence is needed. The dead child or adult was simply a target ofopportunity in an all-out war against the forces of Light.In fact, when it comes to the case of “spectral evidence” in which the suffererperceives the shape or image of a certain person to be causing the mischief,when the actual person can be shown to be elsewhere at the time and “alibied-up”(as we say in the Bronx), Mather understands that to be a wile of the Devil,rendering at times the person innocent even though that person’s “shape” or“spectre” may have been seen by the bewitched. Mather goes even further, to saythat though the person himself may be innocent it is still evidence of theextent of the diabolical plot against the land that the Devil is capable ofusing this type of illusion to cause dissension among the Christians and so todemoralize them.> These our poor afflicted neighbors, quickly after they become infected and> infested with these demons, arrive to a capacity of discerning those which> they conceive the shapes of their troublers; and notwithstanding the great and> just suspicion that the demons might impose the shapes of innocent persons in> their spectral exhibitions upon the sufferers (which may perhaps prove no> small part of the witch-plot in the issue), yet many of the persons thus> represented, being examined, several of them have been convicted of a very> damnable witchcraft: yea, more than one twenty have confessed, that they have> signed unto a book, which the devil showed them, and engaged in his hellish> design of bewitching and ruining our land.> > > > > > —Cotton Mather, Wonders of the Invisible World (emphasis added )21Mather then, in prose fraught with presentiment of what would happen to Americain the 1980s, states,> We know not, at least I know not, how far the delusions of Satan may be> interwoven into some circumstances of the confessions; but one would think all> the rules of understanding human nature are at an end, if after so many most> voluntary harmonious confessions, made by intelligent persons of all ages, in> sundry towns, at several times, we must not believe the main strokes wherein> those confessions all agree: especially when we have a thousand preternatural> things every day before our eyes, wherein the confessors do acknowledge their> concernment, and give demonstration of their being so concerned. If the devils> now can strike the minds of men with any poisons of so fine a composition and> operation, that scores of innocent people shall unite, in confessions of a> crime, which we see actually committed, it is a thing prodigious, beyond the> wonders of the former ages, and it threatens no less than a sort of a> dissolution upon the world.> > > > > > —Cotton Mather, Wonders of the Invisible World (emphasis added)22In other words, if everyone is confessing to things which they did not actuallydo, then it is still the action of the Devil, and the world is in even moredanger. Heads I win. Tails you lose. Either the confessions are genuine, and thewitches guilty; or the confessions are false and have been concocted by theDevil, in which case the accused may be innocent, but the Devil is a lotstronger than we thought and the country is in jeopardy. Either way, the Devilis abroad in the land.Or, at least, in Massachusetts.One of the most revealing views of Cotton Mather on the subject of witchcraftappears in his letters, in which he states that witchcraft works “upon the stageof imagination.” He never doubted the fact of witches and witchcraft, butinstead—after witnessing the events not only in Salem but in other cities in NewEngland and in other cases of witchcraft—understood that the efficacy ofwitchcraft resided in the powers of the mind. We say that “the mind playstricks” or “the imagination plays tricks” and thereby remove any personalresponsibility from the event. But in Mather’s day, one was responsible for thestate of one’s soul and could not shrug off culpability by blaming one’s parentsor one’s environment. If the “imagination” was playing tricks, then someone wasplaying the imagination. Either the victim, or a witch. The witch as manipulatorof perception, as manipulator of the imagination, is a powerful symbol and comesvery close as a model for what actually transpires, as we shall see in laterchapters.And these individuals who understand the workings of the imagination pose agreat threat to society, in Mather’s eyes:> …at prodigious witch-meetings, the wretches have proceeded so far as to> concert and consult the methods of rooting out the Christian religion from> this country, and setting up instead of it perhaps a more gross diabolism than> ever the world saw before.> > > > > > —Cotton Mather, Wonders of the Invisible World 23These are very strong words. For Cotton Mather, the Invisible World is indeedwondrous, and very, very dangerous.Among the most respected historians of the Salem Witchcraft trials is Chad-wickHansen, who based his novel thesis on the close reading of the actual trialtranscripts themselves and came to the conclusion that there was, indeed,witchcraft being practiced in Salem and that some of the accused were actuallyguilty. In addition to this startling assertion, his study Witchcraft at Salem,originally published in 1969, goes on to conclude that many of the girls wereactually suffering from a clinical mental disorder.Hansen states that the problem afflicting the Salem girls was hysteria, but hequalifies this by saying that it was the medical condition known as hysteria andnot the popular concept of hysteria; in other words, he claims that the girlssuffered from a pathological condition. He refers to Freud, Janet and others ashis source for information on hysteria, its symptoms, manifestations andpresumed causes.24 It may be salutary to compare those early definitions ofhysteria with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III(DSM-III) to see if there is still general agreement on both symptomatology andcauses.What is more interesting, perhaps, is his agreement that there was, indeed,witchcraft—specifically “image magic”—being practiced at Salem. He goes furtherto provide some evidence of one murder being carried out by an act ofwitchcraft. Of course, he puts this down to the general effect of cursingsomeone in a superstitious society: if you believe in curses and witchcraft andyou know you have been cursed, you give up hope and die.This does not exonerate those who practiced such spells, however. If theydesired to cause the death of another and used “superstitious” means to effectthat end, are they any less guilty because we—as moderns—profess not to believein witchcraft? On the contrary, the spell-casters seem just as culpable to me asthose who murder with knife, gun or poison. Especially in the context of 1692,it would seem that some of those convicted of witchcraft may very well have beenguilty.As Hansen writes,> While it is clearly true that the majority of persons executed for witchcraft> were innocent, it is equally true that some of them, in Massachusetts and> elsewhere, were guilty.25And,> It should be clear by now that our historians have erred in their assumption> that there was no witchcraft practiced at Salem, or that if there was it was> of little consequence. The documents, rightly read, present us a far different> picture. In Bridget Bishop, Candy, and Mammy Redd we have three people who> practiced black magic, and with demonstrable success. In the Hoar family and> George Burroughs we have people who established a reputation for black magic> and then traded on it, although whether they were actually witches remains> uncertain. …And if the testimony concerning Roger Toothaker and his daughter> may be taken at face value—and there is reason to believe it may—we have one> case of murder by witchcraft—one case in which occult means were used to take> a human life away. 26While Hansen admits that witchcraft and black magic were used by some of theaccused Salem witches, he still tends (as would most sober and serioushistorians) to associate their effects with the clinical definition of hysteria.There is, however, something vaguely unsatisfying about this charge of hysteria.As Hansen himself relates,27 hysterical fits seem to be disappearing as a rule,and he lays this to the fact that we—as moderns—don’t give the hysterical fit asmuch attention or awe as before, so that as a mechanism it has lost itsusefulness. This seems to argue against hysteria being a genuine pathology andthe fit something over which a person has no control. One of the essentialelements of Hansen’s thesis seems to be that the bewitched of Salem were notfrauds, but victims of a pathological condition. Yet, he seems to believe thathysterical fits are disappearing in the modern world because there is no supportin the environment or society for their religious or mystical interpretations.Perhaps I am dull, but I don’t see the logic of this argument.The type of hysteria Hansen is describing—and the symptoms to which thetranscripts of the Salem trials may refer—are covered in DSM-III (the editioncurrent with Hansen’s work) under “300.11 Conversion Disorder (or HystericalNeurosis, Conversion Type).” Under the heading “Predisposing Factors,” we read,> Antecedent physical disorder (which may provide a prototype for the symptoms,> e.g., pseudoseizures in individuals with epilepsy), exposure to other> individuals with real physical symptoms or conversion symptoms, and extreme> psychosocial stress (e.g., warfare or the recent death of a significant> figure) are predisposing factors.28We know from the transcripts that there was no evidence of “antecedent physicaldisorders” and “exposure to other individuals with real physical symptoms orconversion symptoms” seems to be a way of alluding to the popular concept of“mass hysteria,” i.e., if a person sees one hysteric “acting out” then somehowthis fit is contagious, like yawning or laughing, and you have a chain reactionof hysterics. The last mentioned factor is “extreme psychosocial stress,” andthere was a degree of tension in Salem Village in those days, but nowhere nearenough to account for the outbreak of hysteria, if hysteria it was. One settingthat contributes to hysteria—according to DSM-III—is warfare. That’s the degreeof extreme psychosocial stress the authors of the DSM-III had in mind. So, weare left with a question: What social factors contributed to the outbreak ofhysteria in Salem Village in 1692, of a nature equal to warfare?Also, can hysteria be consciously controlled? The psychiatrists of today wouldtell us no, that it is a pathological condition beyond the conscious control ofan individual. That would rule out fraud in the case of Salem, since thesymptoms were so severe and so representative of the cases found in Janet,Charcot, Freud, et. al. that there is no way to disregard them as a kind ofadolescent prank.Many of the symptoms of conversion disorder seem equivalent to the type ofphenomena witnessed in cases of demonic possession, and certainly many suchcases were thus identified in the past. Hysterics in New England in theseventeenth century were often “cured” by prayer, which would seem to indicate aclose relation to cases of demonic possession. It is possible that “conversiondisorder” and “demonic possession” are simply two ways of saying the same thing…but that should not lull us into a false sense of security.Hansen refers to parallel cases of hysterical fits in instances of New England“witchcraft” and in European medicine, in29 which the hysterical victim claimsto see beings tormenting her. Invective—including the use of foul expletives—iscommon in both types of cases. No less an authority than J.M. Charcot believedthat the hallucination of beings attacking his patient were “reminiscences,doubtless, of the emotions experienced in her youth.” 30What does that mean?That these emotions—buried for decades, perhaps—come to the fore during anhysterical fit? Or are these emotions perhaps the cause of the fit? How, then,to describe the same thing happening to young girls, people still in theiryouth?While the emotions may represent buried memories, may they be of a moreatavistic nature? In the way of the collective unconscious of Jung, forinstance? Or perhaps they are what they seem to be to a select few Catholicexorcists: evidence of the possession of the victim by some outside force?It is common to say that a belief in possession carries with it a concomitantbelief in exorcism, and that is why exorcism works and not because there is areal demon possessing a human being. But that is somewhat tautological. Cancerpatients undergoing radiation treatments and chemotherapy are told to thinkpositive, to visualize their cancer cells dying, to develop a “will to live,”etc., leading us to wonder how much of modern cancer therapy is analogous towitchcraft. If the mind-body system is so interdependent as to support a wholehost of radical therapies aimed at treating much illness as psychosomatic—if notin origin, then at least in cure—then perhaps we are missing the boat onhysteria, possession, and witchcraft. And if some of the current theories ofquantum physics hold any deeper meaning for us, then perhaps the notion of an“outside force” is not too far-fetched.Further, one could as easily suggest that because exorcism works, there are realdemons. Science says that there is no evidence that demons exist, and that thesymptoms of possession are actually those of other pathological states which canbe treated with scientific procedures. In the cases where science—i.e.,medicine—fails and magic works (such as in spontaneous cancer remission, forinstance, or in cases of exorcism), it is claimed to be only due to an imperfectunderstanding of the scientific mechanisms of the specific malady, and not dueto supernatural events.What is not entertained—because it would cause a bit of social upheaval and agreat deal of misunderstanding—is the possibility that these two claims are notmutually exclusive: that scientific and medical procedures contain within theman element of the supernatural or at least paranormal, and that the best doctorsand the best physicists are those who recognize this and utilize it to the bestof their ability.Yet, Hansen goes on to insist,> The direct cause of these fits, in the courtroom or out of it, was, of course,> not witchcraft itself, but the afflicted person’s fear of witchcraft.31This is all well and good, for it supports the party line that occult powers perse either do not exist, or exist only in the fevered imaginations of occultistsand fellow travelers. But numerous persons at the Salem trial confessed towitchcraft, and in specifics and in detail. Some of these persons were knownoccultists, such as George Burroughs and Samuel Wardwell. William Barker’sconfession in which he claimed there were 307 witches abroad in the land, andthat they were part of a plot to replace the practice of Christianity with thatof Devil worship—hence the fact that the Salem panic began at the home of itsminister, Samuel Parris—is discounted as patently false by Hansen and, ofcourse, by everyone else. We have variations today in the United States andelsewhere of “satanic panic” and charges of a conspiracy of witches oroccultists in the land who are working towards the overthrow of Christianity,etc. Some of these confessions, however, are deliberate, detailed, expandedupon, citing specific events… and they are dismissed because, of course, thereare no such things as occult powers or the Devil making pacts with humans… oreven, dare we say, the Devil itself.While it is not my intention to say that the confessions are literally true, andthat Barker, Wardwell and others were transported to witches’ sabbats onbroomsticks and made pacts with a literal Devil and signed a physical book andworked for the overthrow of Christianity, what I am suggesting is that there isa dimension to these confessions that is beyond fraud, or overactiveimaginations, or hysteria. What I am suggesting, and hope to demonstrate in thepages that follow, is that there exists a medium in which occult “powers” doexist and do have an effect on the world as experienced by non-occultists, andthat the evidence that is available to support this thesis is convincing, andscientific.As Cotton Mather states,> Our dear neighbors are most really tormented, really murdered, and really> acquainted with hidden things which are afterwards proved plainly to have been> realities. 3233A STUDY IN SCARLET…The details of the case will probably be never known now, though we areinformed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old-standingand romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that boththe victims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints… —“A StudyIn Scarlet,” Sir Arthur Conan Doyle34> It is clear from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s first Sherlock Holmes story that hewas fascinated with the history of the Mormons, also known as the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah wherethe Mormon pilgrims finally ended their search for a place to practice theirreligion freely, they are famous the world over for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir,for their collection of birth records and genealogical data, and perhaps less sofor the fact that the late Howard Hughes, billionaire recluse and erstwhileHollywood playboy, insisted on Mormons as his personal staff and de factobodyguards. The role that the Mormons play in our story will be amplified later;for now it is only enough to look at their mysterious origins, origins that gaverise to the first Sherlock Holmes mystery.The tale begins where we left off a few paragraphs ago, in the village of Salem,Massachusetts. And it begins with the same topic as those infamous trials:witchcraft, magic and secret societies. The witch—or wizard, as the Salem judgeswould have termed him—was none other than Joseph Smith, Jr., founder of theMormon Church and the recipient of its sacred text, the Book of Mormon. LikeMuhammad, Joseph Smith was visited by an Angel. Like Muhammad, he created awhole religion based on his angelic contacts. But unlike Muhammad, Joseph Smithwas actively involved in the use of ritual magic—ceremonial magic—for thepurpose of finding buried treasure. Like a Yankee Doctor Faustus, Joseph Smithconjured spirits to come to his aid. With amulets and talismans, pentacles andswords, sigils and strange alphabets, he stepped from the misty milieu ofContinental European magic and into the creation of the quintessentialAmerican-born religion, a religion which ties together some loose ends ofAmerican archaeology, Christian cabala, Freemasonry, and old-fashioned Biblestories to weave a crazy quilt of millennial paranoia, pseudo-Egyptian magic,and Masonic ritual. In fact, Joseph Smith could be considered one of thegodfathers of the American occult scene, the progenitor of such groups as theChurch of Satan, the OTO “Caliphate,” even the witchcraft revival of the 1970s.One of the texts that was essential to Smith’s occult operations was The Magus,that vast compendium of occult beliefs and systems written by Francis Barretttwo hundred years ago, which was republished many times during the Americanoccult renaissance in the 1970s.35In fact, what many Americans—and probably most Mormons—do not know is thatJoseph Smith, Jr. (who would go on to found the Mormon religion) was a directdescendant of one of the accusers at Salem, one Samuell Smith of Boxford, whoaccused Mary Easty of witchcraft. Samuell Smith was Joseph Smith’sgreat-great-grandfather. Another accuser, one John Gould— who accused SarahWilds—was Samuell Smith’s father-in-law.Both Mary Easty and Sarah Wilds were executed at Salem in 1692, and on the basisof the accusations of Smith and Gould, Joseph Smith’s ancestors... 36…and in 1836, Joseph Smith and a small company of fellow treasure-seekersdecamped to Salem, Massachusetts for the purpose of renting a house where theybelieved treasure to be buried. It should be noted that this is six years afterthe Book of Mormon was first published. Joseph Smith was already the Prophet,had already founded a new religion based on revelations inscribed on goldenplates, and was a well-known figure in American religion by that time. Theevidence shows that he entered Salem quietly, attempted to rent the house,failed in that, was forced to rent another close by, and conducted ceremonies todivine the location of the supposed treasure. The attempt failed, and theProphet left Salem without the gold and silver he was sure was buried there. 37That Joseph Smith should have been heavily involved in classic operations ofceremonial magic came as a shock to many Mormons and Mormon-watchers. Whileinsiders know of the quasi-Masonic nature of Mormon ritual—and, in fact, thatJoseph Smith himself was an initiated Mason by 1842—the rest of the world wasnot prepared for the revelations that he began his career as an occultist andmagician. It would take a famous murder case 38to bring this news to publicattention, and even then the emphasis would be that Smith and his band practiceda form of American “folk magic” that was prevalent in the country at the time,and that they should not be censured or criticized for what was, in reality, apopular pastime among Americans.To equate the formulas of ceremonial magic in such famous grimoires as Barrett’sThe Magus with “folk magic,” however, is naïve. If ceremonial magic is “folkmagic,” then what is the alternative form of magic? The fact that “commonpeople” bought sorcerers’ workbooks and tried to practice the confusing andoften bowdlerized rituals they found therein does not mean that these practicesthemselves were “folk magic,” but only that the folk were practicing them. Thisis perhaps more a reflection of the influence of the publishing industry uponAmerican mystical and religious sensibilities than it is motive for acharacterization of these practices as folk magic.For these early Americans—white, descendants of various European nationalities,whose forebears went back only a few generations before they could be traced tothe ships that brought them from England, Holland, France, and othercountries—were not “folk” in the ordinary sense of the word. There was noindigenous folk magic in America because there were no indigenous folk, asidefrom the Native American population whose religious and occult practices werelargely unknown or—as in the case with Cotton Mather and his writings—largelymisunderstood. American folk magic—as it is interpreted by historians—is theresult of European systems of belief transplanted to American shores, either byactive practitioners of these systems or by the printed word. And these were notfolk systems, but elaborate series of rituals based on the works of educatedmystics, cabalists, philosophers and magicians. In fact, an occultist wouldsay—and with some justification—that it was the imperfect understanding of theseprocesses that would lead to the murder of Joseph Smith himself by an angry mobin Carthage, Illinois in 1847.The story of Joseph Smith, the golden plates, the Angel Moroni, the Book ofMormon and the creation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS)has been covered by many other historians and biographers, so I will give only ashort synopsis here as it relates to this study. The occult aspects are coveredin depth by Professor Quinn, and elsewhere as noted below.Joseph Smith, Jr. was born on December 23, 1805 in the small town of Sharon,Vermont to a strange family that included his father, Joseph Smith, Sr., who wassomething of a wizard and ceremonial magician, a man given to drawing magiccircles in the earth with a sword and divining for hidden treasure with adiviner’s rod and seer stone, and his mother, who was involved in her own occultpractices, and an aunt that married an alchemist. The fact of his birth on (orabout) the winter solstice must have given his family some cause for rejoicing,as it is an auspicious day, and almost Christmas as well. They must have thoughtthat their son was destined for great things, as indeed fortune tellersconsulted about the boy’s future predicted he would be.But he was, in fact, a barefoot farm boy for most of his early life; hedeveloped a knack for treasure-seeking and would assist his father in attemptsto find gold and precious stones buried underground. This was a strangeoccupation for a young boy, especially in light of the fact that treasure wasrarely, if ever, discovered. What did transpire, however, would produce muchmore than buried treasure; for as the young Joseph Smith spent day after daytrying to contact spirits and gaze into magic stones in the fruitless attempt touncover buried wealth, he was opening himself up to other influences, otherforces. The treasure-seeking escapades were a kind of ad hoc initiatory programfor Joseph Smith, and he began to see—not treasure, but visions.This is the point at which various influences come together in a single personand produce unbelievable results, far in excess of what would ordinarily bepredicted for a young farm boy from a bizarre background, living close topoverty, far from any city or center of education, cultural stimulation orsophistication of any kind. In fact, this is the type of family and backgroundthat we might associate with that of the serial killer or mass murderer. Afterall, some of our most famous killers—Charles Manson, Henry Lee Lucas, OtisToole, Arthur Shawcross—all came from a similar background and circumstances, aswell as many not so famous, such as Bobby Joe Long. David Berkowitz claimed tohear voices telling him to kill; Joseph Smith claimed to hear voices telling himto renew Christianity.Whether or not his father truly believed he would ever find gold and treasureusing the rituals of ceremonial magic, what can be assumed as a relativecertainty is that his young son believed in it wholeheartedly. After all, hisparents seemed to be firm believers and they were religious people as well, forwhom their occult practices were perceived as complementary—rather than inopposition—to their Christian faith. In fact, Joseph Smith, Jr. would have beenused as a seer by his father. The requirements for divining by use of spirits inthe old books specified that a young child be used to gaze into the shew stoneor crystal, as such a child was presumed to have led a chaste life and be purein thought, thus permitting him or her easier access to the spirit world.Joseph took this responsibility very seriously. He heard of a young woman with aseer stone (a type of rock used as a crystal ball, placed in a hat and gazed atfor long periods of time), who had good results in divining hidden things. Hespent a lot of time trying to learn the art of gazing from her, and eventuallyused these practices to discover the existence of his own seer stone, revealedto him in a vision as being buried beneath a certain tree or bush. Smithfollowed the instructions in his vision, proceeded to the tree and dug up thestone.As time went on, both Smiths—pere et fils—would become involved in variousrituals of ceremonial magic to the extent that they began to acquire acollection of books and paraphernalia that would be familiar to anyone dabblingin occult practices today. One of the most popular occult textbooks of that timewas Francis Barrett’s The Magus, which is a compendium of magical belief,invocations, occult diagrams and rituals that is as well known today as it wastwo hundred years ago, and which has been reprinted many times in the pastthirty years. It is a hefty volume, and covers everything from planetary magicto divination to ritual invocations. Anyone examining the rituals of thenineteenth century English occult lodge—The Golden Dawn—will find many of thesame seals, symbols and diagrams used by both Joseph Smith in 1820 and MacGregorMathers and Aleister Crowley in 1900… and by modern occult and witchcraftorganizations in the United States, Europe, Latin America and Australia today.In fact, much of the information contained in The Magus is a summary of occultrituals from the seventeenth century and earlier. Those individuals credited byDame Frances Yates for contributing to Renaissance magic—Cornelius Agrippa andPico della Mirandola, among others—can be found haunting the pages of FrancisBarrett’s monumental work.In fact there is a continuum of practice and belief going back in time more thantwo thousand years that runs parallel to the mainstream histories ofChristianity, Judaism and Islam in the West, a continuum of magic and sorcery: abelief in the possibility of the manipulation of hidden powers by ordinarymortals, provided that they only have the technological information at hand, andthe right equipment. It is actually a very scientific attitude towardsunderstanding and working with cosmic principles, contrary to the opinions ofskeptics and historians. It is a technology that was designed to extend thecapability of a person’s five normal senses into a sixth realm: a technologythat acted as a machine to fine tune the powers of the mind. This technology isso consistent in its general terms and practices that a magician of today canlook upon the texts and instruments of his or her counterpart of two thousandyears ago and figure out what they were up to. Furthermore, the systems are sointernally consistent that we can duplicate these rituals exactly in every wayand gradually come to an understanding of how they were expected to work, anunderstanding probably far in excess of what Joseph Smith could be expected tohave, as the studies of psychology, psychobiology, and biochemistry were nowherenear as advanced then as they are today. Whereas modern histories of sciencegrudgingly and somewhat sarcastically give credit to the alchemists of old forhaving—usually, according to these historians, by “accident”—created thefundamentals of chemistry, no one credits the ceremonial magicians for theircontribution (however “accidental”) to modern knowledge concerning psychologyand psychobiology.The tradition in which the Smiths were working is in the mainstream ofceremonial magic, and its rudiments can be studied today in works by IsraelRegardie, MacGregor Mathers, A.E. Waite, Aleister Crowley and many others. Infact, Waite’s book—The Book of Ceremonial Magic, sometimes titled The Book ofBlack Magic and Pacts—is a worthy competitor to Francis Barrett’s volume, andwas a familiar sight in Western occult circles in the 1960s and 1970s. Thesymbols, magic squares and invocations found therein can be traced back to theGreater and Lesser Keys of Solomon, the Enchiridion of Pope Leo, the Grimoire ofPope Honorious, and other famous magic textbooks of the seventeenth andeighteenth centuries. They are the physical remnants of a stream of occultpractice and belief known as “Christian Cabala,” which is an amalgam of Jewishmystical beliefs and texts with corresponding Christian and Islamic input. Theattitude of occultists has usually been very pragmatic and open-minded when itcomes to the practices and “discoveries” of occultists of other faiths, muchmore so than the true believers of any one faith who find competing faithsanathema, and their competitors deserving of murder.Christian Cabala came to America with some of the earliest settlers. A famousGerman mystic, Johannes Kelpius, settled at the Wissahickon River nearPhiladelphia with his band of Pietist brothers—where they practiced astrology,astronomy magic and alchemy—in 1694, only two years after the Salem trials. Theywere a millennialist cult, strictly 39in number (no more, no less) and watchedthe skies carefully for a sign of the end of the world.The Ephrata community, also in Pennsylvania, had its origins with the Kelpiusgroup (known as the “Monks of the Wissahickon”) and was similarly famous for itsoccult practices, which included ceremonial magic, astrology, astronomy, alchemyand Rosicrucian studies and practices. The Rosicrucians themselves became knownas a result of the publication of the Fama Fraternitatis in 1614, in which—amongother things—they claimed to have their origin with the mysterious ChristianRosenkreutz, a philosopher and mystic who had traveled Europe and the MiddleEast in search of esoteric wisdom and who had formed the Rosicrucian brotherhoodas a repository of occult teachings: a secret society whose members would beunknown to the rest of humanity even as they labored on humanity’s behalf. Afurther publica-tion—The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz—placed themystical tradition of the Rosicrucians firmly in the alchemical and qabalisticcamp, in a treatise that borders on Hindu Tantrism.As Professor Quinn points out in his magnum opus, a wide variety of occultliterature was available to Joseph Smith, even in his otherwise remote villageof Palmyra, New York (near Canandaigua). The works of Agrippa, Barrett, Matherand others were routinely stocked in bookstores in the region, and lists ofoccult books either in print or available for sale at second-hand ran to over100 pages. 42 America at that time—so soon after the War of 1812—was in themidst of a religious and mystical revival, a fact that is often ignored ormisunderstood by general historians of the American experience. And in the midstof this religious revival was a fear of secret societies and their presumed illintentions towards the young Republic. Chief among these societies was, ofcourse, the Freemasons.The Anti-Masonic movement in America was in its heyday at the time that JosephSmith was searching for buried treasure using ceremonial magic. The kidnap andalleged murder of William Morgan in 1826 triggered an anti-Masonic backlash inwestern New York where the Smith farm was located. Morgan was a Mason (actually,his status within the Masonic organization was somewhat in doubt) who planned toreveal the secret rituals of Freemasonry in a book he was writing, contracted toa small publisher; as a result, it seems that some Masons felt it was imperativeto mete out the justice specified in those very rituals. The printing office wasfire-bombed and Morgan was kidnapped, that much seems certain. He was admittedlytaken by Masons to Fort Niagara, New York where he was kept imprisoned for sometime. After that, reports vary as to what eventually became of him. A yearlater, a body washed up near Fort Niagara that was eventually identified asMorgan, even though there was controversy over this fact as well. In any event,it was characterized as a cult killing, not the first in America and certainlynot the last, but it was very visible and the results were sweeping.Masons were forced to explain themselves, and explain their history as asociety, in ways they had not anticipated. Masons were believed to be behindsecret movements to control the operations of government and, naturally, thedreaded Illuminati would be invoked as an example of this perfidy. AnAnti-Masonic Convention was held in Philadelphia on September 11, 1830 which wasattended by such political celebrities as William H. Seward and Thaddeus Stevens(founders of the Republican Party after their break with the Whigs, the formerof course also responsible for the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867) andFrancis Granger, an enemy of Seward in other things (notably on the slaveryissue) but a fellow-traveler when it came to the anti-Masonic cause. In theensuing hysteria Masonic membership dropped drastically; many lodges wereclosed, virtually overnight, and Masonry became a campaign issue in the UnitedStates for decades. The 1830s and 1840s saw the growth of an anti-Masonicpolitical party, as well as general paranoia over the perceived penetration ofthe Masonic Society by the political and anti-Christian elements of theIlluminati, thus rendering the Masonic Society little more than an “outer court”for the inner workings of a diabolical European organization with designs on thenew American republic.The Bavarian Illuminati have been covered in so many places in so many ways thatit is probably not worthwhile to describe them in detail here. Suffice it to saythat the Order was created by one Adam Weishaupt, a professor of theology at theUniversity of Ingolstadt, Bavaria on May 1, 1776, as a kind of super-Masonrywhich attracted many of the intelligentsia of the day. It was the politicalmachinations of the Illuminati that lead to its eventual suppression by theBavarian authorities, but the damage had been done: a secret mysticalbrotherhood, bound by blood oaths and practicing strange rites, had beenplotting against the government. It is perhaps no mere coincidence thatWeishaupt’s Order was established only a few months before the signing of theAmerican Declaration of Independence. It has been blamed for everything from theFrench Revolution to the creation of the Federal Reserve banking system. A trueFrankenstein’s monster, born in the same town as the fictional Doctor’s ghastlyexperiment at creating life… and the same town where, eventually, Germanautomaker (and erstwhile warplane manufacturer) BMW would set up shop. As noted,the Illuminati were blamed for the French Revolution, among other things; evenWinston Churchill would one day cite the Illuminati as a dread presence in worldaffairs. 40None of this stood in the way of Joseph Smith’s attraction towards Freemasonry,however, and he eventually became a Mason in March of 1842 despite the generaloutrage over the society. Both admirers and detractors of Mormonism agree thatmuch of the LDS Church’s ritual and priesthood structure mimics that of Smith’sMasonic involvement. Why he would choose to become a Mason in the atmosphere ofalarm and paranoia that surrounded any mention of Masonry in the America of thattime is open to conjecture; probably he saw Freemasonry as being sympathetic tohis own ideas and background: the arcane rituals, the free-thinking atmosphere,the cherishing of a “secret history” of the world would all have been attractiveto Joseph Smith. In addition, it probably gave him a sense of belonging to asociety of people who would respect his higher intentions and his intellect at atime when Mormonism was being viewed as a heretical and possibly dangerous cult.But in 1823, Joseph Smith had not yet founded a religion. He was a young mandesperately seeking buried treasure. On the auspicious day of September 22, 1823he had a vision of an Angel.It was the autumnal equinox, the first day of the zodiacal sign of Libra, and hehad repaired to a hill near his home late that night and performed the ritualsnecessary to invoke spiritual forces. He was gratified to obtain a vision of theAngel Moroni, who directed him to where a certain treasure was buried.Quinn tells us that “Moroni” as a surname meant “dark complexion” or “swarthy,”which reminds us at once of the Black Man or the Man In Black of the Salem witchtrials. 41This did not necessarily mean an African, but could have referred toany person of swarthy appearance: Native Americans, Meditteraneans, Levantines,etc.Smith rushed to the spot indicated by Moroni and began digging. He found thegold plates but, ignoring the Angel’s demand that he take the plates and seek nofurther, he could not resist looking into the hole he had dug to see if therewas anything else. Enraged, the Angel took back the plates and told Smith if hewanted to see them again he should return the following year on the same day andat the same time, and should bring his older brother.Chagrined, he returned to his home and related some of what had transpired.And the following year, he tried again. The problem, however, was that his olderbrother had died a few months after the first attempt at the plates. Smithrepaired to the same spot at the same time as indicated by Moroni, and Moroniput him off again. All in all it would take three more years before—on September22, 1827—he would finally be able to see the plates again and to begintranscribing what has become the Book of Mormon.The method of transcribing the plates—which, according to the story, werewritten in a kind of Egyptian hieroglyphic—would seem odd to many Americans butfamiliar to occultists and those familiar with occult literature. Smith wouldplace his “shew stone” or “seer stone” in his hat and then bring his face intothe hat so that no light would enter his field of vision. There, with his handson his knees and staring into his hat, he would begin to dictate the pages ofthe Book.This method is called “skrying” and was used by Elizabethan astrologer,occultist and spy John Dee in the sixteenth century, as well as by legions offortune tellers, crystal gazers, magicians and soothsayers for millennia. JohnDee, in fact, received his famous system of Enochian magic in roughly thismanner. His shew stone—a piece of what appears to be polished Aztec obsidian—canbe found at the British Museum.Many devout Mormons have a problem with this story, as it makes Joseph Smithappear to be little more than a sorcerer or wizard. This is certainly the pointof view one takes today, looking back on events that occurred nearly two hundredyears ago, but it is perhaps slightly in error. The practices of ceremonialmagic, skrying, divining, and all the rest were taking place side-by-side withintense religious feeling. Magic was believed to be an extension of religion,and not in opposition to it. Thus, we have many clergymen, scientists, andpolitical leaders involved in those days in practices that can only seemunsavory today. To be sure, many strict fundamentalists opposed the practice ofmagic, fearing that it would lead to the excesses of witchcraft anddemon-worship. But to the farmer, the villager, the blacksmith, these practiceswere based on a system of knowledge that was gleaned from the stars and thephases of the moon, things of nature, things that regulated their lives anywayand told them when to plant and when to harvest. It would be difficult to tell afarmer to ignore the phases of the moon, and to place no stock in the almanacsthat had become part of his life at least since the time of Benjamin Franklinand “Poor Richard.”Indeed, as Professor Valerie I.J. Flint reminds us—when discussing the role ofSimon Magus in early Christian literature and his widely reported magical warswith Saint Peter—in The Rise of Magic in Early Medieval Europe,Some supernatural exercises are neither admissible nor praiseworthy; but someare both…. Magical ability is expected of a great religious leader; objectionsarise only when he uses it in unacceptable ways and for unacceptable ends. 42And again,The harnessing of magical abilities to selfish ends renders the practice ofmagic wholly objectionable. …but magical powers of a wide variety emerge fromthe Simon literature as legitimate, provided only that they are employed forclear benefit of human beings. They may even be necessary to humanity.43(emphasis added)“They may even be necessary to humanity.” We will come back to this concept abit later on, but at the moment we can summarize our findings as follows: thatthe origins of Mormonism lie in the most blatant practice of ritual ceremonialmagic, a practice that was never denied or abandoned by either Smith or hisproteges, as we can see by Quinn’s pioneering study; that this blend ofChristian religion and European ceremonial magic was common in America at thattime (Quinn goes so far as to call it “folk magic”); and, finally and“coincidentally,” that we have ancestors of the Smith family itself deeplyinvolved in the Salem witch trials.And we have Joseph Smith himself, years later, running for President of theUnited States and imprisoned in Carthage, Illinois in 1844. By this time he hasbecome a Mason, has formed his new religion, has become the commander of a hugestate militia (the largest in the country at the time), has become mayor of oneof Illinois’s largest communities, has continued the quest for buried treasures(both of the material and of the spiritual worlds, we assume, and at least onesuch quest took him back to his ancestral home in Salem, Massachusetts), hasmarried numerous times, has established temples where his new religion couldthrive… and, in a frenzy of fear and paranoia at the growing power of thislatter-day Prophet, he is murdered by an angry mob on June 27.He was wearing his Jupiter amulet at the time of his death, a photo of which canbe seen in Quinn’s book.44It was incorrectly engraved.The Hebrew characters on top of the magic square of Jupiter in the original—tobe found in The Magus and other places—reads “AL AB,” which means “The Father”and which is a holy name of Jupiter, which was Smith’s ruling planet.Unfortunately for Smith, his talisman is missing the final “B” character. Thus,the characters are A. L A, which in Hebrew means “but” or “only” or “except,” apreposition instead of the Divine Name of Jupiter. As any authority will tellyou, one must be faithful to every letter and mark in a grimoire and not editthe words, the signs or seals lest disaster befall. The other characters of theseal are correct, with one word being “ABA” or “Father” and the other “YHPYAL”or “Johphiel,” which is the “Intelligence of Jupiter.” With AL AB reduced to thepreposition ALA, we are tempted to read the seal as “Father except Johphiel,”certainly a distressing combination implying that Johphiel is nowhere present.The word “YHPYAL” according to Hebrew Qabala (cabala, kabbala, etc.) adds to thenumber 136, the same number on the seal of Jupiter which is a magic square, thesum of whose numbers in any row add to 136. The word “ABA” adds to four. Theword “ALA” adds to thirty-two. It should have been “AL AB” which would haveresulted in thirty-four, for a grand total of 174. With the error in AL AB andreducing it to ALA, the total is 172.According to Liber 777, which is a famous compendium of qabalistic numerologybegun by the Golden Dawn and later compiled and printed by Aleister Crowley, weread that the value of the number 174 will give us “Torches” and “Splendor eiper circuitum,” a pleasant enough attribution. The valuation for 172, however,gives us “Cut, divided” and “The heel, the end.” 45And so it was for Joseph Smith.One is tempted, in the light of Smith’s violent end at the hands of a mob, tolook at his death in another, even more poetic, way. He was, after all, thedescendent of men who, at Salem, accused women of witchcraft and saw themhanged. Like something out of Nathaniel Hawthorne (himself a Salem native), thesins of the father were visited on his children, and his children’s children.Perhaps, with a bit of literary license and a nod at Hawthorne, we may say ofJoseph Smith that “God gave him blood to drink.”Mormonism did not end with him, of course. The banner of leadership was taken upby Brigham Young, and the flight west begun. Eventually the Mormons would settlein what is now Utah, and make their headquarters at the side of the Great SaltLake. But it would be years before Mormonism was viewed as respectable andconservative. Polygamy was one issue, of course, and the Mormons were forced toabandon the practice (at least officially and formally). But there had beenviolent confrontations between Mormons and non-Mormons, and even between Mormonsthemselves. For years they were perceived as a cult, just as David Koresh’sexperiment in Waco or Jim Jones’ failed commune in the jungles of Guyana. SirArthur Conan Doyle is perhaps the best-known representative of this point ofview. His very first Sherlock Holmes story—in which Watson and Holmes meet—isabout the Mormons, with shadings of European occultism, secret societies and, ofcourse, murder. A Study In Scarlet has a long, set-piece study of Mormonism, asConan Doyle understood it and as it would have been familiar to his readers whenpublished in 1887. Of course, for Conan Doyle’s English readers, Mormonism wasprobably just another example of American foolishness at best, or sinister cultbehavior at worse. Yet we see in this famous story an introduction to SherlockHolmes, to Doctor Watson, to the concept of crime detection using the powers ofdeduction based on available evidence, to the paranormal, to murder, to cults,and to a specifically American cult. With the retrospect possible after over onehundred years since the initial publication of the story, we can see how reallyremarkable is this first attempt at popular crime fiction. It wove together manyof the threads that would interest Conan Doyle for years to come and, in its ownway, is concerned with themes that are as modern as today’s tabloid headlinesand trash-talk reality shows.That Holmes and Watson are obviously the prototypes for Mulder and Scullyrespectively of television’s X-Files fame needs no further explanation beyondthis: both pairs are involved in crime detection, one is a doctor who recordshis/her observations after each case, the other is a visionary, an eccentric whopursues his own peculiar modus operandi in the effort to capture the evil-doers,and both have a Dr. Moriarty in their past: in Holmes’s case, it is the evilgenius who is at the heart of all crime in London if not all of Europe, apersonal nemesis who nearly succeeds in killing him; in Mulder’s case, it is thegovernment itself—or some frantic faction thereof—which is responsible for thekidnapping or abduction of his sister, and which nearly succeeds in killing him.The influence of Mormonism does not end here, however. It comes up again andagain in the course of American history, as we discover the Mormon relationshipto Howard Hughes, and Mormon involvement in the Watergate scandal.46 This is notan attempt to smear the Mormon church or the Mormon organization in any way;this is an attempt, however, to examine how religious and occult beliefs haveinfluenced—and, at times, controlled—political events in America, and Mormonismhas a lot to offer us by way of example.Today, many Mormons are conscious that there is an effort underway to discredittheir belief by means of proving that many deeply-held convictions are based ondeception or blatant lies. Attempts to conceal Joseph Smith’s magical practicesare only one alleged example; another is the assertion of the actual existenceof the golden plates from which the Book of Mormon was transcribed, and of thehistorical accuracy (or lack of accuracy) afforded by the analysis of thosetranscriptions.In the 1940s, a devout Mormon began an archaeological quest to prove, once andfor all, the literal truth of the Book of Mormon. Thomas Stuart Ferguson, alawyer from California, decided to prove that the historical elements containedwithin the Book of Mormon were verifiable. He wished to prove that the Book wastrue and, therefore, that the religion was true by extension. Since Smith hadreceived the golden plates from an Angel, and since Smith had not visited thelands described in the Book of Mormon, it was logical to assume that if the Bookwas correct, then Smith’s angelic experiences and visions of the plates and theensuing transcriptions were all true, or at least proof of extraordinaryspiritual powers or gifts.The widespread belief in some Mormon circles at the time was that the landsreferred to in the Book were located somewhere in Central America or Mexico.Ferguson felt similarly inclined, and undertook expeditions to these areas inanticipation of discovering physical evidence for the geography outlined in theBook. After several false starts, Ferguson slowly came to believe that he waswasting his time. The discovery of some Aztec, Maya and Olmec sites that seemedto parallel descriptions in the Book were later invalidated when it was shownthat these civilizations (or, at least, the specific sites referenced) came intobeing much later than the chronology given in the Book.Archaeologists were quick to point out that there was no evidence to support aclaim that Near Eastern groups had established communities in the New World,that there was no linguistic or other cultural evidence to support anycross-fertilization of Levantine and Ancient Mexican religious or racial groups,and that the Book of Mormon added nothing to what archaeologists knew of Aztec,Mayan, Toltec, Olmec or any other ancient New World civilizations. If the Bookof Mormon was true in any historical sense, the basic premise seemed to be inerror: the events described could not have taken place in Mexico or CentralAmerica.The last straw came in November 1967 with the revelation that certain Egyptianpapyri—which had been in Smith’s possession and from which he “translated” theBook of Abraham (included in the LDS scripture The Pearl of Great Price)—hadbeen discovered. Ferguson was eager to have the papyri translated by non-MormonEgyptologists. When they were, the documents were shown to be versions of theEgyptian Book of the Dead and had nothing at all to do with any Mormonscripture.Ferguson died on March 16, 1983, of a heart attack while playing tennis. By thattime he had given up all hope of proving the historical claims of the Mormonscriptures, but had reconciled himself to the fellowship of the Church and anembrace of its moral principles. He admitted that Joseph Smith was a “smartfellow,” but stopped short of calling him a charlatan or a con-man.47From the first voyage of Columbus to the land of the Arawaks on a quest for afast route to Jerusalem; from the witchcraft trials of Salem, Massachusettsinvolving Arawak descendant Tituba and later manifesting in the magic andoccultism of Salem descendant Joseph Smith; from European mysticism to American“folk magic” and stories of murderous cults and demon worshippers in theseventeenth and eighteenth centuries; from all this we can begin to perceive adifferent sort of American history. As Americans, we have been moving too fastand forgetting too much to realize that we have a unique cultural contributionto make, one that unites religion with mysticism at the very bedrock of humanexperience… and then transforms this alchemical tincture into a political andscientific Philosopher’s Stone capable of causing tremendous change in the humanpsyche. Such an effort was, indeed, attempted by some of the best minds of thelast generation.Thus the story of the Book of Mormon is not the end of our quest, because itposes more questions than it answers. What did Joseph Smith see in the woodsthat night in 1823? What was the actual source of the Book of Mormon if it was,indeed, a total fabrication? Were there any advanced civilizations inAmerica—other than those in Central America—which predated Columbus and whichwould have fit the Mormon chronicles of early American settlement?Most importantly of all, for the next phase of our research: who built theAshland mounds?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 H.P.

This conspiracyplayed a definitely recognizable role in the tragedy of the French Revolution.It has been the main-spring of every subversive movement in the 19th Century…”Sparticus-Weishaupt is, of course, Adam Weishaupt, the founder of theIlluminati, whose name in the Order was “Spartacus.” George Washington alsoreferences the Illuminati in one of his letters: “It was not my intention todoubt that the doctrine of the Illuminati and the principles of Jacobinism hadnot spread to the United States. On the contrary, no one is more satisfied ofthis fact than I am.” Washington and Churchill thus give us two completelydifferent value judgments—one from the revolutionary and fiercely independentColonies and one from the voice of the Colonizer—on the existence and purpose ofthe Illuminati.41 Quinn, op. cit., p. 15542 Valerie I.J.

The body had been savagely attacked, and bore nineteen separatestab wounds. The attack was so passionate, so bestial, that the murder weapon—akitchen knife—was still in the body, pinning it to the floor.It might have been a love affair gone terribly wrong. People from Ashland,Kentucky have been known to get emotional, even irrational, over love and thepromises of love and the mistaken assumptions of love and its follies, like atown out of a country and western song.Or it might have been something else. Something more sinister. A warning, borneof a hatred so deep and a malevolence so strong that slain flesh and spilledblood were only symbols—mere tokens—of its power.The victim was a nobody. An ex-con, once convicted of writing bad checks. A mandown on his luck, working for a trucking company.He had been stabbed in a fury of nineteen slashing, slivering strokes—in a woodframe house in the middle of the night or the early hours of the morning on aside street in a small country town—and no one heard a thing.The perpetrator left no clues, no identifiable fingerprints, nothing. The bodymight have lain there for days, except that the victim’s co-worker stopped by tosee why he hadn’t shown up for work that morning. The body was found. The policewere called.The officer who responded to that call and who was the first policeman at thescene is today the Chief of Police of Ashland, Kentucky. The murder took placein 1969. He told me it remains unsolved—and the murder open on the books—to thisday. 3 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos351506]The victim’s name was Darwin Scott. He was the brother of one Colonel Scott.Colonel Scott had been sued—successfully—for paternity of a boy, one “No NameMaddox,” by a girlfriend and sometime prostitute, Kathleen Maddox. No NameMaddox would soon be known by another name. Charles Manson.Darwin Scott was Charles Manson’s uncle.His murder took place in May. In August, the Sharon Tate and LaBianca murderswould occur in Los Angeles. In December, Charles Manson would be charged alongwith several of his associates for those crimes. Crimes committed with knives.Crimes that turned beautiful Hollywood people into corpses, beautiful Hollywoodhomes into abattoirs awash in gore. Manson would be convicted of those crimes.But no one was ever arrested for the murder of Darwin Scott, his uncle.> MANHATTAN TRANSFERNixon was president, and the Vietnam War was in full swing. The Tet Offensive ofJanuary 1968 had occurred the previous year, and Walter Cronkite had bitchedabout it on network TV. The Days of Rage had flamed in Chicago, and Robert F.Kennedy was assassinated, Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, MarcusGarvey was assassinated, Malcolm X was assassinated, the Weathermen wereplotting against banks and Army recruiting stations, and I was on the telephone,talking to someone at the headquarters of the Presbyterian Church in New YorkCity, when I heard a blast and the tinkling sound of breaking glass as my partyshouted at me, “There’s been a bomb! I have to hang up!” The Weathermen hadblown up a brownstone in Greenwich Village in Manhattan, across the street fromthe church. It was an accident, a bomb-making enterprise gone wrong. It would beyears before one of the surviving Weathermen would give herself up to theauthorities.But still we had not heard of Charles Manson. That would happen in December of1969. I turned 19 the day he was arrested: that tiny terrorist dragged fumingand sneering from a crawl space under a wooden cabinet in the desert, but wewould not know that he was the supposed mastermind of the Tate/LaBianca killingsfor some weeks yet. And he would not be convicted for many months more, afterone of his own attorneys died under mysterious circumstances. By that time, Ihad taken a job with a lingerie company in Manhattan’s Garment District.Stardust was founded by a man named Brandt. His son, Steven Brandt, was aHollywood gossip columnist at the time of the Manson killings, and one of thewitnesses at Sharon Tate’s marriage to Roman Polanski. He would return to NewYork in panic, phone up his friends at Andy Warhol’s Factory, and then commitsuicide in a hotel room before his friend Ultra Violet could get there in time.He thought there had been a hit list, and he thought he was on it. All becauseof the Manson Family. Stardust. The company’s Los Angeles location appeared in aJack Lemmon film, Save The Tiger.Other people connected to Manson and his ad hoc cult exploded out of Californiain the aftermath of the Tate/LaBianca killings, and wound up dead—murders orsuicides—all over the world. This would tend to support the theory that therewas more to the Manson “Family” than sex, drugs and rock and roll. But at 19, Iwas more concerned about earning a paycheck from my first real job than I wasabout the inner workings of a madman’s fantasies in California, a place I hadnever been. I was also worried about Vietnam, and the possibility that I wouldwind up slogging through the tall grass, humping a BAR and sweating tears andblood in the tropical jungles.At Stardust, I was befriended by a former model, a tall, exotic beauty with awarped sense of humor. We got along well, and she invited me several times tothe apartment she shared with her musician boyfriend. We talked about a lot ofthings, typical New York topics: music and movies and books. We rarely discussedpolitics, but when I asked her about her former life as a model, she revealedher previous connections to people involved with the Howard Hughes organization.She would tell me that Hughes had been kidnapped.A few months later, Clifford Irving would tell the world that he had beensecretly interviewing Hughes and would write the only authorized biography ofthe hermit billionaire. It was eventually denounced as a hoax, but under verybizarre circumstances: Hughes holding a press conference by telephone, hismetallic voice denouncing the Irving book from a small box in the center of theroom.I urged the model to come forward and tell what she knew. Horrified, sherefused. She said to do that would put her life in danger. We never discussed itagain.Hughes. Nixon. Vietnam. Manson. Hollywood.Then the Craig Karpel series in the Village Voice, and it all came together.And there were more revelations.Richard Helms admitted there had been something going on at the CIA calledMK-ULTRA, which was an attempt to probe the secrets of the human mind in aneffort to produce the perfect assassin and to counteract the enemy’sbrainwashing efforts.Then there were the Son of Sam killings. The Jonestown massacre. John Lennonmurdered by a man holding a copy of Catcher in the Rye, a man who had prayed toSatan only hours before.The bodies—and the cults—were piling up. And my research was outrunning me.Every time I thought I had enough to start work on the book, more bizarrestories appeared linking government agencies and psychological operations, cultinfiltrations, organized crime, banking scandals, serial murder, drugtrafficking…There was the Propaganda Due scandal in Italy. A Masonic society involved withassassinations and terror bombings, Latin American dictators and neo-Nazis,linked to the Church.Then there was Iran-Contra. The BCCI scandal. Koreagate. It just never stopped.And then there was the book by respected historian, Ladislas Farago, Aftermath,about escaped Nazi war criminals living in South America. Farago’s most shockingrevelation—to me—was not his claim that Martin Bormann had escaped and wasliving in Brazil, but the fact that the Roman Catholic Church had beenintimately involved in helping the Nazis escape to South America, evendisguising some as priests. It was that book that sent me to Chile in 1979during the height of the Pinochet regime and martial law, while doing researchon the Nazi use of occult and mystical ideas, a trip that contributed to myfirst book,Unholy Alliance. 4 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos351812]I had originallyintended Unholy Alliance to be only a chapter of the present book, but as usualthe research outran me. In this case, however, I was not able to outrun theresearch: I was detained by German nationals at the infamous Colonia Dignidad inChile and only allowed to leave the torture and interrogation center when it wasdetermined that killing me would be too risky and would perhaps endanger theColony’s most esteemed guests, renegade Nazis on the run from justice.But it wasn’t only about government conspiracies and cover-ups. This book becamea personal and a spiritual quest as well. Links and connections took me to theDead Sea Scrolls and questions about the legitimacy of all the teaching to whichI had been exposed as a young Roman Catholic in New York and Chicago. Books likeHoly Blood, Holy Grail purported to give a completely different history of theorigins of Christianity and specifically of the Catholic Church. Did Jesus havea family? Are his descendants living in Europe today? And what about the Gospelof St. Thomas (so prominent in the recent horror film,Stigmata) ? Does itdeserve a place in the Christian Bible, as respected as the other four Gospels?Was it suppressed by the Church? If so, why?And, finally, what about the reality of spiritual experience? Are saints andmadmen equally deluded? Are witches’ sabbats the same as alien abductions? Isexorcism merely a form of psychotherapy, or is it something more? Something…other? What is evil? Can everything we experience as human beings be explainedaway by a tranquil, Carl Sagan-like belief in science? Was Carl comforted in hisfinal moments by reciting the Second Law of Thermodynamics… or by a rememberedprayer of childhood? Is science a “candle in the dark”?… Or is it simplywhistling in the dark?If Church and State are not separate in reality, in the world of action, thenwhere does Science stand? Is it an outgrowth of the Church, and a tool of theState? Or does the answer lie in the cults, the secret societies, the occultorders of yesterday and today? What did the CIA learn during its longinvestigation of psychology and the paranormal? Why did they shred all thedocumentation of this that they could find?These and similar, equally disturbing questions kept me awake at odd hours ofthe night since that month in 1975 when I read the Craig Karpel series. AfterBendix, I had a series of jobs in New York that eventually led me to travelextensively throughout the United States and the world. I’ve spent a lot of timein South America, the Caribbean, Europe, Australia and especially in Asia, wherethe line between religion and politics is very fine indeed, and sometimes—suchas in Indonesia or Malaysia—non-existent. I visited temples, shrines, mosques,churches, hounforts, cemeteries, séances… and archives, libraries, documentcollections, government offices, factories, military bases, and prisons. I cameto know—often by utter and complete accident—many figures and organizations thatappear in the pages that follow. I discovered the FBI file on my late father; Iworked with a famous spy, a former colleague of E. Howard Hunt and employee ofthe Hughes public relations firm, Robert Mullen. And some clergymen I knewnumbered suspected JFK co-conspirator David Ferrie among their hierarchy.I finally decided, then, to visit the place where my story begins. The town thatCharles Manson called home for the first years of his life. The town where hisuncle had been murdered, by person or persons unknown. I had to find some way tobring all this information together, to connect it in some logical fashion, tomake it make sense. There was no linear chronology, no neat historical pattern.Rather, the information I collated was so intertwined that it appeared more likea spiderweb than a timeline. People who should not have been connected, were.Events that should not have been connected touched each other through improbablelinks. How was this possible? How did it happen that when I pulled the stringsof my own life history, I found tendrils reaching to the farthest ends ofassassination and conspiracy?I hoped the answer would somehow lie in Ashland, Kentucky.There is an ancient America that lurks beneath the threshold of our collective,corn-fed consciousness. We see it all the time. It surrounds us with its feralglow; we have learned to fear it in the dark without learning what it is, whatit means. It’s not just the woods out back, the lonely desert trails, the virginmountains where we lose our Boy Scouts or survivalists in the winter snows. It’salso in the laundromats, the gas stations, the drug stores and diners.“I think you say ‘convenience store.’ We lived above it.”> —Twin Peaks 5 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos352245]It’s in our standing stones, our Anasazi ruins, our Indian burial mounds. It’sthe remains of the Old Ones, the original people, the deep ancestors of ourforgotten history, the history before Columbus that is never taught in theschools because we don’t know it ourselves… because we don’t want to know, don’twant to accept what has been proved so many times in the past: that this land ofours is haunted by the ghosts of races who lived and died on our land thousandsof years before we came, and of races we ourselves exterminated with fire andsword and virus. There were vast cities here before us, huge temples dwarfingthe Colosseum, the Parthenon, the Pyramids of Gizeh, some built long before anyof these more famous structures were even dreamed. There were Norsemen herebefore us, bringing paganism and the worship of Nordic gods. There were Irishmenhere before us, bringing a strange mixture of Catholicism and druidism, standingup their stones and sighting along the solstices years before the Nina, Pintaand Santa Maria. There were Carthaginians here before us, Phoenician traders,perhaps even Buddhists from China. All the votes aren’t in, yet. We don’t knowwhy there are stones engraved with ancient alphabets, buried in our farmland. Wedon’t know how they got there, so we file these petroglyphs along with tales ofsea serpents and great white whales… in the land of fantasy that is the bull’seye target of our scientists. And we whisper ourselves to sleep like thevoice-over on a late night talk show while the gloom gathers outside our windowsand doors and the dead Indians, the dead Phoenicians, the dead Norsemen chanttheir ancient mantras to rob us of our dreams.Welcome to American prehistory.AMERICA, B.C.There are two general approaches to the study of human habitation on the Northand South American continents before the arrival of the people we think of asNative Americans. The most accepted view is that of the “independentinventionists”: archaeologists and anthropologists who believe that bothcontinents were peopled by a race that came from Northern Asia, from what is nowRussia (or, perhaps, parts of China or even Southeast Asia according to oneschool) and who walked across the Bering Straits (when they were frozen solid)and followed the coast down Alaska and into Canada and spread out from there asfar east and south as the land mass allowed. In other words, all NativeAmericans are descendants of this group of wanderers from the frozen wastes ofSiberia—a group known as the Clovis people, from a site in western New Mexicowhere some stone spearpoints were first discovered in 1932 (and oddly enough atown named after the first Merovingian king of France). The Clovis spearpointsare believed to be representative of a purely “American” style of manufacture,and can be found throughout the Americas. (Of course, this gives rise to aquestion: If the “Clovis” people came from Siberia, why is there no evidence ofClovis points in Siberia?) Given their antiquity, the theory is that the Clovispeople were not only the first race to set foot on American soil, but are theprogenitors of all other Native Americans. Thus, the Aztecs, Incas, Mayas,Iroquois, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Hopi, Quecha, Narragansett, Pequot, Zuni and allother known “Indian” and American tribes and civilizations are directdescendants of the Clovis people.The opposing view—and one which goes in and out of fashion regularly through theyears—is that of the “diffusionists.” This theory has it that parts of North andSouth America were peopled by races from Asia, Europe and the Middle East atvarious times, people who sailed across the Atlantic from the Mediterranean orfrom the northern European coastlines of Scandinavia, France, Spain, Portugaland the British Isles, across the Pacific from Southeast Asia or the Chinesemainland, or from Polynesia. The diffusionists like to believe that some of ourmodern Native Americans are descendants of Phoenicians, Celts, Malays, Chineseand other ancient civilizations.In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a Norwegian adventurer attempted to provethat it was possible to sail across the Pacific Ocean on a raft. Thor Heyerdahlwanted to show that people from South America could have traveled to Asia (or,at least, the South Pacific) a thousand years before Columbus; and that peoplefrom Sumeria and Egypt could have sailed the Indian and Atlantic oceans inancient times. Several books (Kon Tiki and Aku Aku among them) were writtendefending this point of view and showing how Heyerdahl managed to build a raftusing local materials and sail across the seas using only the stars fornavigation. His Ra Expedition proved that one could sail across the Atlantic thesame way, always using materials and methods—including navigational methods—thatwould have been locally available at the time and place of origin. (His film ofthe Kon Tiki voyage between South America and Polynesia won a 1951 Academy Awardfor Best Documentary.) Heyerdahl’s courageous undertaking was all the rage amonglaypersons for some years, and then interest waned and we were back to wrestlingwith the Clovis theory.There are some facts, however, that are disturbing to mainstream archaeologists,who dismiss anomalies as either hoaxes or as inexplicable, preferring to acceptthe Clovis position because it’s neat and tidy. There is also a politicalproblem with diffusionism, because some believe it would devalue the NativeAmerican culture. That this is patently not the case has been verbalized againand again by some Native American diffusionists, but their words fall on deafears.6 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos352531]Question: Examination of an Egyptian mummy of the 21st Dynasty by a Germantoxicologist in 1992 shows that the body tested positive for tobacco andcocaine, products that were native only to the Americas at the time of thepharaohs.

Science assumes that these are eitherhoaxes, or somehow “anomalies” that cannot be explained… and which are thereforeput in a category of “unknowables” and left outside the mainstream discussions.Richard Rudgley in his Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age refers to theinteresting case of the Seven Sisters,10 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos354521] aconstellation—the Pleiades—that was known by that name to the ancient races ofNorth America… and Siberia… and Australia; if this is more than merely acoincidence, Rudgley points out, then it implies a common origin for the name ofthis constellation that must predate the peopling of North America as well asthat of Australia. In other words, it is evidence of a single body of knowledgethat existed more than 40,000 years ago, common to Asians and North Americanssince that time. “Most researchers tend to ignore findings as anomalous asthese,” Rudgley says, “as they simply do not fit well with generally acceptedviews.”11 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos354985]The late Harvard Professor Barry Fell did a lot to try to change that attitude,and made an excellent case for the diffusionist perspective. His research hasbeen roundly (if not soundly) attacked in recent years by the Clovis faction,much in the way Gerald Posner attacks critics of the Warren Commission. Usingselective evidence out of context and ignoring evidence that doesn’t fit in withbasic assumptions, it is possible to attack virtually everything and soundknowledgeable doing it. Of course, Fell and the diffusionists have been accusedof the same sins. The controversy has become emotional and personal at times.But the weight of diffusionist evidence is growing every year, and theimplications of it are startling and will eventually require a rewriting ofAmerican prehistory as we know it. Before we examine diffusionism in detail,though, it is worthwhile to pick up our story where we left off, with America inthe nineteenth century and an obsession with buried treasure and sacred hills.Joseph Smith called the Indian mound in upstate New York where he received thegolden plates “the Hill Cumorah,” after an incident in his own Book of Mormon.Others since Smith have tried to place Cumorah in other regions, such as CentralAmerica or Mexico, even though Smith himself referred to this gentle slope nearManchester, New York as Cumorah. What is not generally known to most Mormons isthat America during Smith’s lifetime was a hotbed of speculation about themounds.Mounds are found all over the United States, from New England to Missouri, witha few in Texas and some in Florida. There are, in fact, over 100,000 of them(and this does not count all the sacred circles and standing stones, which mostAmericans are totally unaware exist in their own country).12[../Text/ch02.html#filepos355272]Some of them are burial mounds, as can beevidenced by the skeletal remains found therein. Others are sacred sitesarranged in ways reminiscent of Stonehenge in England, mounds astronomicallyoriented towards the solstices or to the rising of some specific star. Othersstill are vast works of art, such as Serpent Mound in Adams County, Ohio, whichhas been analyzed by professionals and shown to be more than art: an artisticastronomical computer, oriented towards the solstices, the moon, the sun, andthe constellations of Draco and Ursa Major,13[../Text/ch02.html#filepos355821]consistent with a theology we can only imagine,and like those intricately engraved Persian astrolabes one sometimes finds in anantique store or a souk. Some of these Neolithic sites are mere piles of earth;others were constructed using wooden logs as a kind of infrastructure. Othersconstitute what appear to have been entire cities, with wide avenues and hugeplatform mounds enclosing areas in excess of twenty acres or more, such as“Great Hopewell Road” in Ohio, which links Newark with Chillicothe. 14[../Text/ch02.html#filepos356419]But the real mystery in the early nineteenth century was “who built the mounds,and why?”Although generally referred to as “Indian burial mounds,” it was acknowledgedthat the Indians themselves had no precise data to offer as to their origins orpurpose. When asked, the Native American elders of some tribes would refer to anolder race or tribe that had lived in the area long before their own arrival. Insome cases, there were stories of a race of the “Old Ones” or the “First People”who had lived and then disappeared ages ago. Some tribal groups occupiedearthworks and other types of fortifications that they admit they did not build,but found unoccupied, such as the Anasazi site in the American Southwest. (Theword Anasazi means “Old Ones.”) With the passage of time and a lot of digging,archaeology came up with two distinct groups of prehistoric Americans in theregion roughly from New England to the Mississippi River basin: the Adena andthe Hopewell cultures.Although even this division of two distinct groups is currently a matter forsome debate (some archaeologists entertaining the belief that they were reallythe same people) it would do us well to consider them separately for now, asmost of the literature one comes across still speaks of two, very different,populations and cultures. The earliest of these was the Adena people, namedafter a farm in Ohio where this type of mound was excavated. The Adenaflourished two thousand years ago and longer, and were building mounds inAmerica at the time of Christ, even at the time of Buddha. No wonder, then, thatSmith would have identified one of these mounds as having been built by a tribeof Jews who had fled the Middle East and wound up on American shores. Exceptthat the dating of the mounds took place long after Smith had written the Bookof Mormon.Precise dating is not always possible when it comes to the mounds. In manycases, they are simply earthworks with nothing that can be reliablycarbon-dated. In other cases, though, there are skeletal remains as well as woodfragments, pottery and ornaments, and these lend themselves rather more easilyto specific dating exercises.After the Adena came the Hopewell culture, which was more complex andsophisticated than the Adena, and which built some of the more elaborate moundcomplexes and effigy mounds, such as (it is claimed) the Serpent Mound, which isnow dated by some to around 1066 A.D., and by others to 250 A.D.No one knows where the Adena came from, or what happened to them. It is believedthat they were either exterminated by the later Hopewell culture, or wereassimilated into the Hopewells through intermarriage and the gradual erosion oftheir own culture. Their only legacy rests in the proliferation of mounds. Insome of these, strange burial patterns were observed, such as the twelve peopleburied at the Kiefer Mound in Ohio, in a circle with their heads on the insideof the circle and their feet pointing outwards “like spokes in a wheel.” 15[../Text/ch02.html#filepos357053]This same arrangement was reported in theWheeling Gazette—a body on an altar, head facing “west of north” in thedirection where there was evidence of a fire, the body covered by a foot ofashes. The body was found to be “remarkably perfect, and was mostly preserved.Around this body were twelve others with their heads centering towards it, andfeet projecting. No articles of art were found, except a polished stone tube,about twelve inches in length.” 16 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos357546]Thealignment of the body implies an astronomical orientation consistent with manyHopewell and Adena sites. In this case, it is possible that the “west of north”alignment was towards Ursa Major, but that is pure conjecture since we don’tknow when the site was constructed or the bodies interred. The fact that therewere twelve other bodies with the central, altar-lain body indicates that thesetwelve were killed, sacrificed, in some sort of ritual. The stone tube mighthave been a pipe, or it could have served some function of which we are notaware; such is the state of knowledge of American prehistory. Oddly, this is aprecise description of a Cathar burial method of the thirteenth century A.D.(and of nine persons discovered dead in an identical wheel-like formation—headsinside, feet out—after the FBI assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco,Texas in 1993). At the Kiefer Mound, three of the twelve corpses had beendecapitated, with the skulls placed between the thigh bones. This odd placementof the skulls also exists in other Adena sites in Kentucky. 17[../Text/ch02.html#filepos357952]Engraved tablets were found buried in thesemounds with the artistically arranged bodies, and Adena experts William S. Webband Charles E. Snow believe that this “constitutes a very important Adenatrait.” 18 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos358683]Then there is the red paint. Ochre coloring was common on the skulls and bonesof the deceased; in other words, after the bodies had decomposed someone hadcleaned off the bones and painted them with red paint, sometimes in strangesymmetrical designs, and then reburied them. In some cases, the ochre was piledonto the lower extremities of the corpses 19[../Text/ch02.html#filepos358989]and in two Adena sites in Kentucky a blackgraphite compound was used to color the skull and collar bones of the corpsewhile red ochre was used for the lower extremities. 20[../Text/ch02.html#filepos359275]No one knows the purpose of this ritual, butthe use of ochre in sacramental painting was common all over Europe in ancienttimes as well as in early North American civilizations. The amount of workinvolved in either stripping the skeletons of flesh and then painting the bones,or in waiting for natural decomposition to occur and then digging up the bodiesand painting them and then reburying them, was prodigious, and must have servedan identifiable purpose deemed necessary to the Adena.In one case mentioned by Webb and Snow, the skull of a young woman was paintedin horizontal red stripes of ochre on the top of the skull, leaving the foreheadbare of any ochre; the red ochre was continued in horizontal stripes over theeyes, and then a vertical bar of graphite extended from the forehead downbetween the eyes to the nasal cavity. 21 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos359562]Thisclearly had some religious significance for the Adena, but whatever it was islost in time.Other symbolic motifs found in Adena sites include a plumed serpent, which givesrise to speculation that the cult of Quetzalcoatl of Aztec Mexico had reachedthe Adena, or vice versa. A plumed serpent is a very specific icon, a complexmix of concepts that implies all sorts of cultural and religious ideas. Itstrains belief to insist that the plumed serpent of the Adena had nothing at allto do with the plumed serpent of Mexico, a land not that far to the south. Thepresence of obsidian flakes in Adena mounds 22 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos359849]adds further credence to the theory that there was a connection between theAdena and the Aztecs, since the Aztecs prized obsidian. Indeed, one of thefamous shew stones of the Elizabethan magician and spy, John Dee, was of Aztecobsidian brought back from the New World by Spanish conquistadores. The Aztecsused the obsidian shew stone in an identical fashion to that used by Dee (and,later, Joseph Smith), as a kind of crystal ball. To the Aztecs, the obsidianmirror was sacred to the god Tezcatlipoca, the “god of the smoking mirror,” whowould reveal to them the will of heaven. Tezcatlipoca was identified with theconstellation Ursa Major, thus tying together astronomy with religion anddivination in a pattern familiar to all students of ancient civilizations. Theastronomical alignments of many of the Adena mound sites is further evidence ofthis persistent occult theorem. Joseph Smith, of course, used shew stones inmuch the same way as the Aztecs and John Dee.23[../Text/ch02.html#filepos360135] Indeed, John Dee himself was a scientificadvisor to English expeditions to the New World, and a close friend of SirWalter Raleigh, the man who introduced tobacco and many other curiosities toEngland from the New World. Elizabethan magician and spy, Dee also becameconvinced that a Welsh prince had “discovered” America centuries beforeColumbus.24 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos360517]Raptorial birds were also common symbols among the Adena, particularly the hawk.Webb and Snow remark upon an actual hawk’s head that was sewn onto a ceremonialheaddress.25 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos361053] There was even a unique symbolfound at one site: a hand with an eye depicted on its palm, a symbol familiar tothose who study ancient Middle Eastern religions and mysticism. 26[../Text/ch02.html#filepos361362]Further, a unique characteristic of the Adena people was their extraordinaryheight. Analysis of skeletal remains at Adena sites shows the men to haveoccasionally reached seven feet in height, with the women often over six feettall. Thus, their physical dissimilarity to the later Hopewells contributes toaccurate identification of the mounds, but also raises questions as to theirracial origin. Today, this supposed difference in physical appearance betweenthe two cultures is debated, and studies have been done to show that the Adenaand Hopewell peoples were related, if not actually the same people. What islacking is a detailed analysis of some of the remains found in these mounds,which show a race that can only be described as a race of “giants.”Newspaper reports from the late 1800s discuss skeletons of more than seven feetand eight feet in length found in burial mounds and caves that often containedstone altars, or even, in at least one case, a stone sarcophagus. Cyrus Thomasreports on the “blond mummies” of Tennessee and Kentucky in the Twelfth AnnualReport of the Bureau of Ethnology, dated 1894. These bodies were in “someinstances” found “incased in stone slabs and afterwards imbedded in clay orashes. In Smith and Warren counties, Tennessee, and in Warren and Fayettecounties, Kentucky, the flesh of the bodies was preserved and the hair wasyellow and of fine texture…. In one of the caves in Smith county the body of afemale is said to have been found, having about the waist a silver girdle, withmarks resembling letters.” 27 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos361648]This discovery ofletters or hieroglyphics in ancient American burial sites is not an isolatedcase.In December 1870, the so-called Brush Creek Tablet was unearthed from a burialmound on the farm of one J. M. Baughman in Muskigum County, Ohio. The tabletcontains a variety of carvings which appear to be a form of hieroglyphic. Evenmore startling, the mound was found to contain skeletons measuring eight andnine feet in length. 28 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos362030]Of course, theseassertions—including a signed affidavit by six citizens swearing that the aboveaccount is true—are dismissed by academia. Citizens, of course, are not to betrusted as “reliable observers.”In 1838, the same year that Joseph Smith “returned” the golden plates of theBook of Mormon to an angel, a large Adena mound was excavated at Grave Creek,West Virginia. In a burial chamber in that mound which contained a singleskeleton and some copper bracelets (and at a depth of 60 feet) an 29[../Text/ch02.html#filepos362407]engraved tablet was discovered, carved withPhoenician characters in a style of writing that was common in Spain twothousand years ago. This type of writing, sometimes called “Punic,” was Semiticin origin, Spain then being controlled by Carthage, which in turn had originatedin the previous millennium as an outpost of the Semitic Phoenicians. At the timethe tablet was discovered, this type of script had not yet been deciphered, andwould not be deciphered until the mid-twentieth century, thus ruling out thepossibility of a hoax even if the discovery of the tablet under sixty feet ofancient burial mound was not enough to assure its provenance. Thus, there is atleast circumstantial evidence that West Virginia had been visited by Europeansat the time of Christ. There is no other way to explain the presence of thatstone tablet in that grave, carved in a writing that would not be deciphered foranother hundred years.And the Grave Creek tablet is not an isolated case.There is the Bat Creek stone, for instance. Discovered in a burial mound ineastern Tennessee in 1889, its carvings were identified as ancient Hebrew byarchaeologist Cyrus Gordon in 1971, a type of Hebrew that dates from the firsthundred years after Christ. The inscription is said to read “For Judea.” Shadesof Joseph Smith! The site was later (1988) carbon-dated, and found to date fromthe period 32—769 A.D. Thus, Cyrus Gordon’s 1971 identification of the type ofHebrew and the 1988 carbon-dating of the site are consistent. 30[../Text/ch02.html#filepos363084]The American landscape is replete with stone carvings, some very simple andothers quite elaborate, which point to a continuing immigration of Europeans andMiddle Eastern peoples to its shores. A sub-discipline of archaeology—known asepigraphy—has attracted amateur archaeologists in America for many years.Epigraphy is concerned with writings on stone, and epigraphers scour thecountryside, the forests, the hills and mountains, looking for stoneinscriptions and trying to identify and decipher them. Epigraphy andepigraphical evidence are mainstays of the diffusionist argument, because stonecarvings—once they have been identified and certified as genuine and ruled outas hoaxes—can represent unequivocal proof of foreign visitation to American soilin the years before Columbus and, in some cases, in the years before Christ.Joseph Smith’s worldview—though based on a hoax, according to his detractors—isamazingly in accord with the worldview of the diffusionists, which is notunexpected since there was such a lot of speculation about the Mound Builders atthe time the Book of Mormon was being written. According to scholars such asFell, people from the Middle East did come to America long before Columbus. Andwhere they did not leave golden plates covered with lengthy scriptural writings(at least, not as have been discovered so far!), they did leave stone tabletswith scriptural quotations.> > …they have somewhat observed the motions of the stars; among which it has been> surprising to me to find that they have always called ‘Charles Wain’ by the> name of “Paukunnawaw,” or “the Bear,” which is the name whereby Europeans also> have distinguished it.

He is known to have informed the Royal Society inEngland of the discovery of a strange inscription on a stone in Dighton,Massachusetts by clergyman John Danforth, who discovered the inscription in1680. The Royal Society published the information in their PhilosophicalTransactions in 1712, and thereafter the matter died on the vine. 31[../Text/ch02.html#filepos363384]Item: There is the fact of the Los Lunas stone, found in New Mexico (the home ofthe first identified “Clovis” site). This is a stone boulder covered in a formof Hebrew writing current at the time of the first Temple, circa 1000 B.C., butwhich was not translated until 1949. When it was finally translated, it wasrevealed to be an abbreviated form of the Ten Commandments. 32[../Text/ch02.html#filepos363671]The Ten Commandments. In ancient Hebrew. In New Mexico. 2,500 years before thevisit of Columbus.Do we, as Americans, really understand our own history? Is our history thehistory of an unknown race of people who created a vast and vibrant civilizationand then—due to disease, perhaps, in the Great Dying of the sixteenthcentury—disappeared, leaving only the mounds as their trace? Is our history thehistory of our own ancestors in Europe, Africa, Asia? Is it simply the historyof the land we occupy? Or is it really a combination of all of these? Is ourhistory that of our ancient ancestors, who evidently came and went from Americamany times and for many reasons over the last three or four thousand years? IsAmerica a legacy of Asian Buddhists, Palestinian Jews, Norse Vikings, andPhoenician traders as well as a shipload of Pilgrims from England? Is America’sfunction as a destination of dreams for all the peoples of the earth no morethan a memory of the time when it did, indeed, belong to everyone?Is the Statue of Liberty standing in New York Harbor an acknowledgement ofAmerica’s ancient purpose?Even further, when we teach American history in school should we begin, asalways, with its discovery by Columbus in 1492… or should we begin instead withthe fall of Carthage, or the Buddhist missions, or the cult of Wotan? Or withthe Cahokia Mound near St. Louis, Missouri, a vast prehistoric complex thatstuns the imagination? Or with the Newark mound complexes and their radicaloctagon–circle–square designs? By drawing a straight line through history at1492 we, as Americans, are enforcing a kind of dual personality upon ourselves.At first, such a strategy was useful in order to amalgamate all the variousnationalities that came to our shores looking for freedom and opportunity.Wiping out our ancestral heritage was a way of adopting the new, Americanheritage and making us all the same, all Americans, regardless of our familynames or skin color.But what have we lost in the process?Item: The famous Peterborough Stone, in Ontario. A huge rock measuring “hundredsof square feet.” Professor Barry Fell identified the maze of writings as a formof Scandinavian runes or, actually, pre-runic characters that he dated to 1700B.C. Later archaeologists have corrected Fell’s dating and translation, but wereleft with the result that Fell was essentially correct: the characters arewritten in a script called Tifinagh, which was used by the Tuaregs—a people ofnorthern Africa. The stone was dated to 800 B.C. rather than 1700 B.C., butrepresents the record of a trade route in gold running from the Niger River inAfrica to Scandinavia and then, eventually, to Ontario. 33[../Text/ch02.html#filepos363988]In 800 B.C. At the time of the origin of the Adena people, eight hundred yearsbefore Christ and roughly contemporary with the life of the Buddha. A traderoute from Africa, to Europe, to America. An established path for other traders,other peoples, other races, civilizations, religions. The Tuaregs andScandinavians in 800 B.C. were, of course, pagans. How much of their culture didthey bring with them to America? Did they intermarry with local races? Did theyteach their systems of astronomy, divination, metallurgy, etc. to the Americans?Did the Americans teach the Tuaregs and Scandinavians anything in return? Thereis no reason to believe that the transmission of knowledge was all one-sided.How did the African and European traders find the gold mines in Canada? How longwere they in America? How often did they return?Are their descendants still among us?Any one of these pieces of evidence—the Grave Creek tablet, the Bat Creek stone,the Peterborough Stone, the existence of American flora in ancient Egypt, Indiaand East Asia, and the hundreds of other examples, including Celtic Ogam scriptall over the American northeast—should be enough in itself to force historiansto come to terms with pre-Columbian civilizations visiting and interacting withtribes, peoples and cultures from the Eastern Hemisphere. The preponderance ofsuch evidence, however, and the multiplication of possible overseas connectionsfrom ancient cultures means that we have to go back carefully over the legends,myths, and histories of all the ancient peoples and see if we can find textualtraces of this cross-fertilization.In 1840, a pair of mound enthusiasts decide to excavate a promising group ofmounds at Chillicothe, Ohio in the very heart of mound country. The team ofSquier and Davis are generally acknowledged to be the godfathers of modernAmerican archaeology. Their exhaustive and systematic work on hundreds of moundsthroughout the Midwest still stands as a primary reference for Americanprehistory studies, and the Chillicothe excavation is probably their definingmoment. They were not the first to excavate “Indian” mounds, however. GeorgeWashington was interested in the mounds.34 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos364278] Noless a personage than Thomas Jefferson began a scientific stratigraphicexcavation of a mound in 1781; his Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin,was perhaps the most influential person in American government (before or since)to have insisted on an appreciation of both the mounds and of the NativeAmerican populations who lived in the conquered territories. William HenryHarrison (who would become the United States’ ninth president for a month beforedying of pneumonia) would follow suit in 1838 with his Discourse on theAborigines of the Valley of the Ohio, a description of mounds and some fancifulsuggestions as to their origins and purposes. The reader will remember that thisyear has shown up before, as the year Joseph Smith returned the golden plates tothe Angel Moroni, and as the year the “Phoenician” tablet was found at the GraveCreek mound.(In an odd piece of trivia that may interest some readers, a respected Hollywoodfilmmaker also wrote a book about the mounds. Kenneth MacGowan—producer of suchfilms as Young Mr. Lincoln (1939), and one of the better propaganda films of theearly war years, Man Hunt (1941), wrote Early Man In the New World. MacGowan,who began his career in New York City in the Broadway theater, later became afilm theorist as well as a teacher at UCLA, and authored several textbooks oncinema, for which he is better known. He died in 1963 at the age ofseventy-five.)Other personalities who became involved in mound research included the foundersof the town of Marietta, Ohio: Rufus Putnam and Manasseh Cutler, the former ageneral of the Revolutionary War and the latter a minister. Marietta is in theheart of mound country, not far from Chillicothe, and General Putnam forbade thedestruction of the mounds by farmers, instead making detailed maps of them forposterity.But it is to Ephraim George Squier and Dr. Edwin H. Davis that we owe most ofour early knowledge about the mounds. Together they excavated more than twohundred of them, and published the results inAncient Monuments of theMississippi Valley: Comprising the Results of Extensive Original Surveys andExplorations, a by-now standard text that was the first (1848) publication ofthe Smithsonian “Contributions to Knowledge” series. The Chillicothe site isamply described and illustrated; indeed, there are nearly 300 Adena mound siteswithin a 150 mile radius of Chillicothe, extending into Indiana, Kentucky, WestVirginia and Pennsylvania. These sites include the Grave Creek Mound, inMoundsville, West Virginia described above, as well as the mounds in Mound StatePark in Indiana.The Grave Creek site boasts the largest mound of the Adena culture: it has a 295foot base diameter, and is 69 feet high; it represents 60,000 tons of earth, andwas built around 200 B.C. (It is tempting to note that dividing the height bythe diameter of this mound gives .2338, which begs us to consider that it mighthave had astronomical importance: the ratio seems to mimic that of the angle ofthe ecliptic, which is about 23 degrees 30 minutes.) It was in the Grave CreekMound that the stone bearing Phoenician inscriptions was discovered in 1838, tenyears before Squier and Davis published their “monumental” study. This givesrise to several questions, if we accept that the stone is authentic (and many,if not most, authorities insist it is not) and that its placement in the moundtook place during the Adena period (and not much later). It is only withreluctance that some archaeologists today accept these facts, although they haveno explanation for them and describe the Phoenician stone as “anomalous.”Conveniently, the stone itself has since disappeared, although copies of itsinscription were made when it was still in the possession of archaeologists.The first question is the obvious one: In what way were the Adena people and thePhoenicians related? By trade? Or was there some other dimension to therelationship? Were the foreign visitors or traders attempting to convert theAdena people to their religion? Did they leave the stone behind as a reminder tothe Adena of their visit? Was it simply the work of one of the visitors with alot of time on his hands, something to occupy himself perhaps? Or was it leftthere as a kind of claim, a “Kilroy was here” sort of memento?The second question is perhaps more oblique: Why was the stone buried in themound in the first place?Is one of the skeletons found in the Grave Creek Mound the mortal remains of oneof the visitors? The stone was found with one specific skeleton, wearing copperbracelets. Was the stone left there after the fashion of funerary goods, such asthe ancient Egyptians buried with their kings? It seems safe to assume that theAdena people did not simply “find” the stone; the stone and the mound are of thesame period.And why that stone, and nothing else to suggest foreign influence?The first question may be easiest to answer, although with a result unacceptableto most modern historians and archaeologists. When the stone was finallydeciphered—after its identification as a form of Punic (Phoenician) used on theIberian peninsula during the first millennium B.C.—the text was found to referto the 35 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos364876]mound specifically: “The mound raisedon high for Tasach…” it says, in part, according to Barry Fell, and appears tobe an astrological text. Thus, the stone and the mound are part of a singleevent, the stone left in its spot as a message to future generations. If Tasachwas an Adena person, then why was there an inscription in an Iberian form ofPhoenician? If Tasach was a visitor from Iberia, however, then Americanprehistory will have to be re-evaluated, since the Grave Creek Mound (alsoreferred to as “Mammoth Mound”) is representative of the Adena moundbuildertechnology as a whole. The conclusion to which the diffusionists leap—and whichthe independent inventionists refuse to accept under any circumstances—is thatthe Adena (or at least some of the people identified as Adena) were not NativeAmericans but were, instead, Celto-Iberians from what is now Spain and Portugal.One stone does not a complete theory make, however. In the first place, thereare those who dispute Professor Fell’s translation, some even denying thewriting is writing at all, or that it represents any kind of alphabet. Othersquestion whether the writing is a form of Punic, although Fell’s arguments seemsound in this regard and the similarities between the stone inscription andforms of Punic seem almost too strong to ignore. Some philologists haverallied—albeit halfheartedly—to Fell’s defense. If only that single stone hadbeen found, we still would have been forced to confront a whole host of issueshistorical and archaeological. It would still have to be explained somehow, andthe explanation would necessarily be upsetting to establishment archaeology.However, many more stones have been found throughout West Virginia and Kentuckywhich support the diffusionists’ claim that America was not simply visitedbriefly by a few scattered ships from Europe over a period of time, but wasrather settled by foreign races hundreds, if not thousands, of years beforeColumbus. The social and political implication of this theory is that—in someeyes, anyway—it could be seen as devaluing the culture and contribution of theNative American population.OGAM’S RAZORIn addition to the strange Phoenician, Hebrew and other stone inscriptions orpetroglyphs, epigraphers have been uncovering hundreds (if not thousands) ofstones carved with simple markings that were once thought to be anything fromscratches made by the plows of modern farmers to hoaxes perpetrated on thegullible. Epigraphers have been carefully collecting, photographing andcataloguing these stones, and in many cases they have been able to deciphertheir meanings. One of the pioneers of this type of endeavor was Professor Fellhimself. Barry Fell was a marine biologist, and not an archaeologist orhistorian, which is one of the reasons why his work has been avoided or attackedby professional archaeologists. However, his work in epigraphy and ancientlanguages was a direct result of his work as a marine biologist. Coming acrossmany examples of petroglyphs on islands where he was tracing the routes ofvoyages made by ancient peoples throughout the Old World—in an attempt todiscover how plants, animals and humans were dispersed globally—he realized thatthese ancient stones were probably important keys to his research, and that itwould behoove him to have them translated or, at least, identified as to theirlanguage and country or race of origin.It was only when he began receiving correspondence from New World archaeologistsabout identical types of carvings that he came to the inescapable conclusionthat they were written by people sharing a common culture and language, and thatthese same people had traveled from the ancient Old World to the ancient NewWorld thousands of years ago.Although still not warmly embraced by mainstream archaeologists, the bulk ofthis evidence is overwhelmingly in support of the existence of ancient Celticsettlements in North America. The stones are carved in an old form of writingknown—to those specializing in the Celtic histories of Great Britain, Iberia andnorthern France—as Ogam, a Celtic word that means “grooved writing.”Ogam is a in simple form that developed before the invention of paper. Likeinscriptions on clay and stone in the ancient Near and Middle East, the writingstyle was itself a result of the writing technique: that is to say, due to thedifficulty of writing curving lines and flourishes on solid stone or wet clay,the letters that compose these alphabets or syllabaries tend to be all straightlines and sharp edges, the easier to carve with an iron tool or a reed stylus.Sumerian cuneiform and Germanic runes are examples of this type of writing. TheOgam script is another.Consisting mostly of straight, vertical strokes above, below or across ahorizontal line, Ogam script was identified by an Irish monk writing in thethirteenth century A.D. Known as “The Ogam Tract” in the Book of Ballymote, thistext had caused no great interest at first, since it was assumed—incorrectly, asit turned out—that many of the scripts mentioned were simple, childish codes andnot serious alphabets at all. A kind of Rosetta Stone of ancient Europeanscripts, “The Ogam Tract”—in which the nameless monk had tabulated various typesof known alphabets, including even Egyptian and Numidian—was the proof, the“smoking gun,” that the diffusionists were looking for, because it was evidencethat their own identification of the petroglyphs was on target. One particularOgam alphabet—known as “Ogam 16”—was of special interest, since it seemed thatthere were no petroglyphs in existence (in Ireland) engraved with thesecharacters, which made it quite suspect in the eyes of the archaeologists.The fact that the characters of Ogam 16 (albeit unidentified as such at first)were known to archaeologists in New England, West Virginia, Kentucky and otherstates would not be realized until the twentieth century, when archaeologists inthe New World and the Old finally began comparing notes. Further, the existenceof Ogam 16 in North America was particularly troubling, since the “Ogam Tract”was written some eight hundred years ago: three hundred years before Columbus’sfirst voyage to what he thought was India. Either our Irish monk was possessedof tremendous psychic abilities or, as is most likely, he was privy to knowledgeconcerning a far away land and the Ogam script in use there.The simplest solution to a problem is usually the correct solution: “entitiesare not to be multiplied unnecessarily,” a familiar adage known as “Occam’sRazor.” Named after a Franciscan theologian of the thirteenth century, it isfrequently cited by scientists and logicians. In the case of foreign racesinhabiting America before Columbus and perhaps before the peoples we know asNative Americans, the evidence in the stones, the mounds, and the Europeanpetroglyphs provides archaeology with a simple answer, which we may in a spiritof whimsy call “Ogam’s Razor,” since it cleanly and manifestly demonstrates thatthere was wide exploration and settlement in America by races from across theAtlantic Ocean. That this evidence does not seem to be supported by thedispersion of Clovis spearpoints in America does not mean the evidence isinvalid; it simply means that another explanation must be found to satisfy bothsets of evidence. That archaeology has rushed too quickly to judgment in thecase of the early American population scenario seems obvious today. Are thediffusionists right and the independent inventionists wrong? The answer probablylies somewhere between those two positionsThe number of ancient sites in America that mimic ancient sites in Europe isalso startling. Circles of stones reminiscent of Stonehenge in England exist onthe North American continent, as astronomically aligned as their English andCeltic counterparts. Even many of the mound systems are now known to have beenastronomically oriented, including those at Marietta and Chillicothe. Some Adenasites show circles of post-holes, evidence that wooden pillars instead of stonedolmens may have been used in America for the same purpose: astronomicalalignments.While the idea of astronomically-aligned monuments makes sense when oneconsiders the reliance of the ancient peoples on agriculture (it is believed theAdena were the first Americans to cultivate maize and live in communities) andtherefore on knowing the seasons, the phases of the moon, etc., what isstartling about these discoveries is that it means the Adena were scientificallysophisticated enough to know exactly how to build something as complex as theequivalent of a Stonehenge in the American landscape, perhaps as long ago as twothousand years… or longer. (The jury is still out on the age of the Adenacivilization, and books and studies published in the last forty years are allover the place regarding the advent of the Adena civilization.) Dating ofStonehenge itself is rather uncertain, with estimates ranging from 3000 B.C. to1500 B.C. Thus, what is certain is that some of the prehistoric mound sites inNorth America actually predate the construction of Stonehenge and may also 36[../Text/ch02.html#filepos365171]predate that of the Great Pyramids of Gizeh: aproposition that would turn not only American history but world history on itshead.Recent studies undertaken on Adena mounds show that they were mostly ritualisticin nature; the difficulty in locating the remains of Adena living quarters andvillages is directly related to this fact, as the Adena would keep the moundarea clean of debris and non-sacramental artifacts and buildings. Thus,archaeologists find they are looking further and further away from the moundsystems themselves in order to uncover Adena villages.It is generally agreed at this point that the burial mounds were created forspecial personages or the elite, and were not the usual method of disposing ofthe dead, which was probably cremation. As is the case with the Valley of theKings in Egypt, only high-ranking persons were accorded a full burial along withfunerary items such as jewelry (mostly copper bracelets and what are known as“gorgets,” small tablets with engraved markings of raptors, animals, orgeometric designs) and pottery. Yet, in still other cases, mass burials aresometimes discovered, such as the famous Seip Mound in Ross County, Ohio whichcontained ninety-nine skeletons and a huge number of river pearls… thousands ofpearls with a total estimated value in 1970 of $2,000,000. Along with the hugenumber of skeletons, there was an inner chamber which served as the finalresting place of four adults and two infants. It is assumed that these wereAdena royalty, but, of course, there is no proof of this or even if the Adenahad royalty as we would understand it.According to early researchers (and now debated), the Adena themselves werephysically quite different from the later Hopewell culture that replaced them.Adena are referred to as “round heads” and, as mentioned above, they tended tobe quite tall. The remains of Hopewell people show that they were shorter, andhad longer skulls… in fact, the Iberians of ancient Spain, who purportedly gaveus the Phoenician script discovered in the Grave Creek mound, were also known as“long skulls” or “long heads.” It should be noted in addition that Iberianmortuary practices included the burial mound: in a design remarkably similar tothose of the Adena moundbuilder culture. Of course, that is not enoughinformation to create a scenario in which Iberians invaded America and wiped outthe Adena culture, replacing it with their own, or, conversely, were the Adenaculture themselves.If those theories sound outrageous, they are perhaps no more so than some of theother theories put forward in the past two hundred years for the origins of themound builders. Some have claimed that they were an errant band of Welshmen,others that they were Egyptians or, as Joseph Smith believed, Jews in Diaspora.There is certainly not enough data to support any of these theories, but theexisting data do not support a simplistic Clovis migration scenario either. At aconference held in Santa Fe, New Mexico in October 1999 on the subject of“Clovis and Beyond,” such mainstream archaeological types as Keith W. Kintighwere raising doubts and speculating about the Clovis theory. Kintigh is anarchaeologist at Arizona State University in Tempe and president of the Societyfor American Archaeology. His doubts are, like many of his colleagues, based onthe discovery in Monte Verde, Chile in the late 1980s of a race of people wholived in that part of the world about 30,000 years ago. The team ofarchaeologists was led by Thomas D. Dillehay of the University of Kentucky, andthe people were identified as a pre-Clovis settlement and evidence of apre-Clovis migration… at least as far as the southern tip of Chile. If theClovis people crossed the land bridge from northern Asia and settled in NorthAmerica 12,000 years ago… then the obvious questions arise: Who were the MonteVerde people, where did they come from, and how did they get there so far aheadof the Clovis migration?As if that were not enough to encourage a re-writing of American history, thereis the problem of the Pima and Zuni sacred languages.The Pima Indians are descendants of the ancient Hohokam culture of New Mexico,based around the Sonoran Desert. (The Hohokam themselves were of Mexican origin,and migrated to New Mexico about 300 B.C.) At the beginning of the last century,an ethnologist with the US Government visited the Pima and stayed with them forabout two years. During that time, he prevailed upon the tribe’s elders to allowhim to transcribe their sacred Creation Chant. He made a phonetic transcriptionand, using what he knew of Pima vocabulary, attempted to translate it. Thistranslation was published by the government in 1908. The translation waswoefully primitive, as the ethnologist—Frank Russell—himself admitted, makingthe dignified Creation Chant virtually unintelligible at best, or sounding likepidgin English at worst. And there it languished for almost seventy years untilBarry Fell—using a Semitic dictionary—discovered that the archaic language inwhich the chant is sung is a form of Punic.In his America B.C., Professor Fell gives the original phonetic rendering aspreserved by Frank Russell, with a corresponding Arabic transliteration, andthen an English version beneath the Arabic.37 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos365897]The conclusion is inescapable: the Pima Indians had been using an ancientSemitic language as the repository of their sacred myths. The similarity of thePima words to Arabic is uncanny, and it renders the Creation Chant suddenlyquite intelligible; further, it follows the general description of the chant asgiven by one of the Pima elders. What is even more incredible is the realizationthat the Pima (like their Hohokam ancestors) reside in the southwestern part ofthe continent, about as far from Iberia or Phoenicia as one could get.Professor Fell follows this startling demonstration with a longer exposition onthe Zuni language. Without going into all the detail here, Fell’s thesis is thatthe Zuni language is a derivative of an ancient North African dialect spoken byLibyan seamen around 500 B.C., a language which itself is descended fromEgyptian, with Anatolian and Greek loan words. He goes so far as to link theseseafaring Libyans and their language with Malay and Polynesian tongues. Heoffers as proof not only the spoken Zuni words and their equivalents in NorthAfrican dialects, but the written language as well: discovered carved intostones in New Mexico. Fell does not offer these examples unsupported; he had hiswork checked by specialists, such as Boulas Ayad, Professor of Ancient Languagesat the University of Colorado, who concurred with Fell’s findings. He furtheroffers charts that show the similarity (and, in many cases, identity) of thewritten Libyan alphabet as it was known over two thousand years ago to examplesfrom Asian sources and rock carvings found in Iowa. These same symbols are foundeverywhere in the Pacific Rim from Polynesia to Chile, but also as far away asQuebec and New England.In fact, during a dig at a Hopewell mound in Davenport, Iowa, some funeraryofferings were found carved in the shape of an elephant… certainly not an animalwith which the Native Americans would have been familiar! Fell believed thatmany of the more famous mounds of North America were built by these Libyanvisitors, including the Seip Mound mentioned above. Some carved stone headsfound there bear a striking similarity to the physical appearance and headgearof the ancient North Africans. Take these together with some of the epigraphicinscriptions discussed above, and one can easily see that the simplestexplanation is that people from North Africa visited America—and possiblysettled here, building temples and erecting stone tablets to commemorate theirrace—thousands of years before Columbus.It should be emphasized that linguistic evidence is always the hardest to prove;armchair linguists are the bane of serious archaeological and historicalresearch. This is even more problematic in the case of the ancient Americanraces, as they left no written language of their own. Unlike the tombs at theValley of the Kings in Egypt, or the Sumerian cylinder seals of Mesopotamia, oreven the recently-decoded Mayan hieroglyphs of Central America, there appear tobe no hieroglyphics or cuneiform or other writing left behind by the ancientNorth American peoples. No great statues with carved braggadocio, no drearyaccountant’s tables of figures, no secret spells in magical alphabets. Nothing.All that we have of a written record are the controversial petroglyphs studiedso intently by Fell and the diffusionists, and if they were left by visitors tothe American shores and not the native people themselves, then archaeology is ata loss to explain the function of the vast mound complexes in America.The science of linguistics has its own rules and accepted forms of demonstrationand proof. Fell was aware of this, and wherever possible he enlisted the supportof specialists in this field. As time progressed, however, Fell became one ofthe few American experts in Ogam as well as the alphabets of the ancient Nearand Middle East, and he was called upon frequently to translate stoneinscriptions found all over North and South America by puzzled or bemusedarchaeologists as well as by amateur researchers and epigraphers.The reaction of established historians, archaeologists and anthropologists toFell’s work has been mixed. Many disagree wholeheartedly with the wholediffusionist perspective, characterizing it as either racist, fascist, thedomain of the credulous and gullible such as the Atlantis-seekers, or simply as“rubbish.” Yet the sheer amount of evidence for the habitation of America byraces from across the Atlantic is virtually overwhelming. If this evidence doesnot speak to the diffusionist theory, then—going back to Occam’s Razor—what doesit represent?THE SWORD AND THE STONESProbably the strangest story to emerge from diffusionist literature—and one evensome diffusionists have trouble swallowing—is that of the visit of a famousEuropean monarch to American shores (and from there to Kentucky and Tennessee)and of his subsequent settlement there, giving rise to tales of “white Indians”who spoke… Welsh. This has started its own firestorm of controversy as competinghistorians and archaeologists (and epigraphers) struggle to get the dates andthe personalities right.According to popular amateur archaeologists such as the team of Alan Wilson andBaram Blackett—Artorius Rex Discovered, The Holy Kingdom (with AdrianGilbert)—King Arthur visited America on or about 652 A.D. at the time a meteorstruck the British Isles. This meteor strike, they believe, is the reason forthe devastation of the land of Camelot in the Arthurian legends, and the reasonArthur left Wales for the relative safety of Normandy. During that same time,according to the theory, one Prince Madoc of the Welsh court was at sea andfound himself washed off course, finding his way to America by accident. Tenyears later, he would return and tell Arthur of all the wonderful things he hadseen in the land beyond the sea.So far, so good.Then—according to the theory of Wilson and Blackett—Arthur decided to send aconvoy of ships in force to America. They landed, and made it as far inland aspresent day Kentucky and Tennessee. Arthur was killed in America by one of thenatives, his body mummified and brought back to Wales, but not before leavingbehind a race of white men who would stay to settle the land.A competing theory has it that the aforementioned Prince was in reality PrinceMadoc, son of Owain Gwynnedd, a king of the Welsh province of Gwynnedd who livedin the twelfth century A.D., and thus about five hundred years later than thelegendary Arthur. Owain attempted to unite the warring Welsh kingdoms into asingle nation with a single king—much like the Arthur of legend—but after hisdeath a civil war broke out between his many sons about who would succeed him tothe throne. Prince Madoc fled the war, and wound up in America.Although Madoc’s story does not appear in printed form until 1584, one RichardHakluyt—in his Principall Navigations of 1600—claims that the story of Madoc andhis flight to America was common knowledge long before Columbus’ famous voyagein 1492. Famous Welsh historian Gutyn Owen also wrote of Madoc before 1492.According to the best estimates of historian and archaeologist, it would appearthat Madoc landed somewhere at or near Mobile Bay, Alabama and wandered inlandfrom there. This is based on computation of probable landfall due to oceancurrents and prevailing winds from the British Isles, but also on some strangeanomalies of the landscape of that part of the southeastern United States.Along the Alabama River, south of Chattanooga, can be seen three large fortswhose construction pre-dates Columbus and is “unlike any known Indianstructure.” According to the Cherokee Indians who were questioned about theforts, they had been built by a race of white men who lived in the area beforethem. One of these forts was found to resemble the birthplace of Prince Madoc,Dolwyddelan Castle, in virtually every detail. Located on Lookout Mountain inAlabama, its “setting, layout, and method of construction” is that of the Welshprototype. Indeed, early European explorers to the region spoke of finding these“white Indians”—known as Mandans—and the strange language they spoke, whichcontained many Welsh words.According to a Cherokee informant in 1782, Chief Oconostota of the CherokeeNation, the Welshmen who built these forts had been at war with the Cherokee formany years and finally signed a truce in which they promised to vacate Cherokeeland and head north, up the Ohio River and then as far as the Missouri. Duringthis diaspora—or perhaps even before the truce—they had already begun losingtheir European culture and had become nearly indistinguishable from the Indiansthemselves, with some notable differences: their beards, grey hair, blue eyes,and the physical appearance of some of the women, which resembled European womenmore than native Americans.The Mandans became a canvas onto which many historians, anthropologists andarchaeologists would paint the pictures they wanted to see. Hjalmar Holand, in1940, would see in the Mandans evidence of Norse explorations in North America,and the Mandans as descendants of Leif Erickson of Viking fame; 38[../Text/ch02.html#filepos366183]the famous—and controversial—Kensington Stoneis considered evidence of Norse presence in North America hundreds of yearsbefore Columbus. This stone—discovered by a Minnesota farmer in 1898—is carvedin runic characters and is testament to an attack on a Norse encampment byIndians in the year 1362. It has been attacked as a forgery over the years, butusually on flimsy ground (resulting, for instance, from ignorance of the type ofrunic used in Sweden and Norway in 1362); what one cannot adequately explain iswhy someone would go to all the effort of carving hundreds of runic charactersinto a boulder which is then left in the ground for so many years that a treegrew roots around it (as it was found) if the intention was a hoax or a fraud.In the past few years, however, more evidence has been amassed to prove that theKensington Stone—whatever it may be—is not a nineteenth century forgery. Many ofthe linguistic references used by its detractors were found to be inaccurate ordated; the carvings on the stone itself were carbon-dated to the right period byexamining changes in the mica formation along their ridges; finally, Dr. RichardNielsen—in the spring of 2001—published his findings on the stone inScandinavian Studies, a peer-reviewed linguistic journal, in the form of a75-page study representing more than ten years of research. The result: HjalmarHoland was right. The Kensington Stone is genuine. The experts were wrong.History needs to be rewritten. There were Norsemen in Minnesota in 1362.Columbus did not discover America; he was only one of many to recognize a goodthing when he saw it.Yet, in other areas Holand may have jumped the gun. He dismisses the theory thatthe Mandans are descended from Welshmen; he sees the Kensington Stone as ampleevidence of Norse immigration to Minnesota and the Dakotas, as if it would betherefore impossible to also imagine a group of Welshmen in the same territory.If the Norsemen arrived in that part of North America sometime in thethirteenth-fourteenth centuries A.D., then it would have been over a hundredyears after the arrival of the mysterious Prince Madoc and his settlers anyway.Holand imagines that the physical appearance of the Mandans is more clearlyNordic than Welsh, based on nothing more than eye color (claiming that Nordicpeople have blue eyes but that Welshmen have brown eyes, thus ruling outWelshmen as the progenitors of the Mandan race!) but perhaps he is onlysuccumbing to the racial theories of his time; he published his work in 1940, ayear before America’s entry into the Second World War, when it was stillpossible to write,The Swedes and Norwegians are of the purest Nordic stock and a relativelysmaller number would therefore have been sufficient to transmit the physicalpeculiarities for which the Mandans were noted than if any other nationality hadbeen represented by these early culture bearers. 39[../Text/ch02.html#filepos366548]In the years immediately after the American Civil War, a British naval officerbegan a tour of pre-Columbian architecture in the Americas. Lindesey Brinewanted to see for himself the burial mounds, Aztec and Mayan pyramids, and theancient fortifications of North and Central America. His report—published as TheAncient Earthworks and Temples of the American Indians—is a valuable resource inthat it discusses the mounds (and the Native American tribes) ratherdispassionately. Brine had no particular axe to grind: he wasn’t an American,Native or otherwise, and he simply reports on the various mounds and otherstructures as an interested observer, albeit one with military experience andtraining. He noticed striking similarities between Central American mounds andthose of, for instance, Cahokia, forcing him to consider that they were built bythe same people. 40 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos366836]This idea that the NativeAmerican populations originated in Mexico and Central America and came north isone that is batted about constantly by one group of archaeologists or another.There are some obvious similarities between religious art and mythology as well,enough to suggest a close relationship between the two groups if not actualdirect lineage.Brine goes further, to report on Mexican myths concerning a visit by twentywhite, bearded men who arrived by ship in the years before Columbus… men wearingsandals, preaching what appears to be Christianity, and dressed in white robesadorned with red crosses. 41 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos367214]One is startled atthe similarity of this costume to that of the Knights Templar, men whoseorganization was suppressed by Pope and King in the fourteenth century and whohad found refuge in Portugal, Scotland and other European lands even as theirbrothers were being executed in France, accused of heresy and worse.Brine was also aware of the Mandan tribe, however, and reports on them atlength, in the context of foreign races occupying North America beforeColumbus.42 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos367501]He begins by discussing a Shawnee tradition that the mounds constructed in Ohioand Kentucky were built by a race of white foreigners, who were thenexterminated in the course of wars with the Native American populations. Itshould be remembered that the Cherokee themselves have a similar tradition.Brine then goes on to discuss an American cavalry officer, one Stuart, who cameacross the Mandans themselves sometime in the mid-1700s and was made theirprisoner. Stuart claims the Mandans told him they were descended from a race ofEuropeans who had arrived in Florida and then made their way north to rest onthe western side of the Mississippi once the Spaniards had landed. Stuartfurther claimed that another Mandan prisoner, this time of Welsh background,could make himself understood to the Mandans in his native tongue, thus openingup the great Mandan/ Welsh controversy.Brine does not take a firm position on this matter one way or another. He doesnot agree that the construction of all of the mounds required Europeanengineers; he does, however, believe that the construction of the moresymmetrically-aligned mounds would have required a knowledge of geometry andengineering which, in his opinion, the existing Native American population didnot have (although, of course, their ancestors may have had this information andlost it along the way, possibly due to an epidemic in North America referred toby archaeologists as the “Great Dying”). He points to the famous moundenclosures at Newark, Ohio as an example of this.43[../Text/ch02.html#filepos367729]At Newark, we have a construction of tremendous size. The first is a circle,twenty acres in area. Brine’s conclusion is that it would have been tremendouslydifficult to create a perfect circle of that size without instruments, butallows that it would still be within the realm of possibility.What he dismisses as impossible without instruments is the attached constructionof a perfect octagon, containing an area no less than forty acres in size. Thesetwo constructions are joined by a path between them, again perfectly centered.These “fortifications” (if that is what they are) are of an advanced state ofdesign and engineering. Brine feels that—without surveying equipment—the localNative American population (or any population) would have been unable toconstruct something of this nature. If we further examine those mound groupingsthat have astronomical orientation—usually to the equinoctial or solstitialpoints, much the same as Stonehenge in England—then we are forced to considerwhether a race of beings (either Native American or foreign) having thescientific knowledge to create such impressive constructions could have arisenin North America… and then disappeared without any further trace than theirmonuments, and their dead. This is possible if we consider that, without awritten language, there was no way to pass on the techniques of mound buildingonce the Great Dying had begun.The Mandans were eventually forced even further north, due to warfare with theSioux, winding up as far as the Dakotas. The last great Mandan settlement—a townwith old, European style huts and streets, and a fort with a moat—was locatednear Minot, North Dakota where it was visited by French explorer Captain Pierrela Verendrye in 1738. He noticed blond hair and blue eyes among the Mandans, butwith evidence that the Mandan were the result of a process of intermarriagebetween the “original” white people—either Welsh, or Nordic, or perhaps someother, European, race—and local Native American populations. Yet, their mode ofliving was in marked contrast to the local cultures and involved a high state ofagriculture and some curious religious beliefs which seemed to be a mixture ofNative American mythology with elements of Christianity, including a story ofthe virgin birth of a great man; a flood, ark and dove; etc. They eventuallysuccumbed to several smallpox epidemics, the first in 1837 and later in 1856,and were effectively wiped out as a tribe. 1838, of course, was the year of thediscovery of the Grave Creek tablet, the year of the return of Joseph Smith’sgolden tablets, and the year of the publication of William Henry Harrison’sfanciful study of the burial mounds. Perhaps the Mandan tribe held someimportant information about the pre-Columbian centuries of North America—as wellas nuggets of data about the Norsemen, or early Wales, Prince Madoc, and maybeeven the identity (and whereabouts?) of the putative King Arthur—but thatinformation died with them.What most Americans know of their Native populations is usually limited to genreliterature and genre cinema. Cowboy-and-Indian movies were a staple in Americasince the earliest days of both Hollywood and television. Americans romanticizedthe role of the white settler and white soldier and even, to a large extent,romanticized the “noble savage” as well. They have seen their own historythrough a thick scrim of fantasy, fear, and even guilt, but still have notembraced the pure reality. Those that live near reservations have their ownclearly defined set of racial biases. Academics take a more objective view thanmost—such is their vocation, after all—but even then their view of NativeAmerican history and culture is largely determined by a few axiomatic theoriesthat are only now being tested by the weight of archaeological, anthropologicaland linguistic evidence. The Native Americans themselves are confused by some ofthis. Do they embrace the Clovis cult, and imagine that they all came from asingle source, a single race that walked across the Bering land bridge thousandsof years ago and dispersed throughout the Americas? Or do some tribes—holdingancient traditions that talk of white men or other foreigners landing in Americaand settling there long before Columbus—hold a secret belief that their originsare more recent than Clovis… or more ancient? Is it really a devaluation of theNative American population to insist that some of their ancestors arrived herefrom Carthage, or Iberia, or China, or Malaya, or even Wales or Ireland? Thereare those who insist that speculation about the mounds having been built byEuropeans, for instance, implies a kind of racism: as if the NativeAmericans—“savages,” after all—were incapable of building these complexesthemselves. But that is not the point.If the Native Americans are descendants of ancient European, Middle Eastern andSouth Asian races, then how are they devalued? It is accepted as gospel bynearly all archaeologists on both sides of the diffusionist/independentinventionist fence that the Native Americans did not originate in the Americasbut arrived there from other places. How does saying they walked across theBering Strait 12,000 years ago make them more unique or important as a race thansaying some of them arrived by boat from Africa, Europe, or Southeast Asia?The stories of the Mandan tribe certainly point to an interbreeding of nativepopulations with “white” foreigners. The Native American traditions are repletewith stories of ancient contact with European-type cultures, traditions fromCentral America and Mexico north to the Mandans themselves. By ignoring thesevenerable traditions and characterizing them as superstitious nonsense, do wenot do a much greater disservice to the Native Americans, a greater“devaluation”?There are sites on earth that are sacred to various religions and cults, as wein the West have been discovering and usually to our dismay. Jerusalem is sacredto Christians, Jews and Muslims alike. We know this, because we are all stillfighting over it, and the question of Jerusalem and “sacred land” in general hasled to devastating terrorist attacks by Muslims on Jewish and Christian targetsworldwide, in the somewhat dubious context of jihad, a word often translated as“holy war.” It has also led to the insufferable conditions experienced bydisplaced Palestinians, and their often obscene treatment by Europeanconquerors. In Jerusalem, there are sites more sacred still, and the Dome of theRock—a Muslim mosque built over part of King Solomon’s Temple—is perhaps theultimate target of religious fervor among Jews and Muslims alike, not to mentionthose Christians who believe that the Knights Templar discovered somethingimportant in the ruins of that temple, or that the Ark of the Covenant may stillbe buried there. It is a piece of land, nothing more, but it is invested with somuch importance that tens of thousands have been willing to die because of itover the years. Tens of thousands? Perhaps millions.There are mountains in Asia that are sacred to Buddhists, others to Hindus,still others to Daoists and yet still others to various animists and pantheists.There are sacred streams, sacred hills, sacred stones all over the earth. Thesesites are invested with supernatural power; and when the Europeans came toAmerica there were already in place sites sacred to the Native Americans, to theAztecs, the Incas, the Mayas… and to older races for which we have no genuinenomenclature, such as the Anasazi, the Adena, the Hopewell.The early Christians used to meet in catacombs, where the dead were buried. SomeTantric cults held initiations and other rituals in graveyards in India. InApril 1991 American archaeologists discovered catacombs at Casa Malpais,Arizona: tombs used for sacred rituals by Native Americans 800 years ago. Theworkbooks of the medieval sorcerers—such as those consulted by JosephSmith—stipulate still other locations as more suitable than most for raisingspirits, evoking demons, talking to God. The Chinese art of feng shui, sopopular these days in Asia and the West alike, is a means of orienting buildings(and the furniture and decorations within buildings) so as to direct the earth’senergy more profitably. The ancient Hindu practice of Vaastu is virtuallyidentical in intent.As Christianity became more sophisticated, it began the practice of buildingchurches over sites that had been sacred to its pagan predecessors. ChartresCathedral in France is one of these sites. The Church also practiced the ritualof siting the altar over the tomb or grave of a dead saint; failing that, theywould have the bones or other relics of a saint embedded in a special stone thatwould be placed beneath the altar. The bones of the sacred dead were essentialas a foundation for the ritual of the Mass. The Eastern Orthodox Christiansinvented the antimensia. This is a cloth into which sacred relics have beensewn. It is unfolded at the beginning of the liturgical service and lain uponthe altar as a base for the ritual. For some reason, the Church understands theimportance of these relics and has stipulated their absolute necessity for theperformance of the core ritual of the faith: the Divine Liturgy, or Mass, inwhich the miracle of transubstantiation takes place, the transformation of breadand wine into the body and blood of Jesus.If we follow this line of reasoning for a while—and it is a staple of the beliefsystem of hundreds of millions of Catholics and Orthodox believers—we can posita further instance in which some sites on earth are the opposite of these sacredsites, and some relics the opposite of these holy relics. We can even imaginethat it would be a sacrilege of no mean dimension to abuse the sanctity of thesacred site: for instance, to build a prison or a brothel over the grave of St.Peter the Apostle. And if the relics of the saints are necessary in order toform a supernatural link between present-day worshippers and the great chain oftransformation that can be traced directly back to Christ, then what of relicsof murderers, violent criminals, satanists, rapists? Does a lock of AdolfHitler’s hair hold the same supernatural force as a lock of the hair of St.Anthony, different only in kind and not in power?What if a prison were built over a site sacred to the Hindus, for instance? Whatif thousands of criminals were housed in stone and steel cages over the veryplace where once the Buddha slept, or the Goddess Athena worshipped, or wherethe Virgin of Fatima appeared? And if there is great spiritual solace to be hadin close proximity to the remains of a saint, what contagion should be fearedfrom the blood and bones of Heinrich Himmler, Josef Stalin… Ted Bundy?Americans seem to be unconsciously aware that the mounds are repositories ofsomething more than piles of crumbling bones. The famous Outlook Hotel inStephen King’s novel of horror and demonic possession, The Shining, was said tohave been built over an Indian burial mound. The house that was the scene ofterrifying paranormal phenomena in the film Poltergeist was also said to havebeen built on sacred Indian ground. Thus, our novelists and filmmakers seem toagree that there is a substrata of spiritual force—for good or evil—beneath thevery foundations of America’s towns and cities.And those that believe in sacred spaces—Native Americans, Europeans, Africans,or any of the other races that make up the American mosaic—what do they think ofthe mounds, the standing stones, the carved rocks, the buried tablets, and allthe other evidence of a culture, and a religion, that existed in America forthousands of years? What gods were worshipped in Kentucky? In West Virginia?Ohio? Indiana? New Hampshire? Rhode Island? Alabama? Georgia? in the thousandyears before the arrival of the Spanish Catholics and the English Puritans? AsAmerica has systematically engaged in a program of eradication of its aboriginalpopulation, it has simultaneously wiped out knowledge of its own origins. We areleft with rocks, bones, a few scraps of ancient language and a few scraps ofancient myth and tradition, and we attempt to build a coherent story of thehistory of the continents based on these poor remains. If there are such thingsas ghosts in this new age, this new reality, then who haunts the mounds? Whatlanguage do they speak? What gods do they believe in? And what do they want fromus?In 1909, the State of West Virginia acquired the Grave Creek mound, and beganits maintenance and refurbishment… with the assistance of prisoners from theState Penitentiary at Moundsville, which is across the street from the mound. Itis one of a number of prisons located at or near Adena mound sites, includingthe federal prison at Chillicothe which has housed Charles Manson and Henry LeeLucas.In 1950, the Garrison Dam was being planned for the Missouri River in NorthDakota. The existing Native American populations were pressured into signing yetanother treaty, this time ceding their ancient lands to the government. GeorgeGillette, the leader of the Hidatsa tribe, broke into tears as the lands of hispeople for over a thousand years were signed away forever.44[../Text/ch02.html#filepos367958] Hidatsa—and what was left of Mandan—sites weresubmerged in the flood, as if in fulfillment of an ancient prophecy about theend of the world.Although the story of Prince Madoc/King Arthur as it pertains to the NorthAmerican continent is not accepted by all historians, there are enough who findthat both the physical evidence and the written record support the legend of thevoyage as recorded in Welsh literature and the lore of the Cherokee nation.While some would object that the Welsh would be eager to prove that one of theirfamous ancestors had “discovered” America before Columbus, it is assumed thatthe Cherokee would have no such motive. In any event, the schizoid attitude ofAmerican archaeology towards theories of multiple migrations covering thousandsof years and from several different points of origin is enough to confound andobscure any attempt at a multidisciplinary approach to the problem, which iswhat it requires. An objective team of specialists in such fields asarchaeology, anthropology, archaeoastronomy, epigraphy, linguistics, genetics,and comparative religion (to name only a few) is needed before any kind ofconsensus on this very political question can be reached. Until then, we areforced to sit back and watch the experts duel with each other over theirrespective turfs, while the mounds, the tablets, the stone inscriptions, and thenative speakers of ancient languages are ignored and consigned to the literaldustbins of history.The existence of the Alabama River forts, their similarity to Welsh constructionof the period, the existence of the Mandans and their possibly Welsh vocabulary(a datum that Holand excludes from his study), and the stories of the Cherokeeelders—and the violent opposition of mainstream archaeologists and historianswho dismiss such traditions out of hand as so much fanciful smoke—all contributeto this bizarre chapter in American historiography. For example, the Daughtersof the American Revolution would erect, in 1953, a memorial to Prince Madoc andhis expedition of 1170 A.D. at Mobile Bay, Alabama. …and then, a few yearslater, take it down again.Yet, when the author visited Charles Manson’s hometown, the city of Ashland,Kentucky in 1990—nearly a decade before the controversial claim of Wilson andBlackett that King Arthur had visited America—he noted at the time the existenceof a “Camelot” supper club and lounge on Winchester Avenue… and had the stunningrealization that a string of Indian burial mounds occupied the center of town.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos232406] Cotton Mather, The Wonders of the InvisibleWorld, Boston, 1693, “Enchantments Encounter’d,” section V2 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos232878] Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America,Volume II, Part 2, Chapter XII3 [../Text/ch02.html#filepos235245] In correspondence with the author4 [../Text/Sinster_Forces_-_The_Nine_split_015.html#filepos243968] PeterLevenda, Unholy Alliance, Continuum, NY, 20025 [../Text/Sinster_Forces_-_The_Nine_split_016.html#filepos250027] Pilot episode6 [../Text/Sinster_Forces_-_The_Nine_split_017.html#filepos256736] See, forinstance, the works of University of Colorado Professor Vine Deloria, Jr.,himself a Native American and pro-diffusionist, who is quoted in Marc Stengel’sarticle in The Atlantic Monthly (note 8).7 [../Text/Sinster_Forces_-_The_Nine_split_017.html#filepos257245] The work ofDr. Svetla Balabanova—including the hair shaft test, which is a staple offorensic science—was detailed in a Channel Four UK broadcast on September 8,1996, “The Mystery of the Cocaine Mummies,” which also touched on diffusionism.8 [../Text/Sinster_Forces_-_The_Nine_split_017.html#filepos257748] See, forinstance, “The Diffusionists Have Landed,” by Marc K.

Two men—Alonzo Walling and ScottJackson—were arrested for murder after confessing to the crime. Self-proclaimeddevil worshippers and occultists, they refused to tell investigating authoritiesthe location of Pearl Bryan’s missing head, saying it would bring the wrath ofSatan upon them. They feared Satan more than death, because they were offeredlife in prison instead of execution if they gave up the head. They were hangednot far from the slaughterhouse, and Walling cursed his captors from the gallowsin a scene out of Nathaniel Hawthorne.Another young woman—a cabaret dancer known as Johana—committed suicide at theclub in the 1930s, but not before poisoning her father, a gangster who hadmurdered Johana’s boyfriend.

It was a frightening journey in and of itself. On the waydown, through West Virginia from my first stop-over in Washington, D.C., mylittle red Ford Mustang was caught in a violent summer thunderstorm in themountains. Shortly thereafter, I found myself skidding through a lake of bloodin the darkness.I was going to Ashland, Kentucky for several reasons. In the first place, it isthe town where Charles Manson grew up. It is also the birthplace of another vilekiller, Sedley Alley, who viciously murdered a beautiful and accomplished youngwoman, a Marine who wanted to be the first female Marine aviator. 8[../Text/ch03.html#filepos487049]Ashland is across the river from another town,Kenova in West Virginia, where serial killer Bobby Joe Long was born and raised.9 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos487469]It is in a kind of Bermuda Triangle of deathand depravity whose base line runs right through the town in northern Virginiawhere another serial killer, Henry Lee Lucas, was born. Appalachia. As a nativeNew Yorker, I found the very concept of Appalachia arousing feelings of terror,sadness and disgust. Dueling banjoes. In-breeding. Poverty.About fifty miles south of Ashland, in another Appalachian town—Inez,Kentucky—then-President Lyndon Johnson announced the War on Poverty in 1964. Hedid so outside a small shack in the hollow, to the backbeat of television crewsand print reporters. Twenty-eight years later, in 1992, that shack would stillstand and its once famous inhabitant, Tommy Fletcher, still lived there. Onlythis time, the television crews would return to report that he and his currentwife had been indicted for murder: for having children and then killing them offone by one for the insurance money. The body of their daughter, littlethree-year old Ella Rose Fletcher, had been exhumed and an autopsy showed shedied of an overdose of an anti-depressant and had also been sexually molested.Her four-year old brother, Tommy Fletcher, Jr., was hospitalized only a monthafter his sister’s death, showing the same symptoms of drug poisoning.There had been a five thousand dollar life insurance policy on each child. 10[../Text/ch03.html#filepos487915]The War on Poverty was another war we lost.It had been more than ten years since my solitary investigation of the remoteChilean torture center run by fugitive Germans in the Andes mountains. In thosedays, I had relied upon public transportation to get me to the rural communityof Parral from Chile’s capitol, Santiago, and then a taxi—a taxi!—from Parralinto the Andean foothills where Colonia Dignidad was located.Nazi hunting on a budget.Not exactly a James Bond scenario.Now, however, I was riding in style. It was early summer in 1990, almost exactlyeleven years later, and my research was taking me safely within the confines ofthe continental United States. I had my notes, a battered Toshiba T1000 laptopon the seat next to me, and a roadmap of West Virginia and Kentucky. I enjoyedlong drives, as long as I had a fully-functioning tape deck and a ready supplyof tapes with me.So. What could go wrong?As the afternoon turned to dusk in the hills of West Virginia outsideCharleston, a spectacular storm front moved in. I was pushing the littleconvertible up and down the hills, trying to make Ashland before it got toodark, but Nature had other plans. Sheets of torrential rain made it impossibleto see more than a few feet in front of me, and I had to pull over to the sideof the highway. Ahead of me, eighteen-wheelers had the same idea, and soon theshoulder was crowded with vehicles whose drivers had decided to wait out thestorm.Thunder boomed and reverberated in those hills, shaking the car like a Matchboxtoy and making me question, if only briefly, the wisdom of driving all the wayout to Ashland from my home in New England rather than trying a moreconventional approach. I could have flown down to any of the larger towns withina short drive of Ashland, such as Lexington or even Wheeling, but that wouldhave meant a full day of changing planes at regional airports, since, as thesaying goes, “you can’t get there from here.” Ashland—for all the world once amajor American industrial town—is simply too remote from the rest of the UnitedStates to be approached easily from air or land or river.I had to go to Ashland. I had convinced myself that only an on-the-spotconfrontation with the place would reveal any of its secrets. I wondered who, inthe days since the Tate/LaBianca killings, had bothered to travel all the way toAshland, Kentucky to get a feel for the place, to find out if a town could breeda killer (á la Hillary Clinton’s oft-repeated African phrase, “It takes avillage to raise a child”), or if evil had other ways of propagating itself. Tomost Americans in 1969, the Manson story was a California story: morespecifically, a Southern California, or Los Angeles, story. ConservativeAmericans—in 1969, in the midst of the war in Vietnam and politicaldemonstrations and protest marches at home—felt justified in putting down thesavagery of the attacks on the Hollywood celebrities as the sort of thing thathappens in California. After all, wasn’t California the scene of the “summer oflove” and all that hippie madness? No one saw the Manson murders as the resultof Appalachia crashing into Beverly Hills, like a couple of good ole boys in abattered pickup on a Saturday night, all whoops and hollers and jangling beercans and rifle racks, smashing into a gazebo on a society lady’s lawn. No. Whatneither the society lady nor the good ole boys would ever recognize is that theyare both Americans; that only happens when there’s a war on, and the societylady needs the good ole boys to defend the gazebo. When there is no war, thegood ole boys turn on the gazebo and smash it to smithereens.And there was no chance in hell that Charlie Manson would ever see the junglesof Vietnam.All the records say that Charles Manson was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. 11[../Text/ch03.html#filepos488326]It makes sense that his mother, KathleenMaddox, would have traveled that far up river from Ashland to have the baby,since it was born out of wedlock on November 12, 1934 to a sixteen-year-oldgirl. The father is believed to have been one “Colonel Scott,” about whom notmuch else is known. One can imagine the scene of a possibly much older ColonelScott and the suddenly pregnant teenager in Ashland in 1934: the latter beingrushed off to Ohio to have the baby in secret, away from the prying eyes of asmall Southern town, the former wondering if his reputation among friends andfamily would have been harmed by the revelation, or quite possibly just thereverse. We will never know. It is believed that Colonel Scott died in 1954,although even this has not been officially confirmed. Colonel Scott’s brother,Darwin Orell Scott, was only twenty-seven at the time Charles Manson was born;when he was butchered to death in 1969, he was already sixty-four. If Darwin wasthe younger brother, then Colonel Scott may have been in his thirties at thetime Kathleen got pregnant. The military title “Colonel” is suggestive, but notconclusive. After all, it was Kentucky that gave us “Colonel Sanders,” a man whowas not exactly a war hero. Yet, oddly enough, there is no record of a firstname for Colonel Scott, even though he was sued—successfully—by Kathleen in 1936for paternity of little Charlie. Scott agreed to pay the princely sum oftwenty-five dollars in settlement, plus another five dollars a month forCharlie’s upkeep. By this time, Charlie was known as Charles Milles Manson.Kathleen had married a William Manson—a much older man—after Charlie’s birth,and that is how “No Name Maddox” became Charles Manson. William Manson himselfdisappeared from Kathleen’s life not much later.Charlie wound up being parked with Kathleen’s relatives in small towns all upand down the Ohio River—in Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia—while Kathleen hadher various adventures. One of these involved robbing a gas station with herbrother, Luke, in 1939. The sibling desperadoes used soda bottles as theirweapon of choice, knocking out the station attendant with them and robbing thetill. Kathleen and Luke were apprehended and Kathleen was sentenced to fiveyears in the state prison at Moundsville, West Virginia in the heart of burialmound territory. During that time, Charlie was sent to live first with a veryreligious grandmother, and then with an aunt and uncle in McMechen, a town a fewmiles outside of Moundsville, where the Grave Creek mound is located and wherethe infamous “Phoenician” tablet was discovered. Charlie was only five years oldat the time.Dr. Joel Norris, a sort of serial killer ambulance chaser and not the mostreliable when it comes to names, dates and places (McMechen, West Virginiabecomes “Maychem, Virginia” for instance)12 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos489453]recounts a story that Manson was forced to go to school in a girl’s dress by hisuncle, who thought the boy was a “sissy.” (Norris also claims that Manson wasborn in Ashland; this is possible, of course, but I have been unable to findcorroboration of this theory.) The “sissy” story is claimed as true by Manson,although others—such as his being sold for a pitcher of beer by his mother to abarmaid—are probably apocryphal.What is known for sure is that Kathleen was paroled in 1942, took charge of hereight-year-old son, and led another series of adventures with drunken “uncles”in three states. In 1947, the court sent Charles Manson to a home for boys inTerre Haute, Indiana, where he remained for ten months before escaping andreturning to his mother, at the age of thirteen. Kathleen by this time haddecided she had seen enough of her son, so he ran away again and began a life ofcrime, breaking into stores, stealing whatever he could find, until finally thecourts got hold of him again and sent him, of all places, to Father Flanagan’sBoys Town!The 1938 film Boys Town starred Spencer Tracy as Father Flanagan and MickeyRooney as one of his tougher challenges. Somehow, it is difficult to pictureMickey Rooney playing Charles Manson, aside from the fact that both gentlemenare somewhat on the short side. Flanagan’s experiment was considered a kind ofboot camp for juvenile delinquents—and, of course, had been made famous tenyears earlier by the Spencer Tracy film, which won several Oscars—but Charliedidn’t last a week. He and a friend broke out, stole a car, and made their wayto Peoria, robbing a store and a casino along the way. His friend’s uncle—asmall-time thief in Peoria—began using them for small B&E (breaking andentering) jobs until they were caught once again, and this time Manson was sentto a more serious home in Indiana, where he remained for three years, untilbreaking out once more at the age of sixteen. He was apprehended after a stringof crimes in 1951 and sent to another “school for boys” …this one in Washington,D.C., the National Training School for Boys, a secure institution which was runmore like a prison and which was, indeed, under the jurisdiction of the Bureauof Prisons.That was in March. By October, he had managed to convince the school’spsychiatrist that he was trustworthy enough to be transferred to aminimum-security “home”: the National Bridge Camp. There, things got only worse.While his aunt had visited the Camp and told the board that she was willing andable to provide a home for Charlie, he managed to ruin his chances of an earlyparole by sodomizing another boy while holding a razor blade at the edge of hisvictim’s throat. He was transferred to the Federal Reformatory at Petersburg,Virginia instead. While there, he was deemed very dangerous, and sent on to theFederal Reformatory at Chillicothe, Ohio on September 22, 1952.One wonders what subterranean telluric forces were at work that day. Chillicotheis, of course, the center of the American Mound culture discussed in the lastchapter. September 22 was the autumnal equinox, one of the importantastronomical dates around which the ritual mounds were designed. A month afterhis transfer to Chillicothe, he suddenly became a model inmate. He did so wellthat on January 1, 1954 he was given a Meritorious Service Award. Then, on May 8of that year—the same year it is believed his father, Colonel Scott, died—he wasparoled back to McMechen (and the site of the Grave Creek Mound) to live withhis mother. From Mound to Mound. At this time he was nineteen years old.It is a mystery. What happened to Manson in Chillicothe, that he suddenly becamestudious (he was still illiterate when he was transferred there), learned toread and write and do simple arithmetic, mellowed out, and became a star“prisoner”? His psychiatric reports were all negative up to that point; evenduring the first month at Chillicothe the doctors were despairing of him,believing that he needed a closed environment and not the relatively “open”ambience of Chillicothe. Then, suddenly, Manson became a different person andmaintained that identity for over a year and a half, until his release. Thatdegree of conscious control—especially in a disturbed, uneducated, illiterate,violent, criminal, sodomitic bastard child of an unmarried, alcoholic mother—issuspicious, if not alarming. Was Charlie “helped” by someone at Chillicothe?According to Manson himself, in his own words, “I stopped thinking in 1954.”13[../Text/ch03.html#filepos490581]John Gilmore, in his critically-acclaimed 1971 biography of Manson and the“family”—The Garbage People, retitled Manson: The Unholy Trail of Charlie andthe Family—says that Manson met a “boy named Toby” at Chillicothe, from whom helearned hypnosis and mental manipulation. That may be so, but the dates inGilmore’s book seem to be wrong. He has Manson at Chillicothe as early asOctober 1951, but according to Bugliosi he didn’t make it to Chillicothe untilSeptember 1952. Perhaps it is only a typographical error in Gilmore’s book,because October 1952 is a very likely date for Manson to have met the mysterious“Toby,” a person Manson refers to as “definitely satanic,” and the only personof whom Manson ever speaks in tones both of fear and awe.During this time, US government agencies were conducting medical tests amongvarious inmate populations in America. Their most prized subjects were violentcriminals—sociopaths like Charles Manson—whom they dosed with massive amounts ofdrugs to gauge personality changes, emotional response, and other parametersthat have never been revealed. While sworn testimony before Congress in the1970s is evidence that prisons were used for these experiments, and often theprisoners themselves were made aware of what was being done to them, theidentities of the actual institutions as well as the doctors involved (with afew exceptions) are not known today. Those documents were shredded beforetestimony could be given. We will examine all of this in greater detail in thechapters that follow, but for now it is well to keep these questions in mind:What happened to Charles Man-son in Chillicothe, Ohio in 1952? Did governmentexperimentation extend from the adult prison population to reformatories forjuvenile delinquents? Is there any other evidence that children were used assubjects or guinea pigs in medical experimentation? The rain finally lifted andwe all—my fellow drivers and I—began to get back onto the highway and make ourway through the hollers and to our respective destinations. Except that now itwas getting really dark.In the West Virginia hills that time of year the fog and mist sets in with avengeance. You drive up a hill out of the fog and for a blessed moment you cansee in front of you, only to start back down the other side of the hill intomore fog. It can be impenetrable, a thick soup of whiteness as dangerous as thedarkest night. It was early summer, so the ground was still cold, and when itmeets the warmth and humidity of the newly thawed air, the fog becomes the goodman’s enemy and the bad man’s friend. It swirls around your car’s headlightslike the dry-ice smoke of a low-budget horror flick, and I remembered HorrorHotel and other campy fright films of the early 1960s that always involved asilent small town, shrouded in mist and fog, and maniacal killers on the loose.I drove in silence, realizing that I had neglected to put in a tape and probablydid so because it seemed oddly sacrilegious to play music in the gatheringgloom. Or maybe it was because the victims in those horror films are alwaysdriving around late at night with the radio playing in the moments before…There, in front of me, I could see a car pulled over on the shoulder. For amoment I thought the people in the car were in distress. The flashers wereblinking, and I slowed down to see if they needed any help. The car’s interiorlight was on, and I saw clearly a man and a woman arguing vehemently oversomething. I could almost hear them scream over the sound of my own tires andthe wind rushing past the windshield.I drove on.Back into the fog, back into the night.A little further on, there was another car pulled over onto the shoulder, butthis time on the opposite side of the road from me, and pointing in the wrongdirection. Again, the flashers were on. Again, there seemed to be some sort ofaltercation in the car which this time contained two adults in the front seatand at least two children that I could see in the back seat. The front of thecar appeared to be damaged, but if the huge dent in the hood and front fenderwas recent or not, I couldn’t tell. This was too strange; the idea of two suchcars on opposite sides of the road on this miserable night, removed enough fromeach other that their circumstances were not related in any obvious way, was alittle unsettling.I drove on.And then, suddenly, I see in front of me an eighteen-wheeler’s rear lightsemerging from the night and fog. I realize that I am probably driving too fast,or the truck driver is going too slow. I brake down to about 20 mph and watch inhorror as the huge trailer veers sharply out of our lane into the oncoming lane.As I come up to the same place, ready to swerve onto the shoulder if necessary,the truck angles back onto the right lane and continues on as before. Thank Godthere was no oncoming traffic as the highway is relatively deserted. Aside fromthe two cars that have pulled over, and now the eighteen-wheeler in front of me,there is no one else I can see on the highway.And at that moment I notice there are dozens of red eyes staring at me out ofthe darkness from my side of the road.It took me a moment to realize the eyes belonged to a herd of deer waiting tocross the highway, and as soon as that registered, a terrible sight changed theeerie drive into a tragic one. In front of me, and at the place where the truckhad suddenly veered off into the oncoming lane, was the body of a huge stag, itsantlers reaching up like beseeching fingers into the night, wisps of fogtrailing the points like torn lace and fading memories.There was blood all over the highway, and I had to perform the same maneuver asthe truck before me, or else it would have been a toss-up as to which would havewon the encounter: the corpse of a large deer or a little red Mustangconvertible. As I drove sickeningly through the freshly-spilled blood of thedeer I thought that such a sacrifice was probably a most appropriate welcome tothe land of the serial killer and the mass murderer.On the way into Kenova, West Virginia from Huntington—in an area surrounded byother towns with names like Hurricane, Tornado, Nitro, and the gruesomelyappropriate Scary—one passes through the town of St. Albans. There one sees—orsaw, in those days not so long ago—a video game parlor with the unlikely name of“Red Dragon.” Fans of the novels of Thomas Harris know that Red Dragon is thetitle of the first in his Hannibal Lecter series, made famous by the moviesSilence of the Lambs, Hannibal, and Manhunter. In fact, Manhunter was the firstmovie made from Red Dragon, and is in many ways as powerful as Silence of theLambs. Readers may remember that Hannibal Lecter was a psychiatrist who was alsoa vicious serial killer. Apprehended, and serving the rest of his life inprison, Lecter would be visited by FBI profilers who would hope to understandthe mind of the serial killer through conversations with this highly intelligentkiller-in-captivity.Lecter is a fictional creation, but the concept contains many elements that willconfront us later as we poke behind the curtain of popular fiction to see themuch stranger, and much more frightening, truth it disguises. Seeing the RedDragon roadhouse on my way into Kenova—and, from there, a few minutes later intoAshland—only served as an omen telling me I was on the right track.In January 1955 Manson married Rosalie Jean Willis, a seventeen-year-old girlfrom McMechen who worked in a hospital. Although he held a variety of jobs for awhile, he could not keep out of trouble and wound up stealing cars and drivingthem across state lines. Taking stolen goods across state lines is, of course, afederal offense and Charlie was caught, as usual. Only this time, he had apregnant seventeen-year-old wife. He drove a stolen car to Los Angeles, wasapprehended, pled guilty, and asked the court for psychiatric help, for somereason referring back to his time in Chillicothe. The judge so ordered, and hewas examined by Dr. Edwin Ewart McNiel in October 1955.Dr. McNiel had been chief resident psychiatrist at Payne Whitney PsychiatricClinic at New York Hospital in the 1930s, before moving to Honolulu where heheld similar posts, then moving on to Los Angeles in 1944 and going into privatepractice while also working as a consulting psychiatrist to the court system inLos Angeles. Thus, he should be considered eminently qualified to offer anopinion on Manson’s mental capacity.Dr. McNiel felt that Charlie—a poor risk under ordinary circumstances—might bepermitted probation under supervision since he was now a husband and father.McNiel recognized that Manson had problems, but held out hope that marriage andfatherhood would have a socializing affect on the young man. The court agreed,and gave Manson five years probation with no prison term.Unfortunately, while waiting for a hearing on another stolen vehicle charge (forwhich he would have probably also received only probation) Manson decided to gowalkabout. He did not show up for his hearing, and a warrant was issued. He madeit as far as Indiana before he was picked up in Indianapolis in March 1956, whenprobation was revoked, and he was sent to Terminal Island in California to servea three year sentence.His son—Charles Manson, Jr.—was born in March of that same year. On August 30,1957, Charles Manson, Sr. and Rosalie Willis Manson were divorced.THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIESDue to the thunderstorm, the dead deer, and the whole bizarre gestalt of thetrip thus far, I had only made it as far as Huntington before deciding that Ishould probably stop for the night and drive on into Kenova and Ashland in themorning, in the comforting light of day. I also did not know what facilitieswould be available in either town that late at night, so I found a small hotelin Huntington that had a room available for the night.There is a certain gentility, a soft-spoken dignity, that seems natural to partsof the South, and which disconcerts Northeasterners when they confront it forthe first time. A native New Yorker—from the Bronx, no less—I am alwayspleasantly surprised by it, even though I realize that it is simply good mannersand not a reflection of a particularly enlightened or lofty state of mind orbeing. But, then, good manners are usually more reliable than lofty states ofmind. The elderly lady at the reception desk greeted me warmly and kindly—notwith false effusion, but as one human being to another—and I felt some of thetension of the drive slough off my nervous system like an old snakeskin. Therewas a lot of commotion in the place, and I discovered that a wedding receptionwas being held in the main hall as guests began pouring out into the lobby.I made my way to my room for the night, arms filled with computer, maps, books,and small suitcase. Once ensconced, I pulled open the map and traced my journeythus far through the winding country roads of West Virginia. Huntington is onlyabout fifty miles downriver from Point Pleasant, the scene of one of America’sworst tragedies… and also one of its strangest. Covered extensively in John A.Keel’s cult classic, The Mothman Prophecies, it was also made into a moviestarring Richard Gere and released in 2002.The basic outline of the story is that, on November 15, 1966, a strange creaturewas sighted about ten miles north of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. It was seenat night, was about six-six or seven feet tall, with what appeared to be wingsfolded against its back. It seemed to be male, and the most startlingthing—aside from the wings—was the pair of huge red eyes, two inches indiameter, six inches apart on its face. It was clearly not completely human,according to the eye witnesses (no pun intended), but walked upright like a man.Thus was the legend of Mothman born.Accompanying the sightings of Mothman were strange electrical disturbances, suchas bizarre patterns on television sets, phones ringing with either no one at theother end or a kind of strange buzzing sound, plus weird warbles on policeradio, etc. The thing actually seemed to fly, and in at least one instance wasknown to have chased a car full of people, and in another a Red Crossbloodmobile filled with whole blood on its way to Huntington, the town where Iwas now staying the night. As usual, the witnesses were average, normal peopleliving typically American lives: people, that is, with no ulterior motive, nohidden agenda. These were not UFO enthusiasts or college kids out on a prank.The sightings began to take place quite regularly all up and down thatmound-ridden stretch of the Ohio River—from Marietta, Parkersburg and pointssouth—but centered on the town of Point Pleasant.Exactly thirteen months later, to the day, the sightings abruptly stopped.Everyone in Point Pleasant remembers the date—December 15, 1967—because that isalso the date of the Silver Bridge disaster, the worst bridge disaster inAmerican history. The bridge, spanning the Ohio River between West Virginia andOhio, was full of cars and trucks at rush hour, people out buying Christmaspresents or going to and from company Christmas parties or just trying to gethome. At 5:04 P.M. the bridge collapsed, causing vehicles and the people insidethem to plummet to the icy river below. Forty-six people died, more than sixtyvehicles were lost to the river. Two persons were never found.And the Mothman was seen no more after that day.John Keel wonders if the appearance of the Mothman was somehow related to theupcoming bridge disaster, hence the title of his book, The Mothman Prophecies.Are supernatural events harbingers of some impending doom? If so, how tocorrelate the appearance of a creature, half human and half bird of prey, to afailing bridge? There is either more or less to this than meets the eye.There are many designs of raptorial birds among the Adena and Hopewellartifacts, and Keel mentions other mythical birds, such as the IndonesianGaruda, that have appeared throughout history all over the world; he even goesso far as to tie in the Indian burial mounds as somehow related to thephenomenon, linking them to the great burial mounds of Europe. As demonstratedin previous chapters, there is a distinct possibility that some of these moundswere either constructed by Europeans or by people using the same technology asthe Europeans, and even the same (or similar) belief systems. The Tumulus(“mound”) culture of Central Europe, for instance, was prevalent in the secondmillennium B.C. and was probably trading with cultures in the Middle East atthat time, such as Egypt and what was left of the vanishing Sumeriancivilization. 14 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos490916]This culture was known,obviously, for their use of burial mounds and for their practice of buryingvaluable commodities with their dead, as was the case in the Adena and Hopewellcultures in America. Neolithic burial mounds are to be found all over NorthernEurope and the British Isles, and later, in Ireland, these burial mounds wereknown as sidh and were believed to be centers of supernatural power andotherworldly beings. 15 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos491355]The concept of sidh isfamous in Irish folklore, and has come to represent the Celtic underworld ingeneral, the domain of ghosts, fairies and other supernatural beings. Accordingto poet and novelist Robert Graves in his infamous study of Celtic mythology,The White Goddess, the mounds were known as Caer Sidi or the “Fortress of theSidi” who were the ancient magicians of Ireland. The Caer Sidi was also known asthe Castle of Ariadne and linked to the Corona Borealis. To be buried theremeant that the body was returned to the earth, but the spirit had gone toAriadne’s Castle or, equally, to the Corona Borealis. 16[../Text/ch03.html#filepos491642]There was even a British occult society basedon Druidic lore which had, as its inner and most secret circle, The MoundBuilders. Members of this group would figure prominently in the 19th centurycreation of the legendary British occult lodge the Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn, and would include MacGregor Mathers, Allan Bennett and others famous fromGolden Dawn days, 17 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos492144]thus reinforcing the link(at least in the eyes of occultists) between the mound-builder culture andsecret, supernatural forces.The reader may wonder why Graves—a poet and novelist, famed for King Jesus; I,Claudius and other historical works—is referenced as an authority. Aside fromthe fact that Graves’ research on ancient mythology is excellent, documented anddependable, the reader may be comforted in the knowledge that Graves was a closefriend of William Sargant, author of the standard text on mind control andbrainwashing, The Battle for the Mind, to which book Graves even contributed achapter. According to Sargant’s introduction, he credits Graves with havingencouraged him to complete the work while he stayed at Graves’ home in Majorca,Spain. As for Graves himself, The White Goddess was a canonical text of theEuropean and American witchcraft revival of the 1970s, a book not read so muchas handled like a talisman by devotees of the Wicca movement. Sargant isimportant to our thesis for other reasons, not least that he was also acolleague of Frank Olson, the biochemical warfare expert who was murdered in NewYork City at the height of the Cold War, a case to which we shall return in alater chapter. Thus, this strange nexus of mythologist and mind control expertis one of many reference points or “cultural traces” in our strange matrix wherethe spoor of sinister forces may be discerned.The fact that the ancient mound builders were fascinated with birds of prey andcarved their likenesses into their ornamentation could be seen as a reference toa mythical bird-like creature, which would “dovetail” nicely with Keel’s passingreferences to the mounds as possible referants for the Mothman phenomenon.Keel mentions another odd fact, something that would stick in the back of mymind as I worked at collecting data for this book. He mentions the discoverythat Native Americans shunned West Virginia, and that no Indian tribes can beidentified as indigenous to that State. 18 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos492695]Herefers to maps of pre-Columbian tribes worked out by modern anthropologists andpublished by Hammond in which the area we know as West Virginia is marked as“uninhabited.” No one seems to know why the Indians didn’t settle there, whenthe land itself would certainly have supported a large population in terms offish, game, and vegetation. What is found in West Virginia, however, arepetroglyphs and other evidence in stone pointing to the existence of wanderingEuropeans. There is also a heavy concentration of Adena sites northwest andnortheast of Charleston, along the Kanawha and Elk Rivers, sites that date tothe first millennium B.C. 19 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos493155] Keel wonders ifthe Native Americans avoided West Virginia because of something they knew, andsomething the Europeans didn’t know. Something inherently strange about theplace. A sinister force.After a few more hours of unanswered questions, scribbled notes and scraps ofpaper stuck into research material as bookmarks, fatigue eventually claimed me,and I fell asleep—fully clothed and with the lights still on—amidst a pile ofbooks and maps and vague, unsettling terrors. The wedding party downstairs haddispersed into cars, limos and pickup trucks and a new couple was about to begintheir lives in the shadow of ancient secrets.Kathleen Maddox moved to Los Angeles at the time of Charles’s incarceration atTerminal Island, evidently to be near her son. This is one of thoserelationships that simply defies any kind of rational explanation. When Charleswas growing up in Ashland, it seemed Kathleen had no time at all for him and,indeed, for a while he lived by himself as a young teenager, earning a living bystealing. Suddenly, though, Kathleen develops maternal instincts and followsCharlie around the country from one lock-up to another, from one prison term toanother. Charles is married to Rosalie, who is pregnant and who moves in withKathleen while Charlie is “inside.” This arrangement will not last long,however, and by March 1957 Rosalie is living with another man and stops visitingCharles in prison. Their divorce—begun in 1957—is finalized in 1958.At Terminal Island, Charles is tested again by prison psychiatrists. This time,his IQ has climbed to 121, a substantial improvement over his score atChillicothe. His verbal skills have noticeably increased, and he enrolls in aDale Carnegie course, only to quit after a few weeks out of either pique orboredom. When he is seen as trustworthy, he is transferred to a Coast Guardstation which is minimal security, but he is found hot-wiring a car in theparking lot and is slammed back inside to serve the remainder of his term.He gets out on September 30, 1958, hooks up with a pimp in Malibu while underFBI surveillance, and begins running whores himself. He gets picked up on aforged check charge—shades of his uncle, Darwin Scott—and is arrested onceagain.This, of course, is another federal offense. He cuts a deal with a judge, and isexamined by Dr. McNeil once again. He is found to be a sociopathic personality,but without psychosis. (In layman’s terms, we might translate that as “evil, butnot crazy.”) Dr. McNeil recommends against probation.At this time, a young lady presented herself as the mother of Manson’s unbornchild. This turned out not to be true, but Leona—even though a convictedprostitute under the name Candy Stevens—managed to sway the judge’s emotions,and Manson was released on probation once again. This was on September 28, 1959,almost exactly a year to the day after he was released from Terminal Island. Heand Leona would marry that year, only to get divorced in 1963 when Charlie wasagain in prison, a replay of his marriage with Rosalie. In addition, a son wasborn to Leona and named Charles Luther Manson.By December 1959, a scant two months after he was released, he was arrested oncemore by LAPD, but set free for lack of evidence on a stolen car rap. Instead, hebegan running women across state lines from California to New Mexico forpurposes of prostitution—another federal violation—and wound up indicted onceagain after a man filed a complaint against him for raping his nineteen-year-olddaughter and stealing her savings during a typical “Hollywood” scam, in whichManson posed as a radio and television producer. The judge issued a benchwarrant since Manson had disappeared by this time, but he was picked up in Texaswhere he had been pimping and brought back to Los Angeles. An irate judgesentenced him to the US Penitentiary at McNeil Island, Washington, in July 1961,where he would remain until March 21, 1967. The vernal equinox.During this time, Manson became involved with Scientology and it’s this interestthat has fueled a lot of the speculation concerning other influences at work inManson’s life. The creation of a small-time science fiction writer and would-beoccultist, Scientology has been described as either a cult or a scam, or both,depending on which journalist, investigator or “survivor” you read. It hasattracted celebrity membership, including John Travolta and Tom Cruise, as partof a concerted effort to win followers among Hollywood stars; it has alsoconspired against US Government agencies and been conspired against in turn. Itsfounder, L. Ron Hubbard, was a former Navy officer with a history of mentalproblems. He was a colleague of Jack Parsons, the rocket scientist and followerof Aleister Crowley. All of this will be discussed in more detail in thechapters that follow, as it bears heavily on our thesis, but suffice it to saythat Scientology in the early 1960s was just coming into its own, recruitingheavily on street corners, and had obviously penetrated the prison system aswell. An offshoot of Scientology is the Process Church of the Final Judgment,and Manson was believed to have been involved with the Process as well.We are in a dangerous place here, because it is too easy to equate membership inan organization with that organization’s blessing for every endeavor undertakenby the member. The fact that most of the Nazi hierarchy were born and baptizedCatholics, for instance, does not mean that the Nazi Party was a branch of theCatholic Church. The fact that Manson seems to have been involved on some levelwith the Process does not mean that the Process is guilty—from a legalstandpoint—of complicity in Manson’s crimes.Yet, there is another dimension of culpability that transcends a legalinterpretation of cause and effect. To use the previous example, while theCatholic Church cannot be held accountable for the actions of its lay members,it is tempting to consider the Church responsible for creating the type ofenvironment (authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, belief in supernatural events,etc.) in which such a creature as the Nazi Party could come to exist. We do nothold parents legally accountable for the criminal acts of their children nomatter what the age of the child, minor or adult; but we routinely examine thechildhood of criminal offenders to determine where the “problem” originated. Aviolent or abusive childhood is considered prime breeding ground for a violentand abusive adult, and particularly of the phenomenon known as DissociativeIdentity Disorder (the former Multiple Personality Disorder); Manson’s caseseems to illustrate this.Therefore, what effect do cults have on their followers from the standpoint ofmoral responsibility? As cults try to act as surrogate families for theirmembers, do they not recreate the conditions of childhood and “mold” theirmembers in such a way as to make them model “children” of the cult, carrying outthe cult’s agenda whether expressed or implied? The author intentionally usesthe term “cult” here, rather than “religion,” because a cult is generally basedon a more recent revelation or illumination than an established religion: thismeans that the charisma of the leadership is still trembling from its contactwith the supernatural forces it represents to its followers, and attempts tocreate a complete environment within which the cult members function, based onthis revelation. Coupled with this is the understanding that organizedreligion—older, larger, more powerful—would frown on this new, unauthorizedcontact with the supernatural and would disavow any message received by the cultleadership, thus putting the cult in an uneasy position. Like most organizationswho believe themselves vulnerable to outside influences, cults tend to becomeinsular and to develop a siege mentality vis-á-vis other religions, other cults,the government (perceived to be a tool or instrument of whatever religion ispredominant), and eventually the whole world. Further, cult leadershiprecognizes that its members are all former adherents of other religions, cults,etc., and that the pernicious psychological effects of the previous, competingreligion must be neutralized to make way for the “new” revelation. This has ledto accusations of “brainwashing” or “programming,” and the development of acottage industry in “deprogrammers,” who kidnap cultists—usually by request ofconcerned family members—and attempt to neutralize the effects of the cult’spsychological conditioning by, quite often, using the same techniques the cultitself used in the first place.Manson was involved enough with Scientology at one point to have picked up thejargon and to pass himself off as a “clear”: someone who had passed through allof Scientology’s “deprogramming” levels and reached the stage where previoussocial, environmental, perhaps even genetic influences no longer had any effecton decision-making, emotional stability, etc. He had a Scientology “auditor” inprison, another Scientologist called Lanier Ramer, who—Manson claimed—broughthim to the level of “clear” or, more accurately, “theta clear.” (Ramer wouldstay close to the Manson Family, even after the murders, as we shall see.) Thathe actually passed through all of these levels in prison, however, is doubtful,and it is more likely that he simply borrowed the language and the attitude ofScientologists. An indication of this might be his attempt to remain in prison:according to Vincent Bugliosi (the Manson prosecutor in the Tate/LaBianca case)Manson had begged prison officials to let him remain there.20[../Text/ch03.html#filepos493510] He knew he could not adjust to the outsideworld. In fact, his prison reviews said the same thing. Regardless, CharlesManson was freed on March 21, 1967.The drive from Huntington to Kenova and then to Ashland was undertaken on abeautiful summer’s day, quite a difference from the night before. I stopped fora while in tiny Kenova, the birthplace of Bobby Joe Long, a serial killercaptured in Tampa, Florida in 1983 and accused of nine murders and more thanfifty rapes in a string of crimes known as the “Classified Ad Rapist” case.Long’s childhood was oddly similar to Manson’s in several ways, although Longwas much younger (born on October 14, 1953). Growing up with an attractivesingle mother, who moved from place to place and had a succession of lovers, hisearliest experiences were mirror images of Manson’s. And where Manson was madeto wear a dress to his first day of school, Bobby Joe Long had an even greaterproblem.A congenital endocrine system dysfunction was responsible for Bobby Joe’sbreasts. By the age of eleven, his breasts had grown so embarrassingly largethat surgery was necessary and, according to his mother, six pounds of fleshwere removed from his chest at that time. Gender confusion seems to be anotherelement Manson and Long had in common; Manson, with his short stature andbaby-face, made to wear a dress to school, sodomitically raped by guards andother inmates at a succession of reformatories and prisons; and Long, withactual female breasts and associated problems related to the endocrinedysfunction.But while Manson’s experience of institutional life was devoted completely toprisons and reformatories, Long enlisted in the Army. It was an optimisticattempt at sorting out his life, but it ended badly. Six months into hisenlistment, he crashed his motorcycle into a car while doing about sixty-fivemiles per hour. He sustained substantial head injuries, from which he suffereddebilitating effects for the rest of his life, and which—after two years ofbizarre behavior—put paid to his idea of a career in the Armed Forces. Theneurological damage he experienced was severe, but went undiagnosed anduntreated for more than ten years (until after his arrest for multiple murders).This was in addition to four previous head traumas, all experienced when Longwas still a child and before his chest surgery. (The traumas were all related tofalls, and do not seem to be the result of abuse by his mother or other adults.)The aggregate effect of all this trauma was to severely affect his nervoussystem, contributing to blinding headaches, impaired vision, and other symptoms.The “other symptoms” were probably the most distressing. Long developed anenormous and uncontrollable sexual appetite, having sex with his young wifeCindy several times a day and then masturbating as well. He left the Army andhad a job for a while as an x-ray technician, but lost that job when it wasdiscovered he was making women undress for the x rays.Finally, after a few more run-ins with the law, Long began a career as a serialrapist in Florida, using the classified ads in local newspapers to troll forvictims. He would find an ad offering to sell furniture or other household itemsand would make an appointment to visit the seller during the day, when it wasmost likely going to be a housewife who would answer the door. He committed morethan fifty rapes in this manner.The murders were committed largely upon women he picked up in bars or, moreaccurately, who picked him up. He was angered by women who he believed weremanipulating him, and he detested prostitutes (which seems to be a hallmark ofserial killers), so these women he raped and then murdered for a total of ninevictims. He was eventually caught after letting his latest victim, aseventeen-year-old girl, go free, and he was sentenced to death in Florida. 21[../Text/ch03.html#filepos493810]Examination by Dr. Dorothy Ortnow Lewis of the Medical Center at NYU showedsevere damage to Long’s brain in several places, and concomitant neurologicaldisorders. Long was clearly brain-damaged, and his crimes must be seen in lightof this fact. The thorniest problem of modern jurisprudence is judging when actsbecome wholly voluntary or wholly involuntary, and where to draw the line.Long’s own testimony shows that he was aware that what he was doing was wrong,but was unable to control his behavior. Our usual understanding of the humanwill is that knowing an act is wrong automatically determines guilt when thatact is committed. Since Long knew the rapes and murders were wrong, he istherefore guilty regardless of whether or not his limbic system permitted himany degree of choice in his behavior. But was Long willfully committing thesecrimes?In order to answer that, we have to understand the degree to which all of ourbehavior is willed or automatic; this is the crux of the problem. It was thefocus of one of the twentieth century’s most ambitious explorations of the humanmind—an exploration worthy of comparison to the search by Renaissance kings forthe Philosopher’s Stone—and it is the subject of a later chapter on the CIA’smind control programs. For now, as I passed through the town of Kenova onceagain on my way to Ashland, the question had to remain unanswered.Crossing the Big Sandy River between West Virginia and Kentucky, one rounds ahill and suddenly comes upon the huge Ashland Oil plant at Catlettsburg, asuburb of Ashland. It is a surreal sight in the middle of the Appalachiancountryside: smoke stacks reaching for the sky, atwinkle with blinking,different-colored lights and plumes of lethal-looking smoke, representing acombined production of diesel, gasoline, and chemicals: an ambience not unlikethe Blade Runner skyline of Elizabeth, New Jersey. I suddenly wondered if I hadsolved the problem of the serial killer phenomenon in Appalachia: toxicchemicals from the Catlettsburg plant?Due to Ashland’s strategic location at the confluence of two rivers—the Ohio andthe Big Sandy—and at the borders of three states (Kentucky, Ohio and WestVirginia), it seemed like a logical place to build factories which could takeadvantage of the river traffic to move products in three directions. Indeed, thecity brochure I picked up on that trip in 1990 characterizes Ashland as a town“Where Southern Charm blends with the Industrial Northeast.”22[../Text/ch03.html#filepos494145] ARMCO Steel was founded there in 1900, andthere are nineteenth-century iron furnaces on the tourist trail, such as theClinton Furnace, the Princess Furnace and the Vesuvius Furnace. The first ironsmelting furnace was built in 1818, the Argillite Furnace. The ClintonFurnace—built in 1833—was actually the fruit of the efforts of the foundingfathers of Ashland, the Poage brothers.By the late nineteenth century, the railroad had come to town, thus increasingAshland’s profile as an industrial center. This led to the establishment ofAshland Oil in 1924, ten years before Manson’s birth. In 1942, a new refinerywas added to Ashland Oil’s plant, this one specializing in aviation fuel for thewar effort. By 1968, Ashland Oil’s annual revenues would surpass one billiondollars.But things were not completely rosy for Ashland Oil. As the Sixties turned intothe Eighties and Nineties, Ashland Oil was hit with lawsuit after lawsuit bylocal residents claiming personal injury and other damages from the pollutioncaused by its Catlettsburg refinery. In May 1990, for instance, plaintiffs won acombined ten-million dollar decision against Ashland Oil, which was thenappealed to the Kentucky Supreme Court. On February 22, 1993 Ashland announced asettlement of the lawsuits, which by now represented the claims of 740plaintiffs23 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos494470] who had complaints against theCatlettsburg refinery due to air pollution. The terms of the settlement were notrevealed.A few minutes after passing the grotesquerie of the Catlettsburg plant, I foundmyself sliding into Ashland, Kentucky itself, population 23,622. I parked theconvertible near the Ashland Plaza Hotel, on Winchester Avenue, and deciding tohave lunch there and examine my notes and the brochures I had picked up on theway. I definitely had to see the Kentucky Highlands Museum, which is not farfrom the hotel, and a few other points of interest.Sitting down in the nearly deserted restaurant, I pored over the localnewspapers, seeing nothing of particular interest or relevance. Ashland seemedquiet, peaceful, and even a little sad: like a party when most of the guestshave already left. After lunch, I tried to visit the Museum but found that itwas closed. I decided to take a walk around the town using the Museum as areference point.It was then, a block away from the Museum and my parked car, that I saw themounds.Central Park in Ashland is bounded by Central Avenue, 17th Street, LexingtonAvenue, and 22nd Street. It covers 47 acres and was sold to the city of Ashlandin 1900 by the Kentucky Iron, Coal and Manufacturing Company for the tidy sum of$32,500. Towards the 17th Street side of the Park, close to an intersection withBath Avenue, one finds a string of five burial mounds, called “the String ofBeads” by locals. These have been identified as belonging to the Adena culture,and dated to roughly 800 B.C. In fact, according to the Archaeological Survey ofKentucky by W. D. Funkhouser and W.S. Webb, and quoted in the Kentucky HighlandsMuseum brochure, “No city in the state of Kentucky… contains so much evidence ofprehistoric occupation as the city of Ashland.” 24[../Text/ch03.html#filepos494943]If so, much of that evidence is already long gone. The mounds themselves hadbeen opened by a Dr. J. C. Montmollen in 1870 and “found to contain human bonesand other artifacts.”25 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos495209] My attempts to locateand identify these artifacts met with no success. My communications with theMuseum itself did not result in any additional information beyond that of thetown’s official brochure, although they have an exhibit dedicated to theAmerican Indian presence in town from the Adena, Hopewell and Fort Ancientperiods. In fact, most of my attempts at communication with Ashland officialsand residents met with indifference bordering on hostility. I put that down tomy Bronx pedigree, however, and do not hold it against them. After all, I knowpeople in Connecticut and Rhode Island who firmly believe that the City of NewYork is the Abyss of Darkness and the Mother of All Evils, so how can I blameAshlanders from thinking otherwise?I knew nothing of Indian burial mounds in 1990 when I visited Ashland, but theirbizarre presence in Central Park got me thinking. “This is where Charles Mansongrew up,” I told myself, gazing around at the trees, the mounds, the silentstreets. “Did Charlie play on these mounds like the other children? Did he hearabout Indian legends and the human bones found in the mounds? Did mothersfrighten their children with tales of buried Indian warriors coming back tolife? What was it like growing up here in the 1930s?”Standing at the corner of 17th Street, I looked around and found a plaquedescribing the mounds. The plaque, a little weathered, reads,> String of Beads. These mounds are evidence of prehistoric occupation of this> area. The mounds which remain here are thought to have been part of a series> of mounds, which from the air resembled a string of beads, ranging in an> irregular line from 17th Street to 21st Street. In the 1920s several of the> mounds were opened and found to be burial sites. The archaeologist’s> conclusion was that the area was once the site of an ancient village. These> mounds were restored in 1984 by Troop 154 B.S.A.Dr. J. C. Montmollen opened some of the mounds in 1870. Then, in the 1920s, theywere opened again. So, the mounds were opened and reopened over a period of somefifty years and then, sixty years after some of the mounds were opened by anarchaeologist, they were restored to their present condition by a troop of BoyScouts. One wonders what had happened to the mounds in the meantime, and if theothers had been opened surreptitiously. It’s hard to imagine just how that wouldhave been accomplished, as the mounds are in the park, which is in the center oftown. But it seems someone was nervous.In 1919, a huge, Queen Anne style home was moved entire from Winchester Avenueand 17th Street to its present location at Central Avenue and 16th Street by ateam of mules. The town brochure acknowledges that this was “an amazing feat ofengineering.”26 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos495598]Anyone seeing the buildingwould have to agree. This is not a ranch-style home lifted onto a flatbed truckand shipped over state roads with little red flags at the corners and “WideLoad” signs. No; this is a very large, three storey, brick and stone edificereplete with towers and turrets. And it was only moved three blocks away fromits original position. The brochure does not say why, but it does refer to thehouse as “eclectic” and makes mention of the one factor that caught my attentionimmediately. Alone of all the houses I was able to see in Ashland, the house at1600 Central Avenue is the one sporting griffins. According once more to thetown brochure, “Atop the house are two lion-like statues as griffins, whichlegendarily ward off evil spirits.”27 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos495819]I see.I could not help wondering why someone would go to all that effort to move sucha monstrosity only three blocks, when I noticed that its new placement was muchcloser to the “String of Beads” than before. That’s when I asked myself theobvious question: Why the griffins?There are two of these creatures, one at either end of the roof. They looked tome less like lions than dragons, with long serpentine necks and bat-like wings,in a fierce expression, mouths open, long tongues sticking out. The griffinslook outward from the roof, as if to protect the house from outside forces. Iwas reminded of the Ark of the Covenant and its two seraphim, which are alsowinged creatures and which also are situated at either side of the ark’s cover,or roof. The town brochure was quite explicit in identifying the creatures asgriffins, and as explaining their purpose as the warding off of “evil spirits.”> Evil spirits in Ashland, Kentucky?Kenneth Grant, a serious and well-respected English occultist, author ofnumerous books on Aleister Crowley, Austin Osman Spare, H.P. Lovecraft, andceremonial magic that are a fascinating, sometimes exhilarating and sometimesbewildering mixture of western hermeticism and African and Asian occultpractices, has this to say:The Narragansetts of the New England region, the Adena of Ohio, and the Lenapedog-rib Indians of California are known to have forged links with entitiesspawned in the Mauve Zone, and in the outer rings of Yuggoth. 28[../Text/ch03.html#filepos496041](The “Mauve Zone” is Grant’s term for the Abyss, to be discussed in more detailin the next chapter; it is also, in Grant’s words, “a supreme power-zone ofmagical energy.” 29 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos496445]The Abyss, for purposes ofthis citation, may be considered as the realm of demonic beings. The “outerrings of Yuggoth” are a reference to Lovecraft’s tales.)If Funkhouser and Webb are to be believed, Ashland was the busiest Adena site inthe Commonwealth. The five burial mounds in Central Park would be the tip of anancient iceberg of mounds and other earthworks, many of which were destroyed asthe town was growing.Ashland was founded by two Revolutionary War officers, the Poage Brothers,George and Robert, in 1786. (The town brochure is swift to point out that thePoage family was of Scotch-Irish descent.) They established what was then calledPoage’s Landing on the Ohio River, the town that would later become Ashland. ThePoage family was in complete control of the town for more than fifty years. In1854, the Poages joined with some Ohio developers (the brothers Hugh, Thomas andJohn Means) and formed the Kentucky Iron, Coal and Manufacturing Company… thesame company that sold the burial mounds to the newly incorporated city ofAshland. The city was named after the home of statesman Henry Clay, a nativeVirginian who moved to Kentucky when he was twenty, married into Kentuckysociety, and was the veteran of a few presidential campaigns, which he lost,although he was better known as a US Senator deeply involved in the slaveryissue.In 1854, the same year that Kentucky Iron was formed and the city incorporatedas Ashland, the town itself was designed. With Central Park and the mounds inthe middle, and streets running parallel and perpendicular to it, Ashland becamea typical small American town, albeit with the unmarked graves of ancient Adenapeople at its heart. What became of the rest of the Adena sites is unknown, butit is safe to speculate that there were many more mounds in the general vicinityof the “String of Beads” and that some of the houses in town are probably builton top of them. If there are evil spirits in Ashland, one wonders if they wouldbe the souls of the ancient dead whose millennia-old sleep has been disturbed bybusinessmen and Boy Scouts.Or by the blood sacrifice of Neal, Craft and Ellis.THE ASHLAND TRAGEDYOne of the things the town brochure will not tell you is that Ashland was thesite of a horrible crime which was committed in 1881 and which had repercussionsfor many years after. It reads today like the worst of modern mass murders, andindeed the killings radiated outward from the original deaths to encompass a fewmore before all the dust had settled. While researching the town in the AshlandPublic Library that day, I came across the following story. The details are sounbelievable that the Cincinnati newspapers at the time were convinced thatsomething about it wasn’t quite right. 30 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos496673]On December 24, 1881—Christmas Eve—a house was discovered on fire at what is nowCarter Avenue and 28th Street, about seven blocks from the mounds. It was alittle before dawn, about 5 A.M., and the home of the J.W. Gibbons family wasbeing consumed by flames. Neighbors rushed to the home, smashed open windows,and dived into the house to save whom they could, but it was to no avail.The three children were already dead.Fannie Gibbons was only 14; her brother, Robert, was 17 and a cripple; theirfriend, Emma Carico, was 15. Both girls had been raped. The skulls of all threewere smashed in. The fire had obviously been set to destroy the evidence, butthe children’s bodies were found before they could be incinerated. In addition,an axe and a crowbar were discovered nearby. Both were found to contain tracesof blood and hair.The day before, Mrs. Gibbons left Ashland in the company of her youngest son,Sterling, aged 11, to go to visit one of her daughters in Ironton, Ohio, whichis directly across the river from Ashland. Mr. Gibbons was working in WestVirginia at the time, and had left Ashland only the week before. Mrs. Gibbons,concerned about leaving her fourteen-year-old daughter and crippled son homealone, asked Emma Carico to stay with them. Emma was fifteen, and thus a yearolder than Fannie Gibbons.Mrs. Gibbons was due back in Ashland that day, having planned to spend onlyDecember 23rd in Ironton with her married daughter and to return to Ashland tobe with her children on Christmas Eve. Her husband was in Hamlin, West Virginiaand had an alibi for the night of the murders. Hamlin is about twenty miles eastof Huntington, so it was a good distance to travel those days, though it wasbriefly rumored that Gibbons had actually committed the murders himself.That the crimes were hideous and unthinkable is accepted by all who reported onthe event. A Christmas Eve double rape and triple murder of children: what couldbe more horrible? One is forced to imagine the terror of the crippled RobertGibbons, seventeen years old and helpless, being made to witness the rape of hissister and her friend and their subsequent murders. One perhaps hopes thatRobert was the first to be killed, early on before the rapes of the two girls,but the savagery of the attacks says otherwise. More than one person had to beinvolved, and like a pack of dogs they probably cornered their prey and tooktheir time, then torched the house.The three children were buried in a single grave in Ashland Cemetery, after afuneral service at Methodist Episcopal Church, South. The church was packed forthe service; not only were the Gibbons well known in Ashland, but the dimensionsof the crime shocked and wounded the whole town.> And there were no suspects.John Means, acting mayor of Ashland and member of the Means family that hadfounded, with the Poages, the modern city of Ashland, decided to post a rewardfor the capture of the killers. The reward money eventually reached the sum ofthree thousand dollars, which was a substantial amount in 1881. It attracteddetectives to Ashland from all three states—Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia—tohelp in the search for the murderers.Finally, on January 2, 1882 a break in the case came, with the confession of oneGeorge Ellis. This confession was to be the single most controversial element ofthe entire affair.Ellis was seen in a store talking about the murders and acting very nervously.He was a neighbor of the Gibbons, and knew them as well as most people did inAshland. On the suspicion that Ellis knew more than he was letting on, he wastaken to the room of US Deputy Marshall Heflin at the Aldine Hotel, where heeventually confessed to the crime and in the process implicated two othermen—William Neal and Ellis Craft—saying that they forced him to participate.William Neal was arrested at his job in a rolling mill, Ellis Craft in hisrooming house. Both were brought to jail in Catlettsburg and were put in thesame cell as their accuser, George Ellis. Both Neal and Craft had denied havinganything to do with the deaths of the three children, and when George Ellis wasput in their cell he eventually recanted his confession as well.Ellis seems to have been someone easily intimidated. First, he claimed he wascoerced into confessing by Marshall Heflin; then he recanted his testimony afterspending some time in the same jail cell as his accusers. His whole problembegan because he was seen to be nervous whenever the subject of the murders cameup and was acting in a suspicious manner.This was 1882. The forensics labs, DNA testing, even fingerprint evidence of thetwentieth century were still a long way off. Neals and Craft were being accusedon nothing more than the confession of George Ellis, and George Ellis’confession was suspect anyway. While he may have had something to do with thecrimes, what is not known is how much Ellis may have been coached by MarshallHeflin. After all, there was a three thousand dollar reward at stake. We are notsure of the sequence of events, due to the sketchy reports in the Ashlandsources. Did George Ellis testify that the girls had been rapedbefore this hadbeen determined by the three doctors performing the post-mortems?Or was it only after the medical examination, and was this informationcommunicated to Heflin who then suggested it to Ellis?The Cincinnati newspapers thought there was something fishy about the wholething. The children’s father decamps to West Virginia a week before the murders,a week before Christmas. The children’s mother goes to Ironton, Ohio the nightbefore Christmas Eve. Their remaining two children, plus one neighbor’s girl,are left alone in the house and are killed within hours of the mother’sdeparture.The house was torched about 5 A.M., which means the killers were on the premisesuntil that time. It doesn’t seem likely that the parents were involved in thecrime, for the simple fact that their home was destroyed in the commission ofit. And Ashland was, and is, a small town where everyone knew everyone else, soit made sense that the killers were known to the children, who probably let theminto the house not suspecting it would be the last kindness they would everextend. Further, the neighbors would have known—and commented upon—the fact thatthe children were being left alone. Mrs. Gibbons had gone to her neighbor to askpermission for Emma Carico to stay the night with her two children, thusalerting the neighbor to her plans for the evening. Did the information that thechildren were home alone emanate from that discussion with Emma Carico’sparents? Was it a last minute decision, or had the trip to Ironton been plannedin advance? If the trip had been planned some time in advance, then the circleof suspects would grow to include anyone in the neighborhood known to theGibbons family and would also tend to support a theory that the crimes werepremeditated. Had the trip been a last minute decision, however, that would bothnarrow the range of suspects considerably as well as demonstrate that the crimeswere planned and committed in haste.But time was running out. Rumors began to spread that some people in Ashlandwere preparing to take matters into their own hands. In their minds, Ellis,Craft and Neal were already guilty, and sentence had been passed. Anxiousofficials decided to spirit the three men away from Catlettsburg before a mobcould descend on the jail. They boarded the steamer Mountain Girl in an attemptto take the prisoners to Maysville to await trial. At that same moment, thetrain from Ashland pulled into the Catlettsburg station, and a swarm ofAshlanders made for the courthouse.According to reports in the local papers, the Ashlanders had simply arrived towitness the hearing, or examination trial as it was called, but the judge andthe other officials feared the worst. Mountain Girl could not get up steam fastenough, so the prisoners under heavy guard boarded the Catlettsburg ferryinstead. The ferry made it safely to Maysville, but not before a crowd ofAshlanders commandeered the Mountain Girl—which had finally developed a head ofsteam—and engaged in pursuit of the Catlettsburg ferry.The ferry managed to meet another steamer, the Mountain Boy, and the prisonerswere safely transferred to that steamer, which arrived safely in the town ofMaysville, about halfway up river to Cincinnati.Naturally, the Ashlanders were outraged. This was an insult to their honor! Howcould anyone believe that they would form a mob and lynch the three suspects?The authorities were telling the world that the three men could only be safe inanother town, in another county, eighty miles away. The appropriately-namedHuff, editor of the local Ashland paper at the time, also complained that theprisoners could more easily escape in Maysville than in Ashland, thus addinginjury to insult. A special committee was formed to convince Circuit Court JudgeGeorge N. Brown that the prisoners would be safe in Ashland, and that in anyevent there had been no intention to enforce mob rule in Ashland or anywhere inBoyd County.Major John R. Allen was put in charge of the Lexington Guards, the Mc-CrearyGuards and the Mason County Guards and marched to Ashland, the prisoners underguard. A special term of the Boyd County Circuit Court was held, and grand juryindictments were brought down against the three men: conspiracy and murder forNeal and Craft, and three counts of murder for George Ellis, after five days ofdeliberations. The grand jury itself reads like a roll call of Ashland history,and included Hugh Means (of Kentucky Iron fame), D.D. Geiger (the area where thechildren were murdered was known at the time as the “Geiger Extension”) and R.Hatfield, a surname synonymous with Kentucky feuds. The first trial—for WilliamNeal—began on January 16, for the murder of Emma Carico.The trial lasted eight days, and Neal was convicted of the crime and sentencedto death. Ellis Craft’s trial lasted ten days, and ended with the same result.Their execution by hanging was set for Friday, April 14 of that year “betweensunrise and sunset.” George Ellis’s trial was postponed to the regular term ofthe Boyd County Circuit Court in May, a month after the scheduled executions.The three men were then taken to Lexington, Kentucky by armed troops.Appeals were set in motion for Neals and Craft, and their executions werepostponed. They then were reported to have attempted an escape from theLexington jail on May 22, 1882, but were caught and brought back to the lock-up.Both the appeals and the escape attempt made the Ashlanders nervous that perhapsjustice would not be done.A week after the escape attempt by Neals and Craft, George Ellis was broughtback to Catlettsburg to stand trial. He was arraigned on May 30, 1882, and histrial only lasted two and a half days before he was found guilty of murder. Hispenalty, however, was life imprisonment. While it is not stated in any of thedocuments I can find, this lighter sentence may be due to a deal Ellis struckwith the authorities for bringing in Neals and Craft and confessing to thecrime.No matter, the Ashlanders did not take the sentence well.The next night, eighteen masked men marched on the railroad station in Ashlandand commandeered the train to take them to Catlettsburg, where Ellis was beingheld. The men broke into the jail and removed Ellis, taking him back on thetrain to Ashland.He was hanged from the branches of a sycamore tree at 28th Street near CarterAvenue, not far from the scene of the murders themselves. His body was leftthere all night and into the next day.Mob rule did reign in Ashland that night, and obviously the authorities wereright to be afraid.They didn’t know how right.Neals and Craft thought for a moment that they had lucked out. They won newtrials, set for October of that year during the regular term of the CircuitCourt. Once again, they were brought to Catlettsburg under armed guard, but thistime with five companies of state militia and an artillery piece! The Governorof Kentucky, G. W. Blackburn—obviously still smarting over the lynching ofGeorge Ellis four months earlier, and worried about the effect of the criticalCincinnati newspaper columns—threatened that he would kill every person in BoydCounty if necessary in order to uphold the “dignity of the law” in protectingthe prisoners. Ashland was outraged at this bald threat, and hanged the Governorin effigy... from branches of the same sycamore tree from which George Ellis hadbeen hanged only months earlier.In this environment of open hostility, the lawyers for Neal and Craft managed toconvince the court that they needed a change of venue. A new trial date was setfor the following February in Carter County. The troops were once again orderedto guard the prisoners on their way back to Lexington jail.That night, however, things began to get ugly. The new trial, the change ofvenue, and the removal of the prisoners to Lexington made Ashlanders believethat they were losing control of the situation. The murders had taken place intheir town, committed—they believed—by their own people against their ownchildren. It seemed to many that Ashland itself should be in charge of the case,the trial, and the execution of sentence. To everyone’s way of thinking, Nealand Craft were already guilty, just as guilty as George Ellis whose body swungfrom a sycamore tree only months before. Couple that with the open hostility ofGovernor Blackburn and the huge military presence at Catlettsburg, and it seemedas if the Civil War—still fresh in many people’s minds—was starting up all overagain.It should probably be remembered that this was all taking place at the same timeas the famous Hatfield and McCoy feud, which raged across the Kentucky/WestVirginia border not far from Ashland. On January 7, 1865, young HarmonMcCoy—discharged from the locally unpopular Union Army on Christmas Eve, 1864due to his war wounds—had been murdered in his hiding place by men loyal to theConfederate Hatfields.Then, in 1878, Randolph McCoy, while visiting a Kentucky Hatfield, spotted whathe believed was one of his pigs. McCoy accused Hatfield of stealing his pig, andthe two went to court. A key witness testified that the pig was, indeed,property of the Hatfields, and they won the case. The witness was slain by theMcCoys a few months later. Tensions rose.In the spring of 1880, Johnson Hatfield met Roseanna McCoy at a party at thehome of one of the Kentucky Hatfields. They immediately eloped, Roseanna beingtaken to the Hatfield home in West Virginia. Their romance was doomed tofailure, however, as everyone opposed it from both sides of the Tug River (atributary of the Big Sandy that divides Kentucky and West Virginia furtherupstream). Johnson was forcibly removed from her side, and Roseanna sent intears back to her family’s cold disdain.The spring elections of 1882—taking place at the same time as the lynching ofGeorge Ellis in Ashland—were the scene of another hideous murder. RoseannaMcCoy’s brothers—Tolbert, Pharmer and Bud—stabbed Ellison Hatfield twenty-sixtimes and then shot him in the back. No one knows why. The three brothers werethen themselves murdered only a few days later: executed, while tied to bushes,to the sound of their mother’s screams.And on it went, claiming a total of thirteen lives and numerous beatings,burnings, woundings, and other damage across the border between the two states.Finally, Kentucky officials under command of Frank Phillips invaded WestVirginia in 1888 and captured nine Hatfields, bringing them back to stand trial.Several Hatfields had attacked the McCoy home, burning it to the ground afterkilling two McCoys they found there on New Year’s Day, 1888. Eventually, thenine prisoners were brought back to Kentucky, stood trial, and some received thedeath penalty. The feud was officially over.Back in Ashland, though, things had gone from bad to worse. The sounds ofgunfire in the night kept the troops in a state of nervous excitement, certainthat a crowd was descending on them once again to subject Neals and Craft to mobjustice. Major Allen, in charge of the militia, decided against going toLexington by train (there were rumors that the tracks had been torn up to forcethe train to stop so it could be boarded) and ordered the prisoners escorted tothe river front. The date was November 1, 1882.In a replay of the last time this had been attempted, the militia commandeered asteamer—this time the hapless Granite State—and the steamer’s captain was toldnot to stop at Ashland or anywhere else until they reached Maysville. At thatmoment, the train from Ashland arrived and two hundred civilians disembarked.They were armed “with about forty pistols and shotguns.”The prisoners and militia boarded the steamer quickly. Major Allen deployed his215 troops in a line around the wharf, positioning his artillery piecestrategically. The Ashlanders demanded custody of the two prisoners. The Majorrefused. The steamer took off.The Ashland train was reboarded, and as it made its way back to Ashland alongthe riverside, the crowd fired on the steamer from the train. Word spread toAshland that the prisoners were aboard the Granite State. A ferryboat wascommandeered by the mob at Ashland and ordered to approach the steamer. Shotswere fired from both the ferry and the steamer; the volley from the steamer wasso heavy that the ferryboat was put out of service. The militia fired in alldirections, towards the ferryboat where the initial shots had come from and atthe huge crowd on the docks at Ashland. It is said that a total of 1,500 roundswere fired by the militia aboard the Granite State, killing four civilians andwounding more than twenty others, including several teenage boys.Ashland, of course, was outraged. The Governor defended the actions of hismilitia, however, and claimed that when the trials of Neals and Craft came upagain that February, he would “send six regiments, or twelve if necessary, todefend the prisoners from mob rule.” The Cincinnati Enquirer reported all ofthis with glee, as did the Lexington newspapers. The Enquirer insisted that themen were innocent and had been framed; this was received so badly in Ashlandthat, according to one report, no Cincinnati Enquirers were allowed in Ashlandfor years to come. The coroner’s jury in Ashland slammed Major Allen, callingthe Ashland Tragedy a “wanton and ruthless act,” but Allen was never heldaccountable for the debacle. As it was, the memory of the lynching of GeorgeEllis was on everyone’s mind at the State House, and the ferocity of themilitia’s response to the attack from the ferryboat—and from Ashland ingeneral—was deemed justified in the face of the threat.But everything went peacefully after that. Craft—widely understood to be theringleader of the group—was convicted in 1883 and hanged on October 12, 1883.Neal was convicted a year later and hanged on March 27, 1885 protesting hisinnocence to the end:I say to one and all that this is no place to tell a lie. I stand here today tosuffer for a heinous crime I did not commit. One day my innocence will beestablished beyond a doubt. 31 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos497478]Ashland…Putting down the books and papers in the public library after reading all ofthis, I wondered at the strangeness of the place. Indian burial mounds. TheAshland Tragedy. Children murdered and raped. Charles Manson playing in thedirt. Sure, the place was also the home of Naomi and Wynonna Judd, the popularmother and daughter country-and-western singing duo, and of Ashley Judd. Naomi’sother daughter is an accomplished actor who herself portrayed the victim of aserial killer in the film Kiss the Girls with her costar Morgan Freeman. AshleyJudd would go on to donate $50,000 to the University of Kentucky’s Department ofAnthropology in 2001. A former anthropology student at the University, Ms. Juddwanted the sum—matched by another $50,000 from the University—to endow a fund tohelp support Ph.D. candidates in anthropology. (Did her interest in anthropologybegin with a visit to the burial mounds in her home town?)Odd bits and pieces of Ashland’s history and geography seemed to swirl around adarker, more sinister core. In the library, I discovered that Ashland is 555feet above sea level, for instance. That number has resonance for thoseinterested in history and mysticism, for it was the original Nazi Partymembership number of Adolf Hitler (he had it changed later to “seven”). It isalso the exact height of the Washington Monument. Conspiracy theorists of themore marooned variety could have cause to develop multi-colored skeins of causeand effect around that particular loom. I could not see a connection, however,unless one wanted to attribute the creation of the Washington Monument, AdolfHitler and the strange topography of a small Kentucky town to a single, sinisterhand. However, a connection does exist: all three betray the same numericalcorrespondence. But is the connection meaningful? Is this what skeptics mean by“coincidence”? A reference to standard works of qabalistic numerology—such asthose in use by people like Johannes Kelpius and Joseph Smith—will show that thenumber 555 represents “obscurity” in Biblical Hebrew. As mentioned in UnholyAlliance, that number is also the equivalent of the Greek letters that make upthe word Necronomicon, the dreaded magician’s spellbook mentioned so often byLovecraft in his short stories. 32 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos497717]A multiple rape and murder of children on Christmas Eve, originally a paganholiday of the winter solstice, resulting in the Ashland Tragedy of soldiersfiring on civilians on November 1, All Saint’s Day, originally a pagan holidaycelebrating the dead coming back to earth; strange, undescribed burial mounds inthe center of town; the Queen Anne-style griffin house that was moved closer tothe mounds; Charles Manson. I left Ashland with a file full of information, noneof it making very much sense at the time. As I drove out of town, I went over inmy mind the details of Manson’s history after his release on March 22, 1967. Ifthe “cult cops” are right, and if special events occurring on any of the eightsacred days of the pagan calendar (the two equinoxes, the two solstices, and thefour cross-quarter days of July 31/August 1, October 31/November 1, January31/February 1, and April 30/May 1) are evidence of cult activity, then thehistory of Ashland and the life of Charles Manson seemed to suggest that cultactivity was somehow involved. But how could that be true? Events so far removedfrom each other in time and space could not indicate the active involvement ofcultists, unless one wanted to posit a vast conspiracy on the order of theFreemasonry fantasies of the last two hundred years, and that hypothesis defiesbelief. That there are conspiracies, and conspiracies in American politics, wehave come to learn to our regret over the past fifty years. Everything fromWatergate to Iran-Contra, and the coverups of crimes committed in the name ofMK-ULTRA, is evidence of this fact. That persons, often political figures, aremurdered as the result of conspiracies is well-known all over the world. Thatcults do exist is also known. But there is no evidence that cultists in theUnited States have any political power or influence; and the “satanic cultsurvivor syndrome” scare of the 1980s demonstrated how little proof exists ofany kind of network of satanic murderers. But, as Carl Sagan and other skepticshave been forced to admit, “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.”What is really going on? Anything? Anything at all?Charles Manson was loosed on the world. He made his way to San Francisco in timefor the Summer of Love, and the transformation of a small-time thief and hustlerinto a prophet and murderer was begun. Along the way he would gather aroundhimself a commune of young men and women, would undergo ritual-style initiationsincluding a crucifixion while on LSD, and would become involved with the Churchof Satan, the Process, and other cults in and around San Francisco and LosAngeles, in a saga that has been discussed and written about and argued over bylaw enforcement, journalists, filmmakers, psychologists, psychiatrists,philosophers, and cultists since that bloody day in August 1969 that saw abeautiful young actress, pregnant with her first child, and her friends carvedto death with knives. But prior to that murder, there were others.There was Darwin Orell Scott in Ashland, Kentucky: Manson’s uncle and victim ofan unsolved crime, carved with knives.And there was Marina Habe, a seventeen-year-old girl who was abducted on NewYear’s Eve, 1968 and whose body was found—carved with knives—a few days later.Although attributed to the Manson “family,” the murder is still officiallyunsolved.But it was Marina Habe’s case that led me to a whole other dimension of thethesis I was working on. It was Marina Habe who led me back to World War II, toOperation Paperclip, to Hollywood, escaped Nazis, psychological warfare and theenigmatic team of Clay Shaw and Fred Crisman. As I drove out of Ashland thatwarm summer’s day, I was driving out of the frying pan and into the fire.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/ch03.html#filepos370109] H.P.

It was a savage attack reminiscent of the later attack on Darwin Scott inAshland, Kentucky. She had been returning from a date with friend John Hornburgin Brentwood the early morning of December 30, 1968 and was kidnapped from infront of the home she shared with her mother in the Hollywood hills afterreturning from a night out on Santa Monica Boulevard. The case remains unsolved,but there was a lot of speculation at the time that her killer was a Manson“family” member, since she was known to have befriended various members of thegroup. Manson himself has no alibi for the day and time of her death, and isknown to have been in Los Angeles on the day she was kidnapped and killed,attending a New Year’s Eve party at the home of musician John Phillips of theMamas and the Papas.3 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos678422] Phillips himself isknown to have been friendly with elements of the Process Church of the FinalJudgment. The day before and the day after the killing Manson was with hisFamily at the Barker Ranch, which was located in the Panimint Mountains of DeathValley.A reference to this crime is buried deep within Vincent Bugliosi’s book on theManson case, Helter Skelter,4 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos678886] and has a bitmore space in Ed Sanders’ The Family. 5 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos680716]MarinaHabe is identified as the daughter of writer Hans Habe.6[../Text/ch04.html#filepos681180] There was no more information on thisunfortunate victim or her father, so recourse was had to newspaper morgues,libraries, archives and eventually to Holocaust survivor materials. Whatdeveloped was the story of a remarkable man and his mysterious life, one thatstretched from the concentration camp to the Hollywood film studio… and fromMadison Avenue to Munich.According to a small paragraph in Current Biography 1977, the year Habe died, hewas born on February 12, 1911, was an editor and correspondent in the 1930s fornewspapers in Austria and Czechoslovakia, and eventually served with the Alliesin World War II. He died in Locarno, Switzerland on September 29, 1977.Current Biography 1943—published at the height of the War—was much more effusiveand detailed. Habe rated three full pages in that edition, where we learn thathe was born Jean (actually “Janos”) Bekessy in Budapest, Hungary. Oddly, thearticle does not state why or when Jean Bekessy became Hans Habe. Perhaps one issupposed to believe that “Hans Habe” is simply a nom de plume, a pseudonymeasier on American eyes and ears than “Bekessy.” But there is more to the storythan that.Hans’ father—Imre Bekessy—was also a journalist, but in his case a yellowjournalist and extortionist. A converted Jew, Imre Bekessy’s specialty wasconvincing public figures to pay him money in order that their names would bekept out of his articles! For these outrages, an Austrian court decided he waspersona non grata, and Imre found himself expelled from Vienna and on thestreets of Hungary, trolling for new prey. The name of Bekessy became sonotorious that his son Janos Bekessy was forced to become someone else, anyoneelse, if he wanted a career in journalism. And thus Hans Habe was born.A prominent Austrian journalist and social activist—Hans Janitschek—has informedthe author that the “Habe” name comes from the first two letters of the firstand last name, Hans Bekessy.7 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos681479] (“Hans” is theGermanization of “Janos.”)Readers of Unholy Alliance may remember another Viennese journalist with thesame ambitions as Imre Bekessy: Herschel Steinschneider, who became Hitler’soccult advisor, Hanussen.8 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos681790] Like Imre Bekessy,Hanussen began his career extorting money from Viennese celebrities, being paidto keep their names out of his newspapers. Like Janos Bekessy, he changed hisname to something more dramatic but perhaps for a different reason:Steinschneider was Jewish, and he had his sights set on Berlin. Thus, asHanussen moved from Vienna to Berlin, so Imre Bekessy moved from Vienna toBudapest. Eventually his son, Hans Habe, would move back to Vienna and becomethe youngest chief-editor in Europe at the time, working for Der Morgen at theage of twenty-one. Habe, with his name-change, not only disguised hisrelationship to a notorious blackmailer and extortionist, but he also hid hisJewish ancestry at a time when it was becoming increasingly difficult tosurvive—let alone excel—as a Jew in Europe.As hostilities began with the accession of Hitler and the Nazi Party to aposition of control within Germany, Habe found himself becoming a dedicated(some would say “rabid”) anti-Nazi. (It is to Hans Habe, in fact, that we creditthe discovery of Hitler’s “Schicklegrueber” family background.) As war brokeout, Habe found himself on Hitler’s enemies list: his books were burned, and hewas shot at in Vienna (because of his publication of Hitler’s Schicklegrueberancestry; Habe actually sent copies of his report to Germany at the time ofHitler’s campaign against Hindenburg in an effort to ridicule Hitler and causehim to lose the election, a tactic which was in vain as we all know). Habeenlisted with a group of foreign volunteers in the French Army, and took part inthe Battle of France. He was captured on June 22, 1940, armed only with an 1891Remington rifle. Habe—in his book about the experience, A Thousand ShallFall—rails against the French complicity in the defeat, accusing the Vichyhierarchy of actually wanting to surrender rather than fight Germany. (This bookeventually became the 1943 MGM propaganda film The Cross of Lorraine, starringJean-Pierre Aumont, Gene Kelly, Cedric Hardwicke, Peter Lorre and Hume Cronyn.)Held at a prison camp in Occupied France, Habe managed to survive for a fewweeks under an assumed name before escaping, dressed in a German uniform andfleeing in an ambulance. He eventually made his way to Spain and Portugal,joining his wife—Erika Levy—in neutral Lisbon. President Roosevelt gave Habe aspecial emergency visa, and the couple arrived in New York harbor on December 3,1940.A deeper examination of the available record shows that American rescue workerVarian Fry was instrumental in getting Hans Habe out of Europe. Recourse to thearchives of the International Rescue Committee in New York shows that Varian Frywent to France in 1940 after the fall of Paris to help intellectuals escape theGestapo. For over a year, Fry managed to rescue thousands of refugees,eventually becoming the first American ever honored by the Yad Vashemorganization in Israel, where a tree was planted in his name by Secretary ofState Warren Christopher on February 2, 1996. Among the people he helped escapewere such famous personalities as Marc Chagall, Franz Werfel, Hannah Arendt,Fritz Kahn, Otto Meyerhoff, Konrad Heiden (the Hitler biographer), ArthurKoestler and, of course, Habe. In addition, credit must be given to Varian Fryfor saving nearly the entire Surrealist movement: Andre Breton, Marcel Duchamp,Max Ernst and Andre Masson.Fry was eventually expelled from France in 1941. He died in 1967 as a retiredteacher in Redding, Connecticut, his exploits on behalf of the refugees largelyunknown and unrecognized in his own country at the time. Indeed, when he wasexpelled from France it was due to the fact that the US Consulin Marseilles hadrefused to renew his passport! Fry’s wife received a letter from EleanorRoosevelt saying, in essence, that Fry’s expulsion from France was inevitable,as his actions did not have the support of the US Government… the samegovernment which, five years later, would be helping Nazi war criminals emigrateto the United States to assist in the space program and in intelligenceactivities against the Soviet Union.Then the Hans Habe story gets even more interesting.In an attempt to find out more about Habe, the author accessed the Amazon.comwebsite and found that his works were all out-of-print. They had a fewsecond-hand copies in stock, however, and Agent of the Devil was selected, anovel Habe published in 1958. The book arrived a short while later, and—in oneof those eerie coincidences that haunted the research for this book constantlyfor years—there was an old newsclipping taped inside the front cover of thebook. This was a review of Agent of the Devil, by a “B.D.,” and it containedthiss illuminating sentence: “Budapest journalist and U.S. army psychologicalwarfare officer on the Italian front, Hans Habe is a ‘cunning’ writer.”Psychological warfare officer? Italian front? The newsclipping gave the author afurther dimension for his research, and also suggested a new line of inquiry.Let’s see where it leads us.Habe began giving talks at various clubs and societies in America during 1941,even staying for a while at West Point where, it is said, he continued to workat his writing. In 1942 he began a series of lectures at Army bases under theaegis of the War Department’s Bureau of Public Relations on “How To Lose a War”:an ironic title which took as its text the fall of France, and served asmotivation for the American troops in their struggle against Nazism.Habe was busy in 1942 with other interests as well. He divorced Erika Levy aftereight years of marriage and married Mrs. Eleanor Close Sturges Gautier Rand, theaggressively-nomenclatured former wife of that great comic film producer andscreenwriter Preston Sturges and daughter of Mrs. Marjorie Post Hutton Davies,the General Foods heiress and former wife of the US Ambassador to Russia, JosephE. Davies. One could not ask for a spouse with a more blue-blooded (andflagrant) set of pedigrees, the families of Rand, Hut-ton, Gautier, Post, Daviesand even old Preston Sturges amply represented every time she signed a check.They were married on April 22, 1942, Hans Habe becoming her fourth husband andshe his second wife. Considering that Erika Levy, Hans’ first wife, was “theheiress to the Tungsram Lightbulb fortune,” one has to say that he had a knackfor marrying—perhaps not too wisely, but—too well. One story has it that Mrs.Eleanor etc. etc. Rand had helped Habe and his wife emigrate to the UnitedStates, and that they fell in love at that time. She seems to have been an olderwoman, and—according to some accounts—rather short on charm, and many suspectedthat Habe had married for money and security rather than for love or passion.Shortly thereafter, in January 1943, Habe enlisted in the US Army. This was notmere expedience, since he had dependents and would probably not have been calledup, but he asked to enlist anyway. By July of that year, he was in North Africa(and the new father of a son) as a second lieutenant. He was then loaned toBritish General Montgomery for a while, and September found him in Italy andthis time with the US forces.After that, the record becomes a little confused. Some reports have him landingwith Allied forces at D-Day, yet he seems to have entered Europe via Italy ninemonths earlier than that. Regardless of the order of events, by that time Habewas working for C.D. Jackson—more famous in his Time-Life incarnation—and wasactively involved in psychological warfare operations, operations which lastedlong after the war’s end and which found Habe in charge of no fewer thaneighteen German newspapers throughout the Allied territories.One of those who knew Habe at this time was Tibor Scitovsky, a distinguishedAmerican economist who was born in Hungary, and whose father knew Habe’sfather—the yellow journalist—and threw him out of his office when Imre Bekessyapproached him for money. His memoir, A Proud Hungarian, 9[../Text/ch04.html#filepos682255]mentions a psychological warfare school inGettysburg, Pennsylvania where Scitovsky and others were being trained inpropaganda. He characterizes Habe as the “US Army’s propaganda expert” in hismemoir of the war years, and describes how Habe trained him in spottingimportant information in the New York Times, and how to use that information forpropaganda purposes. They practiced making radio broadcasts, writing articlesand filler, designing propaganda posters, and all of it in both French andGerman. According to Scitovsky, Habe also had been a student of the Bauhaus andthus had a good eye for artistic composition as well as literature andjournalism.Scitovsky was eventually assigned to the 4th Mobile Broadcasting Company of theArmy, and had quite a sophisticated bunch of Army “buddies,” including JosephWechsberg of the The New Yorker magazine, and Igor Cassini, the gossip columnistand brother of Oleg Cassini. They were sent first to Britain at the time of theV-1 and V-2 attacks. According to that timetable, they would have been sent oversometime in mid-late 1944. Thus, Habe could have been with Allied forces at theItalian front in 1943, then returned Stateside to conduct psy-war classes atGettysburg, and then returned to Europe with the Allied forces on D-Day in June1944. Scitovsky, et al. did not arrive in Germany until after V-E Day, in May1945. By that time, they had become part of USSBS.USSBS—or United States Strategic Bombing Survey—was created by PresidentRoosevelt in November 1944 to assess the damage caused by the Allied strategicbombing of Europe. Their task was to consider “the effects on civilian moraleand whether bombs hardened the national will to fight, or collapsed it.” 10[../Text/ch04.html#filepos682744]In other words, their function was essentiallyan intelligence one allied to psychological warfare. In the back of Roosevelt’smind must have been the question whether the devastating new atomic weapon beingdesigned by the scientists of the Manhattan Project would cause an earlier endto the war… or prolong it indefinitely.By the time Scitovsky and his colleagues were sent to Germany, their task hadchanged somewhat again. They were on the lookout for specific Nazi individualsto capture and interrogate, and USSBS became so huge in the process that iteventually found itself under combined military and civilian leadership,including an official of IBM (the Nazis were enthusiastic users of IBM punchcard equipment during the war, for such tasks as keeping track of concentrationcamp inmates and their final dispositions) and such luminaries as KennethGalbraith, George Ball, and Paul Nitze, who would all go on to greater glory insucceeding presidential administrations.Another friend of Habe at this time is psy-war officer Alfred de Grazia— now aprofessor at Princeton University and, even more intriguingly, a friend of thelate Immanuel Velikovsky—who was with Habe in North Africa in 1943. His book onthe war years 11 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos683228] makes for very interestingreading, as it reveals that the “Mobile Broadcasting Company” was a cover forOSS (Office of Strategic Services) activities in Europe, and that they werejoint OSS-US Army units. A photograph of Habe in this collection—taken nearTunis in North Africa in July 1943—shows him to look remarkably like the “HansHabe/Heinz Habe” figure in the Bower volumes, mentioned below. What is even moresurprising—especially to a reader of Unholy Alliance—is that the shady figure ofGeorge Viereck once again raises his ugly head.Viereck was a propaganda officer and spy for the Kaiser during World War I and acolleague of infamous British occultist and sometime spy Aleister Crowley.Viereck went on to conduct espionage and propaganda activities during World WarII as well, and wound up arrested for his efforts, spending about a year inprison. At the same time, his son—Peter Viereck—was working for the OSS and the1st Mobile Broadcasting Company in North Africa, along with Hans Habe and othernotables, including Martin Herz, a future US Ambassador! 12[../Text/ch04.html#filepos683818]And we should not forget yet another OSS officer in Italy at this time, PeterTompkins, a broadcast journalist who became an intelligence officer during thewar, but whose fame rests more on his researches in two fields: Egyptianarchaeology on the one hand, and the use of lie detectors in the investigationof the “secret life of plants” on the other. Also involved in intelligenceduring the war in Europe—and specifically in the interrogation of Naziprisoners, like his counterparts in OSS and USSBS—was J. D. Salinger, the famedand reclusive author of Catcher in the Rye, that favorite tome of Americanassassins. He was a CIC (Counter Intelligence Corps) officer from 1943, and tookpart in the D-Day invasion of June 1944.13 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos684109] Hisduties were essentially the same as those of his OSS counterparts: to round upNazis and interrogate them, and to search for collaborators and German Armydeserters among the “civilians.” It also appears that two other gentlemen whowill figure in our story—Clay Shaw and Fred Crisman—were involved in similarintelligence activities, specifically with the Paperclip operations.14[../Text/ch04.html#filepos684813] (This will be discussed in Chapter Seven inmore detail.) Shaw, as many readers are aware, figured prominently in theKennedy Assassination theories of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison andothers; Crisman, supposedly a friend of Shaw from the war years, was subpoenaedby Jim Garrison to testify concerning that relationship. It has been suggestedthat Shaw was an OSS officer during the war; Crisman certainly was, as his CIAfiles demonstrate. Crisman, however, was also involved in the seminal UFOcontact of the twentieth century. This was the Maury Island affair of 1947,which ushered in the whole UFO spectrum, from “flying saucers,” to “men inblack,” to government coverups and exploding aircraft.As if that weren’t enough, another Army Intelligence officer in Rome at thistime, charged with hunting down Nazi agents like his OSS counterparts, wasPhilip J. Corso, who would eventually find a position on President Eisenhower’sNational Security Staff. It was Corso who, a bit before his death, published TheDay After Roswell, a book claiming that he was privy to reverse-engineeredscientific achievements based on captured flying saucers, and had actually seenthe corpse of an extraterrestrial from Roswell in a shipping crate on its way toWright Air Force Base in Ohio, a claim that is hotly debated on both sides ofthe UFO issue, even though Corso’s bona fides in all other respects seemunimpeachable.The involvement of intelligence agents in the field of Egyptian archaeology, theUFO phenomenon, and other odd pursuits will be discussed in a later chapter. Fornow, it suffices to point out that psychological warfare, literature,archaeology, and the paranormal not only make for strange bedfellows: in the waryears of the last century it was positively an orgy.While De Grazia’s account shows that, although some OSS personnel wereantagonistic towards the dashing Hungarian, Habe was riding high in theestimation of the US Army Psychological Warfare Bureau (PWB). Put in charge ofUS Army propaganda in Germany, he was the czar of German newspapers for yearsafter the war (until 1951 according to the information available to the author),eventually responsible for the publication of 8 million pieces and over 10,000newspaper articles (not counting over two dozen novels in his lifetime). Some ofthe papers he ran included Muenchner Illustrierte, Echo der Woche, and theAmerican intelligence/Hans Habe creation: the Neue Zeitung of Munich.Someone as high-profile and as rabidly anti-Nazi as Habe was a jewel in thepsy-war crown. After all, they made a movie about his life in a Nazi POW camp(The Cross of Lorraine); he was married to the adopted daughter of the former USAmbassador to Russia; he was running propaganda and psy-war operations againstthe Nazis and then, after the war, against both the Nazi sympathizers and theCommunists. If the Allied postwar intelligence community was like a corporation,then Habe had a seat on the Board.It seemed logical to the author, therefore, that Habe would have been involved,if only peripherally, in the effort to identify and capture as many importantNazis as possible, including Nazi scientists. His former students at Gettysburgwere doing just that, and had managed quite a coup in finding and interrogatingAlbert Speer, Hitler’s architect, among many others. Was Habe involved withOperation Paperclip, the US effort to bring Nazi scientists—especially rocketscientists, but also medical men and other experts—to America after the war?There is an intriguing—and startling—photograph in Tom Bower’s Blind Eye toMurder, an account of the Allied failure to completely de-Nazify Germany afterthe war. 15 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos685457]It is labeled Photograph 13, “ThePaperclip Scientists,” and describes “the men who put America on the moon,enjoying a Bavarian evening in Chicago, 1950.” Among the scientists—thenotorious “physician” Dr. Hubertus Strughold, Wernher von Braun, and GeneralWalter Dornberger—there is another figure, identified as “Hans Habe.”Hans Habe does not appear in the text of Bower’s book, nor in the index oranywhere else. The photo certainly looks like Habe, when compared to the DeGrazia photo and the one in Current Biography of 1943. But how could that be?What would Hans Habe be doing hanging out in apparent conviviality withPaperclip scientists?Bower’s book was first published in 1981. In 1987, he published The PaperclipConspiracy. This book contains the same photograph, only this time theindividual originally identified as “Hans Habe” is now identified as “HeinzHabe.” 16 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos685917]This person also does not appearanywhere else in the book, but another photograph showing “Strughold’s team atHeidelberg” shows a “Heinz Haber.” Unfortunately, there is no further mention ofHaber, either, even though we know that a Dr. Heinz Haber does make it toStrughold’s Paperclip team in the United States after the war. The personidentified as Haber looks enough like the Heinz Habe in the later photograph tobe the same person. If so, how was the mistake made in 1981 identifying him asHans Habe, the famous novelist and anti-Nazi propagandist?There is another famous photograph to consider, this one notorious among UFOenthusiasts and debunkers alike. It is of an “alien,” a short creature in astrange suit, a weird mask with elongated forehead and breathing apparatus,holding hands with an Army officer as another person walks behind carrying his…oxygen tank? It first appeared in a German newspaper on April Fool’s Day, 1950,and made the tabloid circuit in the States shortly thereafter, in which form theauthor first saw it as a child years later. This photo would have appeared inone of Habe’s newspapers (it appeared in 1950, and Habe was in charge of WestGerman propaganda until 1951) and certainly would not have been shown withouthis prior involvement and approval as the US Army psychological warfare andpropaganda expert. The photo was obviously a hoax and was published that way, ina tongue-in-cheek reference to the famous Roswell sighting of 1947, perhaps.Whatever the original purpose, one source has published that a photocopy of itwas found in FBI files “with the suggestion that it might be one of the Roswellaliens.” 17 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos686384]In any event, it was published thesame year as the “Paperclip scientists in Chicago” photo.Habe evidently finished his postwar service in 1951, which would have been thesame year his daughter, Marina, was born. Habe returned to the United States andleft sometime in 1953 for Europe, evidently leaving his young daughter behind inAmerica; the only information to hand is that he moved to Locarno, Switzerlandat some point and stayed there until he died in 1977 at the age of 66. He hadbeen through at least two more wives by that time, the actress Eloise Hardt(Marina’s mother) and the actress Licci Bala. In the meantime, Habe beganwriting books critical of the United States. One of his more famous efforts,DerTod in Texas: Eine amerikanische Tragoedie, (“Death in Texas: An AmericanTragedy”) was an attack on the Warren Commission published in 1964. Habe hadbeen traveling through the United States at the time of the assassination anddid not believe the conclusions of the Warren Report. He was very fond ofKennedy, but very critical of America in the wake of the assassination and whathe perceived as the obvious coverup efforts by the government and thewillingness of the American people to accept the government’s findings.Habe. OSS operations. Psychological warfare. UFO hoax. Paperclip scientists.Even the JFK assassination. More—or less—than meets the eye?In the effort to learn more about Habe, the author found himself going through alist of the contents of the C.D. Jackson files of the Dwight D. EisenhowerLibrary. Jackson was a vice-president of Time, Inc. from 1931 to 1964 (the yearof his death), but he was much more than that. He was also Special Assistant tothe US Ambassador to Turkey, 1942-43; President of the Free Europe Committee(which ran Radio Free Europe), 1951-52; speechwriter for Eisenhower in 1952;Special Assistant to the President for International Affairs, 1953-54; USDelegate to the United Nations Ninth General Assembly in 1954; speechwriter andconsultant to Eisenhower during the Lebanon Crisis of 1958; and “unofficialconsultant to the President on other occasions.” He was also Deputy Chief,Psychological Warfare Branch (PWB) at Allied Forces Headquarters in 1943 andcontinued in that role, slightly modified, for the Psychological WarfareDivision (PWD) at Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) forthe remainder of the war. His files, collected at the Eisenhower Library,contain one on Hans Habe (Box 58) and another entire box on that notoriousbugaboo of conspiracy theorists, the Bilderbergers.Jackson had files on the Bilderbergers from 1955 to 1964. These files includeagendas, minutes of meetings, lists of participants at the Bilderbergermeetings, even a history of Bilderberger meetings. Surely a treasure-trove forthe academically-inclined paranoid (or the paranoid academic)? It was former CIAdirector Walter Bedell Smith who asked Jackson to help him recruit members forthat mysterious organization. It was also C.D. Jackson who arranged the Lifemagazine purchase of the famous Abraham Zapruder film of the Kennedyassassination, thereby keeping it away from the public view for five years,until the Clay Shaw trial in New Orleans.Psychological warfare is an intelligence function; it involves gathering ofintelligence on target (generally civilian) populations as well as disseminatingpropaganda in various forms; but it also has a more lethal function, and thishas been discussed at length by the respected historian Christopher Simpson inhis excellent and enlightening Science of Coercion: Communication Research &Psychological Warfare 1945-1960. 18 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos686688] There, hediscusses the role Jackson (and fellow Bilderberger Nelson Rockefeller) playedin charge of policy oversight of combined CIA—USIA (US Information Agency) andUS military country plans during the Huk insurrections in the Philippines in themid-1950s. As we saw with the North African memoir of Alfred DeGrazia mentionedearlier, the OSS (forerunner of the CIA) was heavily involved in thePsychological Warfare Bureau from the very start, running joint operations withthe Army in North Africa, Italy and elsewhere.Simpson’s study, however, goes even further and cites clandestine operationssuch as sabotage and assassination as functions of the psychological warfareeffort from the very beginning, for what the establishment considers“psychological warfare” the enemy often considers “terrorism”; these are twosides of the same coin. These operations are not, strictly speaking, military innature, but have as their goal the psychological disorientation of an enemypopulation.The Nazis had already been working a psy-war system of their own since the 1930swhen they came into power. Mystic and Theosophist Otto Ohlendorff, who wouldlater become a famous SS Einsatzgruppe D commando, cut his milk teeth onpsychological warfare programs with his own creation, the DeutscheLebensgebiete, in 1939, before going hunting in the Caucasus, looking for Jewsand Freemasons, and killing ninety thousand innocent people in the process. 19[../Text/ch04.html#filepos687228]Probably the most famous propaganda chief ofthe war itself was the odd-looking, in-your-face Nazi fanatic Josef Goebbels;most Americans and other Allies could not name his opposite number in their owncountries. Propaganda was something the other side did. Our side does not usepropaganda, the story goes; it merely disseminates factual, i.e., truthful,information. Meanwhile, “propaganda” and “psychological warfare” becamesynonymous within the United States intelligence agencies, and psychologicalwarfare was the province of agencies like the famous OSS or the Army’s G-2 andtherefore operated in a cloak-and-dagger world of secrecy.According to Simpson, even the English term “psychological warfare” did not comeinto use until 1941, as a manifestation of that marvelous—and perhaps morerevealing—German neologismWeltanschauungskrieg, or “worldview warfare.” 20[../Text/ch04.html#filepos687559]The term “psychological warfare” was firstappeared in an English language text entitled German Psychological Warfare by anhistorian who would later become famous as the Hungarian-born author of The Gameof the Foxes and Patton: Ladislas Farago. (Farago’s later work, Aftermath, was acrucial factor in the development of this author’s first book,Unholy Alliance.)According to Simpson,> British and Nazi German strategies and tactics in this field have historically> been termed “political warfare” and Weltanschauungskrieg (“worldview> warfare”), respectively. Each of these conceptualizations of psychological> warfare explicitly links mass communication with selective application of> violence (murder, sabotage, assassinations, insurrection, counterinsurrection,> etc.) as a means of achieving ideological, political, or military goals. 21> [../Text/ch04.html#filepos687853]“World-view warfare” says it all: a battle between our perceptions and those ofan enemy population. After all, one could say, isn’t that what war is reallyabout anyway? Rob an enemy of their moral justification for fighting; make yourway seem the right way, the good way, the best way; make their way seem bad,wrong, doomed to failure; and you have robbed an enemy of their will to fight.Even the most crazed suicide bomber is acting from a belief that what he isdoing is right, morally justified, and has the sanction of the people thatmatter, the people that count: God’s people. “The best,” says the poem, “lackall conviction,” but rob the worst of their conviction and the war is over. Itis tantamount to waking up and finding a voodoo doll in your bed, studded withpins… or a horse’s head, á la Mario Puzo’s The Godfather. You’ve been cursed;you will die. And your mind does the rest. That is the value of psychologicalwarfare, of “world-view warfare,” and it works… at least, just as well as thevoodoo doll or the dead horse. In the right hands, one call kill (or influence)without firing a shot.Psy-war was never perceived as a substitute for the real thing, but only as acomplement to an existing arsenal of weapons. The basic psy-war techniques areonly useful insofar as they make the enemy soldiers lose faith in the ability oftheir army, and their country, to win. One can shake that faith in many ways: byridicule, by fake prophecies of doom, by appeals to reason or emotion. Anotherway is through fear.When we speak of “psychological warfare” we are often speaking of ways to makethe enemy afraid, and in order to do this we must understand an enemy’s psyche:what makes him love, hate, fight, run. We must understand how an enemy willreact under stress: will he fight harder, or simply surrender? Or will he startmaking errors in judgment, winning the war for us, in a manner of speaking? Thecostliest mistakes of psychological warfare operations are always those made inignorance of an enemy’s mindset. The psychological warfare officer must be ableto play an enemy’s mind like a violin. This implies a deep knowledge of humanpsychology, which is itself a kind of black art. And since this is a war ofperceptions, of “world views,” it is important that the psychological warfareofficer understand the impact of art, music, literature, theater and othercultural modes of expression and how world-views are represented by them, evenchanged or modified by them. What plays in Peoria may not—very assuredly willnot—play in Phnom Penh……And eventually, the temptation will arise to test some of these principles onthe domestic population. After all, with whose mindset are we the most familiarbut our own? What better place to test new theories of psychological warfarethan among our native populace? And how better to control our populationpolitically than through the judicious use of propaganda, using the robust mediaof the most turned-on, tuned-in, mentally-massaged nation on earth: the UnitedStates of America?ELIMINATION BY ILLUMINATIONPsychological warfare (although in existence for centuries, since at least thetime of Sun Tzu and The Art of War, and formalized in the United States duringthe First World War and George Creel’s Committee of Public Information) wasreally a “discovery” of the Second World War, and its uses were thoroughlyinvestigated in the decades to follow. Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, Africa,the Middle East, Latin America… the roll call of psy-war ops (operations) islong and, for the most part, still classified, representing—again according toSimpson—some one billion dollars per year during the early 1950s alone.22[../Text/ch04.html#filepos688139] It did not end with Habe’s newspapers orflyers dropped from planes, urging enemy soldiers to surrender. It did not endwith the famous “death cards” of Vietnam, the Ace of Spades dropped in Vietcongvillages or on dead VC (a method that was ill-advised and actually did not work,since the Vietnamese did not use the American-style card decks but a different,Chinese version).23 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos688423] It continued on into actsof sabotage, assassination and terrorism, sometimes against entire villages incountries we never knew how to find on a map, whose capitols we couldn’tpronounce. Taken individually, these psychological warfare operations may havehad a succinct political purpose, as defined and identified by nameless men ingrey flannel suits in the corridors of power, or by Presidents and NationalSecurity Advisors to further their own, hidden agendas; but they weremanifestations of something deeper, a spiritual war, a war of “world views,” awar we are still fighting, numbly, into the twenty-first century both at homeand abroad.One of the scholars and academics who codified psychological warfare—via itscreature, the newly-developing science of communications studies andresearch—was Walter Lippmann. Lippmann began his career in psychological warfareand propaganda during the First World War, and was the author of several veryinfluential texts on mass communications based on his wartime experiences. Heunderstood that the technology of mass communications was having a profoundpolitical effect on the world’s citizens, as they became more aware of life inother countries… and the disparity (in wealth, in access to information, inbasic freedoms) between their own nations and their neighbors’. It was Lippmannwho gave us the concept of the “stereotype” (1922), which was basically acontinuation of the Jungian concept of the archetype (1919) by other means. ToLippmann, the world outside our borders exists in a different space,consciously, from our own. We develop notions about life in those countries,their cultures, attitudes, and values, without ever going there. Yet, theirpolitical situation affects our own; they exert a political influence—eitherthrough trade, communications, or transportation—on life in our own country eventhough we live in a constant state of unawareness of those countries, cultures,politics. The effect of these forces on us is invisible, but real. We thendevelop mental images—stereotypes—of the citizens of these countries, and it isupon the stereotypes that we act. The stereotypes determine our actions andreactions; like the stereotypes of the Islamic fundamentalist, the Vietcongrevolutionary, the Red Peril, they are easy targets, and the stereotypecommunicates a specific message, is, in terms familiar to the deconstructionismof Derrida, a text.Stereotypes can be created, and manipulated, by the gurus of mass communicationand psychological warfare. Stereotypes are culturally-loaded and therefore not“value neutral.” We make snap judgments based on the nature of the stereotype;in the hands of the psy-war expert, a stereotype does not contain muchcomplexity or depth. The idea is not to make the target think too clearly or tooprofoundly about the “text” but instead to react, in a Pavlovian manner, to thestimulus it provides.While such stereotypes as Islamic fundamentalists, long-haired hippies, the RedPeril, the Ugly American, the Evil Empire, and others are clearly of a specificpolitical nature and are designed to elicit a specific response from the generalpopulation which is being manipulated for specific ends, there are otherstereotypes that are more difficult to analyze in political terms. These aremore basic to human nature, and involve deeper fears and anxieties, evenreligious or spiritual beliefs. One is reminded of the Flying Tigers of theSecond World War: the fighter planes that were painted with huge teeth and jawsto frighten Chinese villagers and rural troops.But it went further than that. Much further.United States Air Force Brigadier General Edward G. Lansdale was the CIA’s chiefoperative in the Philippines during the Huk rebellion in the 1950s. As such, hewas under the oversight of C. D. Jackson and Nelson Rockefeller, who wereresponsible for psychological warfare operations at that time in the Philippinesand other hot spots. It was Lansdale who came up with the idea of using the Hukbelief in vampires—the asuang—against them. The psy-war squad would snatch a Hukin ambush and then kill him; they would pierce his neck with two holes, like avampire bite, and then hang the body up and drain the blood. They would leavethe body where the Huk would be sure to find it, neck punctured, drained ofblood. 24 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos688987]After his successes in the Philippines, Lansdale was transferred to Vietnam.This was in 1954. At this time, Lansdale followed a psy-war technique that wasused during World War Two: the use of astrologers to predict fatal outcomes forenemy leaders. 25 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos689440]Lansdale was so successful at his work that he was put in charge of organizingOperation Mongoose, the anti-Castro CIA operation designed to destabilize theCuban regime. In one of these operations, Lansdale suggested simulating theSecond Coming. He proposed telling the Cuban people that Fidel Castro was theAnti-Christ, and then staging the return of Jesus, complete with phosphorousshells fired over Havana. His partners in Operation Mongoose called the plan“elimination by illumination.” That was in 1962. 26[../Text/ch04.html#filepos689719]By 1964, the use of occult themes and rituals became an accepted part ofpsychological warfare planning. The Special Operations Research Office (SORO) atthe American University prepared a paper at the request of the US Army on“Witchcraft, Sorcery, Magic and Other Psychological Phenomena and TheirImplications on Military and Paramilitary Operations in the Congo.” The paperwas authored by James R. Price and Paul Jureidini. American University was nostranger to psychological warfare research, having seen the establishment thereof the Bureau of Social Science Research (BSSR) in 1950. The BSSR was the sceneof numerous studies of psychological warfare on Eastern European countries, andits African psy-war studies were underwritten by the Human Ecology Fund, anorganization well-known to researchers of government-sponsored mind controlprograms as a front for the CIA’s MK-ULTRA program. 27[../Text/ch04.html#filepos689998]The SORO paper studied the use of occult ideas and techniques by “insurgentelements” in the Republic of the Congo. It states,> Magical practices are said to be effective in conditioning dissident elements> and their followers to do battle with Government troops. Rebel tribesmen are> said to have been persuaded that they can be made magically impervious to> Congolese army firepower. Their fear of the government has thus been> diminished and, conversely, fear of the rebels has grown within army ranks.28> [../Text/ch04.html#filepos690293]The study was ambitious in scope. Like a good psy-war study, it recommended that“today’s insurgency situation should not be studied in a vacuum, but should beconsidered as part of a continuum stemming from the pre-independence Belgianadministration, the impact of Western culture upon African tribal systems, thecircumstances of the birth of the Congo Republic, and the nature of the strugglefor power within the Congo since 1960.” 29 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos690908]Theadministration of Premier Patrice Lumumba was examined, and the study revealedthat his followers set up a political machine that incorporated African tribalculture “including manifestations of beliefs in magic and witchcraft.”30[../Text/ch04.html#filepos691194]The section entitled “Supernatural Aspects of the Present Insurgency Situation”could be read as a treatment of the Salem witchcraft phenomenon, so closely dothe two situations parallel each other. Any sudden illness or misfortune isinterpreted as a sign of witchcraft at work; indeed, there is an importantdistinction made in the SORO study that even though the villagers may understandthat a building was destroyed due to the actions of termites, “sthat it fell atthe time it did was a result of witchcraft or sorcery.” 31[../Text/ch04.html#filepos691479]This is a sophisticated point of view withregard to the action of occult influences on mundane life, and as such comescloser to a modern interpretation of occult forces rather than the older,blanket concept which tended to blame everything on the invisible mechanisms ofmagic and supernatural powers.In addition, the authors discovered that some of the tribes studied believedthat the power of witchcraft could be put to use unconsciously, due to“hostility or envy,” and that the “witch” may not even know that he or shepossesses occult ability. This is also a sophisticated concept, and loaded withimplications regarding the limits of human moral responsibility.In the end, the study admitted that beliefs in witchcraft and sorcery werevirtually endemic to the Congolese tribes in spite of five hundred years ofexposure to foreign influences and particularly to Catholic and Protestantmissionaries in the past hundred years. Ironically, it was the very attempt byBelgian authorities to eradicate the more lethal forms of occult belief thatcontributed to the growth of witchcraft. They had banned the use of the poisontest, an ordeal by which a person suspected of witchcraft is given poison todrink. If he survives, he must be a witch. This is similar in nature to theEuropean practice of “dunking” a bound witch into a lake or pond; if the witchfloated to the surface and thus avoided drowning, she was surely a witch.Execution of convicted witches—practiced regularly before the advent of theBelgian administration—was also banned, thus giving rise to a fear that evilwitches were multiplying beyond control.As the SORO report states,> As a result, many Africans feel that western political systems such as the> modern state have aligned themselves on the side of evil because from their> standpoint the “civilized” elimination of traditional control measures work to> protect witches and sorcerers from retaliation by their innocent victims. The> African man-in-the-bush is, therefore, much more at the mercy of those who> wish to harm him by supernatural means than ever before. He thus tends to rely> more and more upon the witch-doctor who, in the absence of the poison ordeal> and other drastic sanctions, provides the main source> of protection from evil. 32 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos691764]The advice of the SORO team was to study thoroughly the 200 or more Congolesetribes and to compile a comprehensive database on their beliefs, sincesuperstitions vary from tribe to tribe. They also recommended that no psy-waroperations using witchcraft or the occult be employed until the actual methodswere examined and approved by their opposite numbers in the Congolesegovernment. They recommended that the use of magical practices in a psy-waroperation be relegated to “limited tactical objectives rather than broadstrategic concepts or solutions to fundamental problems.”33[../Text/ch04.html#filepos692049] Further,> A sound understanding of magical concepts, practices, and mannerisms is> necessary for defensive purposes should they play any role or importance in an> insurgency situation…. Detailed studies of supernatural beliefs of specific> tribes are limited.The secrecy inherent in most magical rituals presents a> formidable obstacle to the outside investigator, whether he may be a scientist> or an intelligence agent. 34 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos692335]The report is sober, and dismissive of the long-term benefits of using occultmethods in psy-war against the insurgents. The writers feared that using“superstition” would only validate magical thinking among the tribes, thuslaying the philosophical groundwork for the next crop of anti-Governmentwitches. The report outlined several important reservations, stating that“tribalism and superstition, so closely related to each other, have provided afertile seedbed for political instability in the Congo, and measures whichenhance the divisive and destructive aspects of tribalism simply lay additionalobstacles in the already cluttered path toward Congolese nationhood. Should thecentral government successfully use occult methods to defeat a movement based onsuch methods, the very concepts of sorcery and magic which lend impetus to theinsurgencies of the moment may gain strength and acquire even greatertrouble-making potential for the future.” 35 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos692622]Very politically-correct. But what if Congolese nationhood was not the ultimategoal of the US administration? What if political instability was the goal? Thatcertainly was the result, no matter how well-planned or unplanned, for the Congobecame the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which became Zaire, which becameonce again the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1997. Patrice Lumumba, whohad asked the UN to intervene in a case of insurrection in Katanga Province (aninsurrection supported by Belgian troops) and was denied this assistance, thenturned to the Soviet Union. That strategy spelled doom for Lumumba’sadministration, because it painted him in Communist colors even though he wasmore a nationalist than an “internationalist.” He was targeted by the CIA andeventually killed, leaving his legacy up for grabs in a power struggle ofoperatic dimensions that has not diminished to this day. If political stabilityin the Congo was the goal of the US administrations and their intelligenceagencies since the 1960s, then they failed utterly. But if their goal was toincrease instability—to ensure the ouster of Lumumba who was siding with theSoviets, and to guarantee a weak, pro-US regime in its stead, with Mobutu andhis kleptocracy, for example—then they were quite successful. We will probablynever know to what extent psychological warfare operations were used in theCongo, and if they included magic spells and sorcery. What seems certain,however, is that the Congolese tribes never abandoned their native beliefs.Indeed, it was Mobutu—a puppet of US interests—who reinstated old Africantraditions in his country, forcing his citizens to change their names to moresuitably “African” ones and to adopt African dress. It was the return of thewitch-doctor, something the US accepted and encouraged in exchange for Mobutu’ssupport against Communist strategies in Africa.In Vietnam, events took an even stranger turn.SPIRITUAL WARFAREFor instance, there was Operation Wandering Souls. The Vietnamese, as manyothers around the world, fear being buried in an unmarked grave. This may havesomething to do with Chinese influences, of course, since China was a nation ofancestor-worship, and there is a holiday every year in which dutiful Chinesevisit the graves of their ancestors and burn incense. This practice is soimportant, in fact, that each year Hong Kong must contend with entire hillsidesset on fire by the joss sticks and “hell money” burned on the gravesites amidvery dry vegetation. (The author once drove from the new Hong Kong airport tothe city during this season, and the flames which covered the hills and lookedlike the worst of California brush fires had reached the highway, making thepassage—if not actually precarious or life-threatening—certainly dramatic!)The Army PSYOPs personnel used this fear as a weapon in their spooky arsenal.They broadcast eerie sounds and spectral wailing at night from helicopters in anattempt to make the villagers believe that they were the ghosts of dead VC,searching for their unmarked graves and desperate because their families couldnot find them.On May 10, 1967 the Joint United States Public Affairs Office (JUSPAO), Saigon,issued their Policy Number 36, “The Use of Superstitions in PsychologicalOperations in Vietnam.”36 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos692907] It is a shortdocument, no more than four pages, and begins:IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. MISSION DIRECTIVES, THIS IS MISSION PSYCHOLOGICAL POLICYAND GUIDANCE AND IS TO BE IMPLEMENTED AS PERTINENT BY ALL U.S. ELEMENTS INVIETNAM.The document goes on:> A strong superstition or a deeply-held belief shared by a substantial number> of the enemy target audience can be used as a psychological weapon because it> permits with some degree of probability the prediction of individual or group> behavior under a given set of conditions.This is about as clear and concise a definition of psychological warfareprinciples as any. It is also as cynical. While this document was prepared formilitary actions in Vietnam, the same concept—using a “deeply-held belief” as apsychological weapon—can be ported from the Third World and used anywhere, nomatter what the “deeply-held belief”: fundamentalist Christianity, Mormonism,Buddhism, etc.> A further example of the cynicism in which this program was spawned can be> shown in the following paragraph:> In summary, the manipulation of superstitions is a delicate affair. Tampering> with deeply-held beliefs, seeking to turn them to your advantage means in> effect playing God and it should only be attempted if one can get away with it> and the game is indeed worth the candle. Failure can lead to ridicule, charges> of clumsiness and callousness that can blacken the reputation of psychological> operations in general. It is a weapon to be employed selectively and with> utmost skill and deftness. There can be no excuse for failure. 37> [../Text/ch04.html#filepos693204]Where did the Army PSYOPS people draw the line between religion andsuperstition? Were they any more successful than, for instance, James Frazer orClaude Levi-Strauss or Marcel Mauss? By playing God, what effect did they haveon the lives and belief systems of the civilian populations in the targetcountries? Suddenly, it seems as if there is a dialectical change from the SOROreport on the Congo, mentioned above, to the JUSPAO Policy memo for Vietnam. “Doit,” the policy memo seems to say. “Just don’t get caught and whatever you dodon’t damage the reputation of psychological operations in the process.”> There can be no excuse for failure.> The final paragraph of the JUSPAO memo reflects the attitude of spiritual> warfare in the twentieth century:> Where the superstitions of friendly forces and populations are concerned,> psyops personnel will assist commanders as required or called upon in devising> indoctrination materials familiarizing troops with these beliefs and> counseling respect for and sensitivity to local beliefs and traditions. 38> [../Text/ch04.html#filepos693500]In other words, there are good superstitions and bad superstitions. The UStroops were being trained to know the difference between the superstitions oftarget, i.e., VC populations and those of the “good Vietnamese.” One did notrequire respect and sensitivity for the superstitions of the Viet Cong, ofcourse, since they were the enemy. Evidently it was assumed that there was adifference in belief system between the two groups. Spiritual warfare.Truly. In the early 1950s, an American neurologist began a series of researchprojects to determine how a psychic ability such as extrasensory perceptioncould be used as a weapon in psychological warfare. In November 1952 he briefedthe Pentagon on the military uses of parapsychology. From 1953 to 1955, he was acaptain in the Army and stationed at the Army Chemical Center at Edgewood,Maryland to conduct psychic experiments. His name was Dr. Andrija Puharich, andwe will be covering his story more thoroughly later on, as he is a key elementin the story of American military and intelligence agency involvement in thestudy and use of supernatural abilities as potential weapons in wartime, hot andcold.Somehow, the search for the story behind the murder of young Marina Habe inHollywood in 1968 led to her father, an important figure in World War IIliterature, to the OSS, psychological warfare operations, the Congo, Vietnam andbeyond. Marina was believed to be an associate of the Manson “family,” and it isalleged that Charles Manson himself stabbed her to death. Was she selected for aparticular reason, or was it just an evil coincidence? There is some evidence toshow that the Manson “family” murder of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca the day afterthe Tate murders was a contract killing. Indeed, much of the violenceperpetrated by Manson and his followers had a basis in other criminal activity.They were purposeful. Manson does not fit the profile of a serial killer, andindeed his crimes do not fit that pattern at all. A serial killer would not havemissed the slaughter at the Tate household, for instance, which Manson had done,sending his followers inside to commit the hideous knife attacks on the fiveunfortunate victims. If he was somehow responsible for the murder of his uncle,Darwin Scott, that can be laid to a family grudge going back to Manson’schildhood in Ashland, Kentucky.Why, then, was Marina killed? A lust killing, pure and simple? Manson gettingoff on savagely murdering a college coed? His schedule for the day of the kidnapof Marina Habe and her subsequent murder argues against this; he left DeathValley for one day and returned the next. That implies he went to Los Angeleswith a specific purpose in mind, a task to accomplish, and returned when thedeed was done.Marina’s mother—Eloise Hardt—had looked out her window that night at3:30 A.M. and saw a black sedan next to her daughter’s smaller, foreign car andtwo men, one who looked young, about twenty years old. The sedan peeled out, andwhen Mrs. Hardt went to investigate, her daughter was nowhere to be found.Manson had been driving a black sedan that day, and had been visiting John andMichelle Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas at a New Year’s Eve party. 39[../Text/ch04.html#filepos693796]Marina had been known to the Manson group, and thus they would presumably haveknown of her famous father and his activities during the war. Hans Habe had leftthe United States for the calmer environment of Switzerland. He had writtenbooks criticizing America, and particularly the Warren Report. He was anintelligence officer, there at the birth of the CIA from the eccentric “band ofbrothers” of the OSS and the US Army Psychological Warfare Bureau, which liaisedwith the OSS to the extent that the lines between the two spy shops nearlyvanished.And Marina was killed in 1968, at the height of the Vietnam War and less than ayear after the famous Tet Offensive of January 1968, in the midst of enormousdomestic dislocation in the United States, with student protests, peace marches,demonstrations, and the growth of the Weather Underground. For Manson’s mostfamous victim, he chose Sharon Tate, the daughter of an Army intelligenceofficer serving in Vietnam. Was there a connection? Two victims, both female,both daughters of intelligence officers, both living in Los Angeles; murderedwithin eight months of each other.The author did not know if there was anything more concrete tying these twocases together than the fact that the murders were likely committed by the samegroup. Perhaps the Habe angle was ancient history. Hans Habe’s intelligencecareer seemed to end in the early 1950s—in fact, the same year his daughter wasborn in 1951. But were there other connections between Habe and military orintelligence operations in the United States after that time? Was that Hans Habein the photograph of Paperclip scientists in Chicago in 1950?What was Paperclip?CROSSBOW, OVERCAST, PAPERCLIPThere had to have been a level at which the US government’s leaders identifiedwith the Nazis, or at least admired them. There had to have been a point atwhich the crimes of the Holocaust were considered a minor problem, a kind ofpublic relations nuisance, that was overshadowed by the glamour of theperfectly-run superstate of the Third Reich. There must have been anunderstanding that the ideologies of America and Nazi Germany were more alikethan the ideologies of America and the Soviet Union. This is because there isjust no other way to interpret what took place at the very end of the war;morally, what transpired can only be considered a war crime itself.In 1945, Nazi scientists—using slave labor from concentration camps— were in arace to develop superweapons to enable Hitler to win the war. They were workingat Peenemuende and Nordhausen, famous rocket laboratories where the V-1 and V-2rockets were designed which made life such hell in Great Britain, and where evennewer, more lethal rockets and weapons were being developed. Alfred Einstein wasworried that the Nazis were on the verge of developing an atomic bomb, andcommunicated this concern to President Roosevelt. And, what was worse, Russiantroops were advancing towards Peenemuende from the east and would capture theNazi rocket scientists and their laboratories, factories and blueprints, thuspermitting the Soviets unprecedented access to the “art of German engineering.”Policy makers in Washington knew that the next major conflicts would be foughtbetween the United States and the Soviet Union, and they could not permit theRussians to have the upper hand in technology. It was of utmost importance thatthose scientists—or as many of them as possible—made it to American shores, outof reach of the Russians and, more importantly perhaps, pressed into service tothe United States.To that end, several wartime intelligence operations were put in motion.The most famous of these is Operation Paperclip, of course; yet outside ofpoorly researched, poorly documented newsletters, websites and pamphletsproduced by the fraternity of conspiracy theorists, very little informationabout Paperclip and its implications and ramifications is available to themodern American reading public. It is no longer discussed in Congress; it is notdebated on CNN. One of the most accessible of the Paperclip studies is LindaHunt’s Secret Agenda, published in 1991; yet by 1999 when the author beganwriting the present chapter, that book was out of print in English and totallyunavailable. Recourse was had to a translated edition which was ordered fromParis under its French title, L’Affaire Paperclip. Other important works includeTom Bower’s two books, mentioned above, as well as another—very important—workby Christopher Simpson, Blowback. Much of the information contained in thesevolumes had to be extricated from the grasp of the US government under theFreedom of Information Act by the authors and their sources, and it is revealingthat thousands of documents pertaining to the Second World War and Alliedintelligence activities are still classified as of this writing. The picturethat is revealed is not a pretty one; even as late as 1983 with the deportationof Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie, the American government was denying that anymass recruitment of war criminals had ever taken place on US soil or under USgovernment authority. History now tells a different story.Most people who have heard of Paperclip assume that it was a program to bringNazi scientists to the United States to assist the space program, a concept thatis at least partially true. There was much more to Paperclip—and to subsequentNazi recruitment—than rocket science, however. Nazi medical personnel were alsorecruited, as well as psychological warfare experts and, with the GehlenOrganization, spies, assassins and saboteurs. Eventually, some of these importedNazi war criminals wound up holding impressive executive positions in Americanindustry, principally high-technology firms in the aerospace and militaryhardware industries. That indefatigable researcher and conspiriologist, the lateMae Brussel, even suggested that the Paperclip Nazis had been involved in theKennedy assassination! While that theory seems very far-fetched, there are somedisturbing connections between the recruited Nazis and people close to theassassination, and these will be examined a bit later on.It is important to realize that, at the end of the war, the new enemy was theSoviet Union, even though America and Russia had been allies during the waragainst Nazi Germany. It was, after all, General Patton himself who tried toconvince Washington that we were pointing our weapons in the wrong direction andshould make all haste to invade Russia and put an end to the Soviet state onceand for all. (American schoolchildren never learn that, at the end of World WarOne, we had tried to do just that.)Most people also never learn that the Catholic Church and various EasternOrthodox churches were also involved in rescuing these war criminals andassisting them to find new homes (and employers) in the Americas, North andSouth. Some—such as Alois Brunner—even wound up in the Middle East, in Syria andEgypt, creating secret police organizations there and working for the CIA viathe Gehlen Organization.40 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos694095] Brunner has beenaccused of murdering more than 120,000 men, women and children during the war,in countries ranging from France and Greece to Slovakia. Other Nazis wound up asfar away as Australia and, it has been suggested to the author, in regions asremote as the mountains of northern Thailand and the islands of the Indonesianarchipelago.The Paperclip story is long and complex; it involves the alphabet soup ofintelligence agencies and programs, from CROWCASS to CIC, SIS, OSS, CIA, JIOA,and many more. It deals with dozens of countries and their respectiveintelligence organizations, armies, political parties, churches, and criminaljustice systems. Interested readers are encouraged to seek out the booksmentioned above and draw their own conclusions. For now, the author willconcentrate on those areas of Paperclip that pertain more directly to our story.By December of 1943, it had become apparent to the Allies that the Germans wereworking on a series of secret weapons, notably rockets, at a number of sites inGermany. The most famous, of course, was Peenemuende, located at thenortheastern tip of Germany, close to the Polish border. Bombing raids onPeenemuende forced the Nazis to diversify their rocket research to other centersaround the country, and perhaps the most famous of these is Niedersachswerfen,in the Harz Mountains, the site of the Mittelwerke and only a few miles awayfrom two concentration camps—Nordhausen and Dora—that would provide slave laborfor the rocket factory. Slave labor was also provided by the prisoners atBuchenwald. But before the Mittelwerke (Central Works) became the prime focus ofthe rocket effort, a decision had been made in London that Nazi long rangeweapons research, development, and production had to be stopped at all costs. Ateam was brought together to concentrate on the problem and to allocateresources to its execution. This team was known by the project name Crossbow,and was led by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill himself. 41[../Text/ch04.html#filepos694475]As the war began to wind down with the success of the D-Day invasion and thelarge-scale Allied assault, tensions in Germany grew high. On July 20, 1944—sixweeks after D-Day—a group of Nazi generals attempted the assassination of AdolfHitler, an attempt that failed almost miraculously. For months, Crossbow hadbeen initiating bombing raids against Peenemuende and the Mittelwerke in adesperate attempt to stall (if not completely cancel) Germany’s rocket andsecret weapon development. In the United States, the Manhattan Project was wellunderway and progress was being made in the development of the world’s firstatomic bomb; yet the Allies were worried that the Nazis might be making thesame—or even greater—progress from the hidden tunnels in the Harz Mountainswhere the rockets were being designed. Their worst fear was that the Nazis hadthe bomb; they knew they already had the rocket delivery system necessary tosend it anywhere in Europe.Himmler understood the urgent need for the secret weapons being developed by theNazi scientists as the war was starting to go against the Germans, and at onepoint had approached Wernher von Braun to ask him if he would like to workdirectly for the Reichsfuehrer-SS himself, rather than deal with “Army redtape.” Von Braun politely declined, but the pressure was on. 42[../Text/ch04.html#filepos695007]As the Russians advanced from the East, they were coming perilously close toPeenemuende. The Allies were worried that the cream of Nazi science would fallinto Soviet hands. The Germans shared their concern, and began moving thescientists and their families out of Peenemuende in the spring of 1945 to thecentral German towns of Nordhausen and Bleicherode, where they continued theirresearch at the Mittelwerke. Before leaving, however, they managed to destroy asmuch of Peenemuende’s classified information as possible, leaving only askeleton crew behind when the Russians finally entered the town on May 5, 1945.Nordhausen, however, was right in the way of the American advance, and itappeared that the US Army would reach the Nazi scientists before anyone else.The race was on to capture as much as possible: scientists, blueprints, actualrockets and other weapons and machinery. OSS, CIC and other intelligence unitsspread out through Germany in a desperate effort to deny the Soviets thetechnological advantage of Nazi science, and in July 1945 the effort wascoordinated under the project name Overcast.Overcast would not become Paperclip until March 13, 1946 when security leaksrequired a change of codename, but the project mission was the same. By the timePaperclip was over, thousands of Nazi scientists—many of them accused warcriminals who had participated in some of the war’s worst outrages—had managedto find homes in the United States, South America and other locations. In manycases, they brought their families with them as well. And while the Paperclipagents were seeking scientists, other organizations were looking for Naziespionage agents and recruiting them by the thousands to work for the UnitedStates and Great Britain against the Soviets. The most famous intelligence coupof the post-war period was the recruitment of General Reinhard Gehlen, a Nazispymaster whose specialty was Russia and Eastern Europe. His story is told,albeit thinly disguised, in Hans Habe’s Agent of the Devil, where he isidentified as “General von Greehahn.” Habe treats his subject cynically, and itis easy to see that he has become frustrated with Allied duplicity where thede-Nazification process was concerned. The book was published in 1958, by whichtime Habe had retreated to the aloof neutrality of the Swiss Alps.Gehlen—like Habe’s fictional Greehahn—was a con artist as well as a spy, whichis probably a different way of saying the same thing. He convinced the CIA thathis support, and those of his friends and former staff, was essential to westernefforts to contain the Soviet advance. Today, Gehlen’s real value to Americanintelligence is being seriously questioned, but in those days he was somethingof a hero: “our” German, a “good” German who was fighting the good fight againstthe Communist menace. Habe probably had an insider’s view of the famous General,owing to his privileged position within American intelligence in post-warGermany. While not a spy-master or superspy, Habe’s political influence inGermany was strong, and he had many friends among the OSS and the US Army’sPsychological Warfare Bureau. He was in a position to witness thede-Nazification process at first hand and—as authors such as Hunt, Simpson andBower have documented in exhaustive detail—this process was doomed from thebeginning. Habe was in a position to watch the OSS morph into the CIA, and toobserve how many of his sworn enemies became CIA operatives while he sat inMunich or Berlin, writing articles and editing newspapers for the Allies.Habe assigns a mystical streak to Gehlen/Greehahn, which would not be surprisingin the least. The higher ranking Nazis were contaminated with the ersatzpaganism and popular occultism of the Thule Gesellschaft variety which had beenabsorbed into the SS with torchlight processions and runic chants. As early as1958, Habe was writing of the “materialization of the psychic” as the next stepin technology, putting these words in the mouth of his General. What can be morecreepy than a Nazi intelligence chief predicting a world in which his peopledominate the realm of the metaphysical, through the use of technology thatenhances psychic abilities? Habe seemed to sense this direction, and one wondersif it was the fruit of his intelligence and psy-war connections on both sides ofthe fence in Germany? How strange… how very, very strange… that his daughtermight have been murdered by a man who claimed just those sorts of abilities.ROCKET SCIENCEAs the post-war years continued through the 1940s and into the 1950s, Nazis ofevery stripe wound up doing research for the American defense program. They werebased all over the United States, depending on their specialty, but severallocations stand out as more important than the rest.Perhaps the most intriguing locale for former Nazi scientists was Randolph AirForce Base in Texas. Unlike Fort Bliss, near El Paso, where by February 1946more than 100 Nazi scientists were in residence, working on the rocket program,Randolph AFB near San Antonio was used for more arcane research.It was at Randolph that we come across the name of Dr. Hubertus Strughold.Strughold managed to escape the fate of his Nazi colleagues by clevermaneuvering and outright lying about his work and his responsibility—aided andabetted by American intelligence agencies—but in the end as more and more fileswere found and declassified, it became apparent that Dr. Strughold was right inthe middle of some of the more heinous medical experimentation this planet hasever known.Aviation medicine is a specialized field which has since developed intoaerospace medicine, the study of the physical effects of space travel on thehuman body. In the war years, however, attention was devoted to the effects ofextreme cold, high pressure, oxygen deprivation and high altitude, as well asthe effects of freezing water… for those pilots who would be downed over theopen sea, for instance. Aircraft were being developed that could fly atastonishing speeds, and climb to unthinkable altitudes. Obviously, in conditionsof airwar, the advantage was to the planes—and the pilots—who commanded theskies: the perfect combination of high-performance machines with highly-trained,physically-fit pilots. A new medical science was created to study how the vastlydifferent environment of the air—as opposed to the earth, the domain of thefootsoldier—affected the lives and the performance of human beings.Aviation medicine was begun in Germany, in 1912, by Nathan Zuntz. Ironically,Zuntz was Jewish.43 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos695293] The first German aviationdoctors built their own pressure chambers and centrifuges and experimented uponthemselves, reporting their results in professional journals to the awe andadmiration of the small, but elite, international community of aviationspecialists. By the 1930s, conferences in Germany on aviation medicine werebeing attended by physicians and specialists from all over the world. Dr.Hubertus Strughold was one of these famous aviation medicine specialists, and hemade friends with other members of the international community, includingAmerican military surgeons.As director of an aviation medicine research institute for the Luftwaffe,holding the rank of Colonel, Strughold was in a position to know of the horrificmedical experiments being carried out on living human beings at Dachau in thename of aviation medicine, some of which were being conducted by his friends andco-workers. Prior to the war years, aviation doctors had risked their own livesin these experiments. Now, with such a wealth of potential guinea pigs at theirdisposal, there was no need to endanger the lives of scientists. Experiments inhigh altitude pressure, extremes of heat and cold, etc. were carried out onliving Jewish and political prisoners at Dachau, and these results shared amongthe members of the Nazi aviation medicine community.Strughold had attended an important meeting of ninety-five senior officers inNuremberg in October 1942, during which these experiments were openly discussed,experiments conducted by colleagues who reported to him and others to whomStrughold himself reported. Such notorious Nazi scientists as Dr. SigmundRascher—a Luftwaffe staff surgeon and member of Himmler’s SS—had contributed44[../Text/ch04.html#filepos695587] to these reports on the experiments, some ofwhich had been filmed for the edification of Heinrich Himmler and a selectaudience. Later, Strughold would try to distance himself from Rascher and hisexperiments, but the documentation would go against him. Strughold was anassociate of Dr. Siegfried Ruff—with whom he had co-authored a textbook, theAtlas der Luftfahrtmedizin (Aviation Medicine) published in Leipzig in 1942—andit was Ruff who was assigned by Lieutenant-General Professor Erich Hippke toassist Rascher in the human guinea pig medical program at Dachau’s experimentalBlock Number Five. Hippke was the Luftwaffe’s chief surgeon, and as such wasStrughold’s boss. Ruff, although a close personal friend of Strughold, did notwork for Hippke, but was “invited” to join the human experimentation program toassist Rascher. (Sigmund Ruff and Siegfried Rascher! It is not often that evilattains such Wagnerian proportions.)The experiments involved plunging prisoners into ice-cold water, withthermometers stuck in their various orifices, to measure how long it took for alive human being to freeze to death. Prisoners were also subjected to oxygendeprivation, to high pressure experiments, etc., and much of this was capturedon still and motion pictures, some of which have survived to this day. It is notknown how many prisoners in total died as a result of these “experiments,” buteyewitness testimony indicates that eighty prisoners alone died as a result ofthe high pressure tests conducted by Rascher. 45[../Text/ch04.html#filepos696207]Strughold later admitted that everyone at theNuremberg conference, for instance, was well aware that humanbeings—prisoners—were being used in the experiments, and that many of thesesubjects had died as a result of the tests. No objections were raised.The Nuremberg prosecutors, however, were hot on the trail of the Nazi doctors.The scientists had managed to destroy their files, so all that remained wereHimmler’s SS files, which were discovered at the end of the war. The evidence inHimmler’s files was very suggestive, however, and brought to light much morethan what the Nazi scientists previously admitted had taken place. The problemwas that most of the evidence against the doctors was circumstantial, and theprosecutors could not break the wall of silence that had grown up around thedefendants as they corroborated each other’s alibis and denied any knowledge ofwrongdoing. While all of this was going on, Strughold sat in Heidelberg andedited the medical experimentation reports of his colleagues to ensure that noembarrassing admissions had taken place. He edited out all references to thehuman experimentation program, and thus presented a completely sanitized versionof Nazi aviation medicine research, which was subsequently published as amassive, two-volume study, with some chapters actually written by Naziscientists who had been condemned at Nuremberg for war crimes. This study waspublished by the US Air Force as German Aviation Medicine, and contained nothingabout the human experiments, no reference to the prisoners who had lost theirlives at Dachau and at other camps and “institutes” throughout the Reich.Strughold himself avoided prosecution, as military intelligence considered himtoo valuable to US aviation medicine programs; thus he was able to remain behindat Heidelberg, far away from the prosecutors and jail cells at Nuremberg, andcontinue his painstaking destruction of the evidence against him and hiscolleagues.Dachau was not the only site of human medical experimentation; studies usingprisoners were taking place everywhere in the Reich. Experiments on livesubjects had taken place in settings as diverse as Chalais Meudon in France andOccupied Prague. The experimenters at the last two sites had already foundrefuge and employment in the United States as early as 1947. Rascher had wantedto use Auschwitz as well, as it was a much larger camp and thus an easier placeto hide the hideous experiments he had planned. Rascher complained thatsometimes his subjects screams were quite loud during the course of theexperiments, and that he needed a larger, more secure installation to continuehis research in relative comfort, far from potential witnesses.In the end, everything was blamed on the SS, even though the SS officers at thecamps had no ability to conduct the experiments, no medical training, and couldnot even be expected to know how to operate the complex machinery. Not that theSS was blameless, of course. It was Himmler who was approving this type ofexperimentation right and left. His Ahnenerbe-SS was conducting its ownexperimentation on live subjects at Dachau, and was making a collection of humanskulls from among the living prisoner population, a collection to be used inanthropological research. Indeed, Rascher was an SS officer, and Nuremberg wouldhave loved to have had him in the dock, but he was executed on orders of Himmlertwo weeks before the end of the war. With Rascher dead, and the files destroyed,there remained only the testimony of the doctors themselves… or that of thewitnesses, but in most cases the witnesses had died as a result of theexperiments. Many of the Nazi doctors thus waltzed away free, and found refugein America.Strughold and his team wound up at Randolph AFB in Texas, where they continuedtheir research in aviation medicine, a field then being changed to “spacemedicine.” This was the School of Aviation Medicine that was begun at Mineola,Long Island (New York) during World War One, and which was subsequently moved toBrooks Air Force Base in Texas before winding up at Randolph. It is important torealize that NASA—the US government’s civilian space agency—had not yet beenformed, and would not be until July 29, 1958. Until then, space research wasmilitary research, and fell under the US Army and, eventually (1947) the newlycreated US Air Force. In fact, it was at Randolph that the “first Department ofSpace Medicine in the world” was established, on February 9, 1949… nearly tenyears before the creation of NASA. Strughold then became the world’s firstprofessor of Space Medicine. 46 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos696494]Thus, Strughold’s team was developing the field of aviation and space medicinestrictly for US military applications, acting under the authority and theunapologetic protection of the man who would eventually become the head of theUS Air Force’s aviation medicine program, Colonel Harry Armstrong. It wasArmstrong who had first met Strughold at an aviation medicine conference inGermany in 1934, and who from then on considered himself a friend of the Nazidoctor. Further, Armstrong kept requesting more and more Nazi scientists as timewent by, forcing General C.P. Cabell of Air Force Intelligence to warn Armstrongoff. 47 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos697051]Yet, Armstrong did not back down, butkept asking for more visas for more Nazis to bolster his growing aviationmedicine team at Randolph.Whatever the morality of recruiting German scientists—many of them committedNazis, some actually accused of war crimes—to assist the United States spaceprogram and other military efforts, there was another dimension to the Randolphteam that has gone virtually unnoticed by researchers due to the near total lackof documentation and the lack of living witnesses. The evidence that does existis largely circumstantial, but much of it can be found in the Captured GermanDocuments section of the National Archives and then collated with latertestimony and other odd clues that turn up in memoirs, biographies and historiesof the war years and its aftermath. Like the infamous MK-ULTRA files that weredestroyed at CIA headquarters on the orders of Richard Helms, documentation onNazi psychological warfare and mind control research was also eitherdestroyed—by the Nazis themselves—or concealed under very high securityclassifications by the US military and intelligence establishment.The first indication we have that anything like a mind control program existedwithin the Third Reich is the memoir of Himmler’s astrologer, Wulff, who talksabout the Nazi desire to create a program within the Reich to duplicate themental state of the Japanese soldier, a human being willing and eager to riskhis life without question for his country, stuffing his own body into pillboxesto blow them up, and the Chinese Communist “human wave” trooper, who would rushunthinkingly into certain slaughter. This “Asian” mentality was something theNazis would have dearly loved to inculcate into their own troops, and Wulff—seenas an expert on Asian mysticism—was hired to come up with ways that could beused to condition the German soldier the same way. 48[../Text/ch04.html#filepos697807]Buried in the voluminous files of the Ahnenerbe-SS are also references to theuse of mescaline and cannabis as “truth serums,” programs that—according to JohnMarks in his ground-breaking study of CIA mind control projects—have been keptclassified by US intelligence since 1945. 49[../Text/ch04.html#filepos698110]Here and there we come across the names ofPaperclip scientists involved with military and CIA mind control programs, suchas Friedrich Hoffmann, a Nazi chemist who advised the CIA on matters relating topsychotropic substances for use in interrogation and “brainwashing.” 50[../Text/ch04.html#filepos698594]Hoffmann has been linked to Edgewood Arsenal,where CIA maintained TSS (Technical Service Staff) personnel involved in variousaspects of chemical and biological warfare, including—according to JohnMarks—the implantation of new memories in amnesiac patients.51[../Text/ch04.html#filepos699071] One finds an article by Hoffmann, andco-authors William A. Mosher and Richard Hively, on the subject of “Isolation ofTrans-*6-Tetrahydrocannibinol from Marijuana” in the April 20, 1966 issueofJournal of the American Chemical Society, an issue published—ironicallyenough—on Hitler’s birthday. Hoffmann was working at the time under the cover ofthe University of Delaware, along with his co-author Mosher. Another colleagueat the University was Dr. James Moore, a chemist originally with Parke, Davis inDetroit, and a person well-known among aficionados as deeply implicated in theCIA’s MK-ULTRA program, who experimented on mind-altering substances such asmescaline, psilocybin and the highly controversial drug BZ (quinuclidinylbenzilate).The ready supply of prisoners at Dachau provided a steady stream of guinea pigsfor these chemical experiments and tests. Cannabis and mescaline were bothused—sometimes in very large doses—along with hypnosis to see if any of thesemechanisms could be used as truth serums, magical potions to unlock the secretsof the mind. At the same time, in the United States, OSS agents were using thesame or similar drugs on unsuspecting targets—such as Mafia “made men”—to see ifthe same objectives could be attained. Gradually, in the US, hypnosis was alsoused, sometimes in combination with drugs. And if false information, or“suggestions,” could be implanted in the subject, then we have an instance wherethe goals of psychological warfare and regular intelligence work overlap. In thecase of the latter, the methodology was fine-tuned to the individual subject fora specific purpose: as it turned out, this purpose—as seen by the CIA and bytheir counterparts in other countries—was assassination.We have seen that the Germans were among the first to study the uses ofpsychological warfare; we also have seen that psychological warfare becameinextricably intertwined with propaganda and communication studies and scienceon the “soft” side, and eventually bled over into acts that can only beconsidered terrorism: assassinations, sabotage, torture and interrogation, onthe “hard” side. Indeed, terrorism is nothing more than a form of psychologicalwarfare, as acts of terrorism have no intrinsic military value aside from theireffects on the psyches of the target populations. As psychological warfarebecame more sophisticated—and the intelligence services at once more creativeand more demanding—new techniques were developed and virtually codified. One ofthese was “disinformation,” a method by which false information is “leaked” insuch a way as to make the receiver believe itis valid data. Disinformation can be used in several ways: in the first place,to make a target believe something false so they will act on the falseinformation, wasting time, energy and money in the process and being deflectedfrom any genuinely sensitive areas; in the second place, to trace the flow ofinformation within a target intelligence shop. Like the dye that is used instaining biological slides, disinformation can be used to follow the trail of aninvented story from place to place, from agent to agent, to find out if there isa mole or double agent in the system.All of these techniques—hallucinogenic drugs, hypnosis, acts of terrorism,disinformation—share an ontological purpose: to manipulate perceptions, tore-create reality. As we noted above, the German word for psychological warfaretranslates as “worldview warfare”: a battle of perceptions, of consensusrealities. Once that Pandora’s box was opened, there was no closing it again.The temptation was too great. For those who wanted to play God, in the words ofthe JUSPAO report above, there was the next best thing: one could play with theelements of creation in such a way that magical transformations would takeplace. As the men of the OSS, CIA, and military intelligence developed from thearmchair scholars and academics that most of them were before the war years intosoldiers fighting the Cold War on fronts all over the world, they became—in avery real sense—magicians. As we will see, the CIA mind control projectsthemselves represented an assault on consciousness and reality that has not beenseen in history since the age of the philosopher-kings and their courtalchemists.Rumors of what was taking place at Randolph AFB in those days have filtered outinto the community of conspiracy theorists in such a way as to devalue theresearch completely in many cases. There are, however, some scraps of evidenceand testimony that are hard to ignore. One of these involves a man whose namehas become synonymous with alien abductions and UFO phenomena, and this contextmakes the information suspect to skeptical researchers. However, the informationthat is verifiable has led the author to believe that something more thanhigh-pressure studies and oxygen deprivation tests was going on at Randolph AFBin the bosom of the Nazi scientists.Recourse to an official history of the Space Medicine program, written by MaeMills Link, who was senior US Air Force Medical Historian, and published in 1965as NASA Special Publication-4003 in the NASA History Series, shows us some ofthe later employment in official positions of the Nazi scientists.Among those on the roster is Dr. Heinz Haber, whom we have met earlier in someconfusion with Hans Habe, and who later became chief science consultant for WaltDisney Productions! Dr. Fritz Haber later became involved with AvcoManufacturing, but at Randolph he had designed the sealed cabin for thehigh-pressure studies. Dr. Siegfried Gerathewohl, “who had been chief of thePsychological Testing Center of the German Air Force during World War II,” laterjoined NASA.52 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos699367] Gerathewohl was not an officialmember of the Randolph team, having been assigned to the rocket scientists underDornberger and von Braun instead, but he was often seconded to the Randolph basefor specific work. (The NASA publication also refers to the two-volume GermanAviation Medicine, edited by Strughold and “prepared by 56 leading Germanaviation specialists” on “such topics as the physiological fundamentals of highaltitude and acceleration and the potential problems of man under gravity-freeconditions.” The word “Nazi” is never mentioned in the text, nor is referencemade to the fact that several of the articles were written by accused warcriminals and contained data obtained from the use of live subjects at Dachauand other concentration camps.)That the psychological aspect of space medicine was not being ignored isevidenced by Gerathewohl’s position with the Air Force. He has been the authorof many articles on various aspects of space psychology from a mechanistic—onealmost wants to say “Hegelian”—point of view. With Strughold, he was the authorof “Motoric responses of the eyes when exposed to light flashes of highintensity and short duration” in Aviation Medicine (1953). This study has sincebeen referenced in works on the use of lasers, but has applications inbehavioral psychology as well. His “Orientation and Navigation in Space-Time”was published in 1967, and he is the author of the text Psychologie im Flugzeug(Aviation Psychology). So although his purpose at the US Air Force and, later,at NASA seems to have been devoted to physiological responses to the uniquestressors of space flight, he never lost his interest in the more psychologicalaspects of his field. This wedding of the purely psychological with the purelyphysiological became the cornerstone of subsequent intelligence agency programsdesigned to uncover the secrets of the mind: the interface between the lump ofgrey matter we call the brain, and the great beyond we call reality.Another Luftwaffe alumnus—this time one who wound up conducting torture andinterrogation programs after the War—was Paul Schaefer, whose frighteningColonia Dignidad operation in Pinochet’s Chile was covered extensively by thisauthor in Unholy Alliance. At Colonia Dignidad, these techniques were combinedwith sophisticated technology to conduct the torture of political prisoners byremote control, all to the strains of Wagner and Mozart.THE CHURCH OF… THELMA?Naturally, the Nazis were not the only ones with a rocket program during WorldWar II. The United States was involved in various research projects involvingrocketry, including a search for the perfect solid-fuel propellant. At thistime, much of the work was being done in California, at the GuggenheimAeronautical Laboratory, California Institute of Technology (GALCIT) under thefamous team of Theodore von Karman and Frank J. Malina at Pasadena. One of theirmore illustrious—if eventually notorious— team members was Jack Parsons, a tall,darkly handsome and frighteningly intelligent man who would eventually lose hissecurity clearance after the War due to his relationship with occultists andmagicians. It was Parsons, a devotee of English magician Aleister Crowley, whowould later declare himself the Antichrist… after a stormy relationship with thefounder of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard. Parsons was accused of giving secrettechnology to the Israelis, among other felonies, and at one time worked for theHoward Hughes empire. He died quite prematurely from an explosion at his home,either an accident, or suicide, or murder; none of the sources seem to agree.For all that, a crater on the dark side of the Moon was named after him inrecognition of his accomplishments for the space program and his contribution increating what would eventually become the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech.The reader should be assured at this point that all of the above statements areabsolutely true and verifiable from hundreds of impeccable sources, such as FBIfiles (recently declassified and obtained under the Freedom of Information Act)and from Parsons’s own words, as incredible as this story seems.A search through NASA, Caltech and JPL websites will turn up photographs ofParsons and the rest of the team. Parsons was an apprentice—a researchassociate—of von Karman’s at Caltech when they fired their first test rocket inthe Arroyo Seco, in back of Devil’s Gate dam, in Pasadena on October 31, 1936…Halloween and, coincidentally, the same day as the last Houdini séance (Houdinitold his wife that if there was life after death he would try to contact herfrom the grave at a series of séances; October 31, 1936 was the last—equallyunsuccessful—séance). Snapshots of the Arroyo Seco site show a very primitivelaunch platform in the midst of dry scrub land, and the rocket team casuallyspread out on the ground before it like the nerd contingent of a fraternitybeach party. Those who think that perhaps the first rocket launch on Halloweenwas simply a coincidence should refer to the official JPL website where theystate that the American space age began on “January 31, 1958 with the launch ofthe first US satellite, Explorer I, built and controlled by JPL.” January 31, ofcourse, is the pagan holiday known to Christianity as Candlemas and to pagans asOimelc. Thus, for better or for worse, meaningful or not, the launch that tookplace on Halloween, 1936 culminated in the launch on Candlemas, 1958, and wasthe result of the work of the same organization, for von Karman’s GALCIT teameventually became the founding members of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Oddlyenough, the man in charge of the Explorer launch was Dr. Wernher von Braun, theNazi scientist formerly of Peenemuende and Nordhausen. Perhaps he had a paganagenda?Halloween (known among European pagans as Samhain, pronounced “sa-wen”) istraditionally the day when the dead return to visit the living, similar to theAsian “Wandering Souls” festival mentioned above. It is the day when the gatebetween the living and the dead is open, a favorite day for evocations ofspirits and demons. Candlemas, on the other hand, is the day of “quickening,”when the earth begins to wake from its slumber, a day of promise for the future,of the celebration of fertility, of anticipation for the bounty of the comingyear. One could say, therefore, that the first rocket launch on Halloween was anevocation of the daimon of flight, or perhaps in a darker context a breaching ofthe barrier between this world and the next, an initiatic rending of the veil ofthe Temple: space being seen as the domain of both the dead and the higherspiritual forces. The actual birth of the American space program on Candlemasis, of course, also an auspicious event, ripe with mythical connotations. It isnot the intention of this author to suggest that the selection of these dateswas deliberate on the part of von Karman, Parsons, von Braun or the other spaceengineers. Indeed, by the time of the Explorer I launch in 1958 Parsons himselfhad already been dead six years. It is the intention, however, to point outthese synchronicities as they occur, because they are evidence of deeper, moresinister, forces at work, as we shall see.Jack Parsons was born Marvel Whiteside Parsons on October 2, 1914 in LosAngeles, California. His father was a captain in the US Army. His name was alsoMarvel Parsons. That’s right: his father was Captain Marvel. His son laterchanged his name to John, after his father left his mother subsequent to someunpleasantness over an adultery.He once visited Europe with his mother in 1929, when he would have been aboutfifteen, but that was the extent of foreign travel for Jack Parsons. Hegraduated from University High School in Pasadena in 1933, but did not go on tocollege after that. He took some extension courses at UC and University ofSouthern California, but never obtained a degree.He became involved with explosives and rocket technology at a very early age,even before his high school graduation, working for the Hercules Powder Companyin Los Angeles in 1932, before moving on to the Halifax Explosives Company in1934 and finally winding up at GALCIT in 1936, at which time he was barelytwenty-two.The Halloween launch occurred that year.Parsons inherited a large house in Pasadena after the death of his father, towhich he invited a string of houseguests from the occult and science-fictioncommunities. His interest in occultism ran roughly parallel to his interest inrocket science, and von Karman wrote that Jack used to chant pagan hymns andstamp his feet on the ground in the Arroyo Seco, but that otherwise he wasbrilliant and a very hard-worker, very conscientious, and totally focused onrocketry. Parsons and his childhood friend and fellow rocketeer Edward Formanhad been in regular communication with German and Russian rocket engineers,including the famous Willy Ley, as well as—according to some reports—IgorSikorsky (inventor of the Sikorsky helicopter) and Arthur Young(who developed the Bell helicopter). At the age of 13, Parsons claimed he hadtried to invoke Satan, but the experience frightened him, and he turned awayfrom occultism for a while and devoted himself to pursuits of an even more…explosive nature. 53 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos699663]In 1939, we find Parsons married to Helen Northrup and joining a cult based inLos Angeles, the OTO or Ordo Templi Orientis. The OTO was one of several occultsocieties under the leadership of Aleister Crowley, the English magician whoreceived a revelation in Cairo in 1904 which became the basis for a newreligion, which Crowley called Thelema, the Greek word for “Will.” The OTO was aGerman secret society that was designed to communicate Tantric and other Easternsexual practices beneath the clean, white apron of Freemasonry. Crowley usurpedleadership of the Order after the death of its previous Master, generating athree-way fight which left one version of the Order adhering to its originalrites and purposes, another version—the Brotherhood of Saturn—peeling off topursue a different dream, and Crowley’s OTO becoming in the process the mostfamous of the three.The sexual element of the OTO was enhanced by Crowley’s naturally more rapaciousappetites, and the rituals rewritten to include numerous references to Crowley’sown belief system, Thelema, and more overtly sexual gestures. By 1939, the“Agape” Lodge was under stewardship of one W.T. Smith, an early Crowley devotee.This was the lodge that Parsons visited, and soon he found himself embroiled inall of the petty rivalries, sexual seductions, and thirst after arcane lore andunspeakable powers that characterizes such groups.The following year, in 1940, the US Army Air Corps paid a visit to von Karmanand company and decided that they wanted to support and sponsor the rocketresearch going on there because of its military applications. The first visitwas by none other than General “Pap” Arnold, the famed (and outspoken) aviator.His interest was in developing jet-assisted take-off and landing (JATO)capability for his aircraft, enabling them to take off and land on the veryshort runways he was anticipating in the upcoming Asian conflict. Von Karman,Forman, Parsons, and several others got to work on the program immediately. Itis informative to note that most of the patents that would be generated by thisresearch would be in Parsons’ name. Several of the others would go on to gloryas well, but not before a bit of sturm und drang in California. The GALCITproject was now renamed as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or JPL. Jack Parsonswas a founding member.When General Arnold returned to Washington, a background check was initiated onParsons by Army Intelligence. The person requesting the FBI to scour itsrecords, if any, on Parsons was none other than Brigadier General Sherman Miles,head of G-2 in Washington.54 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos701287] General Miles wasa famous name in Washington circles, coming from a long line of militaryofficers, one of whom fought in the Indian wars. Miles himself had played a rolein drawing up boundaries in post-World War One Europe, a role for which he isstill remembered. What he is best known for, however, was his reluctance tocover for his Commanding Officer, General George Marshall, at the time of thePearl Harbor attack on December 7, 1941, when for a while the General could notbe found, as the teletypes were burning up miles of copper wire between Hawaiiand D.C. (General Miles was later relieved of his command.)The FBI reported back that they had found nothing damaging about Parsons, and hewas awarded a security clearance. It is interesting to note that at this sametime, Naval Intelligence (ONI) also requested information on Parsons. This time,the intelligence officer was one Capt. W. B. Phillips, who may have been thesame W.B. Phillips who later commanded an amphibious transport vehicle in thePacific War. As before, nothing damaging was found.Back in California, however, Parsons had so impressed the membership of theAgape Lodge that one member—Jane Wolfe—would write to Crowley, telling him thatin her opinion Parsons would eventually become head of the Order. In March 1941,W.T. Smith sent a letter to Crowley praising Parsons. By this time, of course,England was at war with Germany.On June 13, 1941, an Army officer is initiated into the OTO at the Agape Lodgetemple. His name is Grady McMurtry, and he will be stationed for a time inEngland where he meets Aleister Crowley and develops an odd sort of relationshipwith the Prophet of Thelema. At this same time, Crowley has been involved insome potential intelligence work with such figures as Dennis Wheatley and IanFleming, both officers with British intelligence and friends of Crowley. Theywould later become famous novelists, of course, but at the time they wereseeking Crowley’s assistance to exploit his knowledge of the European occultunderground in the war effort. (This is all covered in detail in my UnholyAlliance.) McMurtry will return to the United States safely after the war, andengineer a coup to take over leadership of the OTO after the deaths of Crowleyand Crowley’s designated successor. More about McMurtry in later chapters, buthis movements between the Agape Lodge—which is, after all, infamous among therocket scientists who are working on highly classified work—and London, whereCrowley, their leader, is staying are suggestive of a larger purpose.In 1942, Parsons single-handedly solves the JATO problem. The difficulty thatfaced the engineers was that the solid fuel formulas that had worked thus fardegraded quickly during storage. Parsons is able to work out a more stableformula based on a mixture of asphalt and potassium perchlorate, having beeninspired by something the ancients called “Greek fire,” appropriately enough foran occultist. By this time, Parsons and the other rocket team members form theirown company, the Aerojet Corporation, to develop these materials and sell themto the Army. (Aerojet would later be taken over by General Tire and Rubber, nowknown as GenCorp; one of the founding rocketeers, Frank Malina, would take hisshares and open an art gallery in Paris… and future UFO researcher and nuclearphysicist Stanton Friedman would find work there in the 1960s.55[../Text/ch04.html#filepos701938])And, by 1944, Parsons would become head of the Agape Lodge of the OTO byCrowley’s decree, after the ouster of W.T. Smith, whose leadership had turnedthe Order into a “love cult.” During this same year, an FBI informant hadrelayed information on the OTO and Parsons which was of an interesting nature.This notation—filed with the number 100-189320-2 and dated 3-31-44—was fromOklahoma City, and bore the heading“Re: CHURCH OF THELMA, also known as> ORIENA TEMPLUS ORIENTUS, OTO (phonetic)> SECURITY MATTER—G”Thus did the “Church of Thelma” enter FBI files.The informant stated that he had been invited to a party sometime in June orJuly of 1940 in Pasadena. What he thought was going to be a party, however,turned into a meeting of the Order. No matter; the informant was initiated intothe Order during the weekend, but “does not recall anything of the initiationproceedings except that all of the participants had all their clothes removedand they wore robes for the occasion. Prior to the proceedings [name deleted]given a glass of liquor which apparently was drugged thus causing him not toremember much of the proceedings.” 56 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos702414]This was,as the rest of the memo makes clear, during the reign of W. T. Smith, when freelove was the norm (it was, after all, how the Order attracted recruits), and itis not known what drug—if any—was in use at that time that would have caused thetype of amnesia to which the informant claims he was victim. Parsons was, ofcourse, a chemist and later would work in the pharmacology department of auniversity, even though his main interest in chemistry was of the explosivevariety; yet, there is evidence through his writings that he was also takingdrugs, for a poem he published in the Order newsletter—Oriflamme—ratherexplicitly states, “I live on peyote, marijuana, morphine, and cocaine.”57[../Text/ch04.html#filepos702703] While one can assume a certain level ofhyperbole in those claims, it is not inconceivable that these drugs were used insome combination among the swinging, free-love initiates of the Agape Lodge.Love, though, is rarely free; eventually, the bill arrives in the mail. Parsons’wife, Helen Northrup (who became pregnant by Smith), departed with the priapicW.T. Smith in 1944, leaving Jack alone with her eighteen-year-old sister. SarahElizabeth Northrup, known as “Betty,” was by all accounts a very attractivestudent at USC. Although they have an ongoing affair, by the summer of 1945 sheand Jack meet a Naval officer, and their lives are never the same again. Theofficer, a struggling science fiction author with several published stories,becomes known to the world, not for literature but as the founder ofScientology: L. Ron Hubbard.PULP FICTIONAs many celebrities and movie stars (John Travolta, Tom Cruise, and Kirstie Allyfor example) have joined the ranks of Scientology, and as Scientology reappearsin our story in various other manifestations—Charles Manson, the Process Churchof the Final Judgment, etc.—it would do well to examine the bizarre relationshipof Parsons and Hubbard a little further, as it was evidently a pivotal episodein both their lives and led directly to the creation of Scientology, and perhapsindirectly to the death of Parsons.One could reasonably claim that L. Ron Hubbard was the Joseph Smith of hisgeneration. Like Smith, he began his spiritual quest in the murky realms ofceremonial magic, in fact, using some of the very same source material as Smithhimself: the Keys of Solomon, the Books of Moses, all the basic reading materialof the OTO, which itself was based on the European systems of ritual magicincluding planetary invocations, spirit evocations, demonology, the Qabala andSmith’s own particular enthusiasm, Freemasonry. Like Smith, he founded whatamounted to a religion based on his personal revelations, one that has attractedmillions of members worldwide and which has a “sacred scripture” at its core, inHubbard’s case, Dianetics. Like Smith, his cult was attacked on all sides byconventional religious organizations, as well as by the governments of variouscountries. Like Smith, he had military pretensions and demanded a great deal ofobedience from his followers, on pain of excommunication. And, like Smith, hehad a fondness for the ladies.One could say that Southern California in the twentieth century was the WestCoast’s answer to nineteenth century New York’s “Burned Out District.” Religiousrevivals and spiritual societies grew like mushrooms in the hot and sandy soilin and around Los Angeles in the post-war years. Religious leaders of every kindof denomination and persuasion were able to attract members, includingcelebrities and wealthy patrons. While Parsons was a serious, even fanatic,spiritual seeker, Hubbard was the Edward Kelley to his John Dee. Hubbard’svarious biographies contradict each other in important areas; it has takenresearchers years to piece together Hubbard’s real resume. His Naval recordduring the war years does not cover him with glory. He was a confidence man whoclaimed great achievements in his past, achievements which the record shows didnot exist, and he did so unnecessarily since his genuine achievements werenotable enough.When the dust was cleared in Pasadena, however, Hubbard had managed to stealParsons’ girlfriend and his money, and Parsons had to go to court to win back atleast the money if not the love. Sic transit amor mundi.Parsons and Hubbard began working occult rituals together in the lodgeheadquarters at Parsons’s home, including the infamous “Babalon Working” ofJanuary 1946, in which the Scarlet Woman was invoked. The Scarlet Woman—areference to the consort of the Great Beast of the Apocalypse—is a sacred figurein the Thelemic religion, an embodiment of the female principle of nature, buton steroids. Parsons wrote to Crowley in England, praising Hubbard’s magicalabilities, saying that Hubbard was “the most Thelemic person” he had ever met58[../Text/ch04.html#filepos703387]0 Crowley, though, was dubious and fearful thatyoung Parsons was getting in over his head. Parsons, seeing Betty transferringher affections to Hubbard, invokes a woman for himself to replace her, whoappears miraculously in the person of Marjorie Cameron, an artist (who willlater appear in a film by Crowley enthusiast Kenneth Anger, as would Mansonprotégé Bobby Beausoleil). A ritual he performed with Hubbard in the MojaveDesert to attract an “elemental”—in this case, a female sexual partner, sinceHubbard was scarfing up all the available lovers—had culminated in Parsons, inan intuitive flash, suddenly claiming victory (“It is done!”) and rushing hometo find that a vivacious, red-headed Marjorie Cameron (whom he had never met)was waiting for him at his home.At the same time, Parsons had already sold his stock in Aerojet and had someready cash available. After the completion of various rituals, some involvingsex, Parsons, Hubbard and Betty Northrup agreed to form a company: AlliedEnterprises. Hubbard was always fond of boats, and suggested that they purchaseboats on the East Coast and sell them on the West. With that in mind, Hubbardand Betty went to Florida with ten thousand dollars of Parsons’s money.Hubbard later phones from Miami and tells Parsons that they have bought a boat,a yacht. All well and good.And then Parsons hears nothing from Hubbard or Betty Northrup for some time.Worried—and perhaps in his heart still a little jealous of the relationshipbetween Betty and Hubbard—Parsons goes to Miami to find out what has happened tohis money. He discovers that Hubbard has purchased not one, but three vesselsand is nowhere to be found. Parsons stakes out the marina, and when one of theHubbard vessels begins to leave the harbor an amazing thing occurs.According to Parsons, he raised a storm using magic to force the boat back toshore. Whether we can believe him or not, the fact is that a storm rose and theboat was forced back, at which point Parsons takes possession of the boats viacourt order, recouping most of the money, and returning to Pasadena in July1946.Hubbard and Betty Northrup, meanwhile, stay in Florida and get married.But Hubbard is still married to his first wife at the time. It is all very“plural marriage,” very… Mormonesque. Very… illegal. And yet, within threeyears, Hubbard’s new science/religion called “Dianetics” will be born, and therest, as they say, is history.Later, Hubbard will describe his sojourn among the Thelemites as part of anundercover intelligence operation for—variously—the FBI or the Office of NavalIntelligence (ONI), to break up a dangerous satanic cult that counted importantscientists among its members, people with classified secrets who were in danger(we assume) of being compromised by the weird rites and illicit sex taking placeon the premises. How breaking up the “cult” would have benefited nationalsecurity is not clarified. Obviously, no scientists were arrested. Presumably,we are meant to believe that once the scientists in question had seen the errorof their ways—courtesy of Hubbard and the FBI—then they abandoned theirlicentious and blasphemous practices and devoted themselves to the forty-hourwork week and church on Sunday. To be fair, we know that both the FBI and theONI had been aware of Parsons and at least the FBI was watching the cult, butlong before Hubbard was on the scene. Hubbard was no stranger to the secretpolice, though, having once tried to turn in a troublesome steward as a Germanspy in New York City in 1940; he was also an intelligence officer for a briefperiod during the war.A look at Hubbard’s official Navy record—released in 1986—tells the followingstory:He began his career as a Lieutenant, Junior Grade, in the US Naval Reserve onJuly 19, 1941. He went on active duty September 22, 1941 for a few weeks, untilOctober 6, 1941, then went back on active duty on November 24, 1941 for theduration of the war, becoming a Lieutenant in the process, until February 16,1946… after the time he first began seeing Parsons, which, according to theevidence to hand, must have been around October of 1945, with Parsons writing“the most Thelemic person” letter in January of 1946.From December 18, 1941—that is, just after the attack on Pearl Harbor and theentry of the United States into the war—Hubbard is found at the Office of theNaval Attache, American Legation, in Melbourne, Australia. His duties at thistime are described as “Intelligence Officer,” a designation he retains throughJune 24, 1942 in the official account, although further clarification from theNavy shows that he only held that post until May 4, 1942. He returned to theUnited States in April 1942 and served in the Office of Cable Censor, in NewYork, from May 1, 1942 to June 24, 1942. Thus, he spent about three months “inthe rear with the gear” in Australia during the war with Japan, for which hereceived the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign medal, as did everyone else who served inthat theater. The other stories that the Scientology organization (and Hubbardhimself) have spread about Hubbard’s heroic war record are thus without basis infact.During the rest of the war, he was posted around the United States on variousjobs, from Portland, Oregon to the Presidio, and finally wound up at the NavalHospital in Oakland, California as a patient from September 5, 1945 to December4, 1945. (Thus, at the time he was visiting Parsons in Pasadena for the firsttime, he was at least technically a mental patient.) He was honorably releasedfrom active duty on February 16, 1946, and resigned from inactive duty onOctober 30, 1950. One of the stories that is current about Hubbard’s war yearsis that he fired on an uninhabited island off the coast of Mexico, much to theofficial chagrin of the Mexican government. There is no mention of this in theofficial US Navy documentation available to the author,59[../Text/ch04.html#filepos703744] but it has been referenced so many times in somany places that it has passed into Hubbard legend. No matter what, somethinghappened to Hubbard.It is the term he spent as a “patient” that is interesting; the war in thePacific was over in August, and a month later Hubbard is laid up in hospitalwhere he stays for three months. He was not wounded; he never saw any action.There are no Purple Hearts in his Naval records. (The word is, he was sufferingfrom an ulcer.) And, when he gets out, his Naval career is all but over, but themental disorders are not. As late as 1947 he is writing the VeteransAdministration and complaining about suicidal tendencies and his inability tocope with civilian life over the previous two years, i.e., during the time hewas involved with Parsons, the OTO and Parsons’ girlfriend, whom he had marriedin 1946! 60 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos704491]Meanwhile, Parsons is still active in the lodge and is heavily involved in thedarker aspects of magic, including a fascination with voodoo, goetia (theraising of evil spirits in the Crowleyan sense), and heavy ritual. This was nosecret to his fellow rocketeers, and it is mentioned (albeit briefly) in ClaytonR. Koppes’ JPL and the American Space Program, as well as in Iris Chang’s workon Parson’s Chinese colleague, Tsien Hsue Shen.61[../Text/ch04.html#filepos705359] He is not keeping up with the day-to-daybusiness of the Order, however, and the backstabbing and sniping begins. Hemarries Marjorie Cameron on October 19, 1946 in San Juan Capistrano, (with hisold friend Edward Forman and his wife as witnesses), and she returns for a whileto New York City, where her mother is living, leaving Parsons very much alone.By all accounts he was a brilliant chemist and rocketeer who made importantcontributions to the American war effort and to what would become the Americanspace program—a man who attracted the jealousy of the legendary rocket pioneerRobert Goddard when the latter discovered that von Karman’s tykes at GALCIT weregetting important Army funding62 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos705876]—and afounding member of JPL, the black sheep that JPL does not wish to acknowledgeany more than is necessary. (Repeated attempts to extract anything from JPL bythe author on the subject of Parsons have resulted in… nothing. Not even anacknowledgement of the letters I have sent. And yet, there is the crater on theMoon…)With all of that, Parsons was a magician, a kind of sorcerer whose attractionwas to the darker, fringe elements of the occult and to whom nothing was reallyoff-limits. Crowley called him “a weak-minded fool,”63[../Text/ch04.html#filepos706171] and it certainly seems as if Parsons wasvictimized by most of the people in his life. He expected people to behave withhonor, reasonably, to the extent that he, himself, treated them nobly. From whatevidence we can find, Parsons was treated well and honorably only by those whorespected and admired his intelligence, his seriousness, and his brilliance: hisfellow rocketeers. Yet, when involved in the one aspect of American lifevirtually guaranteed to disappoint the idealist—the occult underground, with itspetty jealousies, inflamed egos and unstable emotions—he was ripped apart.And still, he persevered.He did not give up on the people who treated him shabbily, and even remained ongood terms with W.T. Smith, the head of the Agape Lodge in 1939 and the man whofathered a child on Parsons’ first wife, Helen, and contributed to theirdivorce. Parsons saw himself as above jealousy and possessiveness, even whenthose around him were wallowing in it. In his own words, “We can be insulatedagainst everything but death—in fact, death is the very substance of ourinsulation. But to be used by life we must be naked and to be naked is to behurt. But it is also to be alive.”64 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos706528] He wasalso consumed by a desire to set the Creation straight, to cut through illusionand hypocrisy and to somehow revitalize the age. “For over two thousand yearsnow every one who has tackled this job has made a fool of themselves—it is timesome one was making more sense.” 65 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos706863]The world, though, was not ready for Jack Parsons. In 1947, according to FBIrecords and to von Karman’s own memoirs, Jack began to seek work in Israel. Thetiming is suggestive, for it anticipates the creation of the Israeli state,which did not occur until 1948. In other words, Jack Parsons is hobnobbing withAmerican lobbyists for Israel, and perhaps with elements of the Jewishunderground. Israel: a country-to-be which is in desperate need of engineers,scientists and, perhaps most of all, a defense industry to call its own. Parsonsprobably found the whole idea very attractive, very appealing to his idealisticnature: to be in on the ground floor of the creation of a new country,especially one in the middle of the Holy Land, the land where the KnightsTemplar were born in the shadow of the Dome of the Rock, where Jesus walked andpreached, where the Assassins cut down their enemies with stealth, where KingSolomon summoned demons to help build his Temple. Parsons must have felt thatworking to develop the Israeli rocket and munitions industry was a positionworthy of an enlightened man, an initiate of the arcane mysteries of the Order.The OTO in Israel? The very idea had… resonance.Yet it is due to his membership in the OTO that he lost his security clearance,on September 21, 1948.According to FBI file 65-1753, originating with the Los Angeles Field Office butmade at Cincinnati, Ohio on November 22, 1950, Parsons was being investigated bythe Army’s CIC (Counter Intelligence Corps) in May 1948. A Major Sam Bruno,Chief of Security at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, reported the CICinvestigation to the FBI. His report stated that “a religious cult, believed toadvocate sexual perversion, was organized at subject’s home at 1003 South OrangeGrove Avenue, Pasadena, California,which had been reported subversive…. The report further reflects that subjectreportedly associated with one [name deleted] an alleged Communist Partymember.”While his security clearance would later be reinstated (on March 7, 1949), itmeant that Parsons’ career was effectively derailed.A word to the nervous: Wright-Patterson AFB in 1948 is a very suggestive placeto have been involved in an investigation of Jack Parsons, to be sure. UFOenthusiasts know Wright-Patterson as the scene where the elements of the crashedRoswell “flying saucer” were taken in 1947. It is also, of course, where NaziGeneral Walter Dornberger and his merry men were first taken as part ofOperation Paperclip, curiously at the very same time as the Roswell crash inJuly 1947, leading many to suggest that the UFOs were really Nazi experimentalaircraft. The author believes that the security personnel at the air base wouldhave been involved in the Parsons investigation due to the occultist’s deepinvolvement in the rocket program, and not due to anything more sinister;however, interested readers are advised to keep an open mind, because the peoplewho eventually become involved in the Parsons investigation turn up in some odd(and worrisome) places.In the interim, Parsons had to find work wherever he could get it. Without asecurity clearance, he could not work in the defense industry and could onlyfind jobs with companies who supplied the special effects departments atHollywood film studios. At the same time, he was undergoing a tremendouspsychological crisis. In December 1948, he took “the Oath of the Abyss” in aritual conducted before W.T. Smith. This is tantamount to willingly sufferingthe “long, dark night of the soul” that is common in artistic and psychologicalliterature. While most occult initiations can be “given,” i.e., passed onthrough ritual and the laying on of hands or some other appropriate ceremony,the initiatory levels of the “Abyss” and beyond cannot be imposed by humanintervention, according to the tradition of the western mystery schools. In thiscase, all of creation is seen as the Qabalists’ “Tree of Life,” a diagramcontaining ten spheres connected by twenty-two paths. The top three spheres andthe bottom seven spheres are “separated” in this instance by the Abyss, a placewhere one’s ego is destroyed… or not. If not, then one becomes a “blackbrother,” or “magician of the left-hand path,” that is, an evil magician andsource of pestilence. If one has successfully passed the Abyss, however, thenone attains greater spiritual glory.In the Crowley system, one may take the Oath of the Abyss at any time, whichwill then propel one head-first into the dark night of the soul, a bit likethrowing children into a swimming pool: they either learn how to swim fairlyquickly, or they drown. It can be considered a desperate act, fraught withpsychological implications; no less than the destruction of one’s personality,even of one’s sanity… and to make matters worse, Parsons chose as his initiatedname and identity: the Antichrist.Parsons had come to believe that Christianity was the enemy of civilization, ofhumanity, and that it had to be destroyed. Parsons felt that, as the Antichrist,he could summon forth Babalon (the Scarlet Woman of the Apocalypse and consortof the Great Beast 666) and instigate the coming upheaval of westerncivilization. Parsons was not anti-Christian per se, as his writingsdemonstrate; he believed that the real Christ, however, had been hidden andburied beneath mainstream Christianity and that codified Christianity was false,whereas the Gnostic version was true. Parsons realized that Christianity’s powerlay in its simplicity of message and symbol, and that the failure of hermeticcults such as the Gnostics derived from their complexity and intellectualdemands. He dreamed for a way to promote a more magickal, more Thelemicspiritual revolution and sought a simple message and symbol… but stumbled on theCatch-22 of Scarlet Woman, Great Beast, and Antichrist, symbols that had beencreated (or, at least, co-opted) by the Church and which contain a built-infailure mechanism: whoever attests to being anti-Christian becomes part of theChristian duality, part of the problem. In a sense, that person revitalizes thatwhich he opposes. Satanists, for example, are part of the Christian continuumfor it was the Church that created Satan. Buddhists are not Satanists; nor areHindus, Daoists, or members of other non-Christian religions. But Parsons wasworking within what was essentially a Christian—or Judeo-Christian—tradition andcould not extricate himself from its symbols, try as he might.In the same time frame that he lost his security clearance, his pass to thesecret realms of government on earth, he sought a pass to the celestial realmsinstead. The man who had such an influence on the techniques of sending rocketsthrough space now wanted to send himself, if not bodily then “astrally,” i.e.,in a shape made of starstuff, to the realm of the stars.In 1949, he wrote the Manifesto of the Antichrist in which he emphasized hisspiritual accomplishment and his goals. The wording is suggestive of what hadbeen going on in his life, and may contain clues not found in the FBI files: “Anend to all authority that is not based on courage and manhood, to the authorityof lying priests, conniving judges, blackmailing police…”66[../Text/ch04.html#filepos707199]Blackmailing police? Where did that come from? Was Parsons being blackmailed? Itis indeed possible; after all, his home was the headquarters of a cult believedto be involved in “sexual perversion” and “subversion.” It is possible that thedrugs, sex and rituals would have aroused the curiosity of the police department(particularly as there were other, federal, investigations taking place), andthat Parsons found himself in a vulnerable position and had to buy his way outof it from time to time. There is evidence that Parsons gave testimony againstcriminals as a consultant to LAPD, and that one of his fellow consultants—anexplosive expert by the name of Santmyer—gave conflicting stories at the time ofParsons’ death, in what seems to be a patent exercise in disinformation.But we are getting ahead of our story.Once Parsons’s security clearance was reinstated, he started working for theHughes Aircraft Company. It would be in September 1950 that he was found inpossession of “classified documents,” documents that Parsons admitted werehelping him draw up a proposal for a laboratory in Israel. This was consideredoutright espionage, and he lost his security clearance again and never got itback.The man in the middle of this investigation—being brought into it by J. EdgarHoover, the Director of the FBI—was an Assistant Attorney General, James M.McInerney67 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos707657]. In correspondence between the twomen in the spring of 1951, a determination was being sought on whether thedocuments in Parsons’ possession were, indeed, classified and whether their saleor transfer to Israel would be a breach of “national security.” Most of thedocuments were authored by Parsons himself, dating to his GALCIT days, and allwere written during the war years. However, the military decided that one of theitems was Restricted and two others Confidential, thus establishing abasis—however flimsy—for considering Parsons a potential spy for Israel.This correspondence—and the associated investigation by the FBI and the armedservices—took place over a year. On February 7, 1952 Hoover sent James McInerneya memo regarding Parsons, informing him that Parsons’ appeal to the IndustrialEmployment Review Board of the Department of Defense was turned down. Accordingto an attached letter from the Board, Parsons “might voluntarily orinvoluntarily act against the security interests of the United States andconstitute a danger to the national security.” 68[../Text/ch04.html#filepos708357]Five months later he was dead.James McInerney is an interesting person to associate with Parsons. We discover,for instance, in Robert Maheu’s autobiography Next to Hughes, that it was JamesMcInerney who provided the initial funding for Maheu’s security firm, Robert A.Maheu Associates. According to Maheu, “Almost immediately, I began working forthe CIA.” 69 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos708817]This was in 1954, and McInerneywas still Assistant AG. He and Maheu, and some other ex-FBI agents, weregambling illegally, and Maheu won handily the princely sum (in 1954) of $2,800,all from McInerney. When Maheu attempted to refuse the winnings, McInerney wouldhave none of it. It was to this fund that Maheu attributes the initial financialinvestment for his agency.Maheu, of course, would go on to greater glory, including his infamousrelationship with Howard Hughes (Parsons’ former employer) and his involvementwith the CIA/Mafia plots against Castro. McInerney himself would go on torepresent the Kennedys at one point, according to Victor Lasky, 70[../Text/ch04.html#filepos709300]even though Maheu was told to sever hisrelationship with the Kennedy family or else he could not become involved withthe CIA.The murky facts surrounding the death of Jack Parsons make it inevitable thatsome researchers would look for murder. According to the forensics teaminvestigating the blast scene at Parsons’ home in Pasadena, there had been twoexplosions, the first from under the floorboards where Parsons was standing,setting off the second explosion from among his chemicals, thus implying a bomb.Other evidence found at the site, including filter papers soaked in explosivechemicals in the trash outside the house, seemed to support this theory ofcriminal intentions. However, the official version of the story was that Parsonsdied as a result of an accident: he had dropped a container of a powerful andvolatile explosive, fulminate of mercury, while moving some of his personalbelongings in preparation for a trip he was taking with Marjorie Cameron toMexico. On the one hand, we have testimony of those who worked with Parsonsrefusing to believe he could be that careless when he was the epitome of theprofessional chemist. On the other hand, we have testimony that he stored a lotof chemicals, including explosives, at his home and that the accident waswaiting to happen.The Mexico trip is also controversial. According to some sources, Parsons wasthinking of setting up an explosives factory in Mexico to produce specialeffects products; his wife at one time was considering settling down inGuadalajara or San Miguel de Allende to continue her work as an artist. Parsonswas also believed to be on his way to Israel after that, to continue pursuingthe lure of working for Israeli defense. He spent the early part of 1950 runningaround the country, looking for work. His itinerary included Redstone Arsenal,where by then the Nazi doctors had established themselves, Washington, D.C.,Cumberland coal country, and the City of New York, where he stayed at theRoosevelt Hotel and wrote Marjorie long letters filled with magical advice. Hewas finally hired by Hughes at Culver City, California, and this is where he wasworking when he once again lost his security clearance and was forced to findwork at various factories around Southern California, finally giving in duringJune 1952, when it was obvious his security clearance would not be reinstated.Was Jack Parsons murdered? Was it by agents of his own government, in an effortto keep this admittedly brilliant rocket scientist away from other countries?Was it in revenge for the guilty verdict of a crooked cop his expert testimonyhad helped put away, as has been suggested by some (including his wife,Marjorie)? A cop who had earlier used a car bomb to kill his victim?Or did it have something to do with a Chinese rocket scientist, a man whoserelation to Chinese rocketry is much the same as Parsons was to American rocketscience? For one of Parsons’ earliest partners at GALCIT was Dr. Tsien HsueShen, a scientist who specialized in long-range missile development; in fact,his first prototype was built under Parsons’ watchful eye at Aerojet. During theMcCarthy Era, however, Dr. Tsien was accused of being a Communist. Although hedenied any such affiliation, his security clearance was also removed; heprotested this straight up to the Undersecretary of the Navy, saying he would goback to China if he wasn’t reinstated. Instead, the Undersecretary made a callto Immigration and had Dr. Tsien arrested! 71 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos709781]Tsien eventually left the United States, disgusted at his treatment and thesuspicion that was aroused by a man born in pre-Communist China. He returned toChina as threatened… and jump-started the Chinese missile program. Were theMcCarthy investigators wrong in their assumption that Tsien was a Communist?A review of the FBI files shows that Parsons was suspected of knowing someonebelieved to be a Communist, and he was interrogated on this point several timesby the FBI over the course of several years. Further recourse to somehand-written notes in those same files shows an intriguing reference to asuspect in the US Consulate, Shanghai and a list of friends of this suspect; allof the names in the Parsons file are deleted, except for Parsons himself.Was Tsien a Communist, working for Mao’s China? And if so, was Parsons aware ofthis at the time? With his avowed hatred of Christianity—he called himself theAntichrist, after all—and the suspicions of the American government that he wasa walking security risk, is it possible that Parsons was only one element of alarger network of political intrigue, involving Chinese Communists, occultists,and rocket scientists?Was the much-rumored job in Israel a cover for something more ominous?And was his murder the final solution to the nagging problem of what to do witha brilliant young scientist who would not bow to “all authority that is notbased on courage and manhood”?Marjorie Cameron would remain involved in occultism for the rest of her life,keeping in touch with the old Agape Lodge members, and for a while became afixture of the mystical scene, an honored alumnus of the Parsons era. It was ofher that Kenneth Grant, the English magician mentioned in the last chapter,would write:> …Cameron associated with a Witch-woman who had occult affiliations with> ancient Indian cults that had retained unbroken a secret tradition of traffic> with the Great Old Ones. The Narragansetts of the New England region, the> Adena of Ohio… are known to have forged links with entities spawned in the> [Abyss]… 72 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos710129]Thus we go from the ancient Indian mounds of the Adena people to the rocketscientist Jack Parsons, and back again, walking over what must be familiarterritory by now to the reader, although he or she probably never set foot in itbefore!The mystery of Parsons’s death may never be solved, but what of his life?Although there is very little about Parsons on official government websites orhistories, what does remain is incontrovertible proof of his genius, as well ashis eccentricity. Parsons helped the war effort against Nazi Germany andImperial Japan. He contributed heavily to the early days of the space program.It is all but certain that the Paperclip Doctors would have been aware of hiswork, would have read his papers—the ones considered detrimental to nationalsecurity should they leave American shores. And somehow, someone, somewhere inthe labyrinthine bureaucracy of NASA made sure he got a lunar crater named afterhim, so there would always be a monument to his contribution to science.On the other hand, he participated in occult rituals: sex and drug affairsreplete with incantations, billowing clouds of incense and weird summonings ofincarnate beings to visible appearance. He midwifed L. Ron Hubbard’s initiationinto the sacred mysteries of the Cult of Thelema and the Ordo Templi Orientis,thus providing the impetus for the creation of Scientology and subsequentoffshoots, such as the Process Church of the Final Judgment. He took the Oath ofthe Abyss. He called on the Whore of Babylon, and proclaimed himself theAntichrist and an enemy of the Church. He sent rockets into the heavens, andsummoned demons from hell.And during his Babalon Working rituals in the Mojave Desert in 1946, he “openeda hole in space-time and something flew in.”73--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos504928] Ibid., p. 231, 2332 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos506725] Vincent Bugliosi, Helter Skelter, BantamBooks, NY, 1995, ISBN 0-553-57435-3, p. 6423 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos506725] Maury Terry, The Ultimate Evil, BantamBooks, NY, 1989, ISBN 0-553-27601-8, p. 5124 [../Text/ch04.html#filepos507063] Bugliosi, op. cit., p. 642.

Many people haveproblems with Helter Skelter, however, not least of all Manson and the “family”;it is salutary to read Bugliosi’s book against that of Ed Sanders, The Family,Nikolas Schreck’s The Manson File, and many of the other books that have comeout since the time of the murders, including biographies of some of theprincipal actors in this typically American drama. Some of them are published bysmall presses that specialize in the arcane or the bizarre, for such is thedomain of Manson studies thirty years after the crimes. For factualdetail—names, dates and places—the Bugliosi book is quite reliable; for “color”and context, one could do worse than The Family.

It was a time of multiple assassinations, civil unrest, theescalation of the war in Vietnam, the riots at the Democratic NationalConvention in Chicago, and the election of Richard M. Nixon as President. Formany of our generation, it signaled the death of a dream.Yet, 1947 is also in the running as the pivotal year of the postwar period. Manyof the issues that define our generation owe their conception to the events ofthat year. 1947 was the year the CIA was created, and the penetrating ofsecrets; it was the year of the famous UFO crash at Roswell, New Mexico and thesubsequent concealing of secrets; the year the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered,and their exposure of secrets. It was the year Winston Churchill made his famous“Iron Curtain” speech, thus declaring the beginning of the Cold War. It’s theyear that the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) begins itsfull-scale investigation of Hollywood. It is the year that inventor Arthur Youngleaves Bell Helicopter for a full-time study of paranormal phenomena. It is theyear that the US Navy begins Project CHATTER, the search for a viable truthserum, a magic potion to unlock the secrets of the mind.In May of that year, the Corporal is launched: America’s answer to the V-2rocket, compliments of Jack Parsons and the rest of the JPL rocketeers. It isalso the year of the famous “Black Dahlia” murder in Los Angeles, and of AdmiralByrd’s “Hollow Earth” expedition. It is the year that Aleister Crowley dies. Itis the year that Holly Maddux is born: a future murder victim whose death willexpose the seamy underworld of the New Age movement.And, if we can believe the Beatles, it is the year that Sergeant Pepper’s Bandlearned to play. The famous Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band album wasreleased in June 1967 with lyrics saying, “Twenty years ago today, SergeantPepper taught his band to play.” That would have been in June 1947; the monththe first UFO sightings that gave birth to the term “flying saucer” occurred inthe Pacific Northwest. The lyrics go on to state, “We’d like to take you homewith us.” In retrospect, maybe we should’ve gone.It was the year when those things that are now so secret, so classified andbehind the scenes were up front and in your face: the Cold War, the CIA,UFOs—whatever they were, alien spacecraft or Mogul balloons—crashing in NewMexico, and the mysteries of the origins of Christianity revealed in a cache ofclay jars in Palestine. Maybe they were right about Jack Parsons; maybe he didopen a hole in space-time in that series of rituals in the Mojave Desert in 1946and maybe something did fly right in. And nested in America’s heartland. 1[../Text/ch05.html#filepos883354]FLYING SAUCER NEWSIn June 21, 1947—the summer solstice—six unidentified flying objects were seenover Maury Island in Puget Sound in the State of Washington. The observers wereHarold A. Dahl, a harbor patrolman who was avoiding bad weather by anchoring inMaury Island Bay, his two crewmen, his teenaged son and a dog. The objects weredoughnut-shaped and were hovering at about two thousand feet over the boat,according to Dahl. One of the six seemed to be in trouble, as it was losingaltitude and was being circled by the other five. The objects seemed to bemetallic, with a hole in the center (hence the idea they were “doughnut-shaped”)and with portholes around the outer circumference. Each of the objects seemed tobe about one hundred feet in diameter.There was a small explosion, and one of the objects rained hot metal all overthe boat, killing the dog, damaging the boat and injuring the teenaged son. Dahlquickly beached his craft and began taking pictures of the objects, which soontook off and headed towards Canada. Dahl tried to radio for help or to make areport, but his radio was jammed. Instead, bewildered, he headed back to Tacoma.He got some treatment for his son’s injured arm, and then took his evidence—thecamera, the film and some samples of the metallic slag—to his boss, a man knownas Fred Lee Crisman. 2 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos885401]This is a seminal event. No matter on what side of the Kennedy assassination onefinds oneself—a believer in the Warren Report, or a believer in a conspiracy—theFred Crisman element strains credulity. More than twenty years after this event,Crisman will be subpoenaed by District Attorney Jim Garrison as a suspect in theassassination of President John F. Kennedy. Crisman, a former OSS officer, a manwith a CIA file, a man friendly with Clay Shaw… in at the birth of the twentiethcentury’s UFO experience? Of course, this is not the full story. Who wouldbelieve the full story?Crisman wanted to investigate the site where Dahl’s boat was damaged, but theprevious night a stranger visited Dahl at his home and advised him to forget thewhole thing. The man was dressed in black, and what was unusual was the factthat the incident had not yet been reported outside of Dahl’s and Crisman’scircle. Regardless, the next day—on June 23, 1947—Crisman went out to MauryIsland and found what appeared to be molten glass or metal and foil, but notbefore another UFO passed overhead. Crisman returned to Tacoma, not knowing whatto do at the moment with the information and evidence he had acquired, or so itseemed. So far, the UFO sighting was a localized event, a small town anomaly.The next day, June 24, 1947, the world changed.This was the day of the famous sighting of nine UFOs north of Mount Rainier byKenneth Arnold.One of the accusations leveled at UFO eyewitnesses is that their testimony istainted by reason of their inexperience, lack of professionalism, lack ofknowledge of astronomical phenomena, etc. In other words, they are notscientists or members of the military, police or government establishments, thepeople in charge of determining the contours of our reality. The problem withthe Kenneth Arnold case is that he was the perfect witness. A successfulbusinessman from Boise, Idaho, he was also a deputy federal marshal and anaccomplished pilot who was a member of an Idaho Search and Rescue team. In otherwords, if Kenneth Arnold said that he saw UFOs, then he saw UFOs, not the planetVenus or swamp gas or weather balloons. This is not to say that what he saw wasalien spacecraft, but what he witnessed was not conventional aircraft and thespeeds at which he clocked them were not achievable by the types of aircraft heknew to be in existence at that time.In the air on his way home to Idaho from Washington, he spent a while lookingfor a missing C-46 transport plane for which there was a large, five thousanddollar, reward. The plane was believed downed in the Cascade Mountains ofWashington State.Then, at the same time as the Harold Dahl sighting three days previously—at 2:00P.M.—Arnold was flying at an altitude of about nine thousand feet, when he saw abright flash that bathed his aircraft in light. Trying to spot the source of theflash, he soon saw another, coming from north of Mount Rainier. This time, thesource of the flash was a formation of nine objects, flying erratically butmaintaining formation, like “speed boats on rough water.” He clocked the speedof the objects as they passed Mount Rainier at nearly 1,700 miles per hour, animpossible speed for known aircraft of the time.Arnold landed and spoke about his experience. The initial speculation was thathe was witnessing secret weapons tests, but later on in an interview that nightwith the East Oregonian newspaper, he described the motion of the objects like“a saucer would if you skipped it across the water,” meaning the way the objectsflew and not the way they looked. No matter, from that day on the “flyingsaucer” was born.The story should have ended there and then. Arnold had no hard evidence for thesighting, only his own eyewitness experience. Yet, he was visited in early Julyby two military intelligence officers, Captain William Davidson and LieutenantFrank M. Brown, of the Fourth Air Force, Hamilton Field, California. Theylistened to his story, and then returned to base.Again, the story should have ended there.Fred Crisman, however, had other ideas.His relationship to Raymond A. Palmer, the editor of Amazing Stories, is full ofunanswered questions. Why this former OSS officer and harbor patrolman would beinvolved with a man who published fantasy tales of underground civilizations,weird military experiments (such as the Philadelphia Experiment, in which it wasclaimed the military had developed a device that could dematerialize a ship andthen re-materialize it somewhere else on earth, a story that was later believedto be true by an astonishing number of persons), and mischievous aliens fromother worlds, is not clear. Like fellow OSS officer Peter Tompkins after him,Crisman may simply have been fascinated by the paranormal and by speculativehistory. Or his interest may reveal a slightly more sinister agenda. Speculationis rampant that Crisman’s role was that of a disinformation specialist, and thathis ultimate purpose was to devalue the UFO reports or, failing that, to eraseall traces of the evidence.Crisman contacted Palmer in writing concerning the Maury Island incident; Palmerhimself had contacted Arnold about the Mount Rainier sighting, offering a twohundred dollar advance for his story. These were only two of a large number ofUFO sightings that were taking place that month and into July.On the Fourth of July, at about 11:27 P.M., the infamous Roswell crash tookplace, and the first newspaper reports called the device a “flying saucer”; thusreference was made to the Arnold sighting in which that term was first employedto describe a UFO. On that same day, however, there were no less thaneighty-five sightings in the United States. The Roswell crash was only oneinstance of a “sighting.” Clearly, interest was at an all-time high, and opinionwas divided as to whether the craft were of Soviet manufacture, a captured Nazisecret weapon, an American secret weapon, or—and this was by no means the mostprevalent concept—an alien spacecraft.While the Army then changed its story to describe the Roswell debris as that ofa weather balloon, events were proceeding apace. General Walter Dornberger, thechief of the Nazi space program at Peenemuende and, later, at the Mittelwerke atNordhausen, and responsible for the deaths of thousands of concentration campinmates as slave laborers, is sent to Wright AFB as the Roswell debris is beingshipped there. Dornberger and Wernher von Braun—both of whom initial CIC reportsdescribe as ardent Nazis—have been forgiven their past sins by the Army and arebrought to the United States under Operation Overcast—renamed Paperclip—much tothe irritation of Nuremberg prosecutors. They are now in a position to reviewthe Roswell wreckage.At the same time, the same month, the National Security Act is passed, thuspaving the way for the establishment of the Central Intelligence Agency, whichis finally chartered in September. James Forrestal is named as the first USSecretary of Defense. He will not last long.Meanwhile, Kenneth Arnold arranges to meet Harold Dahl in Tacoma, Washington atthe request of Raymond Palmer. The date is set for July 30, 1947. During theflight to Tacoma on July 29, Arnold sees yet another squadron of UFOs—this timenearly two dozen of them, and very small compared to the first squadron, lessthan a meter in diameter each—at LaGrande, Oregon. He attempts to film them, butthe film only shows some small specks, and is disappointing as evidence.Once arrived in Tacoma, Arnold discovers that all the hotels are fully booked.Discouraged, he tries the most expensive place in town and finds, incredibly,that a room has been reserved for him by name although no one knows who made thebooking.The next day, he meets Dahl. Dahl, however, is still unnerved by his visit fromthe “man in black” the previous month and is hesitant to talk to Arnold. Arnold,motivated in part by the two hundred dollar advance from Palmer and partly byhis own curiosity about the sightings taking place, presses Dahl for moreinformation.Dahl finally breaks, and tells Arnold the same story he told Crisman. Dahl’sphotographs are gone, of course: he has given his camera and his film toCrisman. He did, however, manage to keep back a few pieces of the “slag” thatfell from the damaged UFO. He showed Arnold a piece of what seemed to bevolcanic rock, not a very suspicious-looking fragment. Dahl also told Arnoldabout a letter he had received, which stated the UFOs were piloted by aliens whohad become visible due to US atomic explosions, and that they were visiting theearth to help protect it from unspecified enemies. The letter writer wasanonymous, and one can’t help wondering if Crisman was behind this, as well.At this point, Arnold felt he was being had. The whole story sounded verysuspicious, very artificial. He asked a friend, another pilot—United AirlinesCaptain E. J. Smith—for his take on the affair. They came to the conclusion thateither the story was a simple hoax, or it was part of an intelligence operation.They distrusted Crisman completely, and felt that he was trying to control theinvestigation. Either Crisman was a hoaxer, or a spy. Either way, Arnold andSmith felt that he had nothing to contribute.Then, as if in confirmation of their suspicions, it was reported that UnitedPress International had received verbatim transcripts of their interviews anddiscussions, the ones held at Arnold’s mysteriously-booked hotel room! Suddenly,it was all becoming clear. Arnold’s presence in Tacoma had been part of a largerplot; his room was selected in advance and bugged; the information he extractedfrom Dahl, and his conversations with Smith, were sent to the news agency (forwhat purpose can only be imagined). It seemed as if there was an operationunderway to discredit the Maury Island UFO report and to do that with KennethArnold, a much more credible witness than either Dahl or Crisman. Two birds withone stone?At this point, Arnold was determined to bring in military intelligence. Ifnothing else, it would eliminate once and for all the possibility that the MauryIsland affair was some kind of espionage plot, thus reducing it to the level ofa simple-minded hoax by Crisman and Dahl. Crisman seemed to welcome the idea ofbringing in the Army; Dahl was still frightened from his meeting with the man inblack, and did not want to cooperate.No matter; Arnold called the men who had debriefed him after his own UFOsighting, Lieutenant Brown and Captain Davidson. They agreed to fly out toTacoma immediately to see what Arnold had. They arrived later that day, talkedwith both Arnold and Smith, seemed to dismiss the whole affair as a hoax, andreturned to the airport for their ride home. Arnold was nonplussed. It appearedto him as if they had already dismissed the story in advance of their arrival.If so, then why bother coming out at all?At the airport, an odd thing happened, one which has plagued UFO researchers foryears. Crisman, the man the intelligence officers seemed to think was nothingmore than an oddball hoaxer, turned up at the last minute and gave the men aheavy box which he claimed was filled with the debris from the damaged UFO. ToArnold, who was there, the contents looked like a bunch of rocks. The men stowedthe box in the trunk of their car and left for the airport, catching theirflight.They never made it back to base.Both Davidson and Brown were killed. The enlisted men on board parachuted tosafety after the left engine caught fire—according to the report of one of thesurvivors—and the two officers remained with the aircraft for a full ten minutesbefore the B-52 bomber crashed to earth. No one has any idea why the twointelligence officers would have remained with the plane and not parachutedthemselves; or why they did not radio a distress call. The emergencyfire-fighting equipment was inoperable, so there was no chance to save theplane. According to Major George Sander of the US Army Air Corps, the plane wascarrying classified material. Was that a reference to the box of rocks carriedon board by Davidson and Brown?> One of the men involved in the investigation of UFO reports in the American> Northwest that year was none other than FBI Special Agent Guy Banister.Guy Banister’s name is well-known among conspiracy aficionados as another one ofthe men implicated by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison in the Kennedyassassination. It was Guy Banister—by this time a former FBI agent—who rentedoffice space at the same location stamped on Lee Harvey Oswald’s “Fair Play forCuba Committee” flyers. Banister was running an anti-Castro Cuban operation fromhis investigator’s office, an operation that attracted the likes of formerEastern Airlines pilot and assassination suspect David Ferrie. Oswald wasrunning a pro-Castro Cuban operation from the same address, an anomaly thatcould only be explained if one understood that Banister and Oswald were workingtogether, and that the pro-Castro operation was a front for some other, evenmore nefarious, purpose. Further, while Banister was FBI Special Agent in Charge(SAC) of the Chicago field office during World War II, one of his FBIsubordinates was James McCord of Watergate “plumbers” fame, 3[../Text/ch05.html#filepos885916]and another was Robert A. Maheu: the man whowould later become head of his own investigative agency and an employee ofHoward Hughes, the man whose agency was started by money won from JamesMc-Inerney, the assistant Attorney General who was involved in the Jack Parsonsinvestigation. Maheu would go on to become the man in the middle between the CIAand organized crime in the assassination plots against Castro.Banister was—during the time of the Arnold sighting, the Maury Island affair,and Roswell—an FBI Special Agent assigned to the Butte, Montana field office,which had responsibility for several western states, including Idaho (whereKenneth Arnold resided). A look at recently declassified FBI files for thatperiod in 1947 show a number of telexes from Banister, some with his initials“WGB,” all pertaining to UFO phenomena, 4 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos886267]aswell as other FBI documents with the designation “Security Matter—X” or simply“SM-X,” the origin—the author supposes—of the “X Files,” which, at least in1947, did exist at the FBI and was concerned with UFOs (as well as with thefederal investigation of Wilhelm Reich, the pioneer psychoanalyst whose “orgonetherapy” had run afoul of the medical establishment and who himself was a firmbeliever in the existence of UFOs).Usually, when Banister is referenced in connection with the Kennedyassassination, he is mentioned as having been with the FBI in Chicago for manyyears, which is undoubtedly true, but the period in Butte put him in the middleof the seminal UFO event of the twentieth century.Thus, the 1947 UFO sightings attracted two men—Crisman and Banister—who bothwould come under suspicion twenty years later for their supporting roles in theKennedy assassination. The odds against this happening must be astronomical. Itis the constant appearance of “coincidences” like these that leave most amateurconspiracy theorists apoplectic, speechless with disbelief and gazing on theworld around them with haunted, suspicious expressions, as if reality itselfwere layered like an onion, a palimpsest on which numerous events were writtenover each other, all on the same page. In this case, we have OperationPaperclip, UFOs, and the Kennedy assassination all written on the same thinsheet of onionskin parchment. Nazis, aliens and political murder. At this point,we can almost sympathize with Pontius Pilate, who asked, “What is truth?”—andthe temptation to wash one’s hands of the whole matter is almost too strong.The conclusion of the crash investigation was that the plane suffered mechanicalfailure, and crashed as a result. Davidson and Brown were thus possibly thefirst martyrs to the UFO phenomenon. The author cannot offer any evidence thatthey were murdered, still less that they were murdered to cover-up the truthbehind the UFO sightings of 1947. What he can offer, however, are the followingfacts:Harold Dahl saw something in the skies over Maury Island which killed his dogand wounded his son, damaging his boat in the process. He gives his evidence ofthis sighting to his boss, Fred Crisman, a former OSS officer and soon-to-be CIAagent.A few days later, Kenneth Arnold—an experienced pilot, a deputy federal marshal,and a successful businessman—sees a formation of flying objects traveling attremendous speed near Mount Rainier. He reports this to the military.When Arnold, Dahl and Crisman get together in Tacoma their meeting is bugged andtranscripts of their conversations provided to the press. The only ones who knewArnold was flying to Tacoma on that day and time to meet Dahl and Crisman were…Dahl and Crisman. There is only one hotel room available, and it has Arnold’sname on it, although no one admits to making the reservation.Arnold calls in military intelligence, the same two officers he met previously.They arrive immediately, question the men, and leave. Crisman gives them a boxof what he claims is UFO debris. Their plane crashes, killing both intelligenceofficers.Guy Banister is an FBI field agent at the time, charged with investigating UFOsightings under the rubric 62-83894: the “SM-X” or “X Files.”Both Crisman and Banister become suspects in the Kennedy assassination.Crisman is a friend or colleague of Clay Shaw, another suspect in theassassination and a CIA contract agent.Crisman has a CIA file and, according to veteran journalist Jim Marrs, was an“extended agent” involved in disruption operations as part of his brief as anInternal Security Specialist. 5 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos887847]About the only people involved in the affair who are not intelligence officersare Dahl and Arnold. Everyone else is either military intelligence, OSS or FBI.It is important to point out that President Truman had disbanded the OSS onSeptember 20, 1945 and that the CIA was not chartered until September 18, 1947,almost exactly two years later. Thus, the Maury Island affair takes place at theend of that two-year hiatus separating the two agencies. However, the meninvolved in the OSS did not disappear from government service.As several histories of the OSS demonstrate—most notably Richard Harris Smith’sOSS: The Secret History of America’s First Central Intelligence Agency—theassets of the OSS were “dispersed among the other agencies of the government.The remains of the Secret Intelligence and Special Operations branches weretransferred to the War Department and placed under the command of Donovan’sDeputy Director for Intelligence, General John Magruder.”6[../Text/ch05.html#filepos888304]Such other OSS luminaries as Richard Helms,James Angleton, and even Herbert Marcuse remained on board in some capacity orother until the formal creation of the CIA in 1947, even as the former OSSanalysts were being charged with extreme left-wing, socialist and communist,tendencies. Thus, Crisman was possibly working for the War Department at thetime of the Maury Island affair, and was certainly among those reactivated oncethe CIA was formally established only a few months after the UFO sightings.It is tempting to link the UFO sightings with the creation of a NationalSecurity Act and the establishment of the CIA; it is even more tempting to linkthe sudden presence of Nazi General Dornberger at Wright Field withcontemporaneous multiple UFO sightings in the US during the same month theRoswell crash debris is taken there. All of this happened in the same four weektime frame, and involved some of the same notorious characters who wouldresurface sixteen years later at the time of the assassination of John F.Kennedy. One must either put this fascinating conglomeration of events down tomere coincidence, see it as proof of a wide, multilevel and omnivorousconspiracy… or be forced to seek a deeper meaning, evidence of the action of ahidden force in nature, a connective tissue among events that cannot bediscerned from our three dimensional surface. Not mere coincidence, but thephenomenon we know as coincidence taken to a different level.LAND OF ENCHANTMENTThe Maury Island affair and the Kenneth Arnold sighting are often linked, but inreality they were two separate incidents connected only by the fact that Arnoldwas sent—by Ray Palmer—to investigate the Maury Island sighting. Both eventsbecame eclipsed in the popular imagination by the Roswell crash.So much has been written and broadcast about Roswell—including a prime-timetelevision series featuring pouty, alienated teenagers as aliens—that the authorwill not devote an inordinate amount of time to the minutiae of the case.Instead, we will focus on specific elements as they pertain to our thesis.Interested readers can access a wide variety of printed studies of the Roswellcase, as well as websites, films, television specials, etc. 7[../Text/ch05.html#filepos888856]The basic facts of the case—insofar as facts can be identified within the welterof conflicting details that have amassed in the last fifty years—is that,shortly after the Arnold and Dahl sightings of late June 1947, a surprisingnumber of UFO sightings were being reported all over the United States, and inforeign countries. These sightings culminated with an object tracked on radarscreens over New Mexico on July 1, 1947. This object followed the basic patternof the Arnold sighting, showing speeds and maneuvers of which contemporaryAmerican aircraft were incapable. These sightings continued on July 2 and July3. On July 4, the object vanished. Whatever it had been, the belief was that ithad crashed.The next day, July 5, 1947, wreckage was discovered on William Brazel’s ranch,north of Roswell, New Mexico. The people who found the wreckage included oneGrady L. Barnett, a few archaeologists working on a dig nearby, and Brazelhimself. The debris from the crash site covered a wide area, and Brazel’s sheepwouldn’t cross into the field. The next day, Brazel met with the sheriff ofRoswell to report the situation, who then called the Army. The Army had the areacordoned off, and Brazel then spoke with intelligence officer Major Jesse A.Marcel and showed him a piece of the debris. Marcel then made a report at theairbase, and a complete search of the area was undertaken, from both land andair. During the investigation at the crash site, several eye witnesses reportedseeing what appeared to be small bodies, corpses of whatever race was flying theobject, beings that died on impact.Later that week, the wheels fell off. The information officer of the 509th BombGroup at Roswell issued a press release, telling a startled public that they hadretrieved a flying disc.This seemed to have caught Washington by surprise.Marcel was ordered to take the debris to Fort Worth, Texas, to the Carswell AirBase, from which another press release was issued, this time telling theconfused public that the material recovered was not from a flying disc but froma simple weather balloon. And there the story should have died.Except for the witnesses.Once again, most people who claim to have seen UFOs are dismissed asscientifically unsophisticated or somehow misinformed. In the case of Roswell,however, the sheer number of military witnesses alone argues against this. Thesewitnesses include Corporal E.L. Pyles, Sergeant Thomas C. Gonzales, SergeantMelvin E. Brown, CIC agent Master Sergeant Bill Rickett, Major Edwin Easley,Lieutenant Colonel Albert L. Duran, Colonel William Blanchard, and up toBrigadier General Arthur E. Exon, not forgetting Major Marcel himself, amongothers. In some cases, these men saw the crash and concluded that the craft wasnot of this world; in other cases, they saw bodies that did not seem to behuman; in still other cases, they examined the crash debris and were amazed bythe strange properties of the metal, such that it resisted extreme heat andcould not be dented by hammers. This list includes both officers and enlistedmen, from a Corporal to a Brigadier General. Either they are all lying, or someof them are lying, or they are all telling the truth. It strains credulity tobelieve that they were all simply mistaken, or the victims themselves of somekind of hoax.To make matters even stranger, a high-ranking intelligence officer and formermember of President Eisenhower’s National Security Council—Colonel Philip J.Corso—published a memoir shortly before his death claiming that he had seenevidence of the Roswell crash himself. The book was entitled The Day AfterRoswell and was published to, curiously, mixed reviews. Corso’s credentials areimpeccable; he had given testimony before Congress on the fate of POWs beingheld in North Korea, he had appeared on Prime Time Live as an expert on U-2overflights, had worked for both Senator Strom Thurmond and Senator JamesEastland as “a staff member specializing in national security,” and had aremarkable twenty-one year career in the armed services. He had been part ofOperation Paperclip in Italy. He had been a staff member for Senator RichardRussell on the Warren Commission (yet another Paperclip/UFO/assassination tie).The eighty-year-old retired military man with no need for the money the bookwould bring (and, indeed, due to some legal problems his royalties would be heldup until after he died), and with a mantelpiece filled with medals and awardsand photos with the famous and powerful in Washington, had no discerniblereason—no ulterior motive that we can find—for participating in a hoax, if thatis what Roswell is. His claim that his job at the Pentagon involved coordinatingthe reverse engineering of alien technology was greeted by either sneers ofderision or cries of “I told you so!” The question that has not been answered iswhy Corso, at the end of his long and successful career, would have botheredwriting all of this if it wasn’t true, and thereby besmirch a previouslyblameless reputation.Yet, with all that, the American public is expected to ignore Roswell and all ofits attendant mysteries. It was a flying disc; no, it was a weather balloon; no,it was part of a top secret balloon project called Operation Mogul, and thebodies were really just mannequins. Unfortunately, the Roswell Air Base files onthe crash were all destroyed, as US Representative Steven Schiff (R.-New Mexico)discovered to his disbelief in 1995. If Americans are not to believe a virtualplatoon of military men and intelligence officers who all claim that somethingvery unusual—something “otherworldly”—had crashed in the New Mexico desert in1947, then just who are they supposed to believe? Press secretaries? Publicrelations officers? Spin doctors?Of course, it is entirely possible that the government itself has no real ideaexactly what crashed in Roswell, or what that crash implies for nationalsecurity; but in the years that would follow, men would die, commit suicide,lose their minds and their reputations over the UFO phenomenon. That solemn rollcall includes military men and scientists, people who can be expected to beskeptical, cautious, and most of all discerning in their approach to thismaterial. Incredible sightings would take place, and continue to take place, allover the world, increasing the tension in the collective consciousness to thepoint that many people are expecting the truth about UFOs to be revealed anyday. The author himself is reluctant to write this account, fearful that hisreputation—such as it is!—is in danger due to his treatment of thiscontroversial topic, because there are only two sides to this debate: you eitherbelieve, or you don’t. You’re not allowed to sit on the fence, and simply say “Idon’t know,” because you will be immediately assailed on both sides by those whoare desperate to shove their point of view down your rapidly constrictingthroat. In the absence of openness from the American government regarding whatit knows about the UFO phenomenon, both believers and actual witnesses areforced into a kind of fantasy land: believers can make up any story they like,because they will all be denied with equal vehemence. Witnesses are forced toeither admit they may be mistaken or at worst insane, doubting the solidevidence of their senses. And when that happens, a crime on a par with murdertakes place: the murder of truth, a sin—as Sister Agatha used to say—against theHoly Spirit.Item: January 7, 1948. Air National Guard pilot Captain Thomas Mantell crashesin Franklin, Kentucky, chasing a UFO over Fort Knox. A decorated World War IIace, he becomes the first UFO casualty if you don’t count Davidson and Brown whodied in the B-52 crash over Washington State. The cover story was that themisguided pilot was chasing the planet Venus; this was later changed to aweather balloon. Mantell had died because he ran out of oxygen at thirtythousand feet, the only one of his squadron who dared to climb that high inpursuit of the craft. His radio reports make it clear that he was in pursuit ofa manned vehicle of some sort; the crash site examination and all other recordswere covered up and, at the time of this writing, have yet to be released.Item: January 22, 1948. Two weeks after Captain Mantell’s death, the Air Forcecreates Project SIGN to investigate UFO phenomena.Item: February 12, 1948. Brigadier General Charles P. Cabell of the US Air ForceDirectorate of Intelligence—and later to become Deputy Director of the CIA,implicated in the Bay of Pigs fiasco and possibly in the Kennedyassassination—issued a memo requesting all Air Force bases in the United Statesbe provided with at least one camera-equipped fighter plane to record data fromUFOs. The request was considered too expensive, and was turned down.Item: August 1, 1948.

Due to news leaks, Project SIGN is changed to ProjectGRUDGE, and a sea change takes place. From now on, all official governmentreports on UFOs will be designed to discredit the sightings and to characterizethem as weather balloons, planets, etc.Item: December 6, 1950. Radar installations all over the United States are underhigh alert as Canadian stations report a squadron of aircraft flying towardsWashington, D.C. from the coast of Labrador. This event is recorded in DeanAcheson’s autobiography, as well in books about the Truman administration. Itwas later described as anything from a flight of geese to a C-47 air cargotransport to atmospheric conditions, depending on the agency doing theexplanation; but the incident was considered serious enough that the BritishPrime Minister was warned that a possible attack was in progress. Then,mysteriously, the squadron disappeared from radar over American airspace.Item: March 1952.

Have we simply satisfied superstitious impulses withthis newer, quasi-scientific experience, as science observers such as Carl Saganinsist? Or is science itself reaching the limits of its ability to makestatements about reality, and is it crossing over—slowly, but inexorably—intothe domain of the supernatural?A BROTHERHOOD BURIED ALIVEGeorge Steiner, in a breathtaking study of myth and philosophy inliterature—Antigones—introduces us to a theme of Romantic literature, codifiedby the Danish philosopher Sören Kierkegaard as theSymparanekromenoi, a term thatcan be translated as “brothers in death” or “companions in live burial” or even“brotherhood of the sepulchral and macabre.” Steiner presents as examples ofthis “brotherhood” the authors Baudelaire, Coleridge, Novalis, Nietzsche, andKierkegaard himself. 8 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos890242]He sees the literarytechnique of the fragment (bits of diary entry, letters, unfinished lectures,aphorisms, etc.) as representative of this school, as well as a fascination withdeath and the supernatural (in a morbid sense as opposed to the purelyuplifting). One may say that these fragments represent nothing more than clues…clues perhaps at the scene of the crime.The Romantic period was the last gasp of literary arrogance before the advent oftechnology and the “technological sciences” (as opposed to pure science). Onemight say that Hiroshima spelled the end of any future pretense at the Romanticin literature. Faced with such an unyielding and remorseless reality—theinstantaneous incineration of whole populations by a single bomb—westernliterature and philosophy began to reflect that reality. When the full horrorsof the Holocaust became common knowledge, the depth of the depravity anddestructiveness of humanity stunned the innocent and naïve—that is to say, theAmericans—and overrode all other impulses. The world seemed poised on the brinkof Manichean apocalypse, of “mutual assured destruction,” in death measured inmegatons, rads, minutes, and first-strikes. Existentialism became a fad, asyoung people and old began to question existence (and therefore reality) itself,the purpose of life, and moral responsibility. Nuclear winter became our seasonof discontent.As the Forties turned into the Fifties, and then the Sixties, the drug culturetook western civilization on what appeared to be a detour but what may have beenthe main drag itself. Suddenly, questions that seemed so important a year beforewere rendered pointless in the face of fantastic hallucinations and psychedelicilluminations, and all this in the midst of Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Africanrevolutions and Latin American coups d’etat. The real and the ideal were mixedin a kaleidoscopic mural of love and death, hope and despair.As Vietnam turned into Watergate, reality itself became the circus of thebizarre. We learned more during the Watergate hearings than we ever wanted toknow. Crooked politicians we could deal with, and have dealt with since thefounding of the country; but crooked spies, rogue intelligence operations,foreign adventures unsupported by an electorate glued to their television setsduring prime time soap opera extravaganzas… this was more than most Americanscould understand.Gradually, entertainment became reality, and reality, entertainment. Shows likeCops showed Americans what it was like to be on both sides of an arrest. Tabloidnews shows like Current Affair and Hard Copy gave Americans reality presented asentertainment-presented-as-reality. The Falklands War gave us Nightline, wherewe could watch Argentine government officials and British government officialsscreaming at each other over satellite linkups, in real time.Soon, reality became king. MTV gave us the spectacle of intellectually dismalyoung people living together in a single dwelling, sniping at each other andstabbing each other in the back. This was followed by a rash of “reality”television shows, such as Survivor, Combat Mission, Eco-Challenge, and the othercreations of Australian producer Mark Burnett. At the same time, made-for-tvmovie credits were always careful to mention that their offering was “based on atrue story.”We might trace this “based on a true story” motif to that 1973 cinematicblockbuster, The Exorcist. After all, what made that movie so frightening to somany people was the insistence by its producer that it was, after all, based onactual events. And here we had an example of a new kind of postwar Romanticism:horror was acceptable if it was real. After all, the world had been shown to befull of more horrors than any (sane) novelist could imagine. The alternative wasthe splatter film, a genre soaked in blood and violence that was far from whatthe Romantics had in mind with their melancholy graveyards and sorrowful shades.Instead, the sophisticated horror tale had to be real and appropriatelypsychological. Psychology gave horror writers and producers a credible way torepresent the otherwise impossible scenarios in their books and scripts: theperpetrator was crazy, and had only imagined in his diseased brain all thosespooky effects. It was the diseased brain itself that became the crucible forhorror, the new metaphor for evil. The Tony Perkins character in Psycho wastailor-made by Freud, and based on the real-life serial killer, Ed Gein.Of course, our political assassins are all crazy, too.While Romanticism may be dead, a curiosity fit only for college EnglishLiterature courses and tenured professors in tweedy jackets and elbow patches,there is a new kind of Romantic element at play in the West, and it is creatinga new kind of literature. Norman Mailer may have been much closer to the markthan we realized, for instance, when he subtitled his Pulitzer Prize-winning TheExecutioner’s Song, “a non-fiction novel.” There is an element of thefragmentary in that work—the accumulation of evidence based on hundreds ofinterviews, trial transcripts, and public records—as well as in Harlot’s Ghost,his fictionalized treatment of the history of the CIA. There is a growingrealization that we cannot depict what really happened without an element of thenovelistic. We can’t tell the story without… telling a story. We have to putevents in context for them to have any meaning, the same way a homicidedetective examines the clues at the scene of the crime; and it is precisely thisinsistence on meaning that has plagued realism from the start, and has led tothe confrontation between science and religion or, more properly perhaps,between science and the occult. And in the midst of that confrontation, livingin the twilight world between what is mainstream science and what is fringespirituality, an abyss of politics by other means, dwells a new “brotherhoodburied alive”: the investigative journalists Jim Marrs, Howard Blum and JimHougan, among others.Jim Marrs is perhaps the latest one of that brotherhood of respected,award-winning journalists who seem to have gone off the deep end as theirresearch took them further and further into the murky flipside of the Americandream; Howard Blum may have been one of the first. Blum’s 1977 expose on Naziwar criminals living peacefully in the United States—Wanted! The Search forNazis in America—was a bestseller, based on the unsung heroes of the USgovernment (as well as private citizens) who would not rest until the scandal ofgovernment-sponsored Nazi war criminals was made common knowledge and thecriminals deported to stand trial. Blum wrote investigative pieces for the NewYork Times, and won several prestigious awards. Wanted! carried blurbs fromHarrison E. Salisbury and Joseph Heller. Blum went on to become a contributingeditor for Vanity Fair. He followed Wanted! with Gangland (about the FBI and theMafia) and a study of the Walker spy family, I Pledge Allegiance.In the midst of all these mainstream topics, though, we find Blum writing OutThere, a 1990 expose of the UFO coverup in the American military and government.This was a gutsy thing to do. After all, UFOs are the kiss of death for seriousjournalists, and one risks his credibility even thinking about doing a storylike that, unless the goal is to debunk. Out There did not debunk; on thecontrary one comes away believing that the US government has detailed andprecise knowledge of alien visitations, and is covering up a story about as bigas the Crucifixion. To make matters even more interesting, Blum followed that in1998 with The Gold of Exodus, a story about lost treasure, in which some amateurarchaeologists secretly start digging around in Saudi Arabian territory, hot onthe trail of Moses. So, from Nazi war criminals, spies and the Mafia… to UFOsand Biblical archaeology.Jim Hougan, another highly-regarded investigative journalist, televisionproducer and novelist, caught national attention with Spooks, a fascinatingexpose of the private use of intelligence agents in such companies as HughesTool and Resorts International. It is in Spooks that we learn of MitchWerBell—the “Wizard of Whispering Death”—and other colorful, underworldcharacters. Hougan followed this up withSecret Agenda, a convincing report onthe call-girl ring involved in the Watergate affair which has added considerablyto our knowledge of this important political “nightmare.” His novels, however,deal with Illuminati-type secret societies, intelligence agency mind controlprograms, and all the heavy furniture of the conspiracy theorists.What’s going on? Is this a phenomenon in itself worth studying: how the best andthe brightest of our investigative journalists eventually find themselveswandering the labyrinth of cults, conspiracies and alien contact? Jim Marrs isthe Texas-based journalist who came to national prominence with Crossfire, thebook that—along with Jim Garrison’s On The Trail of the Assassins—became thebasis of Oliver Stone’s film on the Kennedy assassination, JFK. He has sincegone down the same mysterious labyrinth, publishing Alien Agenda in 1997 andRule By Secrecy in 2000. The fact that respected journalists such as Marrs,Hougan and Blum put their names and reputations on the line by publishingreports on aliens, cults, and some of the wilder conspiracy theories of our timeshould give us pause. These are the people we trust to come back and tell us thetruth about what is… out there.Norman Mailer, the father of New Journalism, a founder of the Village Voice,two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and no-nonsense eminence gris of Americanletters, has himself followed a similar path. Beginning with The Naked and theDead and through A Fire On the Moon, Armies of the Night, The Executioner’sSong, Harlot’s Ghost and dozens of other novels and works of non-fiction overthe past fifty years, Mailer has given us reality as well as new ways of lookingat reality without compromising his (or our) intellectual integrity. As anexample, many objected to his study of Lee Harvey Oswald, Oswald’s Tale,researched at some peril amid KGB files in the crumbling Soviet Union, since itseemed to support the Warren Commission Report’s “crazed, lone gunman”conclusion. Yet, he has remained fascinated with spiritual and mythical themes.Ancient Evenings is probably the most obvious demonstration of this, a novel setentirely in ancient Egypt. He has also written about Marilyn Monroe at lengthand this, with his work on Oswald and his novel on the CIA, places him squarelyin the middle of some of our greatest twentieth century controversies. While hehas yet to tackle UFOs, he has written The Gospel According to the Son, which isa fictionalized “gospel” written by Jesus himself, and thus has covered theBiblical angle, along with those Egyptian mysteries in Ancient Evenings.The above is a sampling of those who began as essentially political writers andjournalists and who evolved over time into the type of seekers peculiar to thelate twentieth century: seekers after truth who trust science more than faith.(About the only person the mainstream trusted to speak of UFOs, astrology, andcults was, after all, the late Carl Sagan.) But what of those who began theircareers “from the other direction” as it might be? Were there cultists, priestsof arcane religions, devotees of the “astral” who became… political?Perhaps the most famous, most respected of all the amateur assassination andconspiracy researchers is Mary Ferrell. Ferrell’s work has attracted virtuallyevery serious journalist and writer on the subject of presidentialassassinations. Her library of books, papers, newsclippings and articles is vastand well-organized. Mary Ferrell bought the entire 26 volume set of the WarrenCommission Report and cross-indexed it single-handedly, thus immediatelyproviding an invaluable research tool, since, as anyone knows who has ever seenthe entire Report, it is a disaster when it comes to the organization of data.She then collected every scrap of paper she could find that involved theassassination and its various personalities. She has been a source for JimMarrs, Norman Mailer, and virtually every other well-known (and not sowell-known) name in the business. What is perhaps not so well-known about MaryFerrell herself is that she was once heavily involved in the occult,specifically with the Golden Dawn: that British secret society and breedingground for such personalities as Aleister Crowley, William Butler Yeats, ArthurEdward Waite and many others, and with Israel Regardie, Crowley’s one timesecretary and publisher of the Golden Dawn rituals. This involvement was longbefore the Kennedy assassination took place. It was the assassination itselfthat put her mystical studies on hold and which drove her into this nobleobsession with finding out the truth behind the murder.There are many similarities between the function of the occultist and thefunction of the detective: to seek the truth behind a mystery is perhaps theeasiest way to describe what may be a psychological compulsion common to bothtypes of personality. In the case of the detective, each individual homicide isperhaps representative of a greater Evil, and to solve one murder is to begin tosolve all the others, to redress a history of wrong, to redeem society itself.In the case of the occultist, there is only one murder, whether it is the murderof Abel by Cain or of Jesus by the Romans or of any one of thousands of othersymbols and signs for that first, ineffable crime, the “dreadful”—to useKierkegaard’s phrase—“that has already happened.”The Dutch writer Jan Willem van de Wetering is another example of this sameimpulse. In 1972 he published a memoir of his time spent as a Zen monk in Japan,The Empty Mirror. He began his novitiate in 1958 in Kyoto, and spent a year anda half undergoing the harsh discipline of Zen monastery life. This was, ofcourse, at the time of the Beat generation, and Zen had become popularized inthe books and poems of Ginsberg, Kerouac, and the rest of the bongo-thumping,finger-snapping Beatniks. Yet, van de Wetering was quite serious about hisdesire to attain enlightenment, even though he interrupted his routine at timesby getting drunk and walking blindly through the paper walls of the Japanesemonastery.He is now a famous author of mysteries, many involving his most belovedcharacters, the Amsterdam Cops. His tales are part detective story, part Zenkoan. As his master told him the day he left the Japanese monastery, “By leavinghere nothing is broken. Your training continues. The world is a school where thesleeping are woken up. You are now a little awake, so awake that you can neverfall asleep again.”9 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos890707] His detective novels are,perhaps, proof of this “spiritual insomnia.”Apropos philosophy and the detective story, the Italian philosopher anddetective novelist in his own right, as well as author of many important workson semiotics, Umberto Eco has this to say:After all, the fundamental question of philosophy (like that of psychoanaly> sis) is the same as the question of the detective novel: who is guilty? 10> [../Text/ch05.html#filepos891582]Who, indeed?BLUEBIRDS OVER THE MOUNTAIN> You are on the threshold of the Land of Memory…> —Act II, Scene I: “The Fairy,” The Blue Bird 11> [../Text/ch05.html#filepos892020]As we have seen, the creation of the United States’ intelligence apparatus beganin the same month as the Roswell crash, in July of 1947, with the NationalSecurity Act. The National Security Council was established at that time, andJames Forrestal was named as the first US Secretary of Defense (the WarDepartment being renamed as the “Department of Defense”). The National SecurityAct provided for the creation of a national intelligence agency, and the CentralIntelligence Agency was formally created by charter on September 18, 1947. Thevery first National Security Council meeting was held on December 19, 1947, and,a few days later on December 22, the first Director of the CIA—Vice AdmiralRoscoe Hillenkoetter—authorized the CIA’s SPG (Special Projects Group) to carryout covert operations. The Cold War is in full swing, and there is no turningback.Within a few weeks, Captain Mantell would chase a UFO across the skies overKentucky and would die after blacking out at thirty thousand feet, or so thestory goes. During the rest of that year Project SIGN would be created, theState of Israel would be proclaimed, and Jack Parsons would lose his securityclearance. That same year, the US Navy would create Project PENGUIN, a programto research the uses of psychic phenomena by the military.By 1949 the world would enter a very dangerous phase, as the Soviet Unionexploded its first atomic bomb, and Mao’s revolution culminated in the creationof the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949. The world, it seemed, waspolarizing into two opposing forces, the yin and yang of twentieth centuryhistory: on the economic side, the opposing systems of capitalism and communism,and on the political side, the systems of democracy and totalitarianism. Morethan simply a difference of opinion about how to organize society, the opposingprinciples were deeper, more profound than that, and affected every aspect ofthe human experience. Everything from education to religion to commerce togovernment to marriage was being examined under the Communist systems of Russiaand China, which meant that the rest of the world was forced to come to termswith institutions they had taken for granted. The term “Godless Communism”became a watchword and a battle-cry, a stereotype that could have come straightfrom the book of psychological warfare, so neat and unequivocal it was, soefficient in forestalling any need for deeper understanding of the conflict.Communists were atheists, enough said. Wasn’t it Marx who wrote, “Religion isthe opiate of the people”? And speaking of religion and opium it was on February3, 1949 that the world was subjected to a very bizarre experience, in the formof a public confession recited by Roman Catholic Josef Cardinal Mindszenty ofHungary.Josef Mindszenty was a staunch anti-Communist and priest of the Catholic Churchin Budapest when Pope Pius XII consecrated him bishop in 1944, elevating him toCardinal in February 1946. This was in the midst of great turmoil in Hungary,when a democratically-elected government was toppled by a Communist coup d’étatthat instigated a reign of terror. Mindszenty himself was arrested in 1948,accused of collaboration with the Nazis, espionage, and treason. Subjected tophysical and psychological torture, including being beaten with a rubber hose,Mindszenty refused to sign a confession to the charges. Finally, in February of1949, he appeared before the startled view of the world as, apparently druggedor under some other psychological coercion, he fully (and robotically) confessedto all the charges against him. The security and intelligence services of theworld became very alarmed. What weapon did the Russians possess that wasstronger than physical or psychological torture, that could make such acast-iron anti-Communist as Mindszenty confess to crimes that he did not commitand that could conceivably sign his death warrant?The following year, 1950, the Korean War began. Our former allies against theNazis and the Japanese—the Russians and the Chinese respectively—were now ourenemies. The Korean War would officially begin on June 25, 1950, but two monthsearlier an operation was put in motion whose effects are still being felt today,more than fifty years later.Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter was the first Director of the CIA; he was alsolater to become a member of NICAP, that organization of professional scientists,military men, engineers and civilians created to uncover the truth about UFOs.Hillenkoetter remained convinced about the reality of the phenomenon all hislife. But on April 20, 1950—ironically enough, Hitler’s birthday—he approved thecreation of a special project to discover a means to combat the Russian mindweapons, whatever they were. This project was called BLUEBIRD. 12[../Text/ch05.html#filepos892495]Tad Szulc, a respected mainstream journalist and biographer of both WatergatePlumber and CIA agent E. Howard Hunt and Cuban leader Fidel Castro (and thuscovering both sides of the Bay of Pigs story), mentions—in an article printed inthe November 1977 issue of Psychology Today—that code names like BLUEBIRD andthe later ARTICHOKE “have no known significance.” This is echoed in John Marks’classic study of CIA mind control projects, The Search for the ManchurianCandidate (1979). Yet it is true that, in the early days of the CIA, projectnames were at the whim of their creators, and not the results of acomputer-generated random search among a classified dictionary as they are now.Thus, project names usually had some meaning attached to them. (For instance,when Allen Dulles was put in charge of the CIA’s mind control project he changedthe name BLUEBIRD to ARTICHOKE, since (according to Gordon Thomas)13[../Text/ch05.html#filepos892989] he was fond of the vegetable. It was,according to John Marks, CIA security chief Sheffield Edwards who decided tocall the project—a program for exploring the uses of hypnosis and other means toprotect Agency personnel from enemy psychic penetration—BLUEBIRD. Why, then, didhe choose the name BLUEBIRD for the first-ever CIA mind control project, theforerunner of the more infamous MK-ULTRA?At the time, the US Navy had its own truth serum operation, called ProjectCHATTER, begun in 1947. CHATTER seems a more appropriate project name, since itsgoal was to make prisoners talk. Thus, we are still faced with what appears tobe a minor mystery: why BLUEBIRD?There is a phrase which is perhaps not used so much these days as it was in thetender years of the twentieth century: “the blue bird of happiness.” What manypeople do not realize—and did not realize even then—was that this term had itsorigins in a play and a novel by the Belgian Nobel Prize-winning author anddramatist, Maurice Maeterlinck (1862-1949). Maeterlinck was surrounded by theSymbolist movement (forerunners of the Surrealists) in fin-de-siécle France, andwas a friend of Sar Peladan, a noted Rosicrucian of the day. Indeed, Maeterlinckwas something of a mystic himself and a firm believer in occult phenomena, ashis other writings such as The Other World (1942) amply demonstrate. He was alsoa keen observer of nature and natural phenomena, in The Life of the Bee (1901),in which the concept of the “meme” is introduced to a wider audience (after itscreation by a relatively-unknown German psychologist—Richard Sauder—yearsbefore, the same psychologist who created the “engram,” made famous by L. RonHubbard). His writings were very popular in Europe, being a mixture of theprofound with the childlike, such as his most famous work The Blue Bird (1909).In this play, first performed in the Russian language in Moscow on September 30,1908 and later in English in London and New York, two children set off on asearch for the Blue Bird of Happiness. This search leads them on manyadventures—a kind of initiatic quest for the Grail—and the author was startledto realize that many of the motifs of Maeterlinck’s play are repeated in theCIA’s search for a Manchurian Candidate, a search that began with ProjectBLUEBIRD. It is this strange set of correspondences that leads the author to theopinion that Sheffield Edwards’s agenda itself was more profound than simply asearch for a truth serum or a psychological defense against it, or that at leastEdwards understood the implications of what he had set out to do in BLUEBIRD. (Afurther search through Maeterlinck’s works reveals an even more sinister aspect,which will be discussed later.)The story, which begins on Christmas Eve, involves two children—Tyltyl and hisyounger sister Mytyl—who set out on a quest to find the Blue Bird of Happiness.Impoverished children of a woodcutter, who live across from a great house withvery rich children, they understand that they are too poor to receive Christmaspresents that year. They go to sleep with the lamp out. Then, in the middle ofthe night, a light shines through their house from outside, the lamp lightsitself, and the children awake. (It is like a scene from Close Encounters of theThird Kind, similar in detail to descriptions of UFO landings.) There is a knockat the door, and an old woman—who later introduces herself as the FairyBerylune—asks them if they have “the grass that sings, or the bird that isblue.” It appears that Berylune has a sick daughter who will not get well unlessthe Blue Bird of Happiness is found. The children, eager to help, then set offon a quest for the mysterious Bird… and to visit their dead grandparents, withthe Fairy’s help. In order to visit the dead, however, they have to pass throughthe Land of Memory which is on the way to the Blue Bird.Tyltyl is given a magic hat. On this hat is a diamond, set squarely in thecenter. If he presses it, he will see “the Soul of Things”; if he turns it tothe right, he sees the past; to the left, the future; and as long as he wearsthe hat, it is invisible.Those who read Eastern mysticism will no doubt grasp at once that the diamond isthe “adamantine substance” and its position on the hat is a reference to theThird Eye, which, when opened, gives the devotee access to secret informationand occult powers. The search for the Blue Bird will give Tyltyl these powers ashe walks through the Land of Memory, the Palace of the Night, a Graveyard, andan enchanted Forest, meeting his dead grandparents on the way. Eventually, ofcourse, the children arrive back at their home on Christmas morning where theydiscover that the Blue Bird of Happiness has been there all along: Maeterlinck’shomely moral, which was embraced by many at the time. Few sought to delve anydeeper into the tale to discover the esoteric elements of necromancy andtreasure-quest. That children—virgins—are the ideal seers according to theoccult texts of the Middle Ages (the ones consulted by Joseph Smith, AleisterCrowley, Jack Parsons, L. Ron Hubbard, et al.) goes unmentioned. The moral isuplifting and spiritual, conservative and charming. A fairy tale replete withtalking animals and trees, and kindly grandparents, suitable for children andadults alike. The quest itself, though, is enlightening for other reasons.The Land of Memory, of course, was the target of the BLUEBIRD project: to enterthat Land in another person’s mind, to go through the drawers, rearrange thefurniture, and leave unnoticed. Once the Korean War started, and American POWsbegan making bizarre, pro-Communist statements after a mysterious sojourn inManchuria, the world was introduced to the concept of “brainwashing,” andBLUEBIRD took on enormous importance. If the Communists could alter theconsciousness of American soldiers, then the War took on a completely differentnature: it became a war of culture against culture, of atheism versus religion,of race against race, of Darkness against Light. This was a war not to be foughtby bullets alone; psychological warfare operations were ramped up at the sametime as BLUEBIRD went into full swing, and what William Sargant would later(1957) call “The Battle for the Mind” had begun.The innocent tale of Tyltyl and Mytyl must have ignited some deeperunderstanding on the part of Sheffield Edwards. In 1940, Maeterlinck and hiswife had fled to America after a brief sojourn in Portugal during the early daysof the war. It was here, for a publication called the American Magazine ofJanuary 1941 that Maeterlinck wrote “The Blue Bird Found Again.” In it, hewrites, “They sought the blue bird of happiness throughout the worlds of theliving and the dead—for surely, they thought, so great a prize as this cannotexist in any save a far, strange land. It was only when they returned, defeatedin their search, that they discovered the blue bird—where it had been all thetime, where they had never noticed it, since they had been seeing it every day.”14 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos893452]It was from far, strange lands—Communist Hungary, Communist Manchuria—that thesearch for the blue bird had been born. And Sheffield Edwards was determined tobring that search right back home. Everyone in the West in the pre-War years hadknown of Maeterlinck’s creation, even if they had not read or heard of any ofhis other, more obscure, works, or of his studies of astrology, psychicphenomena, and mysticism. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1911, largelyon the strength of The Blue Bird, and he fled to the United States from Europein the same year as Hans Habe, another famous novelist. Yet, it is the author’scontention that Edwards was more familiar with The Blue Bird than simply hearingthe term tossed around as a metaphor for an ideal state of mind. Maeterlinck’sdescription of the Land of Memory had to strike deep resonances in the minds ofthe BLUEBIRD team as they embarked on their search for a key to the mysteries ofhuman consciousness. For it was in Maeterlinck’s play (and later a novelizedform, published by esoteric groups in the US and Europe) that the search forhappiness—for the Blue Bird—is linked to the Land of Memory, to the Palace ofNight, and the source of Truth.In the Land of Memory—a strange land enshrouded in mist and dark-ness—the twoseekers find their grandparents, long deceased. Their grandparents tell them,The last time you were here, let me see, when was it?… It was on All Hallow’s,when the church bells were ringing…> —Act II, Scene 2 “The Land of Memory,” The Blue BirdAll Hallow’s, of course, is the Day of the Dead. They find a Blue Bird, but whenthey return from the Land of Memory the bird has turned completely black. Onlythe first “trial” has taken place, and Tyltyl and Mytyl have much farther to go.The Palace of Night is somewhat more eerie and forbidding than even the Land ofMemory. Night is depicted as a kind of angel, a Dark Lady with wings in place ofarms. “Her beauty, built up of peace and repose, possessed the secret ofSilence...” 15 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos893931]When Tyltyl stands before her,she thinks, “What! A Man’s son coming to her palace! And, perhaps, with the helpof the magic diamond, discovering her secrets!”16[../Text/ch05.html#filepos894217]The strange juxtaposition of “Man’s son” withthe Palace of Night, a magic diamond, and the discovery of the secret which wasthe aim of BLUEBIRD makes one think immediately of that compelling line in EdSanders’ study of Charles Manson: “If the Pentagon ever formulates the Mansonsecret, the world’s in trouble.” 17 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos894503]That thereare other bizarre resonances between Manson and BLUEBIRD will become obviouslater.The Palace of Night is the domain of Ghosts, Sickness and Wars. One goesdirectly from the Land of Memory to the Palace of Night, from unlocking thesecrets of the memory to communing with the dead, controlling sickness andbecoming victorious in war. Some readers may protest that the author’s readingof what is, after all, a fairy story is too poetic, and that he is taking aninordinate amount of license with the material; the author would protest thatthere seems no other reason for calling the CIA’s mind control program BLUEBIRDif it was not in reference to the Maeterlinck play, and that—consciously orunconsciously—the doctors of the mind control program were following virtuallythe same agenda as our fictional hero, Tyltyl. BLUEBIRD, and its associatedprograms such as MK-ULTRA and OFTEN, became involved in all aspects of behaviormodification, hypnosis, drug-induced psychological states, the creation ofamnesia, and studies of the paranormal, including ESP and mediumship. The Landof Memory and the Palace of Night were both amply represented in the USGovernment’s mind control programs.Tyltyl finds a great door set in the rear of the Palace of Night, and is told hemust never open it, that great dangers await those who rush in and that no onewho enters that room ever returns to the land of the living. Tyltyl, who ischarged with the sacred quest of finding the Blue Bird, finally decides to openthe door. When he does so, he sees a beautiful garden, a waterfall, manywonderful things and… thousands of blue birds. He tries to grab as many as hecan, and when he takes them out of the room they turn to corpses in his arms.They cannot stand the light of day.The Blue Bird, the real one, the only one that can live in the light of day, ishidden here, among the blue birds of the dreams that live on the rays of themoon and die as soon as they set eyes on the sun.> —Act III, Scene I: “The Palace of Night,” The Blue BirdHe must continue his quest, leaving the Palace of Night for his nextdestination, the Palace of Luxury. Here, he is confronted by a scene ofoutrageous depravity, as fat beings eat, drink, laugh and carouse, beatific intheir willful ignorance. As always, however, Tyltyl—with his magic diamond—cansee things as they really are, and by pressing the diamond he perceives thatthese beings are miserable fools and, thus exposed, they retreat to theMiseries, a special place from whence they may never return. Of course, the CIAspecializes in “seeing things as they really are,” looking behind the curtain,behind the façade, and their entire program may be seen as Tyltyl’s diamond:they put the magic diamond to use to see the human mind as it really is, tostrip away a human being’s conscious defenses so that everything, everysecret—even highly classified government secrets that could cost the lives ofmany—would be revealed.From the Palace of Luxury, Tyltyl proceeds to the Kingdom of the Future. This iswhere he finds a land filled with children who are not yet born, dressedcompletely in blue and like little scientists. They are occupied with theinventions that they will produce once they have been born on earth. However,Tyltyl—as a living person—is not allowed in this Kingdom, which is under therulership of Time. Secretly, he passes through the Kingdom, learning of the newadvances in science, technology, agriculture and the like, finds the Blue Bird,and begins to leave, when Time discovers him and attacks him. Frightened, Tyltylreleases the Blue Bird, and once again it flies away.From the Kingdom of the Future, then, to the Graveyard.This is much like any other cemetery, with tombstones and grass and silence. Atmidnight, he is to use his magic diamond once again to see the Dead. In themidst of the darkness and impending horror, a clock in the distance chimes thehour. Tyltyl presses the diamond, frightened but willing to face the Dead as thenext in his series of trials before he can capture the Blue Bird.But instead of ghostly figures in shrouds and clanking chains, the scenechanges. The tombs open, but instead of ghoulish entities only flowers emerge.They had thought that ugly skeletons would rise from the earth and run afterthem. They had imagined all sorts of terrible things. And then, in the presenceof the Truth, they saw that all they had been told was a story and that deathdoes not exist. 18 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos894958]The motto of the CIA, of course: “You shall know the Truth, and the Truth willset you free.”The poignant last lines of this section—in the novelization of The Blue Bird—are“There are no dead! There are no dead!” (The family of the late Dr. Frank J.Olson may disagree, of course. As one of the many martyrs of the CIA’s mindcontrol efforts, his sacrifice has become a rallying point for those who fearthe CIA’s arsenal of psy-war and behavior modification weapons. His story willfollow soon.)From the Graveyard, Tyltyl wanders into the Forest. Oddly, the creatures of theForest fear Tyltyl and his efforts to find the Blue Bird and, in theaccomplishment of his quest, reveal all of the secrets he has learned. Theyconspire to kill him.We must now decide, in order to avoid reprisals, which form of execution will bethe most practical, the easiest, the quickest and the safest, which will leavethe fewest accusing traces when Man finds the little bodies in the forest…> —Act III, Scene II, “The Forest,” The Blue BirdDuring the hero’s quest for the Blue Bird, he has been accompanied by variousother creatures who have been observing him from a distance. These are variouslya Cat, a Dog, Bread, Sugar, Fire, etc. Many of these creatures—most especiallythe Cat—fear for their lives should Tyltyl be successful. In addition, the Fairyhas warned some of them: “All those who accompany the two children will die atthe end of the journey.” 19 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos895258]> The Cat, however, is having none of it:> “The idiots,” she thought, “have very nearly spoiled the whole thing by> foolishly throwing themselves at the Fairy’s feet, as though they were guilty> of a crime. It is better to rely on one’s self alone. In my cat-life, all our> training is founded on suspicion. I can see that it is just the same in the> life of men. Those who confide in others are only betrayed. It is better to> keep silent and to be treacherous one’s self.” 20> [../Text/ch05.html#filepos895544]At the risk of belaboring the point, might one say that the above quotationcould be the personal motto of men like Richard Helms, E. Howard Hunt, or eventhe late czar of MK-ULTRA, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb? Loners all, desperately privatemen who guarded the secrets of the nation and the secrets of their lives withequal passion, since the two were often so inextricably intertwined, theirtraining was certainly “founded on suspicion.” The above words could also betheir reaction to the spectacle of the Watergate hearings or those of the HouseIntelligence Sub-Committee on Assassinations, where some of the intelligenceagents threw themselves at the feet of the Senators, “as though they were guiltyof a crime” and “nearly spoiled the whole thing.”In the story, the Cat leads Tyltyl into a trap in the forest, where he is setupon by the trees and the animals and has to fight for his life. He is saved inthe last minute by Light, who warns him—apropos of Cat and the other animals andtrees—that “man is alone against all in this world. Never forget that.” 21[../Text/ch05.html#filepos895830] Not exactly an environmentalist message!Finally, the Leave-Taking occurs, as the hour has grown late and the twochildren, Tyltyl and his younger sister Mytyl, must return to their cottage toawaken on Christmas morning. They have not found the Blue Bird, and are indespair. What is more, they must say goodbye to all the animals and othercreatures that accompanied them on their quest. The Cat has the last word of theanimals, and says, “I love you both as much as you deserve,”22[../Text/ch05.html#filepos896117] which could be the cynical perspective of someof the people whose histories we cover in these pages.The children return to their cottage miraculously as the clock strikes eighto’clock on Christmas morning. This is the Awakening, a constant theme withMaeterlinck which is repeated in The Betrothal, his sequel to The Blue Bird. Ofcourse, when they awaken, the children realize that the Blue Bird has been intheir home all along.The author has taken this much time with Maeterlinck’s work in order to presenthis case that the selection of the project name for the CIA’s first-ever mindcontrol program was deliberate and held a certain degree of relevance for theinitial team of scientists and spies that made up the BLUEBIRD team. Like Tyltyland Mytyl in the story, they were on a sacred quest that would lead them intohumanity’s deepest secrets; by delving into the universal, macrocosmic secretsof the human mind, they hoped to uncover the specific, microcosmic secrets oftheir enemies. As above, so below.Yet, Tyltyl and Mytyl were innocents; they were virgin children, morallyspotless, on an initiatic journey in the company of Light. The men of BLUEBIRD,and later ARTICHOKE and MK-ULTRA, could hardly be considered in the same way.From the point of view of the ancient mystery religions whose quest they wereimitating, they were plumbing the depths of the Abyss without having undergone aperiod of purification; thus their sins—their personal, private, specificsins—would come to haunt them in the days and weeks and years that would follow,soiling their reputations and forbidding them entry to the Inner Temple. FrankOlson was one of these: a man who had confronted his own personal demons, whohad seen the hideous results of his work in the desperate eyes of his victims,and who wanted to be shriven, to be forgiven. Perhaps alone of all hiscolleagues, he realized that what he was cooperating in was heinous and hewanted out. Unfortunately, Dr. Gottlieb had other plans for Frank Olson. Dr.Olson was “initiated” at the hands of Gottlieb before he was spiritually ready,when his soul was sick and when hallucinations of terror were his constantcompanions.His was the first sacrifice of these cynical Masters. His blood was spilled onthe concrete outside a New York hotel. Like the Tarot trump, TheLightning-Struck Tower, the story of Frank Olson has become an icon, anarchetype of sinister forces and the destruction they wreak on the guilty andthe innocent alike. It is also a very real, literal story of espionage, mindcontrol and politics—a terrifying case that may well lead to the dismantling orreorganization of America’s intelligence establishmentTHE TOWER STRUCK BY GOD> What are you doing in that corner? You look like a pack of conspirators!> —Maeterlinck, The Blue Bird 23 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos896404]The story of Frank Olson has been known for quite some time, but only in bitsand pieces. It is well-known, for instance, that he was a scientist who wasgiven LSD without his knowledge, and who became psychotic and who died after aplunge from a hotel room window. It is well-known that his death as a result ofan unethical drug experiment had not been revealed to anyone—including hisfamily—for twenty years, until the Watergate era when some of the details of theMK-ULTRA program leaked out and hearings were held to determine just exactlywhat had gone on then. It is also well-known that the CIA paid damages to theOlson family, and hoped the whole thing would just go away.What is not well-known, and what has only come to light recently, is that Dr.Olson was working on chemical and biological warfare weapons at his laboratoryat Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland, work that involved the search for drugs thatwould unlock the human memory bank and help to create the perfect assassin, the“Manchurian Candidate”; that he doubted the morality of his work when confrontedwith some “test subjects” at a secret base in the United Kingdom (according toGordon Thomas, German prisoners of war); that he was a colleague of suchesteemed psychological warfare experts as William Sargant, who was worried thatOlson would blow the whistle on the programs. He was faced with the horror ofwhat he was doing, and began to request reassignment. He was definitelyreassigned.Most of the following information can be found on the website of the Frank OlsonLegacy Project, which is under the stewardship of Dr. Olson’s son, Eric Olson,who is a psychiatrist who studied under Dr. Robert Jay Lifton. Dr. Lifton is theauthor of numerous works concerned with the malicious use of science bygovernments, one of the classics being his work on thought-reform in China andanother his definitive study of the Nazi doctors. 24[../Text/ch05.html#filepos896689]Frank Olson is born in Wisconsin in the year 1910. He will receive his Ph.D. inbiochemistry in 1942, from the University of Wisconsin. In 1943 he is asked tojoin the staff at the newly-formed Camp Detrick in Frederick, Maryland. The waris on, and the Army has created Camp Detrick to be its center for CBW, orChemical-Biological Warfare. The man in charge of the science at Camp Detrick isFrank Olson’s mentor from the University of Wisconsin, Dr. Ira Baldwin.In 1948, Dr. Baldwin issues “Special CBW Operations” for the War Department, inwhich he advises a new approach for chemical and biological weapons strategy,the use of CBW weapons as sabotage. By 1950, with the outbreak of the KoreanWar, the scientists and would-be saboteurs at Camp Detrick get serious. TheSpecial Operations Division (SOD) of the Army is created under Dr. John Schwab,a group that runs parallel to CIA’s Technical Services Staff (TSS) under Dr.Sidney Gottlieb. It was SOD that was responsible for the bacteriological testswith the bacterium Serratia marcescens over San Francisco in the 1950s, whichmay have led to the death of Edward J. Nevin and possibly more, since at leastten others were hospitalized at the same time with the same symptoms. 25[../Text/ch05.html#filepos897404]Between 1949 and 1969, citizens of the UnitedStates were the unwitting subjects in 239 separate cases of open-air biologicalattack simulations; most used chemicals that were inert and harmless, but insome cases live bacteria were used, such as in San Francisco in September1950.26 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos898224] The Army has defended itself, sayingthat these tests were necessary in order to understand the dispersal patterns ofbiological agents on the civilian population should the enemy (in those days,the Chinese and the Russians) attack the country with anthrax or other virulenttoxins. It was the Cold War, and such measures were thought urgently necessaryin order to defend the country; the question is, of course, where does oneeventually draw the line between what actions are defensible in time of war andwhat are not? With the Nuremberg Trials, we thought we knew.It is a critical period for Dr. Olson. He begins traveling extensively inEurope, and can be found in France, England, Norway and Morocco in July 1953alone. Until that time, everything seemed to be okay with the friendly, upbeatscientist, but by August 1953—a month after the European trip—things begin totake a tragic turn. According to the Frank Olson Legacy website, “Frank Olsonvacations with his family at the family summer house in the AdirondackMountains. He is observed by his sister-in-law reading the Bible and isapparently going through a period of profound soul-searching andself-examination.”Two months later, and the turmoil in Frank Olson’s soul is exposed for the worldto see. Unfortunately, he was involved in heavily classified work for both theUS Army and the CIA. The exposure of Frank’s anguish meant the exposure of thegovernment’s secrets. As below, so above.26November 19, 1953 is the date of the infamous Deep Creek Rendezvous. Here, at anisolated cabin in the Maryland forest, nine persons meet to discuss variousprojects they are working on at Camp Detrick. This group consists of five SODpersonnel and four CIA/TSS personnel. Dr. Sidney Gottlieb is present, as well asDr. Robert Lashbrook. The unsuspecting SOD people are dosed with LSD in theirCointreau. Dr. Olson receives about 70 micrograms of the potent hallucinogen(according to one report, 10,000 micrograms according to another). Who knows howmuch? 500 micrograms would be the average dose. Thus 70 “mikes” is obviouslyquite small, and 10,000 mikes would be the equivalent of 20 doses. The partyturns bizarre and raucous, and breaks up around 1 A.M. with Dr. Olson in aparanoid state, running around shouting, “You’re all a bunch of thespians!” Theauthor takes this to be a reference to their acting a role, i.e., performingduplicitously.The next morning, Dr. Olson complains he had a wakeful night, and his strange,depressed mood is attributed to a kind of psychedelic hangover. He returns homeand tells his wife he wants to quit his job at Detrick and become… a dentist. Heis overwrought, deeply shaken, and tells her he has made a “terrible mistake.”On Monday, the first work day after the Rendezvous, Olson tells hissupervisor—one Lt. Colonel Vincent Ruwet—that he wants to quit. Ruwet scornsOlson’s plea, telling him instead that he is doing a great job and should remainat his post.The next day, Olson goes to work as usual but is brought home at 10:00 A.M. by adriver from SOD. The family is told that Olson might become violent and harmthem, and thus should go to Manhattan to get treatment.The psychiatric treatment planned for Olson is unusual, to say the least. In thefirst place, the “therapist” was Dr. Abramson, a Mount Sinai-connected CIAdoctor whose specialty was immunology, and who had no training or credentials atall in psychotherapy, psychology or psychiatry. It seems his only qualificationwas that he was CIA, with a background in LSD research. Why Olson had to betaken to New York for “therapy” is also unrevealed. There had to be CIA-approvedpsychiatrists closer to home, in Washington or Baltimore; but Abramson had beenone of those involved with the CIA’s Technical Services Staff and thus could beexpected to know what was at stake and to stonewall the local authorities; also,according to the CIA’s internal memo on the events, he was the only one who hadexperience with LSD experimentation.If we look at a book published in 1967, LSD, Man and Society, we will see manyreferences to Abramson’s work in the footnotes to what is a series of articlesbased on a March 1967 symposium held at the chapel of Wesleyan University on theeffects of LSD on society, religion, the laws, behavior, etc. Most of thosereferences are to papers published in the years immediately following the deathof Olson. For instance in 1955, Abramson published an article in the Journal ofPsychology entitled “Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD25) as an adjunct topsychotherapy.” Suddenly, Abramson was an authority. He followed this up in 1960with a contribution to a Josiah Macy work, Transactions of a Conference,entitled “The use of LSD in psychotherapy,” and again in 1967 as editor of theBobbs-Merrill publication The Use of LSD in Psychotherapy and Alcoholism. Soperhaps Dr. Abramson “got religion” after the death of Olson and started tospecialize in the study of psychotherapy professionally?Also in LSD, Man and Society is an article by Murray E. Jarvik, “The BehavioralEffects of Psychotogens,” in which he references a study undertaken by him, Dr.Abramson and Dr. Margaret Ferguson in 1953 (the year of Olson’s death) at Mt.Sinai, where LSD was given to test subjects and a questionnaire prepared toevaluate the effects. Ironically, this same paper references similar work beingdone by Isbell “and his collaborators” in Lexington, Kentucky (in what wasactually a prison setting, where subjects were given massive doses of LSD overlong periods of time). We would not find out for about ten years that these LSDprojects of Isbell, Abramson, et al. were underwritten by the CIA and were partof MK-ULTRA.Needless to say, at this stage of LSD research by Abramson, his “therapy” wasuseless. At one point in the process, Olson was taken to see the CIA’s very ownmagician and illusionist, John Mulholland, a famous stage magician who had beenassisting the CIA with the development of techniques for surreptitiously puttingchemical or bacteriological agents into people’s drinks, among other things.Olson did not like the magician, or the environment, or whatever was going onbetween Mulholland and Olson’s CIA handler, Dr. Robert Lashbrook (SidneyGottlieb’s assistant). Olson wanted to leave, and Lashbrook, Olson and his bossRuwet left for their hotel.That night, Olson leaves his hotel room in the middle of the night, a room heshares with his boss, Ruwet. At this time, he engages in activity which futureinvestigators would find very strange.He wanders the streets and subways of New York, shredding his identification,getting rid of everything on him that can be traced. He returns and sits in thehotel lobby, wearing a trenchcoat and hat.This scene is usually described as evidence of Olson’s deteriorating mentalstate; however, to the trained eye, it looks more like classic espionagetradecraft. Olson was in danger of being caught behind enemy lines, so he didwhat agents are trained to do under the circumstances: get rid of identificationand anything that could be used to blow the cover of the operation and endangerlives.Frank Olson was behind enemy lines. He was in the United States of America inNovember 1953; the enemy agents were from the CIA; and his death at their handswas imminent.November 26, 1953. Thanksgiving Day. Olson and Lashbrook are still in New York.Olson is afraid to go home, according to the CIA reports. So he and Lashbrookhave Thanksgiving dinner, sadly, at a Horn and Hardart automat.The next day, the always helpful if somewhat misguided Dr. Abramson visits Olsonat the hotel and gives the unfortunate man a cocktail made of a dose of Nembutaland a glass of bourbon. (The “use of LSD in psychotherapy and alcoholism”? DidDr. Olson have to fill out a questionnaire?) Needless to say, this is not arecommended combination for anyone; but then, Abramson didn’t have anypsychiatric training. Perhaps to immunologists a Nembutal/ bourbon cocktail is“the right thing to do.”What happens next that night has been reported in several different ways, and bythe same sole witness, Dr. Robert Lashbrook. At one time, he says that he wokeup to see Frank Olson standing in the middle of the hotel room. Olson, from themiddle of a very small hotel room, then rushes across the floor, over a radiatorand through a closed window to plummet ten floors to the street. At anothertime, Lashbrook says he was asleep when Olson went through the window. In anyevent, Lashbrook’s story has always been that Olson committed suicide.The hotel in question was the Statler, which is now the Hotel Pennsylvania, onSeventh Avenue across from Penn Station and the new Madison Square Garden. Therooms at the Statler were quite small. The radiator was under the window. Thewindow was small. There was not enough distance available in the room to permita fully-grown man to work up enough momentum to crash through a closed window,moreover a window with the shade drawn. It also doesn’t make sense that a personwould try to commit suicide in that fashion. At the very least, he would openthe window first. At the very least, he would simply go out the window and fallto the ground. By running at full tilt at a closed window all Olson could havehoped to accomplish was a dismal failure, with enough sound and fury to awakenthe somnolent Lash-brook and defeat the whole purpose of the suicide attempt.When the police get to Lashbrook’s room, they find him sitting on the toiletseat in his underwear. According to CIA memoranda, he first phoned SidneyGottlieb to tell him what happened, then called Ruwet, then called the frontdesk, and then called Abramson, in that order.27[../Text/ch05.html#filepos899338] Abramson at first told Lashbrook he wantednothing to do with the situation, but then later relented (under what type ofpersuasion?) and agreed to assist Lashbrook. The local NYPD detectives could getnothing out of Lashbrook, except that Olson had suffered from ulcers, and soonCIA field agents from the Security Division descended on the city to quash whatlooked like was turning into a homicide investigation.And there matters stood until the Rockefeller Commission and the investigationinto illegal domestic activities of the CIA more than twenty years later.Unfortunately, the only clues we have to Frank Olson’s state of mind in the daysleading up to his death come from CIA or SOD personnel, the very people onewould expect to present cover stories and outright lies. Obviously, nothing thatLashbrook said can be trusted, as he gave at least two different stories aboutwhat happened that night in the Hotel Statler. Nothing that Sidney Gottlieb saidcan be trusted at all. And the one person who may have been able to share sometruth with the Olson family—Lt. Colonel Vincent Ruwet, whom Olson’s wifeconsidered a family friend—was Olson’s boss and in a tricky position vis-à-visOlson, the Army, and the CIA. After all, Frank’s work at Detrick involveddeveloping new ways to deliver biological agents. Like anthrax.According to former State Department official and freelance journalist JohnMarks:After all, the officials at TSS and SOD worked intimately together, and theyshared one of the darkest secrets of the Cold War: that the U.S. governmentmaintained the capability—which it would use at times—to kill or incapacitateselected people with biological weapons.28 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos899681]The arsenal of weapons available to TSS and SOD under their working codenameMK-NAOMI included shellfish toxins, botulinum, Staphyloccus enterotoxin,Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis, and anthrax. Dr. Olson’s specialty was thedevelopment of aerosol sprays and other airborne delivery systems for theagents. During Frank Olson’s tenure at SOD, one of the Fort Detrick employeesactually died of exposure to anthrax. Frank told his wife it was pneumonia. Thesecrets at Detrick were some of the most closely guarded in the nation; if theworld discovered just what went on at Detrick—and at Edgewood Arsenal, whichspecialized in the chemical half of CBW weaponry—the outcry would be loud andfurious. Lt. Colonel Ruwet could be expected to maintain operational secrecy,and if Olson was killed by the CIA—as the evidence now suggests was thecase—then one would not have heard it from Ruwet.That left Lashbrook, one of the men who dosed the party at Deep Creek Lodge;Gottlieb, whose operation it was; and Abramson, a CIA doctor who had worked withLSD for several years and was evidently the only medical man within a threehundred mile radius of Frederick, Maryland who could be expected to keep hismouth shut. No one was about to get a clear picture from any of these men. Whatis known from a source not at CIA or SOD is that shortly before his death, FrankOlson phoned his wife from New York and—according to her—he sounded much better,almost his old self.A few hours later, he was dead.If he was, indeed, murdered by the CIA, what was the motive? Most researcherswould claim that it was to keep him quiet about what was going on at Detrick,that the LSD experience had unhinged him, and that he was about to become asecurity risk. According to the late Colonel Ruwet, Olson had asked to beallowed to quit his post. Yet, he was not allowed to do so. Ruwet worked hard tokeep him in the program, but when it seemed Olson was going round the bend,Ruwet—a Lt. Colonel in the US Army for which both he and Olson worked—did not goto the Army for help but directly to the CIA. Aware of the projects they wereworking on, Ruwet obviously did not trust the Army doctors, who were presumablynot cleared for the classified information in Olson’s head. By handing hisfriend Frank Olson over to the CIA, he was handing him over to his executioners.Gordon Thomas is considered by many to be an expert on espionage matters. Hisbook, Journey Into Madness, published in 1989, is an excellent update andcompanion volume to Marks’ The Search for the Manchurian Candidate. His otherworks on the Mossad, and on the doomed ship full of Jews unsuccessfully escapingthe Holocaust—The Voyage of the Damned—were published to critical acclaim. Yet,it wasn’t until 1998 that Thomas felt he was able to communicate to FrankOlson’s son—Eric—the story behind the cover story.Journey Into Madness begins with the story of veteran CIA field agent WilliamBuckley, who was taken hostage by the Hizbollah in Beirut in March 1984. Buckleywas tortured and killed by an Arab physician, one Dr. Aziz al-Abub, the Arabworld’s answer to Dr. Mengele (or Dr. Gottlieb) and an expert in the use ofdrugs in interrogations. What is important to our story at the moment is thatThomas was a friend of Buckley’s and had also worked with that icon of mindcontrol research, Dr. William Sargant (Battle for the Mind). From them both hewas able to extract the story of what really happened to Frank Olson. In fact,according to Thomas, the Olson murder is taught as a case study to Mossad agentsin Israel! 29 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos899977]According to Thomas, during their acquaintance Sargant was a consultant to theBritish Secret Intelligence Service, or MI5 and MI6, “largely because of hiswork in the eliciting of confessions by the Soviets.” Sargant revealed to Thomasthat he had visited CIA headquarters and met with Gottlieb, Richard Helms, Dr.Lashbrook, Dr. Ewan Cameron (whom we will discuss later on) …and Dr. FrankOlson.Gottlieb and Olson also visited London and Porton Down, which is Britain’sversion of Fort Detrick and Edgewood Arsenal. Later on, Olson went to Englandseveral times himself, and met with Sargant on many occasions. In the summer of1953—the period discussed above—Olson told Sargant he was in Europe to meet withGottlieb and a “CIA team.” Thomas at this point tantalizes us with thestatement, “Sargant was satisfied that the CIA team was doing similar work thatMI6 were conducting in Europe—executing without trial known Nazis, especially SSmen.” (If so, this makes for an interesting additional chapter to the history ofthat war, but there is no independent corroboration of this assertion.)Whatever the facts of the case, when Olson returned from his trip to Europe(which included Norway and West Berlin, according to a photocopy of hispassport) he had changed. According to Sargant (via Thomas), Olson had seen theresults of his work firsthand, on actual human “subjects” who were being killedby the very weapons Olson himself was developing at Detrick. The horror andensuing guilt led Olson to question his faith in the United States governmentand his faith in himself as a human being.Sargant reported this to his superiors at MI6, recommending that Olson no longerbe permitted to visit their CBW facility. This report was then, presumably,passed on in some form to the CIA hierarchy as a matter of course, and stepswere taken to permanently remove Olson’s security clearance… with extremeprejudice.According once again to Sargant-via-Thomas, Gottlieb had been working withvarious other drugs besides LSD, including one which could induce depressionleading to suicide. It is possible that Olson’s Cointreau had been spiked withsomething other than the straight LSD given to the rest of the test subjectsthat evening in November. It is also possible that the visit in New York withAbramson and, eventually, with magician John Mulholland involved furthersurreptitious doses. We have only Abramson’s word, for instance, that Olson wasgiven a dose of Nembutal that day in New York. It could have been anything. Andalcohol is a known depressant; might bourbon have accelerated the action ofGottlieb’s wonder drug?William Buckley confirmed Thomas’ suspicion that Olson had been killed by theCIA, and that Helms and Gottlieb had covered it up and lied about it ever since.Others have come forward in the past ten years or so, some anonymously and somefor the record, with bits and pieces of the puzzle. The picture that emerges isnothing short of murder.Eric Olson had his father autopsied in June 1994. As if to confirm hissuspicions over fifty years after his father’s death, there was no sign of thecrash through the hotel room window on Frank Olson’s body: no cuts, no scrapes,nothing. The coffin had been closed during the funeral on advice of the CIA,since the crash would have disfigured the man’s face. There was no evidence ofthis at all once the body was exhumed. Further, there was a suspicious bruise onOlson’s head which suggested that he had been knocked unconscious. He could thenhave been thrown from the hotel room window.The CIA’s story falls apart completely with this additional evidence. If Olsonwas murdered, then the only suspect is Dr. Robert Lashbrook, who was in thehotel room with him when Olson fell ten stories to Seventh Avenue below. Was thedepressant not working fast enough? Had Olson threatened to blow the whistle oncovert CBW operations in the United States and Europe? No matter how one looksat the story today, there is no alternative but to recognize Dr. Frank Olson asa hero and a martyr: a man who was disgusted by his own country’s atrocities inthe aftermath of World War Two, when doctors and scientists—sobered by theNuremberg trials and all they represented—should have known better.As a strange sidebar to this case, in the days immediately before Olson’s death,his boss Colonel Ruwet had arranged to have him admitted for regular psychiatriccare at Chestnut Lodge Hospital, an appointment that was never kept. Theadmitting physician was one Dr. Robert Gibson. By an odd coincidence (again, oneof many involved in this study) Dr. Gibson was the son of a famous stagemagician, Walter B. Gibson, a “close friend and colleague to John Mulholland,”30 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos900694]and the creator of “The Shadow,” the popularradio character, under the pen name Maxwell Grant. It was while searching forthe traditional meaning of the Tarot trump The Lightning Struck Tower that Irealized I had for many years in my possession a copy of Walter Gibson’s work ondivination, The Complete Illustrated Book of Divination and Prophecy, publishedin 1973, without realizing its significance.Therein, this Trump is described as symbolizing “…disaster, downfall, anddestruction, either physically or in personal affairs.” 31[../Text/ch05.html#filepos901625]The card is depicted as a tower, with one or two people falling from it, as itis struck by lightning (or God) from above. Frank Olson was not the first tofall from a tall building, murdered by his enemies, and he wouldn’t be the last.As for William Sargant himself, we will be examining his contribution to thestudy of mind control and brainwashing as we proceed, but it is worthwhile tonote for the record that he was a close personal friend of Robert Graves, thepoet and scholar who gave the world such classics as I, Claudius and The WhiteGoddess. It was while visiting Graves on the isle of Majorca in the mid-1950s(presumably after Olson’s murder) that Sargant was encouraged by him to completeBattle for the Mind, and indeed that textbook of brainwashing, behaviormodification and mental science actually includes a chapter written by Graveshimself.That this paragon of paganism—whose White Goddess was warmly embraced by ageneration or more of New Agers as a kind of Wiccan bible—should have been onintimate terms with the man who was at the center of the West’s mind controlexperiments (a man who was experimenting on living human beings, a man who alsonumbered poor, murdered Frank Olson as one of his colleagues, and who possiblyratted him out to the Agency) is yet another disturbing nexus point in thisstudy, for these forces that occupy our attention call to themselves whateverthey need, from whatever industry or field, without regard to social niceties,class ties or appropriate acquaintance. What rich material for a novel! ThePoet-Pagan and the Psychiatrist-Spy. Like Arthur Koestler’s The Yogi and theCommissar, such a novel could offer a wealth of contradictions to be resolved inan uneasy truth. The trinity of Olson, Sargant and Graves can be mirrored inParsons, Hubbard and McMurtry, or McMurtry, Crowley and MI5… or Crisman, Arnoldand Shaw… While traditional historians tend to focus on single themes (militarypersonalities seen from the perspective of military matters, for instance, as ifgenerals are as single-minded as their biographers), our view must be at oncebroader and deeper if the history of the twentieth century is to mean anythingto us at all.Because right now not much of it seems to make any sense.History comes across Sheffield Edwards again as one of the CIA officers whovisited former FBI agent and Guy Banister-associate Robert Maheu in 1960, toencourage him to arrange the assassination of Fidel Castro. We will come acrossFred Crisman again as a suspect in the Jim Garrison investigation into theassassination of John F. Kennedy. And we will come across Maurice Maeterlinckagain in the same context, because if Maeterlinck did not actually predict theassassination of President Kennedy, then we must assume that his work providedan inspiration for those who committed the crime itself. And if the latter istrue, then the finger points back towards Sheffield Edwards and all the witchesand warlocks of the Central Intelligence Agency. But first, let us pick up wherewe left off a little while ago, with Charles Manson slouching towards Hollywoodto be born.CEASE TO EXIST> “Me and Charlie… we founded the Family.”> —Dennis WilsonThe Spring of 1967 found Charles Manson making his way down the west coast fromTerminal Island to Los Angeles. He had in prison heard stories about theHippies, free love, and drugs in San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury district, andhad managed to convince a parole officer to let him go up there. After a fewfalse starts, and after meeting Mary Brunner—the first member of the Manson“Family”—Charlie then went back down to Los Angeles to try to meet a recordproducer and get himself a recording contract.Manson had by this time perfected a sort of technique on the guitar, taught tohim by Terminal Island inmate Al Karpis (the last surviving member of the MaBarker gang), and had begun writing his own songs. Manson had also learned thebasics of Scientology from another inmate, Lanier Ramer (or “Raymer”). It wasthat combination—music and Scientology—that comprised the only education he hadof the real world outside prison walls. But it was enough.It was in the Los Angeles area—specifically in Venice—that he met LynetteFromme. Fromme was the eighteen-year-old daughter of an aerospace engineer (whohad coincidentally been in the Army at Randolph Air Base during the war), andshe had had an eclectic childhood, going to school in Southern California withsuch later luminaries as Saturday Night Live’s Phil Hartmann and others whowould one day become famous in the music business. An intelligent, softlyattractive and somewhat ethereal redhead with a penchant for poetry andphilosophy, she suffered a sexually abusive father and a mor-ally-absent mother,running away from home on countless occasions and at one time being remanded forpsychiatric observation.Lynette Fromme was a deeply disturbed young woman who had taught herself toendure tremendous amounts of physical pain; at one point, turning an industrialstaple gun on her arm and shooting staples into herself at three-inch intervals,numb with no expression, like a Hindu devotee at Thaipusam. Manson had alsolearned to cope with physical pain while institutionalized, and fellow inmateshave reported that he could hold a lighted match to his arm and not flinch. Thuson one level the two clearly had a lot in common, and Fromme would later becomeone of Manson’s most prominent “apologists” as the decades passed and Manson’schance for release on parole diminished.On another level, though, one could hardly conceive of two more differentpeople. While Fromme was educated and very literate, fond of Dylan Thomas andErich Fromm, poetry and mysticism, séances and ghost stories, and could quoteMilton in front of the jury at the murder trial, Manson was poorly-educated,barely literate, and street smart from years of petty hustling, pimping,cheating and stealing. Fromme’s background was decidedly uppermiddle-class, andshe had even toured the country while a grade-schooler and star of a singing andacting troupe. Fromme was adored as a young child, while Manson was tolerated atbest, abused at worst. Manson’s background was the type they used to call inthose days “poor white trash” or, at its most euphemistic, “redneck” or“hillbilly.” Manson’s mysticism was largely his own amalgam of Scientology andDale Carnegie, later mixed with a good helping of the Book of Revelations andconvict psychology—an Aleister Crowley manqué. He first dropped acid at aGrateful Dead concert, and from there on he had the ritual mechanism for his ownbrand of spiritual initiation. Manson and Fromme were an accident waiting tohappen.Charlie and Lynette met on the boardwalk at Venice Beach sometime in the springof 1967. (The precise dates, as with much of the Manson story, are unclear.)They connected, Manson virtually reading her mind as she was sitting, miserable,on a bench with her suitcase and nowhere to go. He guessed that she had had afight with her father, and suggested that she go away with him instead. Withonly three weeks left to go of her spring semester in college, she made afateful decision and followed him, leaving family and college behind forever.They made their way north, to San Francisco and Mary Brunner, and from there toMendocino County, where the three lived that summer in and around the small townof Caspar.The summer of 1967 was the “Summer of Love” in San Francisco. Manson had beenenergized by the atmosphere of freedom—including free drugs, free sex, peoplecrashing wherever they could—and the non-judgmental attitudes of the people hemet. He found out that with a glib line, laced with mystical allusions, he couldgo anywhere, do just about anything, and be accepted or even welcomed.That year, Jack Ruby died in prison. Suspected Kennedy assassinationconspirators David Ferrie and Eladio del Valle also died, and Clay Shaw wasarrested in New Orleans. Ouija board sales hit an all-time high at 2.3 millionsold. Ira Levin’s novel of modern-day Satanism in the City of New York,Rosemary’s Baby, was published, and Roman Polanski began work on the filmversion. Sharon Tate was working on the set of Valley of the Dolls, and herprevious film—Eye of the Devil, in which a Wiccan high priest and disciple ofAleister Crowley, Alex Sanders, was a technical consultant—had just beenreleased. And on June 29 of that year, actress Jayne Mansfield was killed in anautomobile accident. Rumors that her death was a decapitation and the result ofa satanic curse were rampant: Mansfield had been seen occasionally at AntonLaVey’s Church of Satan headquarters in San Francisco. Anton LaVey would laterbecome involved in Polanski’s film of Rosemary’s Baby… as a technicalconsultant.While the witches and the satanists found work (if not actual, on-screencredits) as technical consultants in films about the Devil, Charles Manson wasconsulting with some screenwriters on a film about… Jesus.Charles, Lynette Fromme and Mary Brunner were living in the woods of MendocinoCounty when Charlie, hitchhiking one day, was picked up by a Congregationalistminister named Dean Moorehouse. The Reverend Moorehouse is a strange twist tothis already strangely twisted tale, because Moorehouse came to California fromMinot, North Dakota. As we will see later, Minot—a small town of about thirtythousand people and an Air Force base—was the scene of serious and sometimesviolent occult activity that was linked to the Son of Sam murder cases in NewYork a decade later. (It was also where Kenneth Arnold—creator of the term“flying saucer” and involved in the Maury Island affair with FredCrisman—learned to fly.) Charlie struck up a conversation with Moorehouse andconvinced him to visit their place in the woods, where they turned him on toLSD. At that point, Dean Moorehouse became converted to the cause (at leastinsofar as acid was concerned) and introduced Manson, Fromme and Brunner to hiswife and daughter. His daughter, Ruth Ann Moorehouse, became the Family memberknown as Ouisch, who would become involved in the drugging of a prosecutionwitness in Hawaii. At this time it is not known whether there is any moresubstance to the Moorehouse/Minot link than that. However investigativejournalist Maury Terry would later find elements of a drug and prostitutionnetwork shaded with a veneer of ritual Satanism based in Minot, and wouldconnect it to a convicted murderer known as “Manson II,” to the Son of Samkillings in New York, and to the murder of producer Roy Radin in California.32[../Text/ch05.html#filepos902154]When life at Caspar became too much, and they got hassled by the local policefor harboring Ruth Ann, an underage runaway—Charlie telling the booking officerthat he was a minister and that his name was Charles Willis Manson instead ofCharles Milles Manson and thus creating a phrase that he read as Charles Will IsMan’s Son—the three retreated to Los Angeles, where Charlie would meet with someof his old prison friends (something that was happening on a regular basisduring this period; what was discussed is still a mystery, and could have beenanything from chatting about old times to plotting new capers and betterconnections) and finally pick up Patricia Krenwinkle, known as Katie and later,in San Francisco, Susan Atkins, who became Sadie. They moved into a house inTopanga Canyon—close to Malibu—known as the Spiral Staircase, to which they wereintroduced by someone involved in the occult. Some sources have connected thisperson to Abigail Folger, the coffee heiress and eventual Manson Family murdervictim. Folger was involved in various consciousness movements in the area, andit is not unlikely that this would have been the case. She is known to havehelped finance the Straight Theater in San Francisco, where Kenneth Anger wasinvolved in filming his satanically-oriented works, and to have been involvedwith the Himalayan Institute as well as Esalen (where Manson also showed up afew days before the Tate killings). However, this introduces a disturbingelement into the story, because it implies that Charles Manson (and his growingfamily of killers) knew at least one of the murder victims beforehand, and thusgoes to motive.Motive was the most ephemeral aspect of the prosecution’s case against Manson;once they had the satanic and racist elements, the prosecutors looked nofurther. They believed that the victims in the Tate and LaBianca killings wereselected randomly, as part of “Helter Skelter”: an attempt to force a race warbetween whites and blacks. Although this dubious motive satisfied the media’slust for sensationalism and served to paint Charlie and his Dark Angels as thelatest incarnation of Satan and Hitler combined, a look at Charlie’s criminalhistory would tell a different story. As prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi himselfadmits in his book on the case, Helter Skelter, he was surprised by the lack ofviolent crime in Manson’s rap sheet. Manson came across more as a con man andpetty thief than as a lust killer. There were obvious problems with LAPD’sinvestigation of the case too, which is surprising considering how focused themedia was on the sensational crimes. Further, attempts to depict Charles Mansonas a serial killer (notably by the late Joel Norris)33[../Text/ch05.html#filepos902664] are also ill-advised. There is no evidence hekilled anyone until 1968-9 and, in fact, he did not personally murder any of theTate/LaBianca victims, although he was convicted for having ordered theirdeaths. Whatever Charles Manson may be—and he may be many things—a serial killerhe is not, if we look objectively at the available evidence. The murders he didcommit himself were not motiveless crimes, but were each for a specific purpose.Even the Tate murders themselves may have been a device to disguise the realagenda behind some of the other killings, such as those of Leno and RosemaryLaBianca (which may have been related to gambling debts), and of Gary Hinman,and of the attempted murder of drug dealer Bernard Crowe.While keeping his criminal contacts alive and warm, Charlie was still interestedin becoming known as a musician and tried to work the Southern Californiaentertainment network as best he could. He was introduced to Gary Stromberg andCorey Allen, two screenwriters and would-be producers in a small office inUniversal City. They were working on a script about the return of Jesus Christas a black man in America, and Charlie impressed them both with his knowledge ofblack prison slang as well as his insights into religion and spiritual matters.He agreed to work with them one day a week at their office on script ideas andtreatments for what they wanted to call Black Jesus. The project never got offthe ground, but the die had been cast, and Charlie was now a familiar face insome (admittedly bizarre) Hollywood circles from 1967 until his arrest for theTate/LaBianca murders in 1969.There were two people in particular who became involved with Charles Manson andthe rest of his Family. One was the son of actress Doris Day, Terry Melcher, whowas living in the house at 10050 Cielo Drive where the Sharon Tate murders wouldtake place. Melcher was interested in producing records, but, as it turned out,not in producing Manson’s work. A somewhat more enthusiastic promoter of Manson,however, was Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys.People with only a passing knowledge of the Manson case usually don’t realizethat the Beach Boys recorded one of Manson’s songs and released it as the “B”side of their cover of the old Ersel Hickey 1958 hit “Bluebirds Over TheMountain,” a song about lost love. Manson’s song was originally entitled “Ceaseto Exist”—a Scientology reference and not necessarily a homicidal one—but theBoys retitled it “Never Learn Not To Love,” which comes from the song’s lyrics,and changed the line “Cease to Exist” to the more seductive “Cease to Resist.”This song later made it onto the group’s album 20/20 (1969), but by this timethe reference to Charles Manson was deleted.What drew the author’s attention to this nugget of information was the song onthe “A” side of Manson’s single. The title “Bluebirds Over The Mountain” wassuggestive of the CIA mind control operation—even though it had been written bya rockabilly composer from Brighton, New York one night in the mid-1950s—andseemed too synchronistic to ignore. Hickey and Manson were born in the sameyear—1934—and both had problems at home; Manson’s mother was incarcerated forrobbery, while Hickey’s mother was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown. Mansonprobably never knew his father, and Hickey’s father died when the boy was onlyfour years old. Both Manson and Hickey were farmed out to relatives or fosterhomes, spent time in reformatories and ran away from home, and both Manson andHickey were guitar players and songwriters. Hickey’s one and only hit,“Bluebirds Over The Mountain,” then appears on Manson’s one and only songrecorded by a mainstream label (his other music was released on variousunderground, bootleg and private labels after the murders). Is there a reasonwhy Manson’s song was on the flipside of the “Bluebird” cover? Had the CIA’s“bluebirds” escaped? Was Manson a “bluebird,” i.e., a mind control subject, goneamok?> Were there other “synchronicities” to explore?FROM MANCHURIA TO MULHOLLAND DRIVEAnd then, you have told me twenty times over that neither you nor your> people ever deployed such means to pull down an enemy…. No, no, the> people who are near you could never do that…. There is no shadow of> doubt, it was an ambush and an assassination.> —Act I, Scene 3, The Cloud That Lifted, Maurice MaeterlinckManson and his women wound up staying at Dennis Wilson’s home for long periodsof time from the spring to the summer of 1968. Wilson once claimed that he andManson had created the Manson Family, and referred to Manson as “the Wizard.”The other Beach Boys were not so enamored of Manson, and tended to avoid himwhenever they could. Wilson, however, was recently divorced and lived alone inthe house he rented on Sunset Boulevard, and the Manson Family were welcome—ifexpensive— houseguests. Gregg Jakobson, the group’s manager and sometimesongwriter, also found Manson interesting, and they would talk for hours onphilosophical subjects. During this period, Manson and his group treatedWilson’s home as their own, giving things away, wrecking his Mercedes on theroad to their desert commune, and borrowing large sums of money. Wilsonestimated that the friendship with the Manson Family cost him about $100,000 butthat he was the lucky one: he got away with his life. (After the Tate murders,Manson approached Wilson for money, which Wilson refused—although at this timehe did not know that Manson was responsible for the murders—and Mansonthreatened the life of his seven-year-old son, following that up with morethreats on Wilson’s life.)One of the more unusual Family members, though, if only for a short time, wasDeirdre (or “DiDi”) Lansbury, the troubled teenaged daughter of actress AngelaLansbury. Angela Lansbury even went so far as to give DiDi a note that said itwas all right for her to stay with the Manson Family, in case she got hassled bythe police! The author felt the reverberations of this odd piece of trivia,since Angela Lansbury played the role of the evil mind controller in the 1962John Frankenheimer film The Manchurian Candidate, a film starring Frank Sinatra,Lansbury, Laurence Harvey and Khigh Deigh that was pulled from distributionafter the assassination of President Kennedy (even though Kennedy himself hadgiven the green light to Frankenheimer to proceed with making the film, sinceKennedy at the time was in delicate negotiations with the Soviets). Khigh Deighplayed the role of the Asian mind control expert who brainwashed the LaurenceHarvey character ( a decorated Korean War hero) into a programmed assassin whosetarget was a presidential candidate. Ms. Lansbury was Harvey’s mother, and “caseofficer,” moving him towards the kill. Interestingly, Khigh Deigh—who alsostarred in the TV series Hawaii Five-O—later left acting to become involved inChinese mysticism and wrote several books on the I Ching.Ms. Lansbury, though, became the central character in one of television’s mostpopular detective series, Murder, She Wrote. Many of her scripts were written byDonald Bain. Donald Bain was the biographer of radio personality Long JohnNebel, and of a separate biography of Nebel’s wife, Candy Jones, in which herevealed that Ms. Jones was a CIA mind control subject. Although someresearchers have problems with Bain’s book on Candy Jones, much of her storycomes across as perfectly plausible. The author’s own research on Ms. Jones’Asian activities tends to support that end of her tale. Perhaps the mostimportant aspect of the whole affair is the fact that Ms. Jones had no motivefor lying about her relationship to the CIA, particularly as her revelations toDonald Bain began in 1974, before the Rockefeller Commission would in 1975 makepublic the facts of the Frank Olson case. The Congressional Hearings on MK-ULTRAwould not take place until 1977.(The author had the occasion to meet Candy Jones in 1979-80, and found her to bean eminently sane and no-nonsense sort of person who had no desire to exploither alleged CIA background, and who never mentioned it unless pressed to do soby other people. She also shared an interest in paranormal phenomena with herlate husband, Long John Nebel, although perhaps not to the same degree he did.)The odd nexus of Angela Lansbury/Charles Manson/Donald Bain/Candy Jones wassuggestive of a deeper web of connections. Was it possible that Hollywood wasbeing used as a tool of secret, special interests, and that the selection ofthemes, scripts, actors, studios, producers, directors was—at times, and duringcertain periods of international or domestic tensions—politically motivated orthe result of an intelligence agenda: psychological warfare? Of course, we havethe ultimate example of Ronald Reagan, the actor who became a President, but isthere more to this story than that? Something more profound, and evidence ofanother “player” altogether?Another striking reference to “Bluebirds” was in direct connection to theKennedy assassination itself, the spoor of a minor event that may have haddeeper implications, because it involved Lee Harvey Oswald and his time spent atAtsugi Air Base in Japan, one of only two locations outside the United States(along with Manila, in the Philippines) where the CIA maintained a store of LSD,and the base for U-2 spy plane flights over the Soviet Union. And what was thescene of a fistfight between Oswald and Tech Sgt. Miguel Rodriguez on June 20,1958, the same year “Bluebirds Over The Mountain” was first released? TheBluebird Café in Yamato, Japan.Oswald had tried to pick a fight with Rodriguez earlier that month, at theEnlisted Men’s Club at Atsugi. The alleged motive was that Rodriguez hadassigned Oswald to an excessive amount of KP (kitchen) duty. The first attempt,in Atsugi, did not result in a fight, as Rodriguez ignored Oswald; but later atthe Bluebird Café Oswald spilled a drink on Rodriguez and a fight ensued, forwhich Oswald was court-martialed and sent to the brig. Oswald, defendinghimself, had said that he was drunk and spilled the drink accidentally;Rodriguez claimed that Oswald was not drunk, walked over to him calmly, andspilled the drink quite deliberately.This incident merits further attention is for two reasons. In the first place,episodes of Oswald getting physical and looking for fights are few and farbetween. (About the only other event in which Oswald is known to have used hisfists is in slapping his Russian wife, Marina, around.) Oswald was known to havebeen physically cowardly, and even effeminate in the way delicate young men canappear to the “jocks.” One of his nicknames in the Marines was “Ozzie theRabbit,” a reference to his lack of physical courage, perhaps, but one whichcould also be a (conscious or unconscious?) reference to Walt Disney characterand forerunner of Mickey Mouse: “Oswald the Lucky Rabbit,” who appears in the1927 cartoon “Great Guns,” about Oswald’s enlistment in the Army. In any event,Lee Oswald’s deliberate attempt to provoke Rodriguez to a fistfight is whollyout of character.It is not fashionable to cite Disney versions when applying fairy tales toclinical questions. However, it seems likely that the people in the DisneyStudios possess an unconscious, too. It seems possible that the Disneyunconscious may be even closer to our own than those of the storytellers whospoke with the brothers Grimm.> —Jean Goodwin, “Snow White and the seven diagnoses”34> [../Text/ch05.html#filepos903126]In the second place, according to some witnesses, Oswald’s actual time spent inthe brig seems to have been slight, and moreover spent in civilian clothesaccording to the only eyewitness who actually saw him there. Some researchersfeel that Oswald was receiving intelligence training at this time, and that thefight and ensuing sentence in the brig was a cover, to allow him time tocomplete this training unnoticed. Oswald is known to have been approachedearlier by what was probably a Communist spy in Japan—a beautiful Japanese womanwho asked a lot of questions about his job at Atsugi—and he reported thiscontact to his superiors.Former CIA finance officer James Wilcott testified before the House SelectCommittee on Assassinations that Oswald was, indeed, a CIA asset in Japan,according to conversations he had with his co-workers at the Agency after theassassination. 35The CIA denied this relationship to Oswald, but they didsuggest that perhaps the KGB had recruited Oswald in Japan! If so, of course,that meant that Oswald may have been a Soviet agent at the time of theassassination, and this angle was not pursued.Whatever actually transpired in Japan, it was a crucial time for Oswald and hisensuing career—whether as US intelligence agent, Soviet intelligence agent, ordisaffected Marine and crazed, lone gunman—and it began, oddly enough, at theBluebird Café. Some researchers openly wondered whether Oswald was receivingmind control treatments of some sort at the time, since the CIA had a largeoperational base at Atsugi and had been debriefing defectors and returningprisoners of war there under Operation BLUEBIRD at the time of the Koreanconflict. It is impossible to tell with any certainty at this time what Oswaldwas really doing in the Marines at Atsugi; his military records do show somediscrepancies and, in one case, a medical notation shows that he contractedgonorrhea “in the line of duty”; certainly a bizarre set of circumstances for alowly Marine radar operator.As we have seen, BLUEBIRD may have had its inspiration in the tale by MauriceMaeterlinck, discussed above. If so, then perhaps the assassination of PresidentKennedy had also been “inspired” by another of Maeterlinck’s plays, this timethe rarely performed The Cloud That Lifted. 36In this play a political leader bythe name of Bielensky is murdered by unknown assailants. Either three or fourshots are fired; the number is controversial. The mortal wound is received inthe nape of the neck. Bielensky dies without regaining consciousness. The shotscome from a garden wall near a thicket of aspens (the grassy knoll?). The victimhad been receiving death threats, which he decided would not cause him to alterhis routine. Further, the assassin—Axel Thorild—thought “he was serving hismaster and Holy Russia.” He was a member of an underground political factionunder surveillance by the secret police; he believed he killed Bielensky, butsomeone else takes the blame and commits suicide. Was Axel set up? Was he a…patsy?The above brief summary of the play does not do it justice, perhaps, but thedramatic elements are so close to the facts of the Kennedy assassination—andperformed long before Kennedy was even born—that one is hard-pressed to deny anyconnection to that day in Dallas in 1963. Was it a psychic prediction by thismystical Nobel Prize-winning author? Or was the play as well-known to the peoplewho created and manned BLUEBIRD as Maeterlinck’s other works? One is tempted toremark that “Axel Thorild” is reminiscent of one of Oswald’s aliases, “AlecHidell”…but that is probably taking this too far.Probably.> I am looking for some ray of innocent simplicity… of madness, even, if neces> sary, to try to explain a thing that could only be explained… by something> that is wholly impossible…> Act III, Scene 1, The Cloud That Lifted, Maurice Maeterlinck--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/ch05.html#filepos717492] There is a plethora of published material onthe famous UFO cases mentioned here.

I took my pill at eleven.…> — Aldous Huxley, The Doors of Perception, May 4, 1953The LSD experience is an enormous obstacle in the way of understanding what thelatter half of the twentieth century was all about; those who have not taken LSD(or the other hallucinogens available at the time, such as mescaline andpsilocybin) cannot appreciate the effects these substances have on one’sperception of reality. Those who have taken the drugs are often considered to bein no position to be objective about them! Yet, LSD and the other hallucinogensform a core of experience that has molded the lives and behavior of millions ofpeople, both in the United States and abroad. This behavior is the result of analtered perception of reality and, hence, of social values. The shock to thesystem that results when coming down from such a drug and seeing the “realworld” once again is often transformed into a rejection of consensus reality, arejection of human institutions based on what the acid-tripper sees as animperfect understanding of the workings of the cosmos.Just as Communism was perceived by the West as a rejection of its values and theestablishment of a “counter culture” in which institutions such as thegovernment, the church, the school, marriage and other forms of civilizationwere reinterpreted, redesigned or even rejected altogether to create what theCommunists believed would be a paradise on earth, the acid-tripper similarlyrejected all forms of Western “establishment” culture in favor of something moreethereal but no less paradisiacal; but the acid-tripper rejected Communism aswell, and any governmental authority, and was thus a problem for establishmentsboth in the West and in the East.The acid-tripper was also a problem for religious organizations in general, atleast those which attempt to monopolize access to the Godhead, because the acidtrip can be a mystical one, a religious experience equivalent to the visions ofthe Saints. Direct access to God is always frowned upon by religiousinstitutions, for such access renders the institution irrelevant. Thus, the acidtrip is primarily a political problem, as the role of interpretation (of laws,of scriptures, of experience), and thus of control, is taken out of the hands ofhuman authority and placed squarely into the mind of the tripper.Ironically, it was human authority who created the problem in the first place.As is well-known by now and referenced in many studies of the LSD problem, theUnited States’ Central Intelligence Agency was the nation’s first “LSDconnection,” providing the drug to researchers all over the country, includingto young professors such as Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert, Ralph Metzner, andothers who would popularize use of the drug among their students and, byextension, among the rest of the nation’s youth. The purpose behind thisunprecedented largesse was not altruistic: it was to further the research intowhat Richard Helms and others involved in scientific R&D at the Agency believedwas a super-drug for behavior modification and mind control tasking. In otherwords, the Agency needed a much larger base of test subjects than was availableto them from within the Agency’s own personnel pool. They began by farming thedrug out to hospitals—for instance, to Dr. Abramson at Mount Sinai in NewYork—and to prisons, such as Dr. Harris Isbell’s program at the AddictionResearch Center at Lexington, Kentucky. Isbell’s operation was part of theFederal Penitentiary system and although his subjects were referred to as“patients,” they were, in reality, inmates of the prison system.Another obvious benefit to having the LSD administered by doctors and professorswho were not part of the CIA itself was that any adverse reactions, bad trips,and “accidents” would not be laid at CIA’s door. The Olson affair was stillfresh in everyone’s mind, and even though no one was officially reprimanded fortheir role in his “suicide,” the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) did notwant to take any more chances that a person with a high securityclassification—dealing in ultra sensitive matters of national security, such asbiological weapons—would start tripping down Fifth Avenue, naked in a snowstorm.It was time to move the test subjects away from the CBW people and intelligenceassets and towards those more expendable: prison inmates, terminally-illpatients, prostitutes, foreigners, and violent psychopaths. These were peoplewhose deaths—should they occur—could be easily explained as a natural byproductof their personal circumstances. They were also people whose secrets—whateverthey were—could not embarrass the Agency if they should be revealed under theinfluence of the drug.One of Helms’ problems with the drug testing program was the legal issue ofobtaining the consent of the test subjects beforehand. After all, Helmsreasoned, if the subjects know they are going to be tested, then how does thathelp us understand what a person’s reaction will be to the drug in the field,when he will not be forewarned? The idea was to obtain a person’s reaction tothe drug—particularly as used as an adjunct to interrogation and mentalprogramming—when he had no idea a drug was being tested. Even better if the drugcould be administered in a setting that was not so obviously… clinical. Thus,slowly at first and then with greater acceleration, LSD made its way intoacademia, and from there into society at large.SET AND SETTINGRichard Helms—in expanding the CIA’s mind control effort begun with OperationBLUEBIRD and its successor Operation ARTICHOKE— proposed the more comprehensiveand aggressive MK-ULTRA on April 3, 1953 and it was approved by Allen Dulles onApril 13, 1953, three days after he gave a very disturbing speech at PrincetonUniversity that cited “how sinister the battle for men’s minds had become.” Hewas referring to Soviet brainwashing techniques—or what was known, or imagined,of them at that time—and how a human mind could become putty in the hands of thespecially-trained Communist controllers. Remember that 1953 was a pivotal yearfor Soviet Communism: Stalin died in 1953 and a titanic struggle for powerensued in Russia, with dangerous implications for the West. The picture Dullespainted of the world situation in general, and of the state of Soviet mindcontrol in particular, was frightening, and he lost no time in approving whatwas to become the most ambitious ever scientific quest for the secrets ofconsciousness, something that had not been seen in this world since the daysthat magicians advised the crowned heads of Europe and alchemists toiled to turnlead into gold in the basements of archdukes and princes. Probably only the Naziaberration known as the Ahnenerbe-SS comes close to duplicating in scope whatMK-ULTRA was designed to do. In the former case, departments were created withinHimmler’s SS to research everything from the Holy Grail, mystical runes, andTibetan Buddhism, to Icelandic sagas and the World Ice Theory. In the case ofMK-ULTRA, the focus was narrower at first, but soon expanded to include psychicphenomena, shamanism, remote viewing, and occult practices. Even anthropologistsfound themselves on the CIA’s payroll:on the one hand, to obtain data about theremote locations and peoples they encountered, as such information might haveintelligence value later, and to suggest strategies for psychological warfare inThird World countries; on the other hand, to gather whatever flora and faunamight be useful to the boys in the lab back home as mind control agents, or asbiological or chemical weapons.As always, however, psychiatrists were the main focus of this research and theinstitutes set up to funnel money into CIA experimentation were mostly targetedtowards medical and psychiatric purposes. The faith of the Agency in psychiatrywas touching, if not wholly naïve, but what was their alternative? Psychiatrywas not exactly a hard science in 1953… or 2003 for that matter. Basic views ofthe human mind and its mechanisms in the postwar years were split between thebehaviorists, who felt that “the mind” was simply the name we used to describethe functions of the brain, an organ that is physical, biological, andmeasurable, and the psychoanalysts, who felt that there were underlying layersof consciousness, unconsciousness, subconsciousness, id, libido, ego, superego,archetypes, you name it, courtesy of the Freudians and Jungians, who evenbetween themselves had many important differences in their understanding ofconsciousness. In 1953 so little was known about how the mind really works thatAgency personnel desperate to find the magic key that would unlock the gates tothe Land of Memory were hard put to find people who could forge that key. Memoryitself was terra incognita: Did memory reside in a specific area of the brain,or was it distributed throughout the brain? Were all memories recorded forposterity, capable of being dredged up by the properly-trained controller, orcould some memories be erased, and replaced with new memories? In computerjargon, was the human brain “write once, read only” or could it be overwrittenmany, many times, like a floppy disk or a hard drive?For intelligence purposes, what was required of MK-ULTRA was the ability tomanipulate memory, and to relax the inhibitions of captured enemy agents so thatthey would reveal their secrets. Thus, what the Freudians call the “superego”had to be bypassed, allowing the controller direct access to the contents of anenemy agent’s mind. That was step one. Step two would involve erasing specificpieces of information from the subject’s memory and replacing those pieces withnew bits of memory, thus permitting the Agency to send that agent back into thefield without any knowledge that he or she had been interrogated and had givenup the sensitive information. Step three was a potential bonus: Could that enemyagent then be “programmed” to commit acts on behalf of the Agency, withoutknowing who gave the commands or why? This was the essence of the ManchurianCandidate. It is also the essence of what we know today as hypnotherapy and“depth” psychoanalysis, for the psychiatrist or psychotherapist in this case islooking for access to the patient’s unconscious layers, to extract importantinformation (such as childhood trauma) and to neutralize the effects of thattrauma, in some cases replacing certain unwanted or negative behavior patternswith new, approved patterns. Persons going to hypnotherapists for help with adrinking problem, or smoking, or over-eating, go through a similar process, withthe important difference that the entire treatment is voluntary. What the Agencywas looking for was a key that would unlock these secrets and allow unfetteredaccess to the human mind, with or without the voluntary cooperation orsubmission of the “patient.”In order to do this, they had to understand the workings of the mind first, andthen develop drugs and techniques that would allow them quick and painlessaccess. Agency personnel did not have a lot of time in the field to put an enemyagent or defector through years of what might be termed “aggressivepsychoanalysis,” but had to have answers quickly, sometimes in only hours,before that subject was to be sent back into the field to act as a doubleagent—or possibly assassin—for the CIA.But in exploring the mind and developing techniques for unlocking its secrets,the Agency unknowingly tread on areas that have been the domain of religion andmysticism for thousands of years. Cults as disparate as that of Eleusis inGreece, Tantra in India, Siberian shamanism, Native American shamanism, Taoismin China, Tibetan Buddhism, Jewish Qabalism, even the relatively modernphenomenon of European ceremonial magic—as represented in the twentieth centuryby the Golden Dawn, the OTO, and individuals such as Jack Parsons, AleisterCrowley, and MacGregor Mathers—and countless other disciplines had alreadymapped out large areas of consciousness and developed methods for entering themrelatively unscathed. As mythologists such as Mircea Eliade, Joseph Campbell,Carl Jung and others have demonstrated, there is a great deal of similarity in“technology” among these practices, and that similarity exists for a reason.The fact is that mystical experiences, like sudden conversions, do not alwaysarise from purely religious influences and stresses; they can sometimes beinduced by chemical means—such as, for instance, mescaline, ether, and laughinggas.> —William Sargant, Battle for the Mind 1 [../Text/ch06.html#filepos1042094]Precisely, Dr. Sargant; and the next question must be: where are the mechanismsin your laboratory that prepare the subject (we may say, protect the subject)for what he or she may encounter when under the influence of these artificialtriggers of mystical experience?In other words, Dr. Sargant, what really happened to your colleague, Dr. Olson?As LSD became more and more popular among the “civilian” population in America,its use contributed to a unique jargon and a rudimentary understanding of theeffects of LSD—or of any hallucinogen—on the mind, and how best to exploit itsbenefits. This was not the result of scientific tests done in laboratories and aresulting “protocol,” but arose from general practices by the youth of Americain the 1960s. Important factors of any hallucinogenic experience were referredto as “set and setting.” This meant that the emotional state (the “set” or“mindset”) of the individual was important, as well as the immediate environment(the “setting”). In other words, the potential candidate for an LSD experienceshould be in the proper emotional state and frame of mind to facilitate an easyand pleasant experience; the environment itself should be conducive toharmonious feelings, and should reinforce specific elements that the “tripper”would like to encounter or experience during the “trip.” As the Sixties wore on,“guided trips” became more and more common. In this case, the person taking theLSD would do so in the presence of a guide, someone who would walk the tripperthrough the trip—as it were—and also be on hand to protect the tripper from anyill effects. In this way, it was believed that an LSD experience could bebeneficial, could actually result in some important insights and have a lastingeffect on the subject long after the chemical had left the bloodstream.This was nothing new. Native Americans, for instance, had long known of thebenefits of taking peyote as long as it was done in a controlled setting by anexperienced shaman. CIA researchers were rarely interested in the ritualsettings that surrounded drug-taking among aboriginals, however. They were moreinterested in isolating the drug’s active ingredients and developing clinicalprotocols for their use. As scientists, they could be expected to do nothingelse; but in their paradigm of operation—trying to find a fast way into theunconscious mind with control over memory and volition, and then leaving thesubject intact (what Richard Helms, above, characterized as “a reversiblenon-toxic aberrant mental state”)—the purely chemical approach was doomed tofailure.Sargant’s prime example of the success of pure psychology was the Russianneurophysiologist Pavlov and his famous dogs. Sargant extrapolated Pavlov’sfindings to describe mechanisms for controlling human behavior. To a certainextent, this was effective (for instance, in treating victims of battlefatigue—what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder—where there is aspecific trauma and a specific symptom associated with it). Sargant sawreligious and political conversions in much the same way, as a behavioristwould. Apply the right amount of stress under the right conditions, and a humanbeing’s will is malleable; in fact, one’s entire belief system can be changedovernight. Sargant cited works by Arthur Koestler to prove his point, asKoestler had famously undergone a “conversion” to Communism and then a“conversion” back again.Also in 1953, we see that behaviorist poster-boy B. F. Skinner had begunpublishing; his purely mechanical approach seemed the most… scientific, and thefield of psychology was desperate to be taken seriously by science, which hadlong regarded psychology as “soft,” if not an outright pseudo-science. Thephysicists had already given us the atomic bomb; what weapon of similar,demonstrable potency could the psychologists provide in the war against GodlessCommunism? It appeared as if the Communists had found ways of manipulating theconsciousness of Cardinal Mindszenty, for instance, and had done similar work oncaptured American GIs in Korea. When Dulles made his speech in April 1953, hevirtually characterized the Cold War as a Manichaean struggle between the forcesof Light and Darkness. This was not a war over land or resources; it was a warover possession of the soul of humanity.Communism is, of course, a system basically inimical to capitalism anddemocracy, for it pretends to be both an economic system as well as a politicalone. Both the Soviet and the Maoist states had pushed religious observancesunderground; to be a member of any church was to automatically lose one’sCommunist Party card at best, or be arrested and thrown into the Gulag at worst.Allegiance to divine authority was understood as a kind of treason, anallegiance to a different king, and in this perhaps the Communists understoodreligion better than the Capitalists.Today for instance, China still insists it has the right to identify andproclaim the next Dalai Lama, Panchen Lama, and all of the other Tibetanreligious leaders, even though this prerogative had always been the domain ofthe Tibetan Buddhist hierarchy itself. It is based on a tedious, but critical,ritualistic search for the heir that can take years, and which involvesdemonstrable spiritual powers from the candidates (the ability, for instance, toidentify the previous Lama’s personal possessions from among a mass of otherobjects). How the non-religious, anti-religious Chinese Government sees itselfas capable of doing the same thing is beyond understanding, and even opens themup to ridicule, but the impulse is defensible from their point of view: allowingthe Tibetans to choose their own spiritual leader is tantamount to showing theworld that there is an authority that transcends Marxism-Leninism and Mao ZeDong Thought. That policy is extended towards the Catholic Church, as well, forChina has never allowed the Vatican’s nomination of cardinal or archbishop forChinese cities to influence its own candidates; during the time of the SovietUnion, a similar policy was in effect for selecting the hierarchy of the RussianOrthodox Church.What Dulles was describing to his audience at Princeton that Spring, then, had avery real basis in reality. For a nation such as the United States, where churchand state are nominally separate, and where neither the church can appointsecular leaders, nor the state appoint religious ones, the system of governmentin Russia and China seemed like nothing short of… well, Europe during the MiddleAges. Irony aside for the moment, if one takes the sum total of these facts—thesuperiority of the Communist state over religion, the submission of religiousleaders to the will of secular leaders, and the creation of mind control and“brainwashing” techniques—we can see that what the Communist state was doing wasexactly what Hitler had in mind for the Third Reich: the creation of a New Man.The Communist state’s approach, however, was purely behaviorist. Indeed,political dissidents were often hospitalized in mental institutions, since itwas assumed their rebellion against the state was evidence of a psychologicaldisorder; there they would receive the full benefit of the state’s behaviormodification program: what we call electroconvulsive therapy and what othersrefer to as “torture.” Hitler’s approach was more psychoanalytical, in that heencouraged the development of a state religion based on Teutonic paganism, andthus summoning to his psychic assistance all those “archetypes” about whichJung—the Nazi man-qué—was always lecturing about. The Third Reich normallyeschewed the behaviorist approach, and simply imprisoned or executed dissidents,since it was understood that political dissidence and racial inferiority werebasically one and the same. One of the most important exceptions to this rulewas homosexuality, which, when it occurred among the SS men was treated as apsychological aberration suitable for the therapeutic setting, but when itoccurred among members of the general population was tantamount to an assignmentto the camps.Once science and consciousness mechanisms—religion, spirituality, mysticism,psychology—became so closely aligned in service to the state in both the Westand the East, there were bound to be repercussions, some of which are being feltto this day. The vast array of worldwide literature on mysticism and mysticalstates is very clear and consistent on several important points, most of whichwere ignored by government-supported mind control efforts on both sides of thepolitical divide. The first, and most important, point is that these states areapproached gradually and with graded levels of training and preparation. Likethe Masonic degree system, initiates (read “subjects”) are trained in some basicinformation, then brought to the first level or degree of awareness. They thenreceive further training, and another level is attained, etc. This process cantake years, and is designed to integrate the initiate’s consciousness on alllevels and, yes, the goal is eventually to create a New Man (or Woman). Alongthe way, various paranormal abilities are cultivated or simply make themselvesknown to the initiate. The initiate may experience total recall of events fromhis childhood; he may experience some form of out-of-body travel or see eventstranspiring at great distances (“remote viewing”); the initiate may developother psychic abilities, etc. The focus of the mind control experts, however,was on the goodies themselves—the psychic abilities, the control over thememory, control over autonomic bodily functions—and not on the development oftheir subject’s spiritual identity. This is known in occult circles the worldover—from India to Europe to America—as “black magic.”To pursue these abilities as an end in themselves is to tread on the very edgeof the Abyss and, in some cases, to plunge over the side and into totaldarkness; but the people responsible for MK-ULTRA and the Soviet and Chineseversions of the same did not take the “initiations” themselves. In most cases,the treatments were given to other intelligence personnel, or to volunteersubjects at hospitals and prisons, or to unwitting subjects. Imagine someonebeing plucked from the streets—an innocent, a stranger, perhaps a criminal,perhaps a violent criminal—and forced to undergo a rigorous series of spiritualinitiations. While there is no evidence in the ancient literature of secretsocieties and mystery cults that such was ever done, the modern imagination hasadmitted the possibility (for instance, in John Fowles’ novel The Magus. Eventhe author’s own, yet unpublished, novel Citadel is based on that idea). Genuinespiritual initiation is always portrayed as a difficult, painful experience,what the Japanese Zen masters refer to as “grandmotherly kindness”; it is notmuch of a leap to consider that it could be accomplished by force on anunwitting or unwilling participant. MK-ULTRA, unknown or unrealized by itsperpetrators, was just such a program, stripped of any redeeming spiritualvalue. The tragedy of Dr. Frank Olson is proof of that.On May 4, 1953, the brilliant and celebrated British novelist and essayistAldous Huxley took mescaline for the first time. The author of Brave New World(1932) was living in California, having left England in 1937 for the UnitedStates. He tried his hand at screenwriting, and even attempted a treatment ofAlice in Wonderland for Walt Disney, who rejected it on the grounds that he,Disney, could not understand it. Huxley’s The Devils of Loudon, a fact-basedstudy of demonic possession in seventeenth-century France, had just beenpublished the previous year, testament to decades of study of Christian andEastern mysticism and religion. He was as prepared, intellectually, as could beexpected for what mescaline would offer, and he took a dose and waited.The Doors of Perception (1954) was the result, a report of his experience on thedrug, which was followed up by Heaven and Hell (1956). His sober, respectfulaccount of the hallucinogenic experience had enormous influence on the Beatgeneration of the 1950s and on generations to follow. For instance, Jim Morrisonnamed his rock group, The Doors, after Huxley’s work. While authors andexperimenters such as Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert and Robert Anton Wilsonwould, in the decades to follow, write glowing accounts of the benefits to behad by alterations of consciousness—either through drugs, meditation, oroccultism, or all three in combination—Huxley threw open the Door in the Wall(in a self-conscious borrowing of a phrase from H. G. Wells) and let the lightin. He was a bonafide intellectual, a pacifist, a literary lion; compared toHuxley, the others were arrivistes.He writes of the fantastic colors and of the altered state of perception, notingthat a person in an unsound state of mind who took mescaline would probablysuffer the very fires of a schizophrenic hell as a result. Thus, in 1954, Huxleywas writing about “set,” and, as he went on to describe his mescaline trip—takenin the presence of his wife and Dr. Humphrey Osmond, a Canadian psychiatrist andthe man who had supplied the drug and who was monitoring and recording hisreactions—he would go on to write about “setting” as well: the environment andthe influence it had on the progress of the experience.Taking mescaline had a profound effect on Huxley, and he kept worrying at theexperience, writing more about it and finding ways to extend the mescalineexperience into discussions of art, music, literature and culture in general,finally talking about religion and psychology and mysticism in light of themescaline experience. Frank Olson would drop acid six months later—in November1953—and his handlers presumably would have benefited from Huxley’s careful andrespectful discussion of the vulnerability of the hallucinogenic state… butHuxley’s report would not appear until after Olson’s death. His paragraph on therelationship between the schizophrenic state and the psychedelic state readslike an account of Olson’s last days:> The schizophrenic is like a man permanently under the influence of mescaline,> and therefore unable to shut off the experience of a reality which he is not> holy enough to live with… [it] scares him into interpreting its unremitting> strangeness, its burning intensity of significance, as the manifestations of> human or even cosmic malevolence, calling for the most desperate> counter-measures, from murderous violence on one end of the scale to> catatonia, or psychological suicide, at the other. 2> [../Text/ch06.html#filepos1042567]“The experience of a reality which he is not holy enough to live with” says itall. It is not for nothing that the mystery cults of the world prescribe alengthy and thorough period of purification and cleansing—of the body and of thesoul—preparatory to the ritual of initiation, whether by drugs or by trance oreven, as in the case of Tantric Hinduism, sex. One must be “holy enough” tosurvive the transcendental experience, especially if drugs are involved forthere is no easy way to stop that experience once it has begun. One must gothrough it to the end.When Frank Olson was given LSD without his knowledge or approval, he was in adepressed mental state after all that he had experienced in Europe. As AldousHuxley was busy writing up the experience of his first mescaline trip in themonths after May 1953, Olson was traveling in Europe to visit the sites wherehis weapons systems—notably anthrax and other pathogens—were being tested onlive subjects. His soul was in shreds; his heart was breaking. This was not theAmerica in which he had been brought up, and which he was working so strenuouslyto protect against its enemies. This was not the America of the NurembergTrials, much less of the Constitution. Frank Olson was losing his faith, and hebegged the Army to let him go. He wanted to become a dentist. A dentist. One ishelplessly reminded of Kurt Vonnegut’s novel, Slaughterhouse-Five, and itsdentist protagonist who wants to escape the horrors of war, if only in his mind.In this unclean and unprepared—this “unholy”—state, Olson took a drug thatkicked open the Doors of Perception like a Gestapo boot in the middle of acrystal night. He saw a reality that sadly lived up to all his expectations: aparanoid police state committing atrocities abroad while keeping its citizenssmiling at home. A Brave New World. He shredded his identification papers on thestreets of New York, certain—in his psychedelically-charged mind—that enemyagents were coming to get him, to blow his cover and his networks. And they did.And he died.O CANADA!Drugs were not the only royal road to the unconscious mind taken by the Agencyand its G-scale doctors in white robes and pocket protectors. Other eminentpsychologists and psychiatrists had their own ideas, and were recruited far andwide throughout the American landscape. And Frank Olson was not the onlycasualty of this experimentation, although he may have been one of the first onAmerican shores.Dr. Ewen Cameron was a distinctive man with a distinctive resume. Cameron, anative of Scotland who had moved to Canada early in his career, had been one ofthe psychiatrists asked to evaluate captured Nazi leader Rudolf Hess in 1945 tosee if he was fit to stand trial at Nuremberg. 3[../Text/ch06.html#filepos1043057]Hess had twice attempted suicide and this,coupled with his serious occult beliefs, was considered possible evidence ofinsanity. Cameron, however, concurred with most of his fellow psychiatrists whenhe gave his opinion that Hess was sane enough and fit enough to stand trial.He had become a friend of Allen Dulles, who would later become Director of theCentral Intelligence Agency, and had even offered to treat Dulles’ wife, Clover,according to Gordon Thomas. 4 [../Text/ch06.html#filepos1043854]Clover Dulleswas upset over her husband’s frequent philandering, and CIA doctors recommendedshe see Cameron in Montreal, since Cameron had a reputation for being good withwomen and women’s psychological complaints. John Marks—in The Search for theManchurian Candidate—gives Cameron the benefit of a doubt when it comes towhether or not the Scottish-born physician knew that his projects were receivingCIA funding. However, as a frequent visitor to Washington, and as a friend ofDulles from the postwar years, it is not possible to believe that Cameron wasnot completely aware of who was funding some of the most atrocious psychologicalexperimentation taking place in the world at that time, the practice of “psychicdriving” and the maintenance of the notorious “sleep room.” Later, doctorstrained by Cameron who had worked with him at his clinic in Montreal would befound working in South America—in Paraguay and Chile—coercing confessions frompolitical prisoners at detention centers there. It is possible—though not provenyet—that these doctors loaned their special expertise to the interrogationofficers at Colonia Dignidad, where the author spent a rather unpleasantafternoon in 1979 (as detailed in Unholy Alliance).Donald Ewen Cameron was born in Scotland in 1901, and obtained a degree inpsychological medicine in 1925. He fell under the influence of famedpsychiatrist Adolph Meyer, and in 1926 Cameron left Scotland for Johns Hopkinsin the States, where Meyer was then running the Phipps Clinic. After two years,Cameron then went to Switzerland, to the Burghoelzli Clinic, and from there wenton to Manitoba, Canada.The peripatetic Cameron then found himself in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1936(at which time he published Objective and Experimental Psychology promoting athoroughly scientific—which is to say, behaviorist and clinical—model of whatpsychiatry should be) and in Albany, New York from 1939 to 1943, where he wasprofessor of neurology and psychiatry at the Albany Medical College. In 1943 hemoved to McGill University in Montreal, where he created the Allan MemorialInstitute on Mont Royal (with a $40,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation),a post he held until 1964, when he effectively retired from professional life.It is the Allan Memorial Institute that holds our attention, because to many ofits former patients it has become synonymous with suffering. The former mansionof Sir Hugh Allan, before it became the Institute it was known as Ravenscroft, aforbidding but somehow more fitting name for a building housing a flock of madscientists intent on breaking into the innermost recesses of the human mind—byforce.As discussed by Harvey M. Weinstein, himself a physician and the son of one ofCameron’s patients, Cameron had been fascinated by memory, believing memory tobe stored in the brain and accessible through chemicals or other biologicalmeans.5 [../Text/ch06.html#filepos1044278] Cameron realized that the Land ofMemory guarded access to the mysteries of the mind itself, and if a way could befound to call up any memory—and reinterpret those memories or eradicate themcompletely—then one effectively erased mental illness. He called his techniqueof causing selective memory loss “differential amnesia”; it was a criticalaspect of what MK-ULTRA was all about. As mentioned before, if the CIA couldcause certain specific memories to be erased in a targeted individual—andperhaps replaced by false memories—then they could create the perfect spy, theperfect double agent, or even the perfect assassin: a person who would commitmurder and not know (not remember) why he had done so, or who had ordered thehit. Imagine an assassin, standing up in a crowd, pulling out a gun—regardlessof danger to his own safety, his own life—and killing an important politicalfigure. He is captured, of course, and then cannot say why he did what he did,cannot even remember that he did it. Such an assassin is a cypher: a crazed,lone gunman.Cameron believed that schizophrenia and other psychotic states were caused byphysical conditions in the brain; like his friend and colleague of many years,Dr. William Sargant, he had a mechanistic view of consciousness and felt thatwith the right drug and the right procedure all could be made right as rain.This was an approach very attractive to the Technical Services Staff at the CIA;it was what they were looking for: a switch to turn memories on and off,something reliable, something quick. The CIA wanted to hear that there were easytechniques—whether drugs, or hypnosis, or some other mechanisms—to give agentsin the field additional weapons in their arsenal. Cameron obliged. To that end,and to both test and prove his theories, he developed procedures known as“psychic driving” and “depatterning.” The procedures were radical and extreme,designed to totally disorient a human being, to strip away layers ofconsciousness and memory until one came to bedrock, and then to rebuild thepersonality step by step.Unfortunately, his patients—some of whom had come to him for mild disorders,such as anxiety—had no foreknowledge of the treatments and had not volunteeredfor the experimentation. Like other CIA guinea pigs under the MK-ULTRA program,they were unwitting and expendable test subjects. Cameron’s operation had afurther, fringe benefit: since the tests were taking place outside the UnitedStates and on non-US citizens there was another layer of deniability, andresponsibility for the outcome of the experiments was further removed.Additionally, the Agency could ignore the legal dilemma of whether such tests,if conducted within the borders of the United States on unwitting United Statescitizens, were within the scope of the CIA’s charter (which forbids domesticoperations but which does not, evidently, forbid scientific research anddevelopment within the United States).The setting for the tests was like something out of an old B-movie about madscientists. Indeed, a look at history will show that mad scientists tend to bepatriots who are committing their atrocities in the name of that “GreaterReich”: national security. (Robert Jay Lifton calls this unique configuration“doubling,”6 [../Text/ch06.html#filepos1044576] implying that such a doctorholds two different, often completely contradictory, points of viewsimultaneously: one, in which the physician feels he is upholding hisHippocratic Oath “to do no harm,” and the second in which he commits acts ofunquestionable brutality in the name of the State, or the greater good, orwhatever justification is fashionable at the time. It is tantamount to havingtwo personalities, two categories in which to pigeonhole the various opinions,feelings and strategies necessary to support them. It was perhaps Frank Olson’sinability to “double” that led to his death.)In the case of Cameron’s psychic driving technique, a patient would be keptisolated in a room—the “sleep room”—and would be administered some combinationof drugs and electroconvulsive therapy (what is popularly known as“electroshock”). Sometimes the shocks given were staggeringly high, and repeatedmore often than is usual in a therapeutic setting. The normal voltage is usually110 volts; Cameron used 150 volts. The normal dosage was a single shock lastinga fraction of a second; Cameron’s shocks lasted longer, up to one second (andthus an average of 30 times more powerful than normal) and were done 2-3 times aday as opposed to the more usual once a day, or once every two days.Electroshock causes a major convulsion, which is then followed by several minorconvulsions. Cameron’s was a variation of the already intense Page-Russellmethod, but taken up quite a few notches to the point where his patients becamedisoriented and confused. This was Cameron’s aim, which was the opposite of whatwas intended by the already controversial electroconvulsive therapy method.The drug regimen was equally severe: a “sleep cocktail” was administered to thesubjects—one can hardly call them “patients” anymore—consisting of Thorazine,Nembutal, Seconal, Veronal and Phenergan. The subject would be awakened severaltimes a day for the electroshock treatment and for the drug concoction. Thecombination kept the subject asleep day and night except for the electroshock,during which time his screams could be heard all over Ward 2.This treatment typically would last from two weeks to a month, with somesubjects being “treated” in this manner for over two months. In some cases, theywould lose control of their bowels, be unable to feed themselves or to tend tonormal bodily functions. Many tried to escape, but were always captured andbrought back to their ward by the doctors and orderlies, since they were in suchfeeble condition that escape was impossible, groping along the walls andpathetically urinating on the floor of the corridor.The effect of this treatment was to cause the subjects to lose their memory,usually in three stages. In the first stage, much memory was lost, but not thefacts of the subject being at the clinic, knowing he is at the clinic and why,and who the doctors and nurses are. The second stage involved the loss of whatCameron called “space-time image”; the subject would not know where he was orwhy he was there. Understandably, this disorientation was extremely frightening.Imagine waking up in a hospital bed and not knowing what had happened, or why,and with no one in a position to tell you since keeping you in that degree ofconfusion was necessary to the “treatment.” This nightmarish and Kafkaesquestate of affairs was designed, remember, by a man who had once tested RudolfHess for sanity.The third and final stage of memory loss is complete amnesia. There is onlyknowledge and memory of the present; there is no reference to past events orfeelings. Cameron proudly pointed to this stage as the one where anyschizophrenia has disappeared (along, of course, with a lot more!). The mind ofthe subject is a blank slate. He has been depatterned.The CIA, satisfied with this level of progress, then asked Cameron to go to thenext level: to implant new behavioral patterns in place of the old, erased ones.To do this, Cameron turned to another technique he had developed, which hecalled “psychic driving.”This method is, if anything, even more hellish than depatterning, and involvesblasting the subject with tape recordings of verbal messages—usually specificfor each subject—that played in a loop forsixteen hours a day for weeks.Normally, two tapes were used: the first was a “negative conditioning” tapewhich concentrated on, obviously, the negative facts of the subject’s life,continually reinforcing these unhealthy images. This would then be replaced by a“positive conditioning” tape, also in a loop, also for sixteen hours a day forweeks, which would emphasize the desired behavior instead of the unwantedbehavior of the first tape. Cameron’s assistant in these endeavors—one LeonardRubinstein, whose salary was paid for entirely by CIA funds—designed an enormoustape device that could play eight different tapes at the same time, thus“psychically driving” eight subjects at once. The speakers for these tapes wereplaced beneath the subjects’ pillows. They were inescapable, unremitting,endless; and, in some cases, augmented with the use of hallucinogens such asLSD.Compare Cameron’s psychic driving technique—developed as early as 1953—with thisproposal by Aldous Huxley, published in The Doors of Perception in 1954:> What those Buddhist monks did for the dying and the dead, might not the modern> psychiatrist do for the insane? Let there be a voice to assure them, by day> and even while they are asleep, that in spite of all the terror, all the> bewilderment and confusion, the ultimate Reality remains unshakably itself and> is of the same substance as the inner light of even the most cruelly tormented> mind. By means of such devices as recorders, clock-controlled switches, public> address systems and pillow speakers it should be very easy to keep the inmates> of even an understaffed institution constantly reminded of this primordial> fact.7 [../Text/ch06.html#filepos1045099]As can be seen, Huxley envisioned the use of the same technology in virtuallythe same environment and for the same ostensible purpose: to heal the insane.Cameron took this method and used it to drive otherwise sane people totally outof their minds.And this was not all. Cameron eventually (in 1957, and with more CIA money andofficial approval) turned his talents towards sensory deprivation.Sensory deprivation tanks became quite popular in the 1960s and 1970s, as aneasy and legal way to obtain hallucinogenic-type visions, although most peopleused them simply for relaxation and meditation purposes. The idea is tocompletely isolate a person from his environment: have him float in water thatis the same temperature as his body so there is no physical sensation, withgoggles blocking all vision and earmuffs blocking all sound. With no externalinformation source, the mind begins to turn on itself for data. Sensorydeprivation systems were used to test pilots of high altitude aircraft back inthe 1950s and 1960s; the author remembers an educational video from that periodthat showed a pilot strapped to a table in a specially-designed cell with novisual or auditory input: total darkness, total silence. After a short time,everyone begins to hallucinate. For some reason, these pilots hallucinatedlittle yellow men in black hats.In the Air Force’s testing program, though, when the visions became toofrightening the pilot could always hit the panic button next to his hand, andthe room would open and the lights come on and attendants rush in to unstrap thebabbling and sometimes incoherent subject and calm him down. Not many subjectslasted more than a few hours in such an environment, even though they oftenthought they had been there for days. According to the experts, even thestrongest-willed, most adaptable individual should not be left in such a statefor more than six days, because after that time the damage done to the psychecannot be undone.In Cameron’s program, though, no one was allowed out of sensory deprivationuntil he said it was okay. In one particularly harrowing episode, he left awoman—who presented as simply suffering from menopause—in sensory deprivationfor thirty-five days… and this was after a prolonged period of depatterning and101 days of psychic driving. Cameron wrote this one off: “no favorable resultswere obtained.” We don’t know what eventually became of this poor woman—whom weknow only as “Mary C.”—except for a notation by a CIA official at the time thatit was impossible to tell if the sensory deprivation or the psychic driving haddone the most damage.In case the reader is wondering if Dr. Ewen Cameron was a fluke, an accidentthat was taking place in a backwater of the psychiatric field, it is well tonote at this time that Cameron was elected president of the American PsychiatricAssociation (in 1953) and was the first-ever president of the World PsychiatricAssociation. Cameron was famous, honored, well-respected by his peers, and aconsummate politician. This was not a defrocked, dishonored crackpot who hadlost his medical license over a botched, back alley abortion. This was theChairman of the Board.Eventually, when word of the MK-ULTRA experiments began to leak out in the wakeof the Watergate affair, many of Cameron’s former Canadian patients recognizedhis name and his affiliation with the CIA and brought suit against the Agencyfor the horrors perpetrated against them in the name of another nation’ssecurity, and won a settlement of $750,000. But in many cases their victory waspyrrhic: Cameron died in 1967—four years after the CIA cancelled his project—andthe Canadian government refused any responsibility or culpability for hiscrimes, even though they were more than aware of the MK-ULTRA program, and itsmanifestation in their own country as the Allan Memorial Institute. Many ofCameron’s former colleagues still will not talk; many have since died or leftthe country. As mentioned before, Gordon Thomas has revealed that several of thelatter found employment with Latin American dictators and their secret police.The assault on the Land of Memory continues—with electroshock and Wagner—to thisday.Harvey Weinstein’s father, Lou, was one of the victims of Ewen Cameron.Originally going to the clinic to obtain treatment for anxiety, he wound upgetting the works. He became severely disabled following the gamut ofelectroconvulsive therapy, drug treatments, and the sleep room. He suffered“differential amnesia” for the period 1955-1964. He could not eat withouthumming, and had to follow other very specific rituals during the day; he “lostall sense of personal cleanliness or awareness of others.” Like Frank Olson’sson, Eric, Harvey Weinstein decided to become a psychiatrist, and, also likeEric Olson, Harvey Weinstein brought suit against the CIA for what it did to hisfather. That these sons of CIA mind control victims should both decide to devotethemselves to the study of the mind and the treatment of its disorders—as wellas to securing justice for the victims of government mind control programs—isperhaps the silver lining in this heavy, impenetrable cloud of sadness andmadness.The horrors of the Allan Memorial Institute are not an anomaly. Montreal is nostranger to abuses of institutionalized persons. Slowly, after the revelationsof Cameron’s frightening treatment of his patients, came stories about anotherset of abuses, this time from Catholic nuns who subjected the orphans undertheir care to the kind of treatment one would have expected of the old Bedlamdays, when mental patients were “treated” with questionable therapies and keptin filth for days and weeks on end. The exception is that these were orphans inthe 1950s in Canada, and they were not mental patients, but had beencharacterized as such by the Gray Nuns so that they could qualify for additionalstate funding. No one of the author’s generation who has grown up under thetutelage of Roman Catholic nuns will find the following story surprising. 8[../Text/ch06.html#filepos1045402]During the postwar years in Montreal, money was in short supply. Funding fororphanages was virtually non-existent, but funding for hospitals was availablefrom the central government in Ottawa. The Catholic Church decided to takeadvantage of the disparity in funding by classifying its orphans as “mentallydeficient,” thus qualifying for the federal largesse. The government inMontreal—specifically the administration of Premier Maurice Duplessis—was theinstigating factor, since it offered the Church a subsidy of $2.75 per day per“mental deficient” as opposed to only $1.25 per day per orphan. The Churchimmediately took advantage of this policy, and reclassified thousands—estimatesrange as high as 5,000—of orphans and illegitimate children in its care asmental patients (usually without any medical or psychiatric examinationwhatsoever).If this was strictly an exercise in paperwork, with no one the wiser—a pragmaticattempt to secure funding for the support of children whose only crime in theeyes of society was that they existed—then perhaps one could have turned a blindeye to the whole proceeding. However, the reclassification process prompted actsof horrific brutality against the children by nuns, the “brides of Christ,” andin some cases monks and lay helpers. The abuse was not confined to only oneorder of nuns, but extended to the Gray Nuns of Montreal, the Sisters ofProvidence, the Sisters of Mercy, the Sisters of Charity of Quebec, the LittleFranciscans of Mary, and two orders of monks—the Brothers of Notre Dame de laMisericorde and the Brothers of Charity—all of whom were named in civil lawsuitsby surviving members of the thousands of children who were thus abused. Therewere, as well, 120 individuals who were named in criminal complaints. Further,the medical profession in Montreal was also complicit in the case, as physicianssigned off on the thousands of examination forms stating that the orphans werementally retarded when, in fact, they had not been examined at all.Once the papers had been signed and, in some cases, entire orphanages convertedto mental institutions virtually overnight, the horrors began.Children were beaten, in some cases with chains; they were tied to iron bedframes and force-fed; put in straitjackets; subjected to ice baths; andsodomized. Some died from the abuse. Others became severely disabled, to thepoint that now—over fifty years after the events—they are still takinganti-depressants and are unable to hold regular jobs. One man still suffers fromtesticular problems due to the beatings. Of course, as they were officiallylisted as “mentally retarded” or “mentally deficient,” they were consideredmarginal members of society and could not obtain decent education or the otherbenefits of “normal” children and adults. In fact, once they were officiallydesignated “retarded,” it was felt that there was no longer any need to educatethem, and in many cases schooling of these children was cancelled completely.Some of these victims—at the time of this writing, in their 50s and 60s—stillcannot read or write. In many other cases, the children were labeled retardedwhen they were quite young, so they had no reason to believe they were notretarded. When some of these bewildered men and women were interviewed fornational television in the mid-1990s, their confusion and anger were apparent.Their lives had been destroyed, if not by the physical, mental and sexual abuse,then by the label of “mentally deficient” or “mentally retarded” which followedthem all through life.Some apologists for the Church say that it has been unjustly scapegoated for thesins of society at the time, that the children were dumped on the nuns and that,effectively, the nuns had no other choice. The apologists insist that theactions of the nuns be seen in the context of the postwar era, of the “laws,customs, and behavioral standards” that were current in the 1950s. This, ofcourse, is patently absurd. Again, one can understand the bureaucratic maneuverto change the designation of an orphanage to a mental institution in order toobtain more funding from an otherwise recalcitrant government, but no amount ofjustification can be found for the beatings, the rapes, the lack of schoolingand the rest of the hideous abuse suffered by these children. It is as if, oncethey were officially designated as “mentally retarded” on paper, they became soin fact, and were subject to the same treatment meted out to those lessfortunate members of an unenlightened society, for whom the stigma of mentalretardation or mental illness was tantamount to a confession of mortal sin.Perhaps the nuns themselves found the children to be representative of their owncomplicity, their own guilt, in defrauding the government, and the punishmentinflicted on these innocents was the result of what the Freudians might call“transference.” (No one who has done time at a Catholic parochial school in the1950s, however, would even give them that much benefit of a doubt. At the timeof this writing there had been so much evidence of the sexual abuse of childrenby Catholic priests—and ensuing cover-ups by the Church—that aged and ailingPope John Paul II had to convene a special meeting in Rome of high-rankingCatholic clergymen to find a solution to the problem.)But what is more absurd—especially to anyone who grew up Catholic—is theinsistence that the crimes of the nuns were merely reflective of the attitudesof society at the time. Since when has Church policy ever reflected socialattitudes? It sees itself as the supreme moral force in the world, unaffected bywhat society may think is right or wrong, since it is the Church which decidesmoral questions and not society. Thus, the unending issues of birth control,abortion, marriage for priests, ordination of women, etc. Regardless of whatsociety may think, the Church stands firm on what it perceives to be solid moralground, based on Canon Law, the Scriptures, the Church Fathers, the encyclicalsof the Popes. Their moral status was indelibly written two thousand years agowith the crucifixion and resurrection of their God in the city of Jerusalem;they answer to no higher authority.It is also well-known that the status of nuns within the Catholic Church is verylow: the lowliest priest has more status in the ecclesiastical hierarchy thanthe most mature Mother Superior. That the abuse of these children could takeplace without the knowledge or consent (tacit or implicit) of the priesthood issimply not possible. So, how was this long—nearly twenty years ormore—institutionalized horror allowed to take place?There was a war on. A Cold War against godless Communism, against the Red Periland the Yellow Menace. It was a war of Light against Darkness, and the bombscould fall at any time. It was a time of stringent measures to protect the bestand the brightest; for all others it was every man for himself. The AllanMemorial Institute was in full flower at the same time that the atrocities werebeing committed against the Children of Montreal, and in the same city; aninstitute run by the world-renowned psychiatrist and specialist in mentaldisorders, Dr. Ewen Cameron. Who could argue with that kind of success? Theactions of Dr. Cameron were as vile, obviously, as those of the gentle nuns ofQuebec. At the risk of being accused of hysteria or hyperbole, let the author bepermitted to draw the inescapable conclusion that the attitudes of Cameron andthe nuns were no different from those of the Third Reich when it came to thementally ill: they were expendable, “useless eaters,” useful perhaps in testsand experiments of doubtful value to science (á la Dr. Mengele) or, in the caseof the Catholic mental institutes, as slave labor in the hospitals… or even assexual toys for their care-givers. It was St. Ignatius Loyola, the founder ofthe Jesuit Order, who said, “Give me a child for a year, and he is mine forlife.”You will hear no argument from the Children of Montreal.THE DOORMENThe CIA was not the first organization of any size to confront the task ofprobing the human mind. Operations BLUEBIRD and ARTICHOKE, and MK-ULTRA, weredesigned to respond to similar practices of the Soviet Union and the People’sRepublic of China, what was termed in the popular press “brainwashing.” RudolfHess, at his trial at Nuremberg for war crimes, began speaking of thisphenomenon in his one and only statement to the court before he was cut off bythe judges. He made reference to Soviet show trials of the late 1930s, in whichaccused prisoners freely confessed to their guilt even though it meant theirdeaths at the hands of Stalin’s executioners. He referred to doctors who hadvisited him in prison—including one with a Scottish accent who might have beenCameron—and what seemed to be their efforts to hypnotize him. (In an intriguingsidebar, Dulles, who asked Cameron to examine Hess, was actually worried thatthe prisoner claiming to be Rudolf Hess was a double; he asked Cameron to getHess to remove his clothing so that he could locate a specific scar that thereal Hess would have. This was a strange request, since it should have been easyto have Hess physically examined at any time during his incarceration, butevidently Dulles did not entirely trust the British. Unfortunately, Cameron wasunable to examine Hess physically, since he was in shackles and the guards didnot have authorization to remove them.)The show trial of Cardinal Mindszenty was more evidence that the Communists hadmanaged to develop a technique for altering consciousness in their politicalprisoners; American GIs returning from captivity in Korea were another example.That there might be a mysterious Oriental method to “cloud men’s minds” bothfrightened and excited the men of the CIA. In order quickly to learn as much aspossible, they assigned psychiatrists, scientists and medical professionals tothe task of finding out how the mind—and specifically memory—works. In another,parallel, effort they fanned out through the Third World in search for medicinalherbs, narcotic drugs, and hallucinogens that might be used for the samepurpose. In doing so, they came across occult practices, demonstrations ofpsychic abilities, and the mind control techniques of yogis, shamans, and witchdoctors. Clearly, this was a realm of mind control that was well worth pursuing,and which gave birth to some of the strangest projects ever funded by the USGovernment. It was in combination with the work of Cameron, Gottlieb, Abramson,Isbell, et al. that these drugs, spiritual techniques and laboratory testsopened a Pandora’s Box of suffering, violence… and perhaps even redemption,through transformation: the Black Box of consciousness. In this, they wereunwittingly following in the footsteps of magicians, sorcerers, gurus, andcultists the world over; but, unlike their forebears, they used a purelyscientific approach to their material, and thus robbed the experiences of theone essential element that is common to all initiation: meaning.Without meaning, there is no context for the experience; there is no way tointegrate the material into one’s psychological makeup. Cameron was notinterested in meaning, neither was Gottlieb. That wasn’t their job. Their taskwas to open up the mind to fast and easy manipulation by case officers and fieldagents, not to promote spiritual or psychic integration, or what Jung calls“individuation.” Their job was to create assassins, turn agents, interrogateprisoners, obtain information. Saving souls was for priests.However, there was a band of scientists and explorers loyal to the Americangovernment who felt the need to bring together the purely mechanistic andbehaviorist approach to psychology that was being endorsed by the CIA on the onehand with the deeper, more analytical and Jungian approach on the other. Theideal discipline to cement this union and to demonstrate the utility of occultpractices was the relatively new science of parapsychology. Parapsychology wasconcerned with bringing the psychic abilities and practices of certain powerfulindividuals into the clinic for measurement and testing. What seemed like aseries of tame experiments in ESP turned into something quite different as theyears wore on, and some of these government scientists became scalded by theirexposure to the heat and light of powers beyond their imagining. One of thesewas a friend and, in some sense, a colleague of Aldous Huxley: Dr. AndrijaPuharich.The story of Puharich is central to any study of the US government’s postwarinterest in how psychology and parapsychology could benefit the intelligenceagencies. It was arguably Puharich who was the first to bring the potential usesof paranormal abilities in military applications to the attention of the UnitedStates Navy; it was Puharich who introduced the Israeli psychic, Uri Geller, toAmerican audiences… and to American intelligence. Further, it was Puharich whoformed a mysterious cabal that numbered many important and influential Americansamong its members, a cabal that would deliberately attempt to make contact withalien beings and—according to some commentators—actually succeed. This cabalincluded a man with shadowy connections both to Operation Paperclip on the oneside… and to the Kennedy assassination on the other. Thus when we speak of theDoors of Perception, we must turn our attention to one of their most unique, ifsomewhat eccentric, Doormen.Andrija Puharich was born Henry Karel Puharic on February 19, 1918 in Chicago.His parents were Balkan immigrants from what would soon become Yugoslavia, hisfather a stowaway who had entered the United States in 1912. His parents weredivorced in 1933, and the young Puharich spent two years on a farm in Illinoisworking the orchards and doing general farmhand work. He eventually went back toschool, graduating from Farragut High School in Chicago in 1938, when he wasalready twenty years old.Like any good occultist worth his reputation, Puharich had several names. Hisbirth name, Henry Karel Puharic, then became Andrija Puharich, from HenryPuharich (which sounded more American than Andrija, but which—to Slavicears—sounded enough like Andrija to be acceptable); but he was also known fromtime to time as “Andy” and even as “Hank.”Upon graduation from high school, Andrija was awarded a scholarship to theCollege of Liberal Arts at Northwestern University, receiving his B.A. inphilosophy in 1942, with a minor in pre-med. During the rest of the war years,Andrija—as a member of the US Army Medical Corps on inactive status and studyingmedicine on Army funds—also did some post-graduate work in philosophy, thusbecoming himself one of those scientist-philosophers that he seemed to attractaround him in later years. He also managed to get married, in 1943, to a ladywho was working at the Office of War Information (and hence the OSS) and whoeventually moved with him to the Kaiser Permanente Research Foundation in SantaBarbara, California. The two had a baby girl in 1947… at a rather inopportunetime, for he had since fallen in love with another woman, also at the ResearchFoundation. As if that wasn’t enough, he was also due to show up that Decemberfor a regular two-year active duty stint in the Army, for he was now aLieutenant and expected to repay the Army for the years it supported his medicaleducation. As it happened, he received a medical discharge on December 20—due,it is said, to an ear infection—and he was free to consider the direction of therest of his life. He had been offered a position as director of a proposed newneurological institute at the Kaiser Permanente Hospital. While doing researchat Kaiser Permanente during the war, he had written a monograph on a theory ofhis that neurons transmit and receive the equivalent of radio waves, a theory,which came to the attention of the director of the hospital, and which was aprime example of the new field of biophysics.Alas, by that time both his wife (along with his baby daughter) and the otherwoman in his life (a doctor at Kaiser Permanente) had left him. Finding himselfsuddenly free of commitments militarily, matrimonially and romantically, hevisited his father in Chicago, who suggested he drop in on an old family friend,then wintering in Camden, Maine. Andrija was on his way to the East Coastanyway, to visit other scientists and people working in the biophysics field inNew York and Boston with a view to setting up the neurological institute, so heaccepted the suggestion and wound up at the home of Zlatko Balokovic and hiswife Joyce.This visit was considered crucial by both the late Puharich and his biographersand other commentators. Puharich had been interested in extra-sensoryperception—particularly as it applied to his chosen field of biophysics andspecifically to the ability of neurons to act as transmitters and receivers—andhe found in the Balokovics fertile ground for his theories.Zlatko Balokovic—himself a Yugoslav and a famous concert violinist—was marriedto a member of the Borden family (the dairy products Bordens), and thus lived inrelative wealth and comfort in the City of New York and Maine. (This is ironic,in that the young Henry Puharich delivered Borden milk as a poor kid growing upin the “slums” of Chicago.) He was also a friend of Marshall Tito of Yugoslavia,from the days when Yugoslav Communists were welcomed as anti-Nazis and allies, arelationship that was to bode ill for both Balokovic and Puharich as the yearswent by and as Tito’s Communism became a problem in McCarthy Era America.Whatever was discussed during that period in Camden—where Puharich stayed fortwo to three weeks during a snowstorm—the end result was that Puharich wouldstay in Camden and build a hospital there where he could engage in the kind ofresearch that interested him. Thus, he would turn down the more prestigious andpotentially much more lucrative position at Kaiser Permanente, and stay in thefrozen northeast. Balokovic would subsidize him to the tune of two hundreddollars per month, and in no time Puharich had located an unused barn that hewould convert into his hospital. The barn itself was interesting, having beenused by the US Navy during the War to store materiel that was never described,although it had heavily reinforced floors and large quantities of firebrick.Naturally, explosives come to mind or some form of munitions, but this was neverrevealed.Also in the same town was a factory whose products certainly interestedPuharich. The company manufactured piezoelectric crystals, and was one of onlythree such factories in the entire country at the time. The crystals werewafer-thin, could be used in a variety of applications, and had been used by themilitary during the war as well as by General Electric, RCA and otherelectronics manufacturers. The firm was run by an inventor, one Dr. Raymond C.Tibbets, and his son George. The primary peacetime use of the crystals was inhearing aids, which is relevant to what Puharich would eventually be doing towhen he set up his own company, the Intelectron Corporation.At the same time, Puharich was traveling frequently to New York to meet other,like-minded individuals, including the psychiatrist Warren S. Mc-Culloch, one ofthe founders of the burgeoning science of cybernetics, which is basicallybehavioral psychology on steroids. (McCulloch’s work had been underwritten inpart by the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, which was revealed in 1977 to have beena CIA front or conduit for funds for those involved in the MK-ULTRA projects.)Cybernetics views the human body—or, more precisely, the mind-body system—as akind of machine, which can be tinkered with and made better by properly trainedengineers: a very attractive concept to mind control advocates within the CIA.Even more attractive, perhaps, is the fact that Puharich, McCulloch and otherscientists, doctors and engineers became involved in developing electronics thatwould provide a mind–society interface. These devices would involve the use ofradio waves to implant suggestions or, as in the case of Jose Delgado to bediscussed below, commands.The story varies from journalist to journalist, and even in Puharich’s ownwritings, but evidently when visiting McCulloch he discovered that there wereone or two patients in the mental ward of McCulloch’s hospital who complained ofhearing voices in their head when there weren’t any people around. (Had thisbeen taking place at the Allan Memorial Institute, of course, the cause wouldhave been easy to determine!) An examination of the “mental patients” revealedthat traces of metal in their teeth acted as radio receivers, and that they werepicking up a local radio station. At least, that is the cover story. There isvery little reliable documentation on this event; if the signal was coming instrong, then the patient should have been able to realize that it was a radiostation, thus the assumption is that the signal was fading in and out, much likethe signal on a cell phone when one changes position in a car or when walking ona city street. Although we may never know the real story behind the events inquestion, we do know what happened next.Once Puharich realized that small amounts of metal in a dental filling couldeffectively pick up radio signals, he decided to capitalize on this discovery.The handy access to Tibbet’s factory proved providential (if not pre-planned).The use of piezoelectric crystals in hearing aids could be modified as radioreceivers for a variety of other purposes.In tandem with his work in New York City with McCulloch, Puharich formed theRound Table Foundation of Electrobiology in Camden in 1948, an organizationwhose name was usually shortened to the Round Table, or the Round TableFoundation. Thus, the hospital or clinic that had been originally planned becameinstead a kind of research institute specializing in the more arcane of thebehavioral sciences, from cybernetics to ESP, and moved from the barn—which helost due to some unpleasantness concerning Red baiting in the small New Englandtown—to somewhat grander quarters in a twenty-two room house. One of theearliest members of the Round Table was Aldous Huxley,9[../Text/ch06.html#filepos1045933] and one of his earliest experiments was withthe psychic Eileen Garrett, who was placed in a Faraday Cage to test her psychicabilities, as were such other famous names in the field as Peter Hurkos andHarry Stone. In order to support his research, Puharich approached a variety ofindividuals for funding, including Henry Wallace. Wallace had been Secretary ofAgriculture in the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration and later his VicePresident. Under Truman, Wallace had been Secretary of Commerce, and in 1948 ranfor President himself on the Progressive Party ticket. Wallace’s name is usuallyassociated with a scandal involving a Russian mystic, one Nicholas Roerich.(Wallace himself is usually credited with coming up with the pyramid andall-seeing eye design used on the back of the US dollar bill.) There is notenough space here to go into the whole story of Roerich; suffice it to say hewas a painter and a mystic on the order of Gurdjieff, who became friendly withWallace. He and Wallace had discussed how to Christianize Mao’s China, and it isbelieved that Wallace sent Roerich on special missions to Tibet and Mongoliawith this in mind, since he believed that evidence pointing to the Second Comingof Christ would be found in those Asian countries.Wallace had written Roerich letters with the salutation “Dear Guru” which, whenleaked to the press, led to his downfall, for it implied that the Vice Presidentof the United States had spiritual allegiance to a bizarre Russian occultist. Inthe early days of the Cold War, this was not acceptable in a Presidentialcandidate. (Ten years later, the right wing would try to do the same damage toJack Kennedy’s chances for the presidency, since Kennedy was a Catholic andpresumably owed spiritual allegiance to the Pope.) It is fun to imagine thisscenario, however: the Vice President of the United States, sitting at the feetof a Russian mystic, discussing plans for smuggling Christianity into thePeople’s Republic of China. Some of our best history is under-reported,underplayed, or simply ignored by mainstream historians and biographers, andwinds up as grist for the plots of pot-boilers and popular movies that no onereally believes. When will we ever pay attention to what’s going on in thehearts and minds of our most powerful political and military leaders?In any event, Wallace agreed to help fund Puharich’s research, with a check for$4,458.73 in April of 1949. A princely sum at the time. And he visited the RoundTable—according to Eileen Garrett—sometime in 1949-1950.10[../Text/ch06.html#filepos1046422]Another mysterious donor to the Foundation was one Walter Cabot Paine, ofBoston, who donated $3,000. When a researcher attempted to interview WalterPaine, he was rebuffed immediately, and Paine did not answer any questions.Arthur Young, the Bell Helicopter designer and eventual guru himself, told thesame researcher that Paine was an associate of his and an oil executive whowished to remain anonymous. Mr. Young was being a little disingenuous, for hewas related to Walter C. Paine through marriage. Arthur Young would remain aclose friend and associate of Puharich during the 1950s, and it is thisrelationship that—in the context of all we have been discussing so far—isabsolutely stunning in its implications, for Arthur Young was married to aForbes heiress, one Ruth Forbes Paine, who was a descendant of Ralph WaldoEmerson. In other words, very old, very white money. Walter Cabot Paine was theson of Robert Treat Paine, a wealthy Boston Brahmin and art patron who made aspecial study of Japanese art, and was a direct descendant of the Robert TreatPaine who was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. W. C. was directlyrelated to Ruth Forbes Paine Young’s previous husband, George Lyman Paine (whois also descended from Colonial American “royalty,” the Lyman family). Her sonby that previous marriage, Michael Paine, married one Ruth Hyde.The reason for this heredity lesson is simple. In 1963, Michael and Ruth HydePaine befriended two poor immigrants from the Soviet Union: one Russian woman,Marina, and her American-born husband, Lee Harvey Oswald.The documents concerning the Paines and their relatives were sealed by theWarren Commission, and even District Attorney Jim Garrison could not get accessto them when needed. In fact, the Paines are not mentioned by name in OliverStone’s film, JFK, even though they are part of the public record on theassassination, and Ruth Paine’s character is clearly present in the film. It ispresumed that the threat of legal action of some kind forced the director todisguise their identities even though they are mentioned in virtually every bookabout the assassination, including the Warren Commission transcripts of theMichael and Ruth Paine interviews.We will discuss this relationship in much more detail in the next volume of thiswork, including the tricky relationship of the Paines to Allen Dulles (whichexplains some unusual behavior of Dulles at the Warren Commission hearings), butfor now let us continue to examine the activities of Andrija Puharich.At one point, Puharich claimed he was researching psychic abilities for the USNavy in 1948, for something called Project Penguin. The Navy has denied that anysuch program existed, and indeed there does not seem to be any documentationavailable to prove Puharich’s statement. However, what can be proved is that inNovember 1952 Puharich briefed Pentagon officials on the military uses ofparapsychology. His talk was published as “An Evaluation of the PossibleUsefulness of Extrasensory Perception in Psychological Warfare.” That talk wasreported in the Washington Post on August 7, 1977, at a time when MK-ULTRArevelations were coming fast and furious. A recently declassified CIA report,entitled “Parapsychology in Intelligence: A Personal Review and Conclusions,” byDr. Kenneth A. Kress mentions the newspaper article, and goes on to give asummary of CIA interest in parapsychology from about the 1960s through 1977,when the report was written. Dr. Kress does place the ESP and remote viewingexperimentation under the auspices of first the Technical Services Staff (TSS)of the CIA, and then later under the Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI),the Office of Research and Development (ORD) and finally the Office of TechnicalService (OTS), the former TSS. Kress had been Project Officer in 1972 due to hisprior background as a physicist. It was while running this psychic researchproject for the CIA that Kress would become involved with the people at StanfordResearch Institute (SRI) and specifically with Dr. Russell Targ and Dr. HaroldE. Puthoff, both associates of Puharich at one time or another and both of whomfigure prominently in our story.Long before Kress’ involvement with SRI, Targ, and Puthoff, however, Puharichhad decided to go very “hands on” in his approach to the field of psychicphenomena. His presentation to the Pentagon was in November of 1952; accordingto his own account in The Sacred Mushroom, the orders had been cut to redrafthim into the Army the following day, thus implying a specific agenda forPuharich. That December he would begin observing the trance state of one Dr.Vinod (whom he had first met in New York in December 1951) and make contact withwhat he believed were extraterrestrial forces.Within months, Puharich would find himself back in uniform, this time as an ArmyCaptain, and would be assigned to the Army Chemical Center in Edgewood, Marylandin February 1953, a position he would hold until April 1955. In other words, hewas at Edgewood, working for the Army at the same time as Frank Olson was atFort Detrick, and in and out of Edgewood, working for the Army. And as Olson wasinvolved in research and development of biological weapons at Detrick, Puharichwas involved in paranormal communication and ESP experiments at Edgewood. It istempting to speculate whether Olson and Puharich had ever met; it is doubtfulthey would have been colleagues, as Puharich was involved with biophysics andcybernetics, with a little spiritualism on the side. Olson’s work was purely inthe biological warfare arena (except when he was chosen as a guinea pig in theLSD experiment). But they worked within the same overall group at twoinstallations that had an incestuous relationship within the US Army, and it wasOlson’s death and the flurry of news reports around it that eventually led backto Puharich’s presence and activities during the same time period.Maybe they did not know each other. But CIA knew of them both.Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, who was head of CIA’s Technical Services Staff (TSS) at thetime and who dosed Frank Olson with the fatal LSD in the Cointreau, was incharge of all MK-ULTRA work being conducted at Edgewood Arsenal. It has beenreliably reported that Puharich’s function at Edgewood was to develop chemicalsubstances that would stimulate psychic abilities, the very essence of thereport he had given to the Pentagon the previous November. There is no other wayto understand what Puharich was doing at Edgewood Arsenal—of all places—exceptto admit that he was working for the CIA, the US Army, or some combination ofthe two, just as Olson was doing. This is exactly what his colleagues insistedwas the case, and this would mean that the intelligence community’s interest inmind control and in mechanical means of controlling memory and volition wasrunning parallel with its psychic research as long ago as the early 1950s. TheCIA and the Army would have presumably looked upon psychic or paranormalabilities as a behavioral matter, something to be studied and enhanced in aclinical setting. There is evidence that Puharich saw something deeper in thesephenomena, and that the roller-coaster ride that was his life was an indicationof his own inability to “double,” to separate his psychic research from his own,personal, spiritual quest. Puharich left so many clues in his own writings aboutthe interest of the intelligence agencies in his research that in a way it seemsalmost a deliberate ploy, a plea for understanding or a confession of somesecret guilt.Another person who will figure in this story, however briefly, is Dr. LaurenceJ. Layton who—for about two years in the period 1952-54—was Chief of the US ArmyChemical Warfare Division, based at Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah. Laytoneventually found the idea of chemical warfare repugnant, according to his ownaccount, and he left for a position at Indian Head, Maryland in 1954, where hewas involved in developing rocket propellants for ICBMs and other missilesystems (evidently a more humane form of warfare, at least from Layton’s pointof view). Most of his work for the Chemical Warfare Division is stillclassified, fifty years later, even though he only spent two years there.Layton’s name will come up again in reference to the Jonestown Massacre, but itis interesting to note that his mother-in-law, Anita Philip, committed suicideby jumping from a window at her New York City apartment building on May 10, 1952(barely two months after her son-in-law, Laurence Layton, was named Chief of theArmy’s Chemical Warfare Division); the assumption was that she—a refugee fromNazi Germany—became paranoid when she discovered that the FBI was running asecurity check on Layton’s family and friends. The last time that had happenedto her, it had been the Gestapo, or so the story goes. The stress was too much,as she imagined FBI agents stalking her every move, and she jumped.It seems that involvement with the Army’s CBW programs can be hazardous to one’shealth, particularly if one lives in tall buildings in New York. Her suicidenote was unambiguous in intent, but one phrase was particularly intriguing, forit says, “…I was a gossip and have been entangled in a network of intrigue.” Onewonders what she meant by that. Do we put her suicide down to an old woman’sparanoia, a holdover from the Nazi era? Or was something else bothering herentirely?Puharich’s involvement with the mysterious Dr. Vinod is critical to anunderstanding of some of the more arcane aspects of this study, since Puharichand the group that formed around him and his Round Table become involved ineverything from MK-ULTRA to the Kennedy assassination to archaeological digs inEgypt to the New Age movement to extraterrestrial intelligences.Some of this story is reported amply and well in a book by Lynn Picknett andClive Prince, The Stargate Conspiracy. Picknett and Prince have written otherbooks, one on the Turin Shroud and one on the perennial favorite of conspiracytheorists, the Knights Templar; the subject matter alone would give mosthistorians a severe case of the yawns, but it should be emphasized that TheStargate Conspiracy is arguably their best—and most thoroughly documented—workto date, for it reveals relationships that have been little noted even amongwriters on occult themes. What it does not reveal, however, is the importantlink between the Puharich group and the Kennedy assassination. This is due moreto a lack of “crossover” between the investigators of occult themes and groupsand those of political conspiracies and historical movements, than it is to anyoversight or deliberate omission on their part.Corroboration of much of Picknett and Prince’s story can be found in thewritings of the central figures themselves, such as Puharich, Young, Geller,physicist Jack Sarfatti, Puthoff, et al. We will continue with what can safelybe proved by recourse to these sources.On February 16, 1952—Puharich is very specific about the date—he had his first“reading” by Dr. D. G. Vinod, a Hindu scholar “and sage” from Poona, India, whochanneled spiritual forces. Dr. Vinod held Puharich’s right ring finger at themiddle joint, and then began reading his past and future. According to Puharich,Vinod went into a trance, from where he was able to recite Puharich’s life indetail “as though he were reading out of a book.” 11[../Text/ch06.html#filepos1047184]Vinod then went on to predict a rosy futurefor Puharich, and they made plans to meet again to probe this ability further.This would not happen until New Year’s Eve, when Vinod and Puharich flew fromNew York to Augusta, Maine, where they landed at 7:30 P.M. and were picked up byHank Jackson, who was Puharich’s laboratory administrator. They proceededdirectly to the Round Table Foundation (the more luxurious house in Camden).At precisely 9 P.M. on New Year’s Eve, then, the Indian gentleman beganchanneling something that called itself The Nine. “M. calling. We are NinePrinciples and Forces,” the channeled entity began, and thus was born the sagaof The Nine. The reader may be forgiven for wondering what all of thesegentlemen were doing alone on New Year’s Eve, holding a séance in a house in theMaine woods. (Sadly to say, the author has had worse New Year’s Eves.)1952 had been a banner year for strange phenomena. In January, Jack Parsons losthis security clearance; he would be dead six months later. In March, ProjectBLUEBOOK was created by the US Air Force, ostensibly an investigation of UFOphenomena which was later characterized as little more than a placebo; in July,there had been the famous UFO swarms over the nation’s capitol on two successiveweekends; Charles Manson was sent to Chillicothe in September, where heunderwent a personality change; Puharich briefed the Pentagon on military usesof psychic phenomena in November; Operation BLUEBIRD became Operation ARTICHOKE;and the CIA began funding psychic research and infiltrating occultorganizations. 12 [../Text/ch06.html#filepos1047483]According to former colleagues of Puharich, such as Dr. Jack Sarfatti, Puharichhad been working for Army intelligence during the 1950s; others have claimedthat he was also working for the CIA at the time. This gaggle of intelligenceagencies is not unusual, since Frank Olson’s case is a clear example of oneperson working for more than one agency at the same time. Although it isdoubtful whether Frank Olson was ever on the official CIA payroll—he, likePuharich, was employed by the US Army. The CIA funded many Army researchprojects—including specifically Fort Detrick (MK-ULTRA Subprojects 13, 30 and50)—and had also been the entity responsible for dosing Olson with LSD; thus, acertain amount of crossover is to be expected, especially during the Cold War.Even Israeli psychic Uri Geller would claim that Puharich was working for theCIA when he brought Geller into the United States. Therefore, we should look atPuharich’s experiments with Vinod in the light of American intelligencerequirements where the paranormal was concerned, especially as Puharich wouldfind himself back in uniform only months after the first séance with Dr. Vinod.After Vinod’s—or, should we say, “M’s”—initial pronouncement that they weretalking with The Nine, there followed a short discourse on the nature of TheNine in the type of language with which philosophy majors are comfortable,replete with terms like ontology and teleology, which then evolved into a formof the Lorentz-Einstein Transformation equation and a tantalizing reference toits application to the “problem” of the “superconscious.” The Nine offered towork with Puharich to solve some of the problems he was working on at the time.If we are to credit the speech by “M” as given in Puharich’s own work—in thiscase,Uri—then we must assume that Puharich was involved in psychic research,including psychokinesis and clairvoyance, and was interested in pursuing thisresearch as quickly as possible.Vinod completed his channeling ninety minutes later, and said he had no memoryor knowledge of what was said. Puharich worked with Vinod for another month, andthen had to go to Edgewood Arsenal, as he had been redrafted into the US Army.Some months later, on June 27, 1953, the night of the full moon, Puharichgathered around him what was to be a core group of the Round Table Foundationfor another session with Vinod. The membership of this group of nine members—ála The Nine—is illuminating. Henry Jackson, Georgia Jackson, Alice Bouverie,Marcella Du Pont, Carl Betz, Vonnie Beck, Arthur Young, Ruth Young, and AndrijaPuharich. Dr. Vinod acted as the medium. Imagine the Fellowship of the Ring,with government funding and a security classification that was, well, “cosmic.”In this group, we find immediately a Du Pont and a Bouverie. Du Pont isself-explanatory, but for those who do not have a copy of the New York SocialRegister to hand, Alice Bouverie was born Ava Alice Muriel Astor, and was adescendant of John Jacob Astor, and the daughter of Colonel John Jacob Astor IV,builder of the Astoria Hotel and author of the book A Journey To Other Worlds(1894); her father was also one of the ill-fated passengers aboard the Titanicwhen it went down in April 1912. She had a reputation for her interest in theoccult, as well as an interest in the institution of matrimony, for she marriedand divorced four times before her death in 1956 at the age of 54.Interestingly, her first husband was an officer in the Czarist Army, PrinceSerge Obolensky. Obolensky was an intelligence officer during World War II and“headed the OSS Operational Groups which worked with the French Maquis at thetime of the Normandy invasion.” 13 [../Text/ch06.html#filepos1047966]He alsoparachuted behind enemy lines in Sardinia to inform the Italian garrison therethat Italy had switched sides and abandoned the Nazis. A dashing sophisticate,he was a fanatic anti-Communist and, at the same time, a “darling of the NewYork social set.” 14 [../Text/ch06.html#filepos1048461]It was Obolensky whotranslated a secret Russian copy of Mao Ze Dong’s guerrilla warfare manual. 15[../Text/ch06.html#filepos1048689]Thus, Ms. Astor’s intelligence connectionswere on a par with those of Puharich and Paine, making The Nine look like aprayer meeting of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers. (Her lasthusband was David Pleydell-Bouverie, an architect in New York, hence her marriedname at the time of the séance as Alice Bouverie.)The English branch of the Astor family was also involved—if somewhatmysteriously—in the occult. As friends of Stephen Ward, who lived in a cottageon the Astors’ Cliveden Estate, they were privy to some strange occurrences inthe years leading up to the Profumo Affair. Stephen Ward, a society osteopath,painter and occultist, found himself in the center of a political scandal ofmajor proportions in 1962, when it was revealed that a friend of his (theglamorous call girl Christine Keeler) was sexually involved with the BritishMinister of War as well as the local Soviet GRU rezident. The scandal nearlybrought down the government, and Stephen Ward—who was set up to take thefall—committed suicide in 1963. The Astors then had Cliveden Estate and laterStephen Ward’s cottage exorcised. The exorcist—Roman Catholic Dom RobertPetitpierre—claimed that “the evil powers emanating from the cottage were someof the strongest” he had ever experienced. 16 [../Text/ch06.html#filepos1048975]Arthur Young was a famous inventor, one of the men credited with creating theBell Helicopter. For some reason, Young left Bell Helicopter after the end ofthe Second World War before the time that Walter Dornberger—Nazi scientist andslave labor czar of Peenemuende fame—took up residence there as a member of theBoard. Rather than continue in the field of aviation mechanics and design, Youngdropped out of the military-industrial complex and began to devote himself to aspiritual quest which lasted the rest of his life. As mentioned before, his wifewas Ruth Forbes Paine, of the Forbes family and, through marriage, the Painefamily. Thus, we have a Du Pont, an Astor, and a Forbes/Paine attending thisvery important séance; in addition we have Puharich—working for the US Army—andArthur Young, who worked under Army contract developing the helicopter. HenryJackson was Puharich’s administrator and was married to Georgia Jackson. CarlBeck was involved in alternate energy research, and had visited the laboratoryof one Thomas Henry Molay, a Mormon scientist and ersatz alchemist living inSalt Lake City who claimed to have identified a source of “free energy” which hetermed “radiant energy.” Developing alternate energy sources (á la Nicola Tesla)would be a preoccupation of Puharich in the years to come. (The only member ofthe original Nine that the author has been unable to satisfactorily identify isVonnie Beck, who may have been the same Vonnie Beck who was a pilot for the USNavy during World War II, but at this time there is no further information onBeck.)The séance proceeded in the following fashion:Dr. Vinod sat on the floor, the nine members of the group in a circle aroundhim, with a copper plate on his lap, prayer beads in his hands, and a smallstatue of “Hanoum,” a Hindu god that the author believes to be Hanuman, theMonkey King. If this is so, it is interesting in that Hanuman was a human being,a minister, before becoming divine due to his devotion and courage. Thehalf-human, half-divine image is one that becomes more important and moreobvious as this study progresses. Another important aspect of Hanuman is hisdepiction in much Indian art as holding an entire mountain in one hand (and aclub in the other). When—in the Ramayana and during the battle of Rama andRavana—Lakshmana was mortally wounded, Hanuman raced to a mountain covered withdifferent healing herbs. Not knowing which one Lakshmana required, Hanumansimply brought the entire mountain. Hanuman—as well as his fellow monkey-men,the Vanaras of southern India—is often shown with his hand in front of hismouth, signifying “silence” as well as obedience, in much the same way westernoccultists depict Harpocrates. In this sense, replete with silence, obedience, aclub, and a mountain of herbs, Hanuman might easily have been the patron saintof MK-ULTRA. (In the Chinese epic, Journey to the West, the same “Monkey” isdepicted as a trickster, a confidence-man and master of martial arts, who ispart of a Buddhist priest’s bodyguard.)Vinod went into trance promptly at 12:15 A.M., and then “R,” one of theextraterrestrial Nine, began speaking through him at 12:30 A.M. Threads appearedout of nowhere on the floor in front of Vinod, and he passed one to each of thehuman Nine, telling them, “Tonight we want to create Brahmins in this world,”and that the thread was a sign of their initiation. (This is a common feature ofsome forms of Hinduism as well as Tibetan Buddhism.) The author finds thisamusing, since a third of those present were Brahmins already (Du Pont, Astor,Forbes) in one form or another.A Brahmin, of course, is the highest caste in the caste-structured Hindu system.Other castes include warriors and merchants, and there is also the non-casteknown as the Untouchables (who were generally involved in trades consideredunclean, such as handling the dead, slaughtering, etc.). What Vinod (or,actually “R”) was telling the assembled group is that they were to be reborn asspiritual Brahmins, in charge of bringing about a mystical renaissance on earth…under the mentorship of The Nine, of course. “R” then made an allusion toalchemy and transformation, and then a reference to Buddha. Eventually, theHindu and Buddhist references faded out of the communications from The Nine infavor of discussions of “supersense” and other quasi-scientific, philosophicalconstructs that might have seemed profound in the context of the séance butwhich make for rather painful reading today, fifty years later.Gradually, over a period of time, The Nine revealed themselves asextraterrestrial beings living on an immense spacecraft hovering invisibly overthe planet. The assembled congregation had been selected to promote the agendaof The Nine on earth. As Puharich would later write in his biography of UriGeller, “We took every known precaution against fraud, and the staff and Ibecame thoroughly convinced that we were dealing with some kind of anextraordinary extraterrestrial intelligence.” 17[../Text/ch06.html#filepos1049516]This belief was reinforced by events that tookplace over the next twenty years, culminating in the Uri Geller experience, whenit seemed there were UFOs following everyone around, from Israel to SouthAmerica to New York State. Indeed, Puharich became obsessed with The Nine,seeing them behind every psychic encounter, every UFO sighting, every paranormalevent.Puharich did not know what to do with the channeled information from Vinod;although he believed what he heard, he had no way to prove that The Nine reallyexisted. There was the matter of the materialization of the threads fromPuharich’s floor, of course, but that was proof only to the people in the roomat the time. Puharich wanted more; or, perhaps, his handlers did.Puharich stayed with the Army at Edgewood Arsenal until April 1955, when he wasfinally discharged. During his two year hitch at Edgewood, MK-ULTRA was created,his friend Aldous Huxley tripped on mescaline, and Frank Olson was killed. (Evenhis boss at the time—the head of the Army’s CBW program—was Dr. Laurence Layton,whose son would be the only person tried and convicted for his role in theJonestown massacre more than 20 years later.) In addition, the Robertson Panelwas formed by the CIA to investigate UFO sightings, the Korean War ended, theCIA overthrew Mussadegh of Iran and re-installed the Shah, and overthrew Arbenzin Guatemala, C.P, Cabell became Deputy Director of the CIA under Dulles, andthe first Scientology office opened in Los Angeles. Also during the same period,the Army–McCarthy hearings would begin, and on March 3, 1953, “Michelle” ofMichelle Remembers said she was inducted into a satanic cult in Victoria,British Columbia. On May 15 of that same year, US Air Force Chief of StaffNathan Twining would inform an audience at Amarillo, Texas that the Air Forcewas trying to solve the UFO problem and that there was nothing to fear.Although out of the Army, Puharich was still quite busy. He found himself inMexico with his psychic friend, Peter Hurkos, (and, it seems, Arthur Young) inJuly 1956 to “help solve an archaeological problem.”18[../Text/ch06.html#filepos1049815]As Puharich was involved in locating drugsthat could stimulate psychic abilities, it seems likely that he was there withHurkos on just such an agenda; neither Puharich nor Hurkos had anyarchaeological credentials. While in the town of Acambaro, he and Hurkos raninto an American couple from Arizona who eventually claimed that they had beenreceiving instructions from The Nine. Neither Puharich nor Hurkos had ever metthese people before, but it seems they were working with a medium back inArizona who was also channeling The Nine. To prove this, they sent letters toPuharich the following month with sealed communications from The Nine thatreferred to details of the specific séances that Puharich had chaired back inMaine. This was the proof that Puharich was looking for. The details went so faras to include a variation of the Lorentz-Einstein Transformation formula thathad formed part of the first séance.If we do not want to give The Nine the benefit of a doubt, we can assume thatthe medium who was working with the Arizona couple—the Laugheads of Whipple,Arizona (which sounds fishy anyway)—was the same Dr. Vinod, for no one elsewould have the information. Puharich insists that no one from his laboratory hadleaked the details of the séance to anyone; but we never learn what happened toDr. Vinod. Yet, if this were the case, what was Vinod up to? And for whom? Wasthis a kind of double-blind experiment on Puharich, conducted by the Army orCIA? Was Dr. Vinod a plant? Unfortunately, there is no way to answer thesequestions now without more documentation about the Army, the Navy and the CIA’smind control programs, and in most cases this documentation has been destroyed.(The bulk of the CIA’s mind control research was destroyed by orders of RichardHelms when it looked like Watergate was getting a little too warm.) For theirpart, the Laugheads insisted that all of their information came directly fromthe medium during trance, and they refused to reveal the medium’s identity. Agood prosecuting attorney would get a conviction out of a jury with that kind ofcircumstantial evidence, but the defense doesn’t rest just yet.The story of The Nine gets stranger and stranger.THE REFLEXIVE UNIVERSEArthur Young and Jack Parsons had a lot in common, although it is possible thatneither one knew of the other during Parsons’ lifetime. Arthur Young was aninventor working for the Army during the Second World War; Parsons was aninventor working for the Army during the Second World War. Arthur Young’sinvention—the Bell Helicopter—has had an important and lasting impact onaviation science and technology to this day; Parsons’s inventions in the fieldof rocket science are equally (if not, perhaps, more) important to aviationscience and technology. Both Young and Parsons left the companies they were mostidentified with—Bell Aviation and Aerojet, respectively—after the War.And both Young and Parsons were interested in the occult, in UFOs, in paranormalphenomena, and were involved in organizations that were designed to promoteexpanded human consciousness. Yet, Parsons died quite young and Arthur Younglived to a ripe old age. The one possible connection between them was the figureof Harry Smith, an initiate of the OTO in Pasadena (Parsons’ lodge), who becamea friend of Arthur Young, and of whom more later.Arthur Young was born on November 3, 1905 in Paris, France to Charles MorrisYoung—an artist—and Eliza Middleton Coxe, a society woman from Philadelphia.They returned to the United States a year later and settled in Jenkintown,Pennsylvania. Arthur Young had a knack for mechanical things and wanted to go onto MIT after high school graduation, but his father insisted on Princeton, whichis where he ended up in 1921, first as an astronomy major and then later as amathematics major. While at Princeton, Young was undecided as to which directionhis career should take; he dabbled in art, philosophy and even cosmology, as heattempted to create a philosophical theory of the universe that was based onsomething he called “process.” This interest would lie dormant during the Waryears as he became involved with the Bell Aircraft Corporation. On November 2,1941 he joined Bell Aircraft on a short-term, but open-ended, contract, agreeingto stay on until the first workable prototype of a helicopter was complete. Hehad discovered a way to maintain stability in the air, and had been awarded apatent on the concept, which he signed over to Bell in return for the contract.This work was completed in 1947, and Young left Bell to concentrate onphilosophy. He had read Blavatsky in 1946, and thus began a lifelong interest inOrientalia, Hinduism, and Buddhism. He had been married during his tenure atBell, but divorced in 1948 after he left his lucrative position there for whatpromised to be a life of uncertainty. However, he married Ruth Forbes Paine inJune of that year, and his life changed for the better.Ruth Forbes Paine was a descendant of Ralph Waldo Emerson as well as of thefinancially-powerful Forbes family; her previous marriage to George Lyman Painealigned her to one of the oldest American families and related her to WalterCabot Paine, in the direct line of Robert Treat Paine and aligned with thepowerful Cabot family of Boston. Her pedigree—even in marriage—was blue-bloodand blue chip. Although Arthur Young was not quite of the same background—heactually got his hands dirty in the machine shop—his mother was a member ofPhiladelphia society, and he had been born in Paris, which lent him a certain jene sais quoi.Arthur Young’s interests were arcane, but at the heart of them was his theory ofprocess. This theory has been amply explained in his several books—such as TheReflexive Universe and The Geometry of Meaning—and we will not delve too deeplyinto it here. Suffice it for our purposes to say that Young believed there was aforce in the universe beyond that known to modern science, a force thatcontributed to growth, to life, to movement. He believed that science couldexplain the mechanics of things but not the force that organized and propelledthese things; much like explaining how an automobile works but ignoring thedriver. (The author hopes Young’s admirers will forgive him this thumbnailsketch of what is really a much deeper, more complex theory.) Young wanted toput meaning back into science, something it had lost along the way from theRenaissance to the rotor blade.He moved to the City of New York by 1949, beginning a five year quest which tookhim and his wife all over America and to other countries, looking for answers tohis spiritual questions. Eventually, in 1952, he formed the Foundation for theStudy of Consciousness in Philadelphia. This was at the same time that he wasinvolved with Andrija Puharich in the Round Table Foundation in Maine. In Augustof that year, Puharich received a visit from the Army’s Psychological Warfarepeople; in November he would give his famous speech to the Pentagon. InDecember, he would begin his séances with Dr. Vinod.In the summer of 1956, Puharich went to Mexico with Peter Hurkos, the famouspsychic detective. In Uri, Puharich mentions Hurkos but does not mention ArthurYoung on that trip; however other sources say that Young was present, 19which isentirely likely, but it then raises alarm bells that Puharich left Young’s nameout of his account. According to Peter Hurkos, the trip was arranged at thebehest of someone involved with the Round Table Foundation,20 which could havebeen almost anyone, since documentation on those early years is hard to come by.However, Arthur Young was definitely a sponsor and, after all, one of theoriginal Nine “Brahmins” initiated during Dr. Vinod’s second séance in 1953. Itis possible that Young himself wanted to keep this mission secret, since it tookplace at a time when the CIA was actively scrounging around the Mexicanhinterlands looking for hallucinogenic drugs.The Canadian psychiatrist and researcher who had turned Huxley on tomescaline—Dr. Humphrey Osmond—had also been interested in the possible use ofdrugs to facilitate psychic ability and, indeed, had made a presentation to theNew York Academy of Sciences as long before as March 1947 on just that subject.Puharich’s own presentation to the Pentagon involved the military use of psychicabilities. Thus, taken together, it comes as no surprise that someone in eitherthe military or the CIA, or both, came up with the formula: drugs plus ESPequals military applications.On June 29, 1955, a banker by the name of R. Gordon Wasson had stunned the worldwith his report on the psychedelic experience to be had by ingesting a certainmushroom, a report that appeared inLife magazine later that year. While inMexico taking the mushroom for the first time—under the traditional setting andwith a native shaman—Wasson was supposed to have been participating in along-distance ESP experiment with Puharich, but as it turned out Wasson was toostoned to be of any use that day. The story generated an enormous amount ofinterest, coming on the heels of the Huxley books,The Doors of Perception andHeaven and Hell, which were principally about mescaline. Wasson’s experience waswith psilocybin, the famous “magic mushroom” which has been the topic of bothlearned anthropological studies as well as pop culture accolades. The Lifemagazine story prompted a young Timothy Leary to go to Mexico in search of theelusive substance himself, and the CIA began an official search for more of it.It was the era of “God’s Flesh.”A CIA operative named James Monroe approached Wasson in an attempt to get thelatter to work for the CIA in obtaining more of the drug, and perhaps othersubstances as well, but Wasson refused. That didn’t stop Monroe from trying,however, and he dogged Wasson’s footsteps through Latin America. The evidencethat Puharich, Young and Hurkos were in Mexico on Monroe’s behalf is largelycircumstantial, but compelling nonetheless. The archaeological reason given asthe cover for their trip was probably bogus, since Acambaro was already known asthe site where thousands of pre-Columbian statues had been discovered in the1930s and 1940s, so there would have been little reason to enlist a psychicdetective like Hurkos to search for more of them in the same spot; but as Wassonhad been cooperating with Puharich in ESP experiments (which presumably involvedthe use of hallucinogens to enhance psychic abilities), and since Wasson was notcooperating with the CIA directly, it is entirely possible—no, probable—thatPuharich was in Mexico for the same reason: to locate and identify hallucinogensfor the Agency. Hurkos would have been along for cover, painting the trip aspurely some wacked-out psychic archaeological dig; the presence of Arthur Young,however, is more mysterious. One possible scenario is that Young was financingthe trip himself (as he most probably was, as an important supporter of theRound Table) and decided to go along for the ride to further his owninvestigations. With Young doing the financing, there was no need for the CIA toimplicate themselves financially in this junket; there is no record in theMK-ULTRA Subprojects of anything having to do directly with Puharich, althoughhe could have been financed by the CIA through any one of a number of Agencyconduits, such as the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation or the Geschickter or HumanEcology fronts, or even directly by the Army. There are a number of MK-ULTRASubprojects whose designations refer to the collection of various hallucinogens,however, such as James Monroe’s Subprojects 51, 52 and 53, and Subproject 58 toJ.P. Morgan and Co. in 1956 for the collection of hallucinogenic mushrooms for$2,080.00, which also seems to be related to Wasson’s work. Thus, the fundingfor this expedition could have come from anywhere, and be buried within anothersubproject’s expenses.We don’t know if Puharich’s mission to Mexico was successful; indeed, we don’treally know what it was. In any event, it would not be the last time ArthurYoung and Puharich would work together. Even twenty years later, Puharich couldbe found at Arthur Young’s home in Pennsylvania with Uri Geller (and murdersuspect Ira Einhorn) in tow.What we do know, based on Young’s own statement, is that he wrote his two books,The Reflexive Universe and The Geometry of Meaning—in “the early 1960s,” eventhough they were not published until 1976.21 These books give a description ofhis theory of process, and address an “added parameter” to physics beyond mass,length and time. This added parameter he quantifies as process, or drive, orforce, or consciousness as manifested in the photon, what he terms the “quantaof action.” His writings and lectures have had a great effect on an entiregeneration of thinkers, scientists, researchers, academics, and even novelistsand artists. He was deeply concerned about what he called science’s “cleavage ofour culture,” and sought to redress that disunity through a concentration on thephysics of consciousness. His work has been picked up and elaborated—in spiritif nothing else—by quantum physicists such as Jack Sarfatti, who himself managedto walk the line between pure physics and culture. As an original member of theRound Table Foundation, and a member of the original Nine, Young, along with theother Brahmins, would try to bring about a kind of transformation on theearth—perhaps under the guidance of the very space beings who so fascinated himthroughout his life.But it is what Arthur Young was doing in the “early 1960s” that concerns ushere, for in addition to writing his two seminal works on the parameter offorce, he was entertaining a central character in the assassination of apresident.The doors of perception had been opened, not only by drugs like mescaline, LSDand psilocybin, but by the séance, the shaman, the secret ritual. All had becometools of the trade for elements of the CIA, and their assault on memory andconsciousness threw open the doors of perception and, instead of letting theLight in, they let the Darkness out.Drugs, shamanism, and the occult. The dark domain of Charles Manson and AndrijaPuharich, of Arthur Young and Sidney Gottlieb. With psychedelics and spiritguides, they disturbed the sleep of ancient forces, and America would never bethe same.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/ch06.html#filepos921705] William Sargant, Battle for the Mind, MalorBooks, Cambridge, 1997, ISBN 1-88353606-5, p. 992 [../Text/Sinster_Forces_-_The_Nine_split_089.html#filepos938816] AldousHuxley, The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell, Flamingo, London, 1994,ISBN 0-00-654731-1, p.383 [../Text/Sinster_Forces_-_The_Nine_split_090.html#filepos942836] Harvey M.Weinstein, Psychiatry and the CIA: Victims of Mind Control, American PsychiatricPress, Washington, DC, 1990, ISBN 0-88048-363-6, p. 92-93.

It is not the intention of the author to go over all the evidence andprove, conclusively, that so-and-so committed the murder, or that such-and-suchan organization was responsible, or even try to prove that Oswald acted alone.For this, one imagines the reader will be grateful.What the author does intend to do, however, is to present additional evidencethat so far has not been considered by mainstream journalists and researchers.This is evidence that may support one or more conspiracy theories, to be sure.The author feels that the conspiracy—if such existed—went much deeper than canbe traced through the witness testimony and what passed for forensics reports inthe Warren Commission Report. Like Peter Dale Scott,2[../Text/ch07.html#filepos1180226] the author believes in “deep politics,” i.e.,a layer of interrelationships that exists below the level of the simple facts ofthe case. In the author’s case, though, he believes that there is a layer belowProfessor Scott’s: a web of threads of cause and effect that run parallel attimes, perpendicular at others. To that end, the author has pulled at some ofthese threads—these “scarlet threads of murder” that run through history—and hasfound relationships that are, if anything, more incredible than those presentedin Oliver Stone’s film, JFK, or in some of the more popular books on theassassination. Yet, they are fact, and supported by ample documentation.THE CONCOURSE OF THE FORCESPerhaps the most famous, and most respected, of the “amateur” investigators ofthe assassination of President John F. Kennedy is Ms. Mary Ferrell. She has beenthe ultimate resource for many other journalists, historians, and conspiracytheorists over the past fifty years. She cross-referenced and indexed all thevolumes of the Warren Commission hearings, something which had never been donebefore, not even by the Commission itself, and thereby performed a vital serviceto all who would come after her. She also maintained a vast library ofnewsclippings, articles, journals, books, and transcripts that refer, in one wayor another, to the subject of the assassination. Recently, some of her work hasbeen published on CD-ROM, thereby giving researchers—particularly those like theauthor who lived at some geographical distance from the source material—anembarrassment of riches.What many don’t know, however, is that—until November 22, 1963— Mary Ferrell wasan occultist.In correspondence with the author, she spoke of her interest in the system ofceremonial magic practiced by the Golden Dawn, that British secret society thatspawned Aleister Crowley, William Butler Yeats, Arthur Edward Waite, and manyothers. She had been in correspondence with Francis Israel Regardie, anoccultist and author who had been Aleister Crowley’s personal assistant for someyears, and who published—to the grief and surprise of his brethren—the secretrituals of the Golden Dawn. Regardie himself was regarded as something of aresource to those in the New Age movement whose interest in the complex ritualsystems of ceremonial magic was whetted by the works of Crowley, Mathers,Parsons, Charles Stansfeld Jones, Louis Culling, and others. Even morestrangely, Regardie was initiated into a Rosicrucian group in Washington, D.C.in 1926, a group that leads us right to David Ferrie and from him to theassassination itself.Regardie had been in contact with a group of Golden Dawn hopefuls in Dallas inthe early 1960s; they had hoped to have Regardie teach them how to pronounce theHebrew words that are so much a staple of Golden Dawn and other Hermeticliterature. Regardie suggested they simply go to a local synagogue and getsomeone there to help them; but the Dallas group insisted and thus forked over a$500 per diem for two days, plus all expenses to bring Regardie to Dallas.Regardie made friends in Dallas that day, and had stayed in touch with themuntil the day he died.3 [../Text/ch07.html#filepos1180728]Mary Ferrell was thus, in the autumn of 1963, in position to become an importantperson in the community of magicians and occultists who came out of thetradition of Mathers, Crowley, et al. Had she devoted her energies to ceremonialmagic instead of to the assassination, she may have provided an extremelyvaluable service to that muddled mass of theories, rituals, and posturing thathas become modern ritual magic in America. Instead, she provided an even moreimportant service: tools for the analysis of the twentieth century’s mostcritical political murder.The desire to uncover mysteries and secrets is probably a manifestation of adeeper paranoia about the universe; but this paranoia may be a healthy thing. Asliterary critic Anatole Broyard once remarked, “Paranoids are the only ones whonotice anything anymore.” 4 [../Text/ch07.html#filepos1181287]Or, as CharlesManson once observed, “Total paranoia is total consciousness.”Rather than a symptom of mental illness, paranoia may be the psychologicalequivalent of physical pain: a mechanism to warn of danger to the organism. Inthe case of physical pain, the source is usually easily identifiable. In thecase of paranoia, the source is often invisible: an unnamed, sinister, force.The forces of darkness are inherently neither benign nor malevolent. They areunknown.> —Arthur Young 5 [../Text/ch07.html#filepos1181846]Actually, how could a reasonably intelligent person who was interested in thedeeper aspects of the occult—of which the Golden Dawn system is certainlyrepresentative—not be moved to study the details of the Kennedy assassination?The murder had taken on mythic proportions, even in the days immediatelyfollowing the event. The Kennedy administration had been referred to as“Camelot,” a reference of course to King Arthur and the Knights of the RoundTable, itself a symbol of deeper mysteries running the gamut from the Holy Grailto Joseph of Arimathea to Celtic magic and mysticism. Kennedy—the youngestPresident, the only Catholic President, husband of an attractive, sophisticatedwoman who graced the White House with famous artists, writers, musicians, thecultural elite of the day—had been murdered in front of crowds on a sunnyafternoon in Dallas, Texas. It seemed as if the best and the brightest had beenslain, a blood sacrifice on some unimaginable altar. It had all the hallmarks ofan archetypal event, like the Crucifixion. We know so little about what reallyhappened that day two thousand years ago atop Mount Golgotha, an event thatspawned a religion and countless sects, cults, and secret societies; and murder,pogrom, and torture; and music, art and literature—so that when a similar eventtakes place in our midst there are those who will mop up every detail, everyaspect of the case, like the witnesses at the decapitation of Charles I whosoaked his blood into their handkerchiefs as sacred relics. In case the readerbelieves the author is overstating his case, please remember all thosephotographs of Kennedy that adorned the apartments, shops and homes of peoplefrom North America to South America, from Europe to Asia, in the years after theassassination; usually placed next to a picture of Jesus or the Pope, it had aplace of honor tantamount to a Last Supper painting. Without being able toarticulate why, in many cases the average person—particularly the averageCatholic person—saw something divine, something terrible and sacred, in the ideaof the murdered President. All over the world, major streets and avenues andeven districts (such as “Kennedy” in Bogota, Colombia) were re-named in honor ofthe slain President. Kennedy was seen as a friend of the poor, and as a defenderof the disenfranchised of every race. Whether or not that was true in fact, itwas true in the minds of the people. And when his brother was assassinated, andMartin Luther King, Jr., it only seemed to justify the worship of the faithfuland the certain belief that forces of evil were behind the multiple killings.This was a belief that the anti-Kennedy forces had to contend with at theirperil, for they had nothing quite so strong in their arsenal. Except, maybe,fear. The author remembers the 1980 election campaign of Ronald Reagan andGeorge Bush, when anti-Republican demonstrators wore buttons that said, “ShootBush First,” and, “Where is Lee Harvey Oswald now that we need him?”There is a degree system in the Golden Dawn, as there is in Masonry and in manyother secret societies. One advances from degree to degree, from knowledge toknowledge, from experience to experience, under the guidance of those who havegone on before. The Golden Dawn professed to be the British branch of a Germansecret society, and the roots of that society were believed to have been derivedfrom the German Rosicrucian Society of the seventeenth century, and that societyto be a survival of the French Knights Templar of the fourteenth century, and soon back to the ancient Egyptians by way of the Gnostic Christians, the Islamichashishin, the Ethiopian Coptics, the Jewish Qabalists, the Arabian Sabeans andSolomon the King. The rituals of the Golden Dawn therefore harkened back to allof these influences, and the study materials and lectures offered detailedexegeses of many ancient mysteries with the ultimate goal of creating a newhuman, a perfected creation, the next step in the evolutionary ladder. They tookas their texts the Zohar, the Egyptian Coffin Texts and the Book of the Dead, aswell as the alchemical works of the English, the Greeks and the Arabs, the TurbaPhilosophorum and the Atalanta Fugiens, thePicatrix and The Book of the SacredMagic of Abramelin the Mage and The True and Faithful Relation of What PassedFor Many Years Between Dr. Dee and Some Spirits. And, as an underpinning to allof this and to demonstrate the internal consistency of their program, was asystem of correspondences.This system was a mathematically-based set of tables against which virtually anyobject, any event, any philosophical idea could be identified and so drawn intocomparison with other objects, events, ideas. Thus, one would find that thecolor red was related to the planet Mars, to blood, to iron, to certain herbs,to Tuesday, to the zodiacal sign of Aries, and so on. This system was predicatedon the belief that events are related by invisible threads of connection thatlink them in ways too subtle to be measured by the normal cause and effectparadigm with which we are all familiar. After all, this is also the conceptbehind astrology, the Chinese system of feng shui, and many another occult,spiritual or New Age fashion. One can point to the Jewish system of the Qabalaas the forerunner of this system in the West. The Qabala was a means of findinghidden relationships between words, based on their numerical equivalents; it wasused to find secret messages in the Torah, for instance, or to create talismansand amulets. It was a method of assigning meaning to number, and this systemformed the grammar and the algorithm for the Golden Dawn rituals, attaining itsapotheosis in the Book of the Concourse of the Forces, which is an astonishingsystem of merging the Qabala with astrology, the Tarot, geomancy and otheroccult disciplines on the schema of John Dee’s Elizabethan era Enochian system.6 [../Text/ch07.html#filepos1182276]It was also a theater of memory and a meansof controlling memory to the point that altered states of consciousness wouldresult; a use of memory that goes beyond basic survival requirements and extendsto the creation of a new way of perceiving reality, a new prioritizing ofmemories.The goal of all this, the ultimate initiation in the Golden Dawn system, was theAdeptus Minor Ritual, which involved the crucifixion of the initiate (with ropesinstead of nails) and a representation of the tomb of Christian Rosenkreutz, theputative founder of the Rosicrucian Order. It is a ritual symbolic of rebirthbut, even more than that, it mimics the death and resurrection of the initiatein psychological terms so that those who undergo the ceremony are not merelyacting parts in a strange play with no audience, but are experiencing profoundpsychological—if not spiritual—changes. It also unites the initiate with thewhole history of his tradition, going back through all of those grimoires andspellbooks, all that gematria and incantation, all that sacred geometry, until akarmic balance has been achieved between the actions of the initiate’s life (orlives) and the life to come, the life he will lead. The cross on which he hasbeen crucified fixes him at a specific point in space and time, bleeds him ofkarmic debt, fixes him like the alchemists fixed mercury, so that he becomes theengine of his own transformation, his own X and Y axis, the center of his owndimension and, as such, the center of all dimensions. What is death andresurrection, after all, but a conquering—an abrogation—of the linear,unidirectional flow of time, and thus of space as well? And the extension ofthose parameters by the Young-ian quantum of force?This crucifixion ritual would be mirrored in a ceremony that was performed byCharles Manson in Box Canyon near the Spahn Ranch in 1968, while he was underthe influence of LSD. Charlie and his group had visited the headquarters thereof a cult known as the Fountain of the World. This religion had been founded bya Francis Heindswatzer Pencovic, who renamed himself Krishna Venta. The grouppracticed a form of Christianity, and followed a strict celibacy rule (strict,that is, except for Krishna Venta himself). Disaffected followers who accusedhim of committing adultery with their wives killed him and nine of his followerswith explosives on December 10, 1958, planting the dynamite in catacombs hiddenbeneath the church’s complex. Photographs of the group show women dressed asnuns and sporting crosses, and in some cases washing the feet of male members ála Mary Magdalene.7 [../Text/ch07.html#filepos1182745] Charlie was impressed bythe group’s dedication, and attempted to test their sincerity by sending hisgirls in to lure the members away from their vows of celibacy, a ruse that didnot work.Close to the sect’s complex was a hill in the shape of a skull and a woodencross planted atop it, in imitation of Golgotha. Charlie decided to re-enact theCrucifixion with himself as the central character. He dropped acid. Hisfollowers tied him to the cross, jeered and humiliated him, and thensymbolically killed him. They later celebrated his resurrection with an act ofgroup sex.Indirectly, as America’s first acid pusher, the CIA had provided this barelyliterate Messiah-manqué with a quick fix on the cosmic cross; and, like theother psychic roadkill who make up the rolls of the Agency’s unwitting testsubjects, he was unprepared for the experience and wound up spinning like animbalanced top over the California landscape of starlets, sunshine and sex. Wehave no idea what went through Manson’s mind—or soul—during that ritual, but wecan judge its after-effects. Manson was reared for a while by extremelyreligious relatives in West Virginia, and this when he was not even ofkindergarten age. He was made to wear a dress to his first day at school,because his uncle thought he was a sissy. He was humiliated and jeered in reallife, and was made to listen to sermons on Christian values and Biblicalmythology. Then, he was sent to reform school after reform school and prisonafter prison. What an initiate of the Golden Dawn would have internalized, aspart of the degree system and the gradual awakening of spiritual understanding,Manson experienced in the outer world. He then “fixed” these experiences—thesenegative, often horrifying and hideous experiences—in the ritual of theCrucifixion (while under the influence of a potent hallucinogen), without anymeans of neutralizing their effects or understanding them, or coming to termswith them in some positive way. Every humiliation he suffered, every rape in theprison system, every beating, every torment, was crystalized in the ritual,formalized, made—in a sense—permanent and unchanging. In the terms of a GoldenDawn-style perspective, he had become a “black brother” (ironically enough), afollower of the “left-hand path,” and he didn’t even know it.They never do.At times he called himself “Jesus,” or “God,” or whatever else came to mind. Hispower over his followers, however, began long before the crucifixion in BoxCanyon, a control that was likened by one follower to Pavlov’s Dogs, and byanother to machinery in the minds of his followers that Charlie could control,like throwing a switch. But this degree of control did not contribute tohappiness on Charlie’s part, and he began to deteriorate, and to talk aboutapocalypse and armageddon.\"THE PROBLEM IS NOT YOUR BED, MRS. MCNEIL.\"For a while, back in the 1960s, much was made of the similarities between theAbraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy assassinations. We may call thesesimilarities “coincidences,” but perhaps Jung’s “synchronicities” would be abetter description. In any case, the number and type of similarities between thetwo cases beggars a simple description of coincidence. For instance, Lincoln hada secretary named Kennedy who advised him not to go to the theatre that fatefulday; Kennedy had a secretary named Lincoln who advised him not to go to Dallas.Abraham Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1847; Kennedy in 1947. Lincoln waselected president in 1860, Kennedy in 1960. Lincoln was succeeded by AndrewJohnson, who was born in 1808; Kennedy by Lyndon Johnson who was born in 1908.Both presidents died on a Friday. There are even more such coincidences, but thereader gets the general idea.To a scientist, as well as to a historian, these are meaningless similarities.They are accidents of history. A scientist—if pressed—would look for otherdetails that are not common to both Presidents, and then use that information todiscredit the above catalogue. Lincoln was assassinated in 1865; Kennedy in1963. Lincoln’s wife was named Mary Todd; Kennedy’s wife was Jacqueline Bouvier.See? No coincidences there. And what about the other two American Presidents whowere assassinated? How many Americans even remember they were, or who they were?Why do Americans only remember Lincoln and Kennedy?In the end, what do coincidences mean, anyway?That they may be elements of a deeper web of connectivity between events inspace and time (something suggested by Carl Jung, and ascribed to by physicistWolfgang Pauli, among others) is too ephemeral an explanation for a traditionalscientist, who would say that it properly belongs to that category ofsuperstition that includes four-leaf clovers, rabbits’ feet and the PsychicHotline. What it will take perhaps another century or more to comprehend fullyis that the assassination of President Kennedy was a modern-day crucifixion, abloody sacrifice replete with iconic resonance. The cultural motif of themurdered President as a “slain king” was made clear in Kevin Costner’s closingargument in his role as New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison in OliverStone’s JFK. While there may be no overt religious overtones to the Kennedyassassination, there is a deep uneasiness about it; an uneasiness that becamemore pronounced with the murder of his brother in 1968, about the time ofManson’s self-inflicted crucifixion in Box Canyon. The eerie set of similaritiesbetween the lives of Lincoln and Kennedy, therefore, is evidence of a much widerphenomenon that is screaming for our attention, even as it lurks beneath thethreshold of consciousness, “dead, but dreaming,” like a chthonic monster out ofLovecraft or Arthur Machen.> I discover with surprise to what extent I had judged and admired my new> country through Kennedy’s actions. This brutal death reminds me of the> existence of a volcano of violent realities underneath the orderly unfolding> of our best plans. The real Beyond is not that which follows death but that> which stretches underneath life itself. In this sense the saucers are a> potential source of cultural and strategic upheaval, just like yesterday’s> killing in Dallas. Just as in Dallas, we are dreadfully unprepared.> —Jacques Vallee, Diary 23 November 1963 8 [../Text/ch07.html#filepos1183226]There is a famous moment in the film version of The Exorcist in which apsychiatrist tries to reassure the mother of the possessed Regan that herdaughter is suffering from a temporal lobe disorder. Her mother insists that thewhole bed was shaking and lifting off the floor. The psychiatrist says thatmuscle tremors are common in such disorders. Her mother insists that these werenot tremors, that the whole bed was moving. The psychiatrist ignores thisunacceptable evidence, and insists that everything is the result of a temporallobe disorder, uttering the priceless line, “The problem is not your bed, Mrs.McNeil.”Which is another way of saying that the drunk was looking for his keys under alamppost (even though he lost them across the street) because the light wasbetter there.In a way, the approach of science to date has been admirable. By ignoring thesupernatural explanation, science has tried to let us keep control over ourlives, to hold our destiny firmly in our own hands, to empower us and not blameFate or Kismet or God’s Will or a poor alignment of stars for the evil that doesoccur; but by taking all credibility or culpability away from the Infant in theManger, God, Buddha, a malefic conjunction of planets or just bad vibes, theyhave thrown the Baby out with the bathwater. If we refuse to believe that aconspiracy of CIA agents, Cuban refugees, Mafia hitmen, or some combination ofthese had arranged the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas, then we areforced to come up with some other explanation for the appearance of Lee HarveyOswald—like some phantom squadron of UFOs—on everyone’s radar: at CIA, the FBI,the Office of Naval Intelligence, Army intelligence, the Secret Service, Russianintelligence, anti-Castro Cubans, pro-Castro Cubans, right-wing extremists,homosexual cultists, private detectives and even the Civil Air Patrol. We areforced, that is, to find another reason why the relationships exist.ON THE TRAIL OF THE ASSASSINSWhile the inventor, psychic researcher, astrologer, Zen enthusiast and member ofthe original Nine, Arthur Young, was writing The Reflexive Universe in the quietof his home in the Philadelphia suburb of Paoli in August of 1963, his wife wasentertaining their daughter-in-law, Ruth Hyde Paine.Ruth Hyde had married Michael Paine—Ruth Forbes Young’s son by her previousmarriage to George Lyman Paine—on December 28, 1957 in a Quaker ceremony inPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania. Ruth Hyde’s background alone is suggestive: herfather had been employed by the Agency for International Development (AID),which was a well-known CIA front and which lost a few overseas officials to actsof terrorism, including the famous case of Dan Mitrione in Uruguay. Herbrother-in-law—based in Washington, D.C.—was also employed by AID.9[../Text/ch07.html#filepos1183710] Ruth Hyde had been working in Philadelphiawhen she met Michael. Upon their marriage, she moved in with Michael, RuthForbes Young and Arthur Young at their home in Paoli, where the couple remaineduntil the summer of 1959, Michael working directly for Arthur Young in hisstepfather’s barn… building model helicopters. This part of the story soundsquite strange. According to his Warren Commission testimony, Michael Paine setup shop in Arthur Young’s barn (sometime in the early 1950s) and started workingfor himself. The nature of this work was not clarified, nor why Michael Painewould have been using Arthur Young’s barn to “work for himself.” Eventually,Arthur hired Michael to make model helicopters for him. This sounds suspiciouslylike make-work, since Arthur Young by this time had given up on helicopterdesign and was involved full-time in mystical pursuits. The other problem withMichael Paine’s testimony is that he cannot give dates; he does not know when hebegan working for Bell Helicopter, he doesn’t have a firm grasp of when he leftschool, joined the Army, re-enrolled in university, or anything else about hispast. Nor is he aware of what level of security clearance he has at Bell. Infact, he cannot even remember what year he married Ruth Hyde! He has furtherlapses of memory throughout his testimony; anything to do with his relationshipto Ruth Hyde Paine becomes vague and ephemeral.What we do know with some certainty is that Michael Paine—a native of New YorkCity—graduated from high school in 1947. He then went to Harvard for two years,but had to drop out, as he was failing academically. That would have been in1949. His mother had married Arthur Young in 1948, while Michael was doing hisfirst year at Harvard.At some point, he wound up working for a nuclear research firm, the BartolResearch Foundation at Swarthmore, doing something vague with machines, whileattempting to finish a bachelor’s degree. He claims that he would have been inthe class of 1953 at Swarthmore, had he stayed in school. With two years atHarvard already accomplished (and for which he probably received credit atSwarthmore) that puts him there in 1951, but according to his testimony he onlyworked about a year at Bartol before leaving for the Army.He spent two years in the Army, and was sent to Korea. This would have beenduring the height of the Korean War. There is no indication in his testimonybefore the Commission about what his duties were or even what his rank mighthave been. It seems odd that his war record was not read into the transcript, orthat an attempt to get accurate dates out of him was not strenuously mounted bysomeone at the Commission, but so it goes.At one point, he is saved from embarrassment—or inadvertent revelation—by AllenDulles. When Michael Paine is asked about his duties at Bell Helicopter, thefollowing exchange takes place:> Mr. LIEBELER—Have you been engaged in that type of work for Bell throughout?> Mr. PAINE—I have been in the research laboratory research group that long. It> has all been problems –> Mr. DULLES—Are you a helicopter pilot by any chance yourself?The reader is left with this tantalizing bit of personal anecdote interrupted bya typical Dulles non-sequitur, of which there are quite a few when it comes tothe Paines. The question of Michael Paine’s work at Bell never comes up again.This will happen several more times during Ruth Paine’s testimony.Michael and Ruth Paine moved to Irving, Texas (a Dallas suburb) in 1959 andsomehow had two children. By September 1962, Michael and Ruth were separated butstill on good terms. She was thirty years old. He was thirty-four. They would beofficially divorced in 1971.Michael Paine had managed to get a job at his stepfather’s old firm, BellHelicopter, at a branch facility they had in Fort Worth, Texas. One can onlyimagine that this job was due to his stepfather’s influence at Bell, sinceMichael’s work record is spotty and he had no college degree. Michael Paine’sjob was essentially the same as the one he had at Arthur Young’s barn: buildingmodel helicopters. At this time, Bell’s R&D was being run by the former NaziGeneral Walter Dornberger, whom me met earlier as a scientist brought to the USunder Operation Paperclip along with more than 1,000 other German scientists,many of whom were suspected of being committed Nazis, including both Dornbergerand his protégé, Wernher von Braun. (This association has given rise to muchspeculation that somehow the Nazis themselves were behind the Kennedyassassination. While this may be an exaggeration, there is no lack of Naziinfluence in and around the events leading up to—and away from—theassassination.)Ruth Paine met Lee Harvey Oswald and his wife, Marina, at a party in HighlandPark, Texas (a short drive from Irving) on February 22, 1963. Ruth at this stageof her life was a Quaker, having converted in the first few months of 1951; hermother was a Unitarian minister. As one reads her Warren Commission testimony,it becomes obvious that religion was important in her life at that time, andliving in close proximity to Arthur Young for almost two years something of hisinterest in spirituality must have rubbed off. Ruth Paine was also interested inlearning Russian—a politically-suspect language to study in 1963—and interestedas well in square-dancing and madrigal-singing. (The reader should be remindedthat television programming was relatively spare in 1960s Dallas.) These variedinterests had her joining several different groups and making friends over awide spectrum of the population, including the White Russian émigré community.The Oswalds were brought to the party by the De Mohrenschildts.George de Mohrenschildt is one of the most enigmatic characters in the entireassassination scenario. A White Russian himself, a petroleum engineer, anentrepreneur, a world traveler, multilingual, suspected of Nazi sentiments, hecooperated with American intelligence on more than one occasion in his life. Hismotives for introducing the Oswalds to the Paines is unclear. He has told thestory several different ways. When finally he was about to be brought before theHouse Sub-Committee on Assassinations in 1977 to tell the whole story, hecommitted suicide or, as some theorists insist, was murdered; it is true thatthe forensic evidence is suspicious, but either way—suicide or murder—the eventis sufficiently alarming and suggestive of deeper, darker secrets.Marina Oswald—who spoke very little English—was invited to stay with Ruth Paineat her home in Irving, along with Marina’s child. This way, according to RuthPaine, they could swap language lessons (a plan that seems to have beenabandoned immediately after Marina moved in). Lee Oswald would go to New Orleansto seek work, and during that time he became modestly famous for about a weekdue to his “Fair Play for Cuba” leafletting and subsequent media appearance.When he returned to Dallas, he took up residence in a rooming house, once RuthPaine had managed to network him into the Texas School Book Depository, andMarina remained with Ruth at Irving. When the assassination occurred, it was thePaines who led the police officers to the place (and the blanket) where Lee hadsupposedly stored his Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.In fact, Ruth Paine was more than helpful. Much of the evidence that wouldeventually damn Oswald in the eyes of the Warren Commission (and the public)came from Ruth Paine: some of the famous photographs of Oswald posing with therifle and copies of a Communist newspaper, the “spy camera,” the fake AlexHidell documents, and much else besides. There is even a growing body ofevidence that Michael Paine’s father—George Lyman Paine, who was a Trotskyiteleader in California—had intelligence connections that led straight back toWilliam Buckley, Jr. and E. Howard Hunt, through one James Burnham, who wasGeorge Paine’s colleague in the Trotskyite party to which they both belonged,and who was also a consultant to the CIA and a friend of E. Howard Hunt ofWatergate “Plumber” fame. E. Howard Hunt himself had no little interest in theoccult, and was the author of three occult novels (as well as numerous spynovels) under various pseudonyms; one of the occult stories was athinly-disguised attack on the Kennedy family. He even lived on “witchesIsland.” Hunt, it may be remembered, was one of those CIA agents in charge ofthe Bay of Pigs invasion, and thus no lover of Jack Kennedy. He also has had ahard time accounting for his whereabouts on November 22, 1963.The full story of Ruth and Michael Paine has never been told. Michael Paineadmitted that on the day of the assassination itself, he was discussingpolitical assassinations with some co-workers in the Bell cafeteria when theannouncement came that the President had been shot. Another coincidence?Perhaps. Michael Paine—assuredly aware of his stepfather’s occultinterests—actually made a joking remark to the Commission that perhaps it wasESP that led him to engage a co-worker in a discussion of the nature ofpolitical assassins, but since neither one of them actually knew any politicalassassins the topic was dropped. Rather than ESP, was it that perhapsunderachiever Michael Paine was bursting to reveal a secret?It was Michael Paine who took Oswald to his first ACLU meeting. It was alsoMichael Paine who took Oswald to his first John Birch Society meeting. It wasMichael Paine who engaged Oswald in political discussions in front of witnesses.During his wife’s testimony before the Warren Commission, several unusualmoments took place which may have meant nothing at the time, but which raisesome questions in the author’s mind today.For instance, early in her testimony to the Warren Commission, Ruth Paineadmitted that at one point Lee Harvey Oswald was considering going toPhiladelphia. As soon as she mentioned Philadelphia, Allen Dulles chimed in andopined that it was presumably to find work, to which Ruth replied in theaffirmative. That is what is known as “leading the witness.” Philadelphia, ofcourse, is where Arthur and Ruth Young lived, and Ruth had a habit of going upthere every year in the summer... as she did in the summer of 1963. Did ArthurYoung invite the young Marine defector to his wooded estate in Paoli? Or hadRuth Paine made an inadvertent slip one day in front of Lee that she was relatedby marriage to the famous inventor of the Bell helicopter? Or did Michael, whoafter all worked for Bell? The relationship between the Paines and Arthur Youngis never mentioned, never examined, in the Warren Commission hearings except tonote that Michael’s mother married someone named Arthur Young.Dulles becomes helpful to Ruth Paine’s testimony on more than one occasion. Eachtime her Russian language tutor is mentioned, Dulles heads off the line ofquestioning by asking something else before Ruth can answer. This happens firston page 467 of Volume II of the Warren Commission Hearings, and then again onpage 473. Then, when Ruth Paine mentions that she thought of getting herhusband, Michael, to put Marina Oswald on his tax return as a dependent so thatshe could earn some additional income—a suggestion that caused no end of mirthamong the assembled Officers of the Court due to its stunning admission ofillegality—it was Dulles who came in like the cavalry to paint Ruth Paine’smotives in a purely altruistic light.When the Commission finally did get around to asking Ruth Paine about herRussian language tutor, Dulles was conveniently absent from the hearings thatday.Why would Dulles take such a particular interest in Ruth Paine if, in fact, hedid? Was he afraid that something said about the Russian language tutor in hispresence would reflect badly on him later on? Was he aware of Ruth Paine’saugust family connections back in Philadelphia? Or did it have something to dowith Michael Paine?In fact, all of the above reasons may be valid. He certainly knew Michael andRuth Paine, and perhaps should have recused himself from their part of thetestimony in the first place; there is certainly no mention by Dulles in thetwenty-six volumes of the Warren Commission Hearings that he knew the Painessocially, but it seems clear that he had to have known of them if not known themto talk to. He knew Ruth Young, and he knew a very close and personal friend ofRuth Young: Ms. Mary Bancroft.Mary Bancroft has written an autobiography, and she describes this relationshipin some detail. She had been the mistress of Allen Dulles for some twenty years,and had also been the mistress of Henry Luce (of Time-Life, where the Zapruderfilm of the Kennedy assassination wound up) for about the same length of time.She knew Dulles from the War years in Europe, when he was running the OSSoperation out of Switzerland (Dulles knew E. Howard Hunt and Richard Helms atthis time, as well). It was a relationship that lasted for decades, and of whichDulles’ wife, Clover, was probably aware, as she was of his other infidelities.Mary Bancroft was a good friend of Ruth Forbes, which meant of course that sheknew her children as well. Thus, it beggars belief to think that Allen Dulleswas not acutely aware of the Paines, the Youngs, and their relationship to LeeHarvey Oswald.Ruth Paine visited the Youngs in Paoli, Pennsylvania in mid-August 1963, aftervisiting the Naushon Island (Wood’s Hole, Massachusetts) home of the Paine sideof the family from July 31 to August 12. She then returned to Dallas, andinvited Marina Oswald to stay with her while Marina was pregnant with theOswald’s second child. (At the same time, according to his testimony, MichaelPaine had gone to Los Angeles to visit his father, the Trotskyite.) We may beforgiven if we assume that Ruth Paine discussed the Oswalds with Arthur and RuthYoung during this period. The Oswalds had stayed with her in the spring of1963—during the time of Oswald’s putative assassination attempt on right-wingextremist General Walker—and Ruth Paine was thinking up ways to have Marina movein with her again, even going so far as to find additional funds by cheating onMichael’s income tax return. Marina happily moved in with Ruth Paine at thelatter’s home in Irving, Texas, and was there through the birth of her secondchild and right up to the day of the assassination of President Kennedy.As noted above, Ruth Paine was more than helpful to the authorities who camecalling as soon as Lee Oswald was identified on the day of the assassination. Itwas Ruth Paine who provided some of the most damaging circumstantial evidenceagainst Oswald. It was also Ruth Paine who dragged her feet on getting LeeOswald legal representation, even though both she and her husband were membersof the ACLU. Ruth Paine the Quaker, Ruth Paine the liberal activist, Ruth Painethe pacifist who was studying Russian and writing letters to pen pals in theSoviet Union, hoping to bridge the gap between the two superpowers and promotepeace, Ruth Paine the folk-dancing, madrigal-singing, friend of the oppressed…refusing to help the husband of stranded Russian immigrant Marina Oswald, andthe father of Marina Oswald’s two infant children, get legal representation?When Ruth Paine’s Russian language tutor—the elderly Mrs. Dorothy Gravitis, aLatvian—was deposed before the Commission, she revealed an interesting piece ofinformation. A woman whose history parallels that of many Latvians in the secondhalf of the twentieth century, she had been born in Latvia when it was part ofRussian territory under the Czars; it became independent in 1918, at the time ofthe Revolution. It later became annexed to Russia in 1940, was invaded by theNazis shortly thereafter, and then in 1944 Mrs. Gravitis herself wound up inGermany in a camp along with many other Displaced Persons (DPs), and eventuallymanaged to emigrate to the United States in late 1949.She taught Ruth Paine only two official classes at Berlitz, but remained afriend of hers in Texas and taught her privately after that. Ruth asked her tocheck on Marina when the former was out of town, in May of 1963 when she wasevidently in San Antonio. Mrs. Gravitis spoke with Marina on the phone twice,and never met her, but they discussed Lee from a perspective that should havebeen very disturbing to the Commission, but which seems to have been passedover.When asked by the Commission why she decided to distance herself from Marinabefore the assassination, she said it was because of Marina’s remarks concerningLee Oswald. Marina had used a very specific term in Russian to describe Lee’spolitical beliefs. This word is not easily translatable into English, and herinterpreter—Mamantov—had difficulty with it. It is a word that signifies thatLee was in the second phase of becoming a member of the Communist Party, thephase where he had to prove himself to the Party in some material way. In theSoviet Union of Mrs. Gravitis’ experience, that usually meant spying.What many Americans never realize about both the Soviet Union and the People’sRepublic of China is that there have been actually very few members—percapita—of the Communist Party in each country. To be a Party member is to be oneof the elite class, and to lose Party membership is tantamount to social as wellas political suicide. Thus, the requirements for attaining Party membership wereusually quite strict, and a demonstration of Communist loyalty and zeal wasrequired before one could be given a Party card. Within the Soviet Union (as inChina), this usually meant spying on your neighbors, your co-workers, even yourown family to discover anti-Communist actions or beliefs. You would then reportall of this to the Party member in charge of your advancement, like a catshowing up with a dead mouse. What Marina was telling Mrs. Gravitis, then, wasthat Oswald was in this second phase.Marina may simply have been bragging or exaggerating for the benefit of old Mrs.Gravitis (who was in her seventies at the time and who had had a hard life inLatvia, Russia, Nazi Germany, and New York City, where she worked cleaningfloors, and finally in Texas). Whatever the truth of the matter was, Gravitisdecided she wanted nothing to do with Lee Oswald, afraid that he was spying onthe Russian émigré community in Texas on behalf of the Soviets. Since the lastthing the Warren Commission wanted was evidence linking Oswald to theKGB—evidence that might have precipitated a Third World War—this aspect of thecase was downplayed or ignored.Another possibility, also never followed up, is that Oswald told Marina thisstory in order to direct her away from his real activities, which also includedspying not on the White Russian community but for a faction of the USgovernment.As former CIA officer Victor Marchetti revealed in an interview to assassinationresearcher Anthony Summers, the US Navy’s Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) hada program in place in the 1960s to place phony defectors in the Soviet Union.These included between thirty and forty young men who were “made to appeardisenchanted, poor, American youths who had become turned off and wanted to seewhat communism was all about.” 10 [../Text/ch07.html#filepos1184180]From everyindication, it would appear that the twenty-year-old Oswald fit the profileexactly. Add to that the fact that the period in which he defected was a time ofnumerous defections of US military and intelligence personnel to the SovietUnion, and the shoe fits.This is not to say that Oswald was a James Bond. In fact, he was a poor,probably disenchanted American. He was also quite young. He would not have beengiven a strenuous assignment, such as running agents. He might have been made toserve other purposes, about which we can only conjecture. Yet, he was proficientenough in Russian at the age of twenty to indicate a reasonably highintelligence (Ruth Paine had studied Russian for years and obviously never gotthe hang of it… or so she said. The author, who can make his way in a variety ofEuropean and Asian tongues, can attest that Russian is one of the most difficultto learn). His erstwhile friend, the White Russian George de Mohrenschildt,found Oswald to be intelligent and well-spoken; it was also de Mohrenschildtwho, it was later discovered, was reporting on Oswald to American intelligencein the months prior to the assassination; it is also de Mohrenschildt who, fromhis writings and remarks to various investigators and journalists, gives theimpression that he was saddened—perhaps even guilty—about what happened toOswald. There is a great deal of evidence—all of it circumstantial—that Oswaldmay have been working for American intelligence (or some faction thereof) rightup to the end of his life. The author will not go into all of that here, ofcourse.Dulles may have already known what Dorothy Gravitis would say from othersources. As a Russian immigrant in the United States, Gravitis was vulnerable toall sorts of pressure from other Russians (and Latvians) in the United States atthat time who were agitating for an American assault on the motherland toliberate it from Soviet control. The White Russian community in the UnitedStates had rallied around the Russian Orthodox Church and around several ersatzpolitical groups that held parades and other conscious-ness-raising eventsaround the country. These groups were often so extreme in their anti-Communismthat they were pro-Nazi and, indeed, the Russian Orthodox Church in New YorkCity was a center of Russian fascism. The Orthodox Church had split into severalfactions after the Russian Revolution of 1917. One group remained loyal toMoscow, through duress; this was the Patriarchate of Moscow which, of course,was headquartered in Russia and had to make accommodations with the Soviets tosurvive. They maintained a cathedral on West Ninety-Seventh Street in New Yorkwhich was well-known as a conduit for KGB agents coming to the United States,agents disguised as priests.Another group was the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia—usually referred toas the Synod—which was based on Park Avenue at Ninety-Third Street. Thiscommunity was supported by the Romanovs and other escaped Russian royalty. Thisgroup was—during World War II—pro-Nazi, seeing in the Nazis potential liberatorsof the motherland.The CIA and other political and intelligence organizations made use of thesegroups to run agents, gather information, or whatever could be valuable to thecause. Psychological warfare officers were familiar with the main characters inthe Russian Orthodox scenario, and Radio Free Europe (an acknowledged CIA front)would broadcast religious messages into the Communist bloc on behalf of variousChristian groups, but especially the Synod.This use of Orthodox churches in the fight against Communism was more widespreadthan most Americans realize, simply because to them the Eastern Orthodox churchis too ethnic, too mysterious to understand. Eventually, though, such famousnames in the Kennedy assassination investigation as David Ferrie would berevealed as players in this strange underworld of archaic ritual, deadlanguages, and wandering bishops.Dulles was aware of all of this, of course. Support of the Eastern churches wasan essential element of the Cold War, as they provided a moral and culturalcontext for the fight against the Soviet Union. Rather than try to explain whydialectical materialism is flawed, or how putting the means of production in thehands of the State is doomed to failure, it was far easier to say that theSoviets were “Godless,” were atheists bent on destroying Christ’s church. Thismeant that the struggle against Communism was a war of Light against Darkness.In addition, the misguided attempt by the Soviets to completely eradicatecertain of the ethnic minorities—such as the Ukrainians—by prohibitingpublications in their native tongues was an attack on the cultural heritage ofmillions. The Eastern churches were repositories of not only Christianity, butalso of ethnic culture, since each Eastern church celebrates its rituals in thevernacular of its people and is a repository for their traditions; thus, theceremonies of the Greek Orthodox Church are in Greek, of the Syrian OrthodoxChurch in Arabic, of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Ukrainian, etc.The possibility that Mrs. Gravitis—or her interpreter-son Mamantov— might havebeen allied with one or another of the anti-Communist underground organizationsin Texas must have occurred to Dulles, if he did not actually know of thisbeforehand. He would not have wanted to reveal the CIA’s interest in—and supportof—these groups in an open forum, and this might have been one reason why hekept changing the subject when Ruth Paine mentioned the tutor, in essencekeeping her from saying her name while Dulles was present.This—admittedly circumstantial—piece of evidence, coupled with Dulles’ omissionof his prior acquaintance with Michael and Ruth Paine, as well as theCommission’s not firmly establishing Michael Paine’s curriculum vitae orfollowing up on his war record, or delving more closely into the background ofArthur Young, indicates the presence of a hidden agenda. The author would liketo propose that the connection to Arthur Young through the Paines is a smokinggun, indicative of another level of covert activity that has not been exploredby the Warren Commission or by the later House Sub-Committee on Assassinations(HSCA). Arthur Young’s travels with Andrija Puharich to Mexico and elsewhere,and his long support of Puharich’s Round Table Foundation, as well as hisinclusion in the first “séance of The Nine,” may reveal an intelligenceoperation—a truly bizarre intelligence operation—that is connected to the Oswaldaffair. Puharich, as we have seen, was working for either Army intelligence, theCIA, or more probably some combination of the two, out of Fort Detrick, whichwas a staging ground for both. Although Arthur Young’s interest in theparanormal was very probably innocent and well-meaning—as so many of hisadmirers will insist—that is not to say that he did not cooperate withgovernment agencies when he could, or when he was asked to do so, Puharich beingthe first known example. There is a tantalizing lack of published informationabout Arthur Young’s life between 1952, when he founded something called theFoundation for the Study of Consciousness in Philadelphia, and 1973, when hefounded the Institute for the Study of Consciousness in Berkeley. We know of hisrelationship to Puharich, but only in a very sketchy form; we know that he wasMichael Paine’s stepfather and, by extension, Ruth Paine’s father-in-law; weknow that Michael Paine worked for Arthur Young at the same time that ArthurYoung was working with Puharich. Further, we know that Michael Paine’s mother(Arthur Young’s wife) was a close friend and confidant of Allen Dulles’mistress, Mary Bancroft. This incestuous tangle of friends, lovers, relatives,mothers, sons, in-laws, coworkers and intelligence agents is an aspect of theKennedy assassination that has never been adequately investigated. How odd thatthe legacy of Robert Treat Paine—a signer of the Declaration of Independence andthus one of America’s Founding Fathers—should have trickled down to a MichaelPaine, a friend of the accused assassin of an American president.There is another strange aspect to the question of the Paines that is worth abrief look, even though it is perhaps too bizarre to take seriously. One of themost mysterious of the many Aleister Crowley mysteries is that of a section ofhis famous Book of the Law, specifically Book Two, Verse 76. This verse reads,76.4 6 3 8 A B K 2 4 A L G M O R 3 Y X 24 89 R P S T O V A L.What meanest this, o prophet? Thou knowest not; nor shalt thou know ever.The verse is commonly referred to—by Thelemites—as “R P Stoval” after the lastgroup of letters. No one knows what it means, although many have claimed todecode the enigmatic phrase.A photograph found in the Paine home—a photograph of a ’57 Chevrolet in thedriveway of General Walker, the man Oswald is supposed to have fired upon andmissed in the weeks leading up to the assassination—was mutilated. The licenseplate had been removed from the photo so that it would be impossible toidentify. The Dallas detective who seized the photo from the Paine home and putit into evidence claimed that it was already mutilated; Marina Oswald deniedthis and later evidence—a photo of the photo, to be precise—shows that Marinawas telling the truth. The photograph when it came into custody of the Dallaspolice was intact; someone in the department must have chopped the licensenumber out of the picture.The Dallas police detective who confiscated the photo and who subsequently liedby stating that it arrived in his possession in its mutilated state was one R.B. Stovall. In addition, Oswald worked for a photographic firm in Dallas thathad Defense Department contracts: Jaggers-Chiles-Stovall. The job had beenarranged for Oswald by George de Mohrenschildt. 11[../Text/ch07.html#filepos1184647]In de Mohrenschildt’s entire existence, as with so much else surrounding Oswald,we seem to be looking at a kind of voodoo.> —Dick Russell, The Man Who Knew Too Much 12 [../Text/ch07.html#filepos1184934]Is any of this data meaningful in a forensic sense? Does it reveal the truthabout what happened in Dallas in 1963? Perhaps, perhaps not. But if, in somefuture decade, the evidence given above is shown to be not relevant to theactual murder of the President, then to what is it relevant? For it challengesevery definition of cause and effect to ignore the above relationships and callthem “coincidence.” The point of the author is that these relationships cannotbe ignored: that they are the spoor of some darker mechanism of history, of whatwe call reality, and that an understanding of world events is impossible withoutacknowledging their existence and seeking their underlying meaning.HOW TO BECOME A BISHOP WITHOUT BEING RELIGIOUSOn the opposite side of the psychic scale from Arthur Young is the strange,intense figure of David Ferrie. Made memorable by Joe Pesci’s performance inOliver Stone’s JFK, Ferrie was an improbable person. Had a novelist inventedhim, the genre would have to be either science-fiction or fantasy, or perhapssomething avant-garde and experimental. In actuality, everything one reads aboutFerrie is usually understatement. An Eastern Airlines pilot, an amateur cancerresearcher, possibly an anti-Castro gunrunner and certainly (by his ownadmission) an associate of Sergio Arcacha Smith of the anti-Castro undergroundas well as of Mafia overlord Carlos Marcello, he was also in charge of LeeHarvey Oswald’s old Civil Air Patrol unit in Louisiana. He had no facial hair atall, due to a condition known as alopecia, so he would paste on false eyebrowsin a shocking shade of red and wear a red wig. (One is reminded of an episodeduring the Watergate affair when E. Howard Hunt borrowed a voice modifier and ared wig from CIA supply. An homage?) Ferrie came to the attention of DistrictAttorney Jim Garrison when the latter was ramping up his investigation into NewOrleans’ connection with the Kennedy assassination. Ferrie’s name had beendropped as a friend of both Guy Banister and Lee Harvey Oswald by one JackMartin, who worked for Guy Banister (he of the FBI UFO files) as some sort ofersatz investigator. Martin himself had worked with Ferrie on an investigationinvolving diploma mills and fraudulent ecclesiastical papers. Well, they claimedit was an investigation. It was obviously more than that. It seems that bothMartin and Ferrie were only too happy to acquire these paper dignitiesthemselves. Ferrie and Martin had both come to the attention of the WarrenCommission briefly, and then were dropped as suspects. They both came under JimGarrison’s microscope later on, but Ferrie died before he could testify.Garrison claimed that Ferrie was one of the most important people in history,but that might have been hyperbole. He was certainly one of the strangest.One of the intriguing aspects of the Ferrie case to the author—and to very fewothers—was his membership in a church and his status as a bishop. This rangalarm bells, since the author himself has direct and personal experience of thechurch to which Ferrie was admitted and in which he was consecrated.This church is referred to in the journalistic accounts of the assassination byall sorts of names, such as the Old Catholic Church or the Holy ApostolicChurch, etc., etc., but in testimony obtained by the FBI it is clear that DavidFerrie was a bishop in the American Orthodox Catholic Church, and therein lies atale.The American Orthodox Catholic Church was founded by Walter (Vladimir) Propheta,a priest with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church whose father was also a priest. (InEastern Orthodox churches, priests are allowed to be married and raise families,provided they are married before they are ordained; married men are not,however, allowed to become bishops.) Walter Propheta was a sincere and dedicatedanti-Communist, as were most Ukrainians who lived in the United States duringthe time of the Soviet Union. Propheta had gone on television in its early daysto promote a strong, anti-Communist message. He had arranged for a documentaryto be made on the Katyn Forest Massacre, and had appeared with Dave Garroway todiscuss the evils being perpetrated against Ukraine and other “Captive Nations”by the Communists. In fact, Propheta once showed the author a letter fromPresidential candidate Thomas Dewey, promising Propheta that he would be theWhite House chaplain should Dewey win the election against Truman. According toPropheta, he was packing his suitcase to go to Washington when the news camethat Truman had won.As it happens in the churches, celebrity can be the kiss of death when it comesto advancement in the hierarchy. Propheta wanted to be consecrated bishop of theUkrainian Orthodox Church, but for some reason (canonical or otherwise) itdidn’t happen. Upset, he broke away to form his own church, the AmericanOrthodox Catholic Church, which would be an Orthodox Church conducting itsservices in English (a rather novel idea at the time). The Church’s headquarterswere on East 183rd Street in the Bronx, at the Cathedral of the HolyResurrection, a former Protestant church with an interior covered incrayon-colored ikons, quite close to the Bronx Zoo and also comfortably nearArthur Avenue, a famed Italian neighborhood with great bakeries and restaurants.The church, however, had very few—if any—parishioners. It did have, however, anembarrassingly large number of bishops. At the headquarters alone—in the period1968-69 when the author was there frequently—there was Propheta himself, BishopLeonard G. Hill and Bishop John Christian Chiasson as the regular staff. Therewere no priests, deacons, altar boys, or anyone else for that matter.But there were American intelligence officers.According to Propheta, there was one FBI agent and one CIA agent on the Church’sBoard of Directors. This may have been simple boasting, but the author wasintroduced to both during his tenure at the Church. In fact, they were involvedat the time in trying to buy a former mental hospital in New Jersey on behalf ofthe Church (for which purpose the author never knew), and once broached thesubject to two young priests, wondering if they could sign the purchaseagreement in order to disguise the agents’ involvement. When they discoveredthat the two priests were only eighteen years old at the time, and thus couldnot sign legal documents in the State of New Jersey, the matter was dropped. Thetwo young priests, however, went on to greater glory—and notoriety—in the yearsthat would follow.> At this point, the reader no doubt is puzzled, and wondering what this is all> about.Back in the 1960s there was a very popular book—in certain circles—entitled HowTo Become a Bishop Without Being Religious. This book humorously discussed theease with which one could become a clergyman, particularly a bishop, and all theperks that went with it. It was read avidly by a strange circle of very strangemen—of which David Ferrie was a member—known as the Episcopi Vagantes, or“wandering bishops.” These were men who had either invented their own Church andnamed themselves as its bishops or who, more often, joined churches already inexistence and (for a fee, or for some service) were consecrated as bishops byother bishops. There is a certain degree of sadness in contemplating the type ofindividual who would lust so mightily for the bishop’s robes but be otherwiseincapable or unqualified to be even an altar boy, much less a priest and much,much less a bishop. Some of these men gave themselves outlandish titles, such asPatriarch or Archbishop; some were janitors, convicted criminals, or theborderline insane. Still others were intelligence agents.When Propheta crossed the line and created his own church, he was in need of alegitimate consecration. “Consecration” is the ritual by which a priest is madea bishop, and in Orthodox Christianity as in the Roman Catholic Church, oneneeds a minimum of three bishops to consecrate another bishop. This guaranteessomething called the “line of apostolic succession,” which is a line ofconsecrations leading directly back to St. Peter, the first Pope. For those whohave gone the “independent” route, it is vitally important to prove that one hasbeen validly ordained and validly consecrated, for it means that the rituals oneperforms are thus as valid as those performed by a Catholic priest or bishop, orby a regular Eastern Orthodox priest or bishop. This validity is the only thingstanding between a wandering bishop and doubts about his sanity. For thisreason, consecrations are swapped like baseball cards, because one is neverquite sure if his consecration is really valid, and it is nice to haveadditional consecrations in case the previous one is shown to be invalid.This is what happened with Propheta. He had to secure valid consecration, and hedid so at the hands of an occultist, a man who ran one of the oddest of oddchurches in Manhattan, an Orthodox Church which was at the same time the localheadquarters of the SRIA: the Societas Rosicruciana In America, or “theRosicrucian Society of America.” 13 [../Text/ch07.html#filepos1185413]The SRIA. was an occult lodge founded in the United States at the end of thenineteenth century as an outgrowth of a British lodge, the Societas RosicrucianaIn Anglia (also known as SRIA). The British SRIA was the breeding ground of theGolden Dawn, which itself was the breeding ground of Aleister Crowley. Withoutgoing into too much detail about the creation and history of these orders, whichis certain to bore and confuse the reader, let us summarize by saying that thehead of the American SRIA was, for quite some time, one George Winslow Plummer,a devoted occultist and Hermeticist who edited a magazine of things alchemicaland Rosicrucian called Mercury. Plummer was also interested in Christianmysticism, and aligned himself with several renegade Christian churches,including something called the Holy Orthodox Church. He was also a member ofAleister Crowley’s OTO, and thus fits the mold of occultists everywhere: theinveterate joiner and accumulator of dignities. Plummer died in 1944, and wassucceeded in the SRIA by his widow, the ethereal Mother Serena, who played theorgan at the Church’s headquarters at 321 West 101st Street on the Upper WestSide of Manhattan when the author knew her. Mother Serena later marriedTheodotus Stanislaus de Witow (1890-1969), who then became the Patriarch of theHoly Orthodox Church, as well as the head of the SRIA until his death in 1969.Propheta was ordained a Ukrainian Orthodox priest by Bishop Bohdan of theUkrainian Orthodox Church on May 15, 1933. At this time, and until 1964,Propheta was still within the ecumenical fold. But things became strange afterthe Kennedy assassination in 1963, and Propheta sought other alliances; thedetails are not too well known.Propheta was consecrated bishop of the American Orthodox Church on October3,1964 by Archbishop Joachim Souris of the Autocephalous Greek Orthodox Churchof America and by the aforementioned Archbishop De Witow of the Holy OrthodoxChurch in America; he then incorporated the American Orthodox Church as theAmerican Orthodox Catholic Church (AOCC) in New York, and thus entered thedocument stream as one of America’s foremost bishop mills.Archbishop Joachim Souris was himself made a bishop by Metropolitan PeterZhurawetzky and two Old Roman Catholic Church bishops who traced their lineagethrough the inescapable Rene Villate, a famous name in wandering bishop circles,as are Zhurawetzky and Propheta themselves. The Old Roman Catholic Church is theAmerican incarnation of the famous Jansenist heresy, and according to mostauthorities they have maintained valid apostolic succession through theirbishops who were—originally, at the time of the heresy—validly consecrated. Itwas the Old Roman Catholic Church more than any other group who popularized theidea that one could be a “real” priest and a “real” bishop without belonging tothe “real” Catholic Church or any of the legitimate Eastern Orthodox Churches.Once that was accepted, it was only a matter of time before a lot of peoplejumped on the bandwagon, obtained “real” consecrations and set up their ownchurches, usually aligning themselves with other “real” bishops in order toconsecrate even more bishops… who would found their own churches… and so itgoes.Anyone trying to make sense out of the foregoing, or to follow the richlyentangled web of consecrations, cross-consecrations and affiliations has theauthor’s condolences. For those who truly wish to trace the threads of thesepersonalities, please refer to the Appendix of this volume, with the caveat thatit is nowhere near complete (it couldn’t possibly be), and that it should beconsulted only as a general guide to the field.For now, it is enough to say that Propheta’s organization became very popularwith all sorts of unsavory characters.Before Propheta was consecrated bishop, another representative of the AmericanOrthodox Church (soon to become the American Orthodox Catholic Church) wasmaking a name for himself and has now become—if you are one of the faithful—asaint. This is Carl J. Stanley, who became Archbishop Christopher Maria (nowSaint Christopher Maria, canonized—by someone—on April 22, 1976). It was CarlStanley who was referenced in the Warren Commission documents as the bishop whoconsecrated David Ferrie a bishop; a photograph of Stanley in his episcopalregalia will show a dignified looking sort (it’s hard not to look dignified involuminous robes and heavy golden pendants, topped by a veiled hat of the NeverOn Sunday Greek variety) that one would hesitate to associate with anti-Castrogun runners.Stanley told the FBI that he consecrated David Ferrie as a bishop in July of1961, but then removed him from that office the following January when Stanleylearned of Ferrie’s homosexuality. When the author first read Stanley’sstatement, he burst out laughing. Homosexuality was never a bar to eitherordination or consecration at the American Orthodox Catholic Church; in fact, asuccessor to Stanley—one Bishop Michael Francis Augustine Itkin of the “MoorishOrthodox Diocese of Ong’s Hat and Montclair, New Jersey” (I am not making thisup)—was consecrated by him in November of 1960, only eight months before heconsecrated Ferrie. Bishop Itkin was first ordained by Bishop George A. Hyde in1955, Bishop Hyde being an openly gay bishop who celebrated the first divineliturgy (Orthodox prototype of what would become the Catholic “Mass”) dedicatedto a homosexual parish, in a gay bar in Atlanta, Georgia in 1946. Hyde openlysought converts in the pages of a magazine published by the Mattachine Society,and Itkin joined the church because he wanted to work among the gay community.When Hyde became a little nervous about being too activist, too “out of thecloset,” Itkin left him and sought consecration by Stanley, who had no qualmsabout consecrating a gay bishop. Thus, his remarks to the FBI that Ferrie’shomosexuality would have disqualified him from the episcopate is patentlyuntrue. Even if the Itkin episode never happened, the history of the AmericanOrthodox Catholic Church (indeed, of all the “wandering bishop” dioceses) isreplete with instances of every form of sexual expression. (It’s not for nothingthat Propheta’s headquarters—the Cathedral of the Holy Resurrection—was known as“the Cathedral of the Holy Erection” in wandering bishop circles.) Thus, thereis no question in the author’s mind that Ferrie was never defrocked or deposedor in any way removed from office due to homosexuality, and it is doubted thathe was ever removed at all, for any reason. If he was, he would have been thefirst (and probably only) person ever kicked out of the wandering bishops’ club.To be fair, Stanley and Itkin “parted ways” soon after Itkin’s consecration:evidently because Stanley found Itkin’s activism a little too “up front” for1960, and Itkin joined yet another church, finally (at the time of this writing)winding up with the “Moorish” diocese above-mentioned, which is actually a sectwith heavy cultic overtones, being a survival of something called the MoorishTemple. The Moorish Temple was the progenitor of what would become the Nation ofIslam; a West Coast mystic who called himself Hakim Bey revived the Temple andmade it a catch-all for occultists, magicians, Christian mystics, Islamicmystics, homosexual mystics, and assorted counter-culture types.Thus, to summarize, we have Francis Regardie of Golden Dawn fame being initiatedinto the SRIA in Washington, D.C.: the same Rosicrucian cult that was behind theHoly Orthodox Church of OTO initiate Winslow Plummer and Theodotus De Witow.This same Church, run at that time by SRIA initiate De Witow, then consecratedWalter Propheta of the American Orthodox Catholic Church as well as DavidFerrie. The occult organizations behind the creation of some of the wanderingbishop dioceses (such as the SRIA) are venerable institutions in the eyes ofoccult historians; the weird churches they created, however, are considered lessthan respectable by the mainstream Christian denominations. Yet, it should beremembered that the Lutheran Church was also considered less than respectable bythe Catholic Church, as were the groups that eventually became thePresbyterians, the Methodists, and even the Episcopalians.This is not as strange a phenomenon as some might think. Even the TheosophicalSociety itself was not immune to the lure of apostolic succession. The LiberalCatholic Church is a denomination that is closely affiliated to the TheosophicalSociety and, for quite some time, held services every Sunday above the QuestBookshop of the Theosophical Society in New York City. The infamous BishopLeadbetter was a cleric of this Church as well as one of the leaders of theTheosophical Society after the death of its founder, Helena Blavatsky.And the OTO itself—the creation of a group of German occultists with Masonicleanings who believed they held the secret of the sexual rituals of the HinduTantricists and the Islamic Sufis, an organization that was later kidnapped byAleister Crowley and turned into a vehicle for his own philosophy—is allied withsomething called the Gnostic Catholic Church, and members and clergy of theGnostic Catholic Church are also members of the OTO The “Gnostic Mass” is acentral feature of virtually every OTO Lodge that the author has visited orresearched. This Church has its lineage in another gaggle of wandering bishopswho were involved in occult societies in fin-de-siécle France.Thus, Ferrie and Regardie—while probably not knowing each other—were brothersunder the sign of the Rose and the Cross. Ferrie’s interest in occultism ishinted at by the people who knew him. It is known that he considered himselfsomething of a hypnotist as well as a psychotherapist… or at least used thesedubious qualifications as a lure for potential sexual partners. According toPerry Russo—one of Jim Garrison’s witnesses during the Clay Shaw trial, and notnecessarily the most reliable or credible of those witnesses in the eyes of manyinvestigators—Ferrie conducted the equivalent of Black Masses in his apartmentat the appropriately-numbered 3330 Louisiana Avenue Parkway, New Orleans. JamesKirkwood, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of A Chorus Line, conducted his owninformal investigation in New Orleans during the Clay Shaw trial, published asAmerican Grotesque in 1970. Kirkwood was unequivocally pro-Shaw andanti-Garrison, so although his lengthy study makes for entertaining reading, hisconclusions are not always above reproach, but it is worth quoting histranscript of Perry Russo’s description of Ferrie’s weekly Black Masses:> The chalice featured animal blood, the wafer consisted of some kind of raw> flesh, instead of cake or bread. “He wore a little black toga, solid black. He> wore nothing underneath. …he called it the American Eastern Catholic Orthodox> Church… after all the ritual, shouted ritual… it ends up and it’s a brutal> thing, a sadistic quality to it—bloodletting, chicken killing, stuff like> that….”14 [../Text/ch07.html#filepos1186339]Previously, in his own description of Ferrie, Kirkwood states,> He professed to be a bishop in the Orthodox Old Catholic Church of North> America, a cultish underground group quite different from the Catholic Church> we know. 15 [../Text/ch07.html#filepos1186811]We can see that there is some confusion with the ecclesiastical nomenclature, ifnothing else. This is understandable, since these groups have long, outlandishnames which generally include “Orthodox” and “Catholic” and “Church” somewherein the title, in some order. Often, the bishop concerned has consecrations withseveral groups so that the confusion becomes almost unmanageable. The authorbelieves that Perry Russo actually comes closest to the name of theorganization, which we now know to be the American Orthodox Catholic Church; butas we have seen there were Old Catholic elements behind Ferrie’s succession aswell.The rest of Russo’s characterization of the Ferrie “Black Mass” sounds more likeVoudoun or Santeria than it does Satanism, and one wishes that Russo had paid alot more attention—or that Kirkwood had published the transcript of hisinterview in full—so that we could trace the elements of Ferrie’s ritual to aknown progenitor. Kirkwood’s statement that “the wafer consisted of some kind ofraw flesh, instead of cake or bread” is a recension of whatever Russo actuallysaid, and the author wonders why Kirkwood would have said “cake or bread” whenno Catholic or Orthodox Church uses cake in their sacraments… in fact, only theGnostic Catholic Church of the OTO is known to use something called the “cakesof light,” an unpleasant (and, these days, potentially lethal) mixture of semenand menstrual fluid and other ingredients which participants in the ritual areexpected to consume. Was Kirkwood making an unconscious reference to the OTO andthe Gnostic Catholic Church?Propheta’s organization began fronting for intelligence agencies and setting upshop all over the world. The author has personal knowledge of several suchinstances, such as the improbable H.P. (“Holy Prophet”) Aluya, who came to theUnited States from war-torn Nigeria during the Biafran crisis. The author was onhand to welcome the Prophet at Kennedy Airport in New York in 1968, as wereseveral members of the Nigerian Consulate. Aluya was brought to the Cathedral inthe Bronx, consecrated a bishop, and sent back to Nigeria with a handsomedocument and photographs of the consecration. The author doubts whether the HolyProphet was even a Christian, much less an Eastern Orthodox priest deserving ofconsecration as a bishop. In fact, his consecration certificate bore the name“Bishop H. P. Aluya” as if “H.P.” stood for, perhaps, “Harry Potter.”Another instance was the synchronization of American intelligence goals withthose of the Italian government around the same time. As is well-known, Italy inthe 1960s was in the throes of an active and subversive Communist movement, andcover as priests for American agents in Italy was quite valuable, particularlyif one did not have to deal with the cranky and bureaucratic Catholic Churchitself. The Vatican was likely to exact a pound of flesh for every agent sentover under its cover; indeed, one could not be sure that the Vatican itself wasnot penetrated by agents of a hostile service. The author— due to his basicability in the French language—was pressed into service as translator ofcommunications from several suspect religious organizations in Europe andAfrica, one of which was run by a bishop in what was then the Belgian Congo.This bishop had connections among another network that runs hand-in-hand withthe wandering bishops, and that is the equally bizarre world of knighthoods androyal titles.For an unknown consideration, Propheta was to receive a Papal Knighthood fromone Prince Policastro of Sicily. This had been arranged with the Belgian bishopaforementioned. This dignity was delivered to Propheta’s church by two gentlemenfrom the Italian Embassy in a limousine. The reason for this award is not knownto the author; indeed, as an award it would not have been particularly necessarysince Propheta had his own purveyor of knighthoods, baronetcies, dukedoms andother such endowments in the person of Bishop Pierre Michel Lorenzo de Valitch,a putative Serbo-Croatian Count who had been in the art gallery business yearsbefore, but who now ran a flourishing trade in bogus orders of knighthood forthe rich and famous. The Count’s appearance was reminiscent of a young BelaLugosi, complete with kidskin gloves, monocle, and silver-knobbed walking stick.Thus, there would have been no particular need to have gone to such extremes topick up what the Count could have more easily provided using his ownconnections. The author suspects that he was being tested in this instance, andintroduced to the religious underground and to some of its politicalaffiliations.Another suspect organization was the Greek Order of St. Denis of Zante, anorganization that numbered the elusive Father Fox among its members. Father Foxhad been a priest of various denominations, including the Syrian OrthodoxChurch, and had studied at Fordham University. He was fluent in several foreignlanguages, including Arabic and Russian, and had once been caught trying tocross the border into Northern Ireland in a car with a trunk full of weapons.Fox had made trips to Vietnam during the War, and one has the suspicion it wasnot as a tourist. In at least one episode, it became obvious to the author thatFox was working for American intelligence as an informant, if nothing else.Yet another personality close to the Propheta organization was the famouswrestler Antonino Rocca. Rocca—retired from wrestling at that time—claimed to bean agent of the CIA working out of Lebanon; he further claimed that he wasrunning Phantom jets into Israel under diplomatic radar by having them shippedto Luxembourg first and then flying them into Israel, thus avoiding Arab spiesand saboteurs, who would have been expecting a shipment from the United Statesor, at least, France or Great Britain. It also was a way of hiding the shipmentsfrom the US Congress, since the sales would not register as Israeli but as salesto Luxembourg. All of this would seem like outrageous posturing, except thatRocca made these statements before Rabbi A. Allen Block of the BrotherhoodSynagogue in 1969, in a meeting including several of Propheta’s clergymen aswell as the author. One of the clergymen present, Andre Pennachio, was closelyconnected to the Teamsters Union via Joseph Konowe and to celebrities such asHarry Hirschfield, Peter Sellers’ astrologer Maurice Woodruff, comic Lenny Kent,and who even had a bit part in Francis Ford Coppola’s Godfather movie, as acleric presiding over the baptism of Michael Corleone’s godchild. Pennachio alsohad Old Roman Catholic origins, but wound up with Propheta in late 1968, runninga committee to finance his consecration as bishop in Propheta’s church, which hewanted to celebrate in a big way with photographers, reception, etc. Thiscommittee was being run out of a CIA front organization in lower Manhattan,Delta Metal Industries, which was ostensibly a metal furniture import-exportfirm. When one of the young clergymen around Propheta and Pennachio realizedthat the operation was bogus, he began to fear for his life. He left the churchabruptly, and caused a panic at Delta Metal Industries that their cover would beblown. His phone would ring at all hours of the day and night from people atDelta Metal and by various clergymen attempting to ascertain what heknew—including an American priest who operated in a strangely autonomous fashionwithin the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (the “Synod”)—and to determinewhether or not he was going public. When they were satisfied he was not, thephones stopped ringing.Thus, Propheta’s church was a clearing-house for all sorts of intelligenceoperators and fellow-travelers. David Ferrie, Andre Pennachio, Antonino Rocca,Father Fox, all had crossed paths with Propheta’s people or had actually beenmembers—and bishops—of Propheta’s church. The occult connection via the SRIA wasalso a serious one, and that connection has tainted the apostolic successionclaims of many bishops in the eyes of the legitimate Orthodox Churches, whoconsider SRIA to be a satanic organization.And what do we make of the strange association of David Ferrie—pilot,investigator, consecrated bishop, acquaintance of Lee Oswald, performer of BlackMasses—with Guy Banister, former ONI, former FBI, former hunter of UFOs? And ofFred Crisman, author of the Maury Island Affair, former OSS, former CIA, reputedfriend of Clay Shaw? UFOs and satanists, aliens and archbishops. Spies andsoothsayers. Magicians… and Manchurian Candidates.Another Ferrie association—and another connection that was examined by JimGarrison’s staff—was with a strange wandering bishop based in Canada: BishopEarl Anglin Lawrence James. Ferrie had made a number of long-distance phonecalls to James in the period 1962-63, and Garrison asked Metropolitan TorontoPolice to follow up. The episode made the Toronto newspapers, and a report filedby theToronto Telegram on November 6, 1967 was headlined “Toronto’s Renegade‘Bishop’ Mentioned in Garrison Probe.” According to the paper, James “operates abizarre school on Danforth Ave.” What newspapermen considered “bizarre” inToronto in 1967 is anyone’s guess; not for nothing was the town known as“Toronto the Good” for many years. James denied any knowledge of Ferrie, and infact denied he had ever been to New Orleans. That proved to be a dubiousstatement, since he was in possession of a Key to the City of New Orleans, hadmembership cards in various Louisiana and New Orleans organizations, includingone naming him an “Honorary Attorney General” of the State of Louisiana, anotherthat named him a Colonel on the staff of Earl K. Long, and possessed variousother police and investigation agency paper litter, and including a UnitedStates Social Security card. The one phone call he admits he received from NewOrleans was from a “Mr. J. S. Martin. It was a personal call.” J.S. Martin is,of course, Jack Martin, the man who was beaten by Ferrie associate and formerFBI SAC Guy Banister shortly after the Kennedy assassination. Ferrie and Martinwere involved in “investigating” phony diploma mills—according to Ferrie’stestimony to government investigators—but they had a falling out and Martin wenthis own way.According to the paper’s report, James had been a bishop of the Old RomanCatholic Church in 1945, but had been excommunicated two years later. The storyis more interesting than these bare bones would indicate, however.James was indeed consecrated—on June 17, 1945—by the infamous Henry Carfora, theguiding light behind the Old Roman Catholic Church and its policy ofconsecrating all and sundry in those days. Carfora was assisted in thisconsecration by the indomitable Hubert Augustus Rogers. Thus, James’ pedigree isfirmly in the wandering bishop camp.To make matters if possible any more complicated, Christopher Carl Stanley—thebishop who was being “investigated” by Jack Martin and who consecrated DavidFerrie a bishop—was himself consecrated by the same Earl Anglin Lawrence James.Thus we have a direct line of apostolic assassination succession from Carfora toJames to Stanley to Ferrie: the latter three all at one time or another suspectsin the Kennedy assassination conspiracy. This is not to forget the line thatgoes from Carfora to Stanley to Propheta.Before Kennedy was elected President, however, Bishop James was the luckyrecipient of the Eloy Alfaro Award, an obscure dignity that was conferred uponhim in New York City and announced on the floor of the House of Representativesof the United States Congress on August 23, 1960. He was given this award—theEloy Alfaro Grand Cross—for his “extraordinary achievements and accomplishments…within the framework of the services rendered by him to his fellow human beingsand to the cause of international peace.” 16[../Text/ch07.html#filepos1187126]The person who read this event into the Recordwas Republican Representative Robert R. Barry. The actual ceremony took place atthe Hotel Astor, appropriately enough. The Master of Ceremonies was apsychiatrist, Dr. Herbert Holt, who conferred the Cross and diploma on James forhis “outstanding work in behalf of humanity all over the civilized world as adynamic religious leader and a great humanitarian…” and etc., etc. Otherrecipients of this award, according to Holt, were “President Eisenhower, formerPresidents Harry S. Truman and Herbert Hoover, Senator Lyndon Johnson, GovernorsRockefeller and Averell Harriman, Generals MacArthur, Crittenberger, Devers, andthe Rt. Rev. Benjamin C. Eckardt, of Canada…”17[../Text/ch07.html#filepos1187495] Eckardt is yet another “autonomous bishop,”and it is possible that he suggested to the committee that the award go toJames, but this is purely speculation on my part.Now Dr. Holt would go on to greater glory as the head of something called theWestchester Institute for Training in Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy.According to the Institute’s brochure, Holt was a “Viennese-trained psychiatristand psychoanalyst who, in a series of papers and books, built upon the groundthat Freud had established but added a holistic and phenomenological/existentialemphasis as well.”We find Dr. Holt attending a meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study ofReligion at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. on Halloween, 1964, giving atalk on “Existential Analysis and Pastoral Counseling.” At this time, Holt gavehis affiliation as the New York Institute of Existential Analysis. Obviously,his interest was in the psychology of religion, and especially in the use ofpsychology within a pastoral setting. The Westchester Institute still offerstraining in this discipline, and has expanded the curriculum to include Jungianconcepts as well.What did Herbert Holt have in common with the “renegade bishop of Toronto,” aman who had a mysterious past, who claimed more than 100 degrees—although hedropped out of the University of Toronto after only one year—and who was anassociate of some of the most bizarre figures surrounding the Kennedyassassination? What great contribution did James make to the world to justifynot only his receiving the Eloy Alfaro Award but having it read into theCongressional Record?Most of the members of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion weretheologians or scholars of religion, such as the well-respected Peter L. Bergerof the New School. In 1964, the vice-president of the Society was Paul W.Pruyser of the Menninger Foundation, an organization known to have ties to theCIA’s mind control programs, but that is a tenuous connection at best. The nameof the organization itself suggests an intelligence agenda, since MK-ULTRA wasnothing if not a “scientific study of religion”; however, at this point thetrail runs cold.The only clue we have to what was really going on with Holt, James, Stanley,Ferrie, Propheta, and the rest is the connection between the Old Roman CatholicChurch and hypnosis, specifically the interests in hypnosis of not only Ferriebut also William Bryan, Jr., who claimed he was the technical advisor for thefilm version of The Manchurian Candidate. It was Bryan who worked a score ofwell-known criminal cases, including the Boston Strangler case, and who claimedhe worked for the CIA. He claimed also to have hypnotized Sirhan Sirhan,something that could only have happened before the young Palestinianassassinated Robert F. Kennedy. As we shall see in the next chapter, Bryan was amember—and possibly a bishop—of the Old Roman Catholic Church.To most people, the association of hard-core occultists and members of secretsocieties and Masonic groups such as the SRIA, the Golden Dawn and the OTO withthe Old Roman Catholic Church, the American Orthodox Catholic Church, and—Godhelp us—the Moorish Orthodox Diocese of Ong’s Hat and Montclair, New Jerseywould seem to be illogical. Why would occultists and magicians hunger after“apostolic succession,” mitres, cassocks, croziers and panagias? The answer issimple, and sinister.The Black Mass which Ferrie was accused of performing is a ritual that mocksthose of the Catholic Church; essentially, it is an attempt at organizedblasphemy, an attack of rebellion, political as well as theological. It is alsodesigned to attract demonic influences, evil spirits and the souls of the angrydead. Yet, this ritual carries very little weight if performed by a lay-person.It is potentially quite powerful, however, if performed by an ordained priest.A valid ordination is one of the most singular sources of spiritual strength inthe West. It is a line of ritual, faith and trust that extends back in timethrough two thousand years; to those who believe in the power of the “laying onof hands” it is potent magic, indeed. Aleister Crowley, dubbed by the myopicBritish tabloids as the “wickedest man in the world,” could not perform a BlackMass no matter how much he may have liked to (there is no evidence that he everwanted to). He was not an ordained priest.Further, many rituals of ceremonial magic prescribe the use of relics and otherarticles that could only be sourced from the Church, thus giving rise to a greatdeal of theft and subterfuge. A priest, however, has immediate access to all ofthis and possesses the power to create more: holy water, holy oil, a consecratedHost, etc. Inasmuch as many grimoires—cookbooks of ritual magic—insist oninvoking God, Jesus, Mary, the Saints, etc., the use of genuinely blessedreligious artifacts would, of course, give the ritual that much more authority.Thus, David Ferrie—should his line of apostolic succession prove valid—could“legitimately” perform a Black Mass whereas Crowley (from all availableevidence) would not have been able to do so. This should not be viewed as thesole objective, however. Many occultists value the line of succession as asource of spiritual power whether or not they consider themselves Christian.Power is power, wherever it is found and by whatever means it can be obtained; avalidly ordained priest has the power to perform most of the sacraments, and thevalidly consecrated bishop has the power to perform all of the sacramentsincluding ordaining more priests and consecrating more bishops, thus ensuring aline of power for his cult equal to that of the Catholic Church. The allure isirresistible.Add all of this to espionage activities and you have a perfect fruit salad ofparanoia, power and prestige, mixing secret government work with secret ritualsand the manipulation of those sinister forces we have been studying. The secrethandshake of the cult and the secret code of the intelligence agency: they bothinvoke the power of relationships that are beyond the reach of the ordinaryhuman being. The cultist believes he can summon the very hounds of hell to hisaid; the intelligence agent can overthrow a government, terminate a politician,or call in an air strike. Either way, the Gates of the Underworld are opened.In an interesting side note to all of this, H.P. Lovecraft in his short story“The Horror at Red Hook” (1925) mentions a church in Brooklyn that had beenturned into a dance hall. This church actually existed; to the author’s bestrecollection it was on Amity Street, but that may be a confabulation. In anyevent, it was only a few blocks south of Atlantic Avenue; south, that is, ofBrooklyn Heights, where Lovecraft lived for a short time during his equallyshort marriage. Briefly, in the 1970s, that church had been taken over byanother one of Propheta’s renegade churches, this one practicing a kind of RomanRitual under an Eastern Orthodox aegis. The church was also—and at the sametime—believed to be a place where satanic or occult ceremonies were performed.It was only a few blocks away from the infamous Warlock Shop, a location thatfigures prominently—though never by name—in Maury Terry’s study of the Son ofSam cult, Ultimate Evil.EXECUTIVE ACTIONI remember staying home from school with a stomach ache the day Kennedy wasshot. My family had moved to Charlestown, New Hampshire from Chicago thatsummer; we lived in an old saltbox-style house at the top of Hubbard Hill, aplace reputed to be haunted, due to the fact that it used to be a prison farm atone time, and more recently it was suspected that old Percy Whitmore hadmurdered his wife and daughter on the place and buried them in the woods.Discovering a hidden panel in the house where Percy kept some poisonselaborately labeled with skull-and-crossbones didn’t ameliorate the feeling thatthere was something strange about the farm. That afternoon, I was sitting in bedon the second floor of the house, gazing out the window at the gray day and thetree line, when my mother suddenly appeared in the doorway and said, “They’veshot the President.” They.At the same moment, a few hundred miles to the north in Montreal, Dr. JamesMonroe was paying a visit to Dr. Ewen Cameron at the Allen Memorial Clinic. Aformer Air Force officer and MK-ULTRA project leader in brainwashing studies,Monroe was in charge of the funds of the Human Ecology Society, which served asthe Cameron project’s front. As the airwaves broadcast the news of theassassination of President Kennedy at the Clinic, Monroe stopped and made aphone call to Washington. When he returned, he told Cameron that CIA sponsorshipof his program was terminated. 18 [../Text/ch07.html#filepos1187803]The readerdoes not need to be advised that this was a strange and compelling combinationof events, indicative of a deeply sinister agenda.At the same time, three thousand miles away in California, Aldous Huxley died.The pioneer of the psychedelic revolution, author of Brave New World, The Doorsof Perception and Heaven and Hell, lost consciousness without ever learning ofthe assassination of the President.At the same time, Andrija Puharich was out of the country, in Brazil; George deMohrenschildt was out of the country, in Haiti; E. Howard Hunt (according to aCIA memo) was in Dallas, but denies it; Richard Nixon was in Dallas; DavidFerrie had just come from the courthouse in New Orleans, where he helped Mafiakingpin Carlos Marcello beat his latest rap. An anonymous phone call from BellHelicopter told Dallas police that Marina Oswald was staying at the Paines’. AndMK-ULTRA ramped up like never before.Haitian President-for-Life “Papa Doc” Duvalier celebrated when Kennedy waskilled, claiming that his powers of voudoun had caused the President’s demise.To Duvalier, the number “22” had mystical associations with voudoun powers, andhe used that number on his personal license plate. Kennedy was killed, ofcourse, on November 22. The number 11/22 tickled Duvalier, who asked his cronieswhat more proof they needed of his occult abilities? Duvalier had long suspectedKennedy of having evil designs on his dictatorship; the threat of armedintervention was never very far away. (The US had already intervened in theDominican Republic, with which Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola, and hadinvaded Haiti several times in the past.) Having George de Mohrenschildt therein Haiti with him the day Kennedy was killed must have been somewhat…comforting.The religious, mystical dimension to this study leads in many directions.Suffice it to say that swirling about the feet and hands of the Kennedyassassination was a sticky fog of occultists, wandering bishops, Americanintelligence… and alien intelligence known as The Nine. Arthur Young, MichaelPaine, Ruth Paine, Ruth Forbes Young, Andrija Puharich, Mary Astor, even DavidFerrie were all a handshake or two away from Jack Kennedy’s alleged assassin,Lee Harvey Oswald. They were all talking to ghosts, summoning alien beings,practicing ritual magic, holding hands around the séance table or sacrificingchickens in a New Orleans apartment.And, in some cases, they were also members of America’s ruling elite, thewealthiest and best-connected families in the country.> What were they really channeling?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/ch07.html#filepos1058571] Maurice Maeterlinck, The Cloud That Lifted,The Century Company, NY, 19232 [../Text/ch07.html#filepos1060365] Peter Dale Scott, Deep Politics and theDeath of JFK, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1996, ISBN 0-520-20519-73 [../Text/ch07.html#filepos1064039] Christopher S.

Mary Meyer was something of a free spirit, however, a painterand the woman who smoked pot with Jack Kennedy. She had been a friend of Learysince the early 1960s—and of the Kennedys before that—and spoke to him of a veryimportant friend of hers who was interested in the LSD experience, and asked fortips on how to guide the LSD trip, leading some investigators to believe thatshe had turned the President on to acid, as well. Leary certainly provided MaryMeyer with acid, without knowing the identity of her important friend. WhenLeary began to actively promote acid consumption by the masses, Mary warned himthat this was not what the CIA wanted him to do, but rather that he should studythe effects of the drug on his test subjects and report back discretely. She hadalready succeeded, she told him, in turning on certain high-ranking members ofthe Washington establishment. Leary, however, had other ideas. “Turn On, TuneIn, Drop Out” became the slogan of the disaffected young of the 1960s, a slycounterpoint to “You Shall Know The Truth, And The Truth Will Set You Free,” theslogan or motto of both the CIA and NASA.Mary Meyer was murdered less than a year after the Kennedy assassination—onOctober 12, 1964 (coincidentally Aleister Crowley’s birthday, and of course theday Columbus discovered America)—and her diary disappeared. She seemed to havebeen the victim of a mugging in Georgetown during the lunch hour, shot in theface at close range on a towpath, although the level of violence in the attackmade it look suspicious to some, and the accused murderer was acquitted by ajury due to lack of evidence. The disappearance of her diary caused some concernin her friends—after all, she was married to a high-ranking CIA officer and hadturned the President (and who knew how many others) on to pot and possibly LSDas well. But evidence later would show that the diary was found by her sister,and surrendered to James Jesus Angleton, the CIA’s paranoid Chief of CounterIntelligence and one of Cord Meyer’s closest friends, who had been in MaryMeyer’s apartment with a key long before her other friends arrived, looking forthe same diary. Meyer was single, no longer married to Cord Meyer by this time,having divorced him much earlier. Her sister, Tony Pinchot, had been married toBen Bradlee of the Washington Post. This is perhaps an indication of howincestuous these relationships become: Mary Pinchot Meyer, Tony Pinchot Bradlee,Ben Bradlee, Cord Meyer, Timothy Leary, Jack Kennedy…Angleton did not destroy the diary, however. What he did with it while it was inhis possession is open to debate, but he eventually gave it back to TonyBradlee, who then destroyed it herself. It seems very odd that the Bradleeswould have given the diary to Angleton to destroy in the first place; destroyinga book is not exactly rocket science. It would have been a simple matter to ripout the pages and burn them, or flush them for that matter. But the diary wentto Angleton, who took it to the CIA, who then did not destroy it, who then gaveit back to the Bradlees to destroy.Mary Meyer evidently believed that Jack Kennedy was killed on orders of peoplein the US government, and this is the gist of what she told Leary. Leary, aconsummate showman who could have made much hay out of this, did not exploit theinformation at all and tended to downplay it or change the subject when asked.There has been a lot of speculation (much of it rather silly) in thecounter-culture press that Leary was a CIA agent, or that Kennedy had been yetanother MK-ULTRA guinea pig, etc. The facts of Mary Meyer’s death may be simple:a mugging gone wrong. Yet the number and quality of the relationships iscompelling, and this is what begets conspiracy theories. It is understandablydifficult to believe that a woman who was sleeping with Kennedy, smoking potwith him and perhaps turning him on to LSD, a woman who was also a closepersonal friend of Timothy Leary and who believed that Kennedy had been murderedas a result of a conspiracy, moreover a woman who was married to a high-rankingCIA official who was at that time in charge of “dirty tricks,” would have died aviolent death that was somehow not related to the assassination or its coverup.Like the Kennedy assassination itself, there are way too many suggestiverelationships; Angleton’s fast trip to Mary Meyer’s home to find the diarysuggests that he was worried about far more than a revelation that she had beensleeping with Jack Kennedy. One does not get the impression that Angleton wouldhave been worried about Jack Kennedy’s reputation being tarnished; he would havebeen more worried about the intelligence implications of what would have beencontained in the diary. The Warren Commission Report had been published theprevious month. This was also during the time of the Nosenko debriefing, inwhich Angleton was certain KGB defector Yuri Nosenko was a plant, a falsedefector, sent by Moscow that January to do serious damage to the CIA. Angletonmust have worried about the possible use Mary Meyer’s diary would be to Sovietintelligence, for the type of intelligence information contained therein (pillowtalk with the most powerful man in the world until his assassination less than ayear earlier) might well have been damaging to national security.The Mary Pinchot Meyer case is only one of many “scarlet threads” runningthrough this narrative of American necromancy. It is not even the most shockingshade of red. Yet it suggested the use of a mind-expanding drug by the Presidentof the United States, provided by Timothy Leary to the President’s mistress. Hadthe CIA ever imagined that the drug they brought into the United States in the1950s to test as an interrogation tool—the drug they used to dose Frank Olsonunknowing unto death—would have filtered up as well as down?The following year, Yale psychologist Dr. Jose Delgado demonstrated one of themost powerful applications of electronic technology in the area of mind controlat the time. Delgado used brain implants to control an enraged bull in front ofspectators. Using only a remote control device—a small, handheld box in hishands—he was able to increase the bull’s aggression to the point that it chargedthe psychologist, who was standing quietly in an arena with no protectivedevices, and then, with a press of a button in Delgado’s hand, the crazed animalsuddenly stopped on a dime. This demonstration was widely reported in the pressin May of 1965, and Delgado presented a lecture at the American Museum ofNatural History in New York City that month on electrical stimulation of thebrain. Although Delgado admitted that the technology at the time was crude, itwas certainly effective. One can imagine the effect of this vivid demonstrationon American (and Soviet, and Chinese) intelligence agencies. It also had otherimplications, for concentration on the electrical approach to behavior controlmight have been at odds with the purely chemical approach that had beendeveloped to a certain extent under MK-ULTRA.The electrical approach would likely seem more promising to a group ofresearchers who would consider such a “push-button” technique of controllingbehavior as more reliable than a chemical technique which was more variable—interms of results obtained, dosages, etc.—with each person. The drawback, ofcourse, would be the need to physically implant electrical devices in the targetsubject’s body; further, the experiments by Delgado were limited to very basicbehavioral models, such as aggression and motor control. What the CIA needed wasa more sophisticated switch that would point the subject in a specificdirection—at a specific target, say—and no other. The “raging bull” model wouldnot be sufficiently fine-tuned for the CIA’s purposes. However, the results werevery promising in that they showed that outside control of a sentient being’sactions was possible. There had been no psychoanalysis of the bull, of course,no psychological interviews, no Rohrshach tests, no MMPIs. It was a simplematter of knowing where to place the electrodes. It could, theoretically, bedone to anyone, and with no need for a prior evaluation of that person’s psyche.No need for Dr. Cameron’s “sleep room” or depatterning exercises, proceduresthat were time-consuming and dangerous, and which often did not result in usablesubjects. The individual person’s will (and identity) was no longer an issue;the issue was the human will in general, how it could be overridden in anyonewith the use of the proper electronic device.In June 1972 Dr. Sidney Gottlieb—he of the LSD-spiked cocktail to Dr. FrankOlson—proposed a serious program of ESB (Electrical Stimulation of the Brain) toCIA Director Richard Helms, based on the work of both Delgado and neurosurgeonDr. Robert G. Heath of Tulane, whose experiments with stimulating pleasurecenters in the human brain using electrodes were fascinating, and filled withpotential for behavior control. By identifying the brain’s pleasure centers theywere one step closer to mapping the electronic grid of the brain to the pointthat pleasure, pain, aggression, fear, and violence could be switched on and offat will—someone else’s will. 5 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1334311]This programwas approved, and CIA development of ESB proceeded apace; but before thisapproach was considered, CIA was still investigating the use of drugs, hypnosisand other chemical and psychological means towards the creation of a ManchurianCandidate. In the meantime, however, other parties were developing their ownversion of a mindless killer, using the same combination of drugs andpsychology.AS IT ISOn 1946, Jack Parsons’ occult partner in the Babalon Working was L. Ron Hubbard,the founder of Scientology. Hubbard would claim to have been investigatingParsons on behalf of some government agency—the FBI or ONI—but that claim hasnever borne out. Hubbard’s military record is available, and it is ratherdismal. His wheedling for disability benefits is particularly sad. Hubbard waswhat he always appeared to be, a struggling science fiction writer andconfidence man who borrowed a great deal from his apprenticeship with JackParsons, and who stole much else. It is somehow depressing that the most famousexample of the work of this brilliant scientist and idealistic young occultistwould be Hubbard and his Church of Scientology, but there it is. (Sorry, Tom;John; Kirstie.)On the other hand, Scientology would love to distance itself as much as possiblefrom its Crowleyan origins, but the Pasadena episode sticks quite tightly,particularly as Hubbard would go on to marry Betty Northrup, whom he met asParsons’ soror mystica. As more and more evidence comes to light, there is noway for Hubbard’s spiritual heirs to continue the charade that L. Ron was simplytrying to break up a black magic ring that was populated by rocket scientistswith security clearances. The lawsuit against Hubbard, filed in Miami by Parsonswhen the former stole his money and made off in one of the boats for partsunknown, stands as a different kind of evidence: of fraud, theft, and thedeepest form of betrayal.It was perhaps inevitable that Hubbard’s philosophy of enlightened self-interestwould result in the Process Church of the Final Judgment, usually referred tosimply as the Process. Formed sometime in 1963-64 as a splinter group fromScientology, its founder was Robert Moore, a British subject who was born inShanghai on August 10, 1935 and had been—according to one account—a cavalryofficer who had served time in Malaya (that favorite haunt of witchcraft guruGerald Gardner, Clockwork Orange author Anthony Burgess, and the Heart ofDarkness’ Joseph Conrad), and who later lived in London at the time of theProcess’ creation. At the Hubbard Institute of Scientology in London he met MaryAnne MacLean, a woman who is said to have been engaged to prizefighter Sugar RayRobinson in America for a brief period, before returning to England. Mary AnneMacLean was born in Glasgow on November 20, 1931, and was thus four years RobertMoore’s senior. Before she met Moore, however, she became involved with severalhigh-ranking British politicians á la Christine Keeler of the Profumo affair. Asmentioned earlier, Christine Keeler was the mistress of both British WarMinister John Profumo and Soviet GRU agent Yevgeny Ivanov; she herself has alsoalleged that she slept with President John Kennedy on a trip she made to theUnited States in the summer of 1962. The Profumo Affair has other resonanceswith our story, since it also includes occultist Stephen Ward—an osteopath whowas a friend of Christine Keeler as well as a kind of go-between for Profumo,Keeler and Ivanov, and who had many high-society celebrities as friends andpatients and subjects for his other passion, portraiture, including Claus vonBulow, Sophia Loren, Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor, even Joseph Kennedy. Someauthors have linked him to the Golden Dawn, but the author has been unable tofind evidence of this; by 1963 there wasn’t enough left of the Golden Dawnanyway to have made the association particularly relevant. Stephen Wardcommitted suicide when he was convicted—wrongly, as it turned out—of havinglived on the proceeds of prostitution (i.e., Keeler and her friends). He couldnot take the humiliation and, on August 3, 1963, took an overdose of Nembutalinstead.This, then, was the situation at the time Mary Anne MacLean met Robert Moore atScientology headquarters in London; they then decided to break away, form theirown operation, and get married. For someone like Mary Anne, it was probably awise move: her profile in British society was not entirely low. Engaged to anAmerican prizefighter, running in the same circles as Keeler and her associates,who were all being rounded up to “help the police in their inquiries,” it was asmart move to decamp to the Scientologists and marry an intelligent andcharismatic architect like Robert Moore, as cover if nothing else. Further, thecircumstances of the Profumo Affair and of Stephen Ward’s participation in it,suggested a far deeper political agenda that involved Jack Kennedy, the Britishgovernment, the Soviet government, and the Cuban Missile Crisis, as declassifiedFBI and CIA files suggest. It has also been revealed that Dr. Ward was thego-between for the British intelligence services and the Soviet GRU (militaryintelligence) via his friendship with Yevgeny Ivanov, and that possibly Ward hadmanipulated Keeler into sleeping with Ivanov as part of a classic “honey trap,”in case they needed to blackmail the Russian agent into defecting at some laterdate. War Minister Profumo was essentially caught in the middle, having alsoslept with the evidently irresistible Ms. Keeler. Mary Anne MacLean’s formerfiance, Sugar Ray Robinson, had even intended to make a film of the ProfumoAffair with Christine Keeler in the starring role opposite Sugar Ray himself, 6[../Text/ch08.html#filepos1334912]thus strengthening the link between MacLean,Robinson, Keeler and the Profumo Affair… and from Profumo to Process.The headquarters of the Process in London was on Fitzroy Street in the earlydays, before moving to a large house on Balfour Place in 1966. The philosophy ofRobert and Mary Anne Moore (now known as Robert and Mary Anne DeGrimston, a nameof cultic significance to them) was a mixture of reincarnation, existentialism,some concepts adapted from Scientology, an attempt to merge the worships ofJehova and Lucifer, and a bit of neo-Nazi flavor. Their emblem was a stylizedswastika, which in all fairness could have meant they were Buddhist; however,the philosophy of the Process and its alleged origins as a front for a Germanneo-fascist group, coupled with Mary Anne’s belief that she was thereincarnation of Josef Goebbels, seems to indicate a Nazi rather than a Buddhistinspiration. Further, the group was known to have kept thirty German shepherdson hand as a kind of totem-cum-guard dog arrangement. It was this very publicassociation of German shepherds with the Process that would later lead someinvestigators in the United States to link Process members or former memberswith a series of sacrifices of these particular dogs where cult activity wasbelieved to be taking place.That same June, a large group of Process members—replete with dogs— spent a fewmonths in Nassau and later in Mexico for reasons that are not clear, beforereturning to London to begin publishing their magazine and a book by RobertDeGrimston, As It Is. It is known that, while in Mexico on the Yucatanpeninsula, DeGrimston added Satan to the Jehova-Lucifer deities of their groupand, according to Maury Terry, held moonlight rituals on the beach at Xtul toinvoke the Dark Lords. 7 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1335400]By the time they hadreturned to London at the end of the summer they were ready to launch theProcess in a much more aggressive manner, luring singer Marianne Faithfull intotheir organization. Ms. Faithfull is yet another solid link between the Processand Thelemic organizations in the United States, as she was known to belong tothe same circle as Kenneth Anger, Anita Pallenberg, Marjorie Cameron, and MansonFamily member Bobby Beausoleil, and had appeared in one of Anger’s Crowleyanfilms, Lucifer Rising, as we shall see below.In 1967, the Process set up camp in San Francisco, a few doors down from whereManson was living at the time on Cole Street. By the spring of 1968, they werein Los Angeles, and making a frontal assault on the entertainment industry(something the DeGrimstons had perhaps learned during their sojourn at theScientology operation). Dressed in black, German shepherds at the leash, andspeaking about worshipping Jehova, Lucifer and Satan, they were a pretty commonsight in California. In 1966, Anton LaVey had already opened his Church of Satanto much media hoopla in San Francisco, so Californians were getting used toSatan-worshippers and oddly-dressed, blackly-dressed young people working ontheir satanic stares while everyone else was working on their tans. And then, inthe summer of 1968, the Californian operation of the Process suddenly wentunderground.On May 28,1966, a young Palestinian immigrant fascinated with the occult hadattended his first meeting of the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC) atthe society’s Akhnaton Lodge in Pasadena, and was the subject of an experimentin sensory perception, sitting blindfolded while attempting to identify objectsby touch.8 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1335892] AMORC was one of the many splintergroups that broke off from the SRIA in England; they had OTO and Golden Dawnconnections, but created a distinctly American style of recruiting: direct mail.Most people of a certain generation are familiar with those large ads in allsorts of magazines with the tag “What Secret Power Did These Men Possess?” and aP.O. box where one could send for information and begin a correspondence coursein mental telepathy, meditation and, eventually, magic.This interest continued for the next few years. In March 1968, the Palestinianwas in Pasadena—where he lived with his mother, some blocks north of where JackParsons had lived in the 1940s and 1950s—attending a meeting of the TheosophicalSociety’s Adyar Lodge. (That same month, the Process set up shop on SouthCochrane Street in Los Angeles.)A few months later, he would be arrested for the assassination of Senator RobertF. Kennedy. The Palestinian, of course, was Sirhan Bishara Sirhan.Much ink has been spilled on the subject of the Process; Ed Sanders in the firstedition of The Family links the Process with an amoebic network of death cultsin California and from there to Manson; investigative journalist Maury Terry haslinked them to Charles Manson as well as to the Son of Sam killings. The problemis that the linkages are there, but not enough to put a smoking gun in the handsof the Process itself. Of course, that is the problem with the entire field ofconspiracy theory as well. What we are looking at in this case are mostlyphilosophical influences—which are certain to become a subject for academicstudy in another twenty or thirty years—and the “deep politics” connections ofwhich Professor Peter Dale Scott writes so eloquently. The fidgety reader maycomplain that the American system of jurisprudence is such that one cannot bearrested on suspicion of undue influence over another; but, of course, that isexactly what happened in the case of Charles Manson, who did not actually murderanyone at the Tate or LaBianca households, but who was convicted of the murdersanyway and would have been executed had not the State of California abolishedthe death penalty during his incarceration.The Charles Manson case is germane to the study of the Process, since Manson wasknown to them and had even written an article for the “Death” issue of theirmagazine (in all fairness, Marianne Faithfull and Salvador Dali also wrote forthe Process magazine; however, what put scroungy little Charles Manson in thesame company as Faithfull and Dali?); and, as his prosecutor Vincent Bugliosihas written, members of the Process visited Manson in prison after his arrestfor the Tate/LaBianca killings. At one point, Manson is known to have boasted,“I am Robert Moore.”9 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1336378] Thus, it would behooveus to study this group a little to see how they could have become involved withCharles Manson and, by extension, the Tate/LaBianca killings and—if Maury Terryis correct—a spate of killings from California to New York City. (One of themurderous cults in California supposedly linked to Manson and to Maury Terry’s“Manson II” was something called “Four P.” A glance at the Process’ logo—thestylized swastika—will show it is basically four P’s in a circle.)In all of that ink, a lot of nonsense has been promulgated about the Process, ascritics such as Robert Hicks10 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1336854] have beenquick to point out. That strange new breed of law enforcement officer, the “cultcop,” has been all over the Process, the OTO, and the Church of Satan, withseminar leaders telling wide-eyed police officers around the country that thesecults are dangerous, using mind control methods, and committing murder andmayhem on a global scale. To anyone who has had any direct dealings at all withthese groups, the accusations are absurd. The Church of Satan was at best agimmicky New Age operation; at worst it was a magnet for the type of neuroticsthat LaVey himself would eventually banish. The OTO couldn’t organize a boxlunch much less a nationwide program of human sacrifice. And the Process doesnot exist any longer, and hasn’t existed for almost thirty years.On the other hand…It is a fact of life that many people who join or are attracted to organizationslike the three mentioned above are much more serious than their leaders. Tojudge all Church of Satan members by the writings or the actions of its founder,Anton LaVey, would be a mistake. LaVey, for instance, talked a good game, but itwas little COS vampire Susan Atkins who plunged the knife into Sharon Tate,killing both the actress and her unborn child. To judge all OTO members by theirleaders would be to reduce that organization’s reputation considerably. JackParsons and British occultist and author Kenneth Grant are good examples ofpeople that the OTO administration did not like, but who have in past yearsbecome icons of the Order, and its best representatives. As for the Process,Robert Moore aka Robert DeGrimston has distanced himself completely from hiscreation. One published account even states that he was “purged” from the Churchand that his wife, Mary Ann DeGrimston, took over and further emasculated thegroup. 11 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1337335]When critics of the cult copsrightly point to the many logical inconsistencies in the way the police describethe very cults they investigate, they ignore something darker that is takingplace. Indeed, the Process was itself a splinter group of Scientology; theChurch of Satan was a rebellion against Christianity; the OTO was an attempt toinject new life into dusty old Freemasonry. And these groups have spawned theirown splinters, their own renegade branches that have taken the original ideas astep or two further and usually in a dangerous direction. To the outside world,these people are all “Process” or “Church of Satan” or even “OTO,” but in factmost of them have severed any formal links with these organizations before theybegan their criminal activity. What the occult Orders have done, however,deliberately or not, is provide these individuals—often more dedicated, moreserious, even more charismatic than their own leaders—with the philosophicalbasis for their actions; in many cases, providing them with the ritual tools,jargon, and psychological conditioning necessary not only to perpetrate theircrimes, but to scare the living daylights out of the rest of the population.Many people in the New York City area, including some very serious occultists,were originally drawn to the OTO when it made its resurgence in 1977. It was thetime of Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The hottestunderground novel was Robert Anton Wilson’s Illuminatus! trilogy, all aboutconspiracy theories, occultism, secret societies and consciousness expansion,with healthy dollops of sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll. The occult was on theincrease, the Church of Satan was actively recruiting, as were the Wicca covens,and the OTO had decided to get back in the game after almost twenty years oflying low.At that time, the most prominent member of the OTO in New York was KristopherDowling, who later became a “Celtic Orthodox” priest in the Bishop Prophetasuccession. Gnostic Masses were held in the back of the Magickal ChildeBookstore in Manhattan, the last incarnation of the old Warlock Shop in BrooklynHeights. Gradually, the OTO went through some serious internal struggles and afight ensued between two opposing factions, one led by a Brazilian, MarcelloMotta, and the other by Grady McMurtry, who had been an Army officer and then ateacher at George Washington University. He had been referred to AleisterCrowley by Jack Parsons, who had recommended that the two visit when McMurtrywas in England during the Second World War. This was done, and when McMurtryreturned to the United States he was put in nominal charge of Parsons’ Pasadenalodge, to Parsons’ dismay. Yet, by the 1950s, the OTO was more or less moribundin America, with McMurtry in Washington, D.C., living his own life in apparentlygreat distance from the Order.By 1977, however, McMurtry was trying to gain control over the OTO by claiminghe had authorization from Crowley himself (who died in 1947; this is thirtyyears later). This claim has been disputed, at length and in detail, by Germanresearcher Peter Koenig on his website, and it makes for interesting reading.Nonetheless, when the smoke finally cleared, McMurtry’s gang had convinced ajudge that they were the legitimate OTO in America, and Motta’s claims werethrown out. Dowling went the way of all flesh, and became an Orthodox clerictaking with him a woman who had been a Theosophist and cult member herself(although not to my knowledge of the OTO). The OTO under McMurtry and hislieutenants became organized and active in New York City and things were lookingup.But their membership roles were swollen by some very strange individuals. Andthese individuals attracted some even stranger hangers-on, who had expected tosee in the OTO something more profound, more serious than they actuallyencountered. The exposure of these individuals to the Order at first stimulatedthem, but then they discovered that the rituals and the posing of the Ordermembers—their pretension to spiritual powers and profound insights—were shallow,and so they adopted what they learned in the Order’s meetings and Gnostic Massesand from discussions with other serious members and fellow-travelers, and beganto develop more serious programs of their own. The same was true of the Process.The same was true of the Church of Satan, in which case Michael Aquino brokeaway in search of something more intellectually stimulating and more powerful,creating the Temple of Set: a much more ambitious occult program than the morepopular, showy Satanism of LaVey. Many of those who broke away started their owngroups; some were as public as Aquino’s Temple of Set, others were more privateand did not advertise, because their tastes ran to the… eclectic.Thus, there were OTO members (current or lapsed) involved with nefariousactivities in New York City at the time of the Son of Sam murders. And therewere some familiar faces at OTO gatherings who could also be found at producerand theatrical agent Roy Radin’s home on Long Island, for instance, includingone young woman—a student at one of the Brooklyn schools of higher learning—whotook her occultismvery seriously, and who introduced the author to Roy Radin oneafternoon when the latter was looking into the possibility of filming occultrituals. (Roy Radin figures prominently in Maury Terry’s theory of a nationwidenetwork of Satanic killers, of which “Manson II” was a member.) None of thismeans that the OTO itself was officially involved in anything illegal. How doesone separate the acts of the organization from the acts of its members,particularly when what we are speaking of is essentially a secret society?George Washington was a Mason, and so incidentally was Robert Treat Paine. Doesthat mean that the Masonic Society started the American Revolution? Of course,some conspiracy theorists would have us think so.But when cult members engage in cult activity which results in the commission ofan illegal act, then it should be assumed that the cult itself is responsible insome way. Drug dealing is not a cult activity, even when all the members of agiven cult are involved in dealing drugs, unless “drug dealing” is in theirmanifesto or book of shadows. The same is true of murder. When a cult memberkills someone—or when a group of cult members kill someone—it is not necessarilya ritual act; the commission of the murder within a cultic ceremony, however,is. This is the point of view of the American courts, and it is valid insofar asit goes, and thankfully so.What we are examining here, however, is another level of culpability entirely.There can be no doubt that individual Process members were involved in someillegal acts; interviews conducted with a Process member a few years ago havecategorically linked David Berkowitz and other “Son of Sam” killers to theProcess, or to some faction thereof. 12[../Text/ch08.html#filepos1337879]Further, the murders of people linked toBerkowitz are evidence of a group at work and since nothing else seems to havecharacterized this group except murder and magic, then we are forced to makesome unsettling assumptions. Indeed, a published personal account of the Processmakes it clear that at least some members had knowledge that the Process wasfronting for a German neo-Nazi operation in the 1960s. 13[../Text/ch08.html#filepos1338505]Founder Robert DeGrimston’s wife, Mary Anne,even claimed that she was a reincarnation of Nazi Propaganda Chief JosefGoebbels. 14 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1338803]The Process’ symbol—a stylizedswastika—is further evidence of the group’s sentiments if not alignments; andtheir theology included worship of Satan, Jehovah and Lucifer while theirmagazine was a paean to Death, Fear, etc. To view the Process then as anamalgamation of Scientology with neo-Nazism puts us in a different realm: itraises the stakes. The neo-Nazi movement—both in Europe and in the Americas—hasbeen violent, has been responsible for murder. Scientology members themselveshave performed illegal acts in the United States, including breaking into USgovernment offices and spying on government agents, former Scientology members,etc. What occurs is a unique social phenomenon that has been inadequatelyexamined: it is the fact that these groups—which openly incorporate or idolizeLucifer, Satan, ancient Egyptian gods, Death, Fear, Nazi ideology, secretrituals and arcane initiations, and use what is sometimes a sophisticated,sometimes an ill-advised, series of psychological mechanisms such as hypnosis,auto-hypnosis, psychodrama, ritual sex, and potent hallucinogenic drugs tocreate altered states of awareness—thus may act as channels for sinister forces,forces they cannot control.In simple human terms—viewed as a commonplace social phenomenon— men like JackParsons were destroyed by these forces. Their lives, once they were activelyinvolved in serious occult practice, began to go downhill in terms of personalsuccess, material achievement, even mental health. Yet, this is sometimes trueof our best artists, musicians and novelists, as well. It is also true of manyof our philosophers and scientists. Genius—whether innate or invoked—can destroythe human vessel that carries it. The effect of Genius on the rest of society,however, is usually profound and lasts long after the death of the pennilessartist, the bipolar painter… the mad magician. Even such a figure as Jesushimself was only a minor celebrity during his lifetime; look what happened sincethen. Viewed from another angle however, from an “initiated” perspective, thedrama and tragedy of their lives was in a sense their apotheosis. Christ was onthe cross. Van Gogh, Nietzsche, Artaud, and so many, many others, went insane,committed suicide or died violently; and Hollywood filmmakers and their starsare not immune from these effects, as they consciously try to evoke violentemotions using language, art, music, dramatization… in other words all the hoaryrepertoire of the magician. Yet we speak casually of possession and genius as ifone went hand-in-hand with the other; never realizing that, in some cases,possession can be voluntary and madness temporary, and in other casespossession—even voluntary—can end in permanent madness, or death.TO THE DEVIL, A DAUGHTERIt was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I knowthat panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes.> —H.P. Lovecraft, “The Call of Cthulhu”On October 1965, Pope Paul VI made a historic visit to New York City, where hewould celebrate Mass at Yankee Stadium. This visit provided the inspiration andthe backdrop for Ira Levin’s bestselling novel,Rosemary’s Baby (1967). In thisstory, a young wife—Rosemary—is made to bear the child of Satan in order tousher in a new age of the Devil. Unknown to her at first, her next-doorneighbors are Satanists, and they arrange some lucky accidents for her husband,a struggling actor, enabling him to get lucrative roles. He gives them hiswife’s body in return, thus allowing Satan to impregnate her.All of this activity takes place at a fictional old pre-war apartment buildingon the Upper West Side which, in the novel, is known as the Bramford, but whichwas inspired by the Dakota, where the movie version of the film was made. TheDakota, of course, is where John Lennon and Yoko Ono lived, and where the formerBeatle was gunned down in December 1980.The basic scenario of a coven of Satanists drugging a young woman, using her ina blasphemous rite involving sex, and then taking her baby is familiar to mostAmericans, and has provided a template for much of the “satanic cult survivorsyndrome” of the 1980s and 1990s. Although Ira Levin’s novel is purely fiction,there was a later, non-fiction book incorporating most of the same themes. Thisbook—Michelle Remembers (1980)—became the bible of the satanic cult survivorbelievers, with its additional twist alleging that many cult members (initiatedas children) have suppressed the memory of the cult and only skilledpsychotherapy and hypnosis can bring the memories back. According to MichelleSmith, she was initiated into the cult in 1955, when she was only four yearsold. The book is compiled from transcripts of psychiatric sessions conducted byDr. Lawrence Pazder, her therapist and the man who later became her husband. Inthese transcripts, Michelle recounts horrific rituals conducted by what shecalled the Church of Satan, although this could not be a reference to the Churchof Satan of Anton Szandor LaVey, which was only begun in 1966, eleven yearsafter the events in question. The rituals involved blood-letting and sexualabuse of the child, events that evidently only Dr. Pazder’s analysis couldreveal since Michelle had no conscious memory of them.Michelle Remembers has been attacked by medical professionals and otherresearchers on various grounds; without coming down on one side or the other onthis issue, the author would like to mention that the dates given for Michelle’sinitiation—the eighty-one day “Feast of the Beast”—lasted from September 7, 1955to November 27 of the same year. On October 9, General Douglas MacArthur wasquoted in the New York Times as saying that the nations of the world shouldunite in common cause against a possible attack by alien forces, the term“alien” in this context meaning beings from other planets. (Other interestingevents during the “Feast of the Beast”: on October 13, Allen Ginsburg gave thefirst public reading of his landmark poem, Howl in San Francisco, a dayconveniently close to Aleister Crowley’s birthday of October 12, Crowley being,of course, the Great Beast himself; and on October 22, Timothy Leary’s wifecommitted suicide on her husband’s birthday, in another natal “celebration.”)Rosemary’s Baby was an instant bestseller when it was published in 1967. Theevents described were supposed to have taken place from August 1965 to June 1966(i.e., 6/66). The Pope’s visit was in October of 1965, and Rosemary’s Satanicchild was born on June 25, 1966—i.e., nine months after the Pope’s visit. (No,the implication was not that the Pope was the father!) What many people do notrealize, and what was not generally known at the time, was that there was anactual exorcism taking place in Manhattan on 125th Street, on the same day thatthe Pope celebrated Mass in Yankee Stadium (and the same daythat the fictionalRosemary was being drugged and raped in the Satanic ceremony in Manhattan). Thepossessed person in this case was “Marianne K.,” and the event is recorded inMalachi Martin’s Hostage to the Devil, a book that was not published until 1976,almost ten years after Ira Levin’s novel had hit the bookstores.15[../Text/ch08.html#filepos1339275] Marianne was a student of philosophy andphysics, born and raised a Roman Catholic, but who abandoned the faith in thecourse of her studies and became fascinated with Satanism and the occult,drawing upside-down crosses and referring to “the Man” (either an hallucinationor a real person), who indoctrinated Marianne into the mysteries of Satanism. Asa possessed subject, her taunts of the priests during her exorcism wereunusually intelligent. According to Martin’s account, Marianne had posited theexistence of two levels of communication in every being: the conscious level ofinformation exchange, and an unconscious one where there is a flow of influencefrom one being to another. This influence could be benign or malign, dependingon whether the influence served to enhance the self of the receiver or to splitit, to damage it.In addition to her philosophical ideas, as Marianne’s mental illnesspro-gressed—leaving school, living with a succession of male partners, wanderingthe parks in a general state of dishevelment—she also became progressivelysexual, picking up men and women and asking them to perform violent and bestialacts… or perhaps what would have seemed violent and bestial to a Roman Catholicpriest in 1965 America. With her voracious sexual appetite came a profoundly badsmell that could not be erased with soap and water. The symptoms sound oddlylike those of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, who also had a fascination withSatanism, an insatiable sexual appetite, and very bad body odor, which somemedical professionals associate with high levels of cadmium poisoning and itsassociated psychological disabilities.16 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1340249]Marianne K., however, was well-educated and intellectually sophisticated, asopposed to the barely literate Lucas; and, of course, there is no evidence thatMarianne committed any homicides.The exorcism seems to have been successful, although there is some ambiguity inMartin’s account of it. He does imply, however, that the exorcist’s mentor—whowas very ill at the time of the exorcism—died at the same hour as the possessionceased, in Italy over three thousand miles away. The principal exorcist himselfdied in 1966, a year after the exorcism, shaken to the end by his encounter withthe Devil. The late Malachi Martin was generally considered to be a reliable—ifcontroversial—source on matters Roman Catholic, and a kind of back channel tothe outside world for some of the Church’s viewpoints on theology and Churchpolicy. He has been attacked by other authors, though, particularly by RobertBlair Kaiser (a Robert Kennedy assassination investigator, as it turns out), whoclaims Martin seduced his wife and destroyed his marriage. The author has noreason to doubt Martin’s reportage of the exorcisms he details, however. Whetheror not one “believes” in demonic possession and exorcism is, of course, anothermatter; but there is no doubt that the Church believes in them and has beenperforming exorcisms for two thousand years. The odd coincidence that a genuineexorcism was taking place at the same time and in the same city as the placementof a fictional evocation of Satan—something Ira Levin could not have known—is anarresting piece of data.On April 30, 1966 Anton Szandor LaVey officially opened his Church of Satan inSan Francisco. April 30, of course, is the pagan feast of Walpurgisnacht, knownas Beltane in Celtic countries: one of the most important days of the pagancalendar and second only to October 31, or Halloween. During the same month,actress Sharon Tate was busy filming The Fearless Vampire Killers in London withdirector Roman Polanski, the man who would later become her husband. She hadalready filmed 13, also known as Eye of the Devil, in London the previous year.Although she was perhaps better known to American audiences for her supportingrole in Valley of the Dolls, her occult films gained her additional notoriety,especially after the Manson killings. It has been reliably reported that duringthe filming of 13 she was initiated into a form of witchcraft created by thefilm’s technical consultant, Alex Sanders. 17[../Text/ch08.html#filepos1340711]Sanders had developed an amalgam of Gardnerianwitchcraft and ceremonial magic that was known as “Alexandrian,” after itsfounder’s name; Gardnerian witchcraft itself was the creation of Gerald Gardner,a one-time customs official in Malaya and expert on the kriss—the wavy-bladedknife peculiar to Malaya and Indonesia—who returned to Great Britain and becameinvolved with Aleister Crowley. Crowley actually wrote many of Gardner’s ritualsafter the latter became initiated into Crowley’s OTO. The flavor of theGardnerian Book of Shadows—the witch’s spellbook—is distinctly Crowleyan, andeven has poems by Kipling, presented as if they were ancient pagan chants. AlexSanders took some of the Gardnerian concept and mixed it with a somewhat moreintellectually-demanding collection of ceremonial magic rituals, and it was thisinto which Sanders claimed to have initiated Sharon Tate. The same sourcesuggests that Sanders had also had contact with members of the Manson “family,”either directly or through his wide network of Alexandrian covens in Europe,America and Australia. There is also evidence that Sanders’ group had interactedwith the Process, and, if so, this is yet another connection to Manson and tothe Tate murders.This is a suggestive series of events, though. When Roman Polanski was asked todirect the film version of Rosemary’s Baby, he hired Anton LaVey to act astechnical consultant for that project, thus putting Sharon Tate in the path oftwo well-known twentieth century occultists and admirers of Crowley: AlexSanders and Anton LaVey. What is even more suggestive is the fact that MansonFamily member, and later convicted killer, Susan Atkins performed the role of avampire in LaVey’s 1967 public production of a Black Mass, in which she rosemenacingly from a coffin. LaVey himself performed the role of the Devil in oneof avant-garde filmmaker Kenneth Anger’s offerings, Invocation of My DemonBrother (1969), alongside Bobby Beausoleil, another Manson Family member andconvicted murderer. Jack Parsons’ widow Marjorie Cameron had once appeared inAnger’s Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954), in a dual role as Kali and theScarlet Woman.A later Anger film, Lucifer Rising (1970), was an Anita Pallenberg production,which featured Marianne Faithfull in the role of Lilith. The musical score wasby Bobby Beausoleil, then already in prison for his participation in the MansonFamily murders, and the film was shot in Egypt and in Externsteine, the Teutonicpagan shrine in Germany that was sacred to the Nazis. For this film, Angerenlisted the aid of Gerald Yorke as “Thelemic consultant,” i.e., as an advisoron the Crowleyan aspects of the film’s mythology. The names of Pallenberg,Faithfull, Beausoleil, LaVey and Atkins all figure prominently in our story, aswe shall presently see.As the Manson Family was located in California, it is perhaps no accident thatthey would become involved in film. It should be noted, however, that none ofthe Anger films referred to here were Hollywood productions in the usual sense.They were not done by the major studios, with big budgets and brand-name stars.These were labors of love by a filmmaker with an abiding interest in AleisterCrowley and the religion of Thelema. Anger also felt he had “discovered” BobbyBeausoleil, and saw him as the perfect Lucifer.Anger was not the only one to use Beausoleil as a film actor. The soft-pornproduction Ramrodder—an “E.S.I. Production” shot in Topanga Canyon—featuresBobby Beausoleil as a murderous Indian with Buck knife (the same type he used tokill Gary Hinman?), and Manson Family member Cathy “Gypsy” Share as an Indian“squaw.” One of the central acts of the film involves the rape and murder of ablonde woman by a group of rampaging Indians. The film is high on productionvalue but low on virtually everything else, from script to acting. Even the sexacts are chastely mimed, with a strange over-emphasis on close-ups of swingingbuttocks. The value of this film, however, lies in the fact that Manson Familymembers Bobby Beausoleil and Cathy Share are actors, that they portray peopleliving rough who turn murderous, and that there is a scene showing the murder ofa blonde woman by a group of these Native American “Hippies” led by BobbyBeausoleil. When the blonde asks, “Why me?” the Beausoleil characterresponds,You are paying for the sins of your people, just as our people arepaying for the crimes of our fathers who sold our land and our honor to thewhite man for a string of beads…. [The Chief] says we must live by the whiteman’s law. Does not the white man’s law say you are to take an eye for an eye?Further, the castration of a white man by Bobby Beausoleil is also aforeshadowing of the murder he would commit on musician Gary Hinman, using thesame type of weapon. The portrayal of the Indian tribe as a group of promiscuousyoung people wearing headbands and indulging in both straight and lesbian sexualacts could be a rehearsal of the Manson Family experience, or of the Summer ofLove generally. It is the degeneration of this “Hippie life-style” into a seasonof violence and murder—portrayed by Manson Family members as actors—that leadsthe author to propose that this is yet another manifestation of the influence ofsinister forces below the surface of everyday actions.No major studios produced the Anger films or Ramrodder. A major studio didproduce Rosemary’s Baby, however. The executive producer on this project wasRobert Evans, and it is Evans who will tie us in with a world of occultism,serial murder, secret societies, drug running and Hollywood celebrities thatwill lead from California to New York… and back to Ashland, Kentucky. Alsoreleased in 1968 was The Devil Rides Out, a film version of the Dennis Wheatleynovel about a coven of murderous magicians, starring Christopher Lee. A formerBritish intelligence agent and friend of Aleister Crowley, author Wheatley hadwritten a trilogy of novels with a satanic theme, including—in addition to theabove—The Satanist and To The Devil, A Daughter (this last also made into amovie in 1975 starring the ubiquitous Christopher Lee as well as NastassiaKinski). These novels were based in part on Wheatley’s personal knowledge ofCrowley, the OTO and Crowley’s own occult Order, the A... A.. . (ArgentumAstrum, or “Silver Star”), and are amusing romans á clef for those so inclined,filled with paranormal events, ritual magic, human sacrifice and even—in thecase of The Satanist—the involvement of a US military officer as cult leader.But before we delve too deeply into this unbelievable morass of hidden forces,let us first examine the events around another filmmaker in 1968, and thetragedy of a year’s worth of political assassinations.THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATEThen Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated, there was a lot of talk in the mediaabout a “Kennedy Curse.” After all, Joe Kennedy’s eldest son, Joseph Jr., waskilled in the war. John F. Kennedy was assassinated; then Robert Kennedy wasassassinated. When Ted Kennedy later became embroiled in Chappaquiddick, it wasconsidered just another piece of evidence that a Kennedy Curse did exist.Of course, it is unscientific to talk of a Kennedy curse. What is the definitionof a curse, exactly, and how does it apply in this case? Yet, if we deny theexistence of something so insubstantial and unprovable as a curse, then we areforced to consider whether or not John Kennedy and his brother, Robert, werekilled as the result of something else. Coincidence? Or conspiracy? And if notcoincidence or conspiracy, what is the alternative? A curse… or something moreprofound?The Richard Condon novel, The Manchurian Candidate, was published in 1959 andbecame a best-seller. It told of an American GI who was captured by theCommunists during the Korean War, brainwashed, and sent back to the UnitedStates as a programmed assassin: his target, a candidate for President of theUnited States.The film version starred Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury, andwas directed by John Frankenheimer. Frankenheimer had asked then-President JohnF. Kennedy if it was okay to make the movie, as it dealt with Communistbrainwashing and the assassination of an American political leader.Frankenheimer was afraid that the sensational aspects of the plot would eitherinflame the American public or otherwise have an effect on Kennedy’s ongoingnegotiations with the Soviets, which had become exacerbated by the Bay of Pigsinvasion and the Cuban missile crisis. Kennedy was also trying to get theSoviets to come to the table to ban nuclear weapons testing, and was embroiledin Vietnam. Frankenheimer did not want to create an atmosphere that would rockany boat the President might be sailing at the time. Kennedy told Frankenheimerto go ahead with the film and not to worry about any political fallout.The film was released in 1962 to much critical acclaim; but in 1963 Kennedy wasassassinated, and the film was pulled from distribution almost immediately, andwas not seen again for almost thirty years.Five years later, in June of 1968, John Frankenheimer hosted a small dinnerparty at his home in Malibu. Among the guests were Roman Polanski and his wife,Sharon Tate. The guest of honor was Senator Robert F. Kennedy, then running tobecome Democratic candidate for President. Four of his children were alsopresent at the dinner. The California Primary polls were open, and there wasnothing else for the Senator to do until the winner was announced except enjoythe company of film stars and studio executives. It was to be his last supper.Frankenheimer drove the Senator to the Ambassador Hotel after dinner, where hewould stay up the night to watch the election results. By midnight, it becameobvious that Kennedy had won the California Primary. He went to the Embassy Roomdownstairs and declared victory to the cheers of his supporters. “On toChicago!” A few moments later, he was shot to death. The accused assassin wasSirhan Bishara Sirhan, the Palestinian immigrant and Rosicrucian wannabe. Heclaimed (and still claims) to have no memory of the assassination (even thoughit took place in front of witnesses), and notebooks found in his home—seizedwithout a warrant—opened a Pandora’s box of conspiracy theories, as they tendedto support the view that Sirhan had been the subject of a mind controlexperiment. Also discovered was a book by occultist Manley Palmer Hall, TheDivine Art of Healing. The famous “girl in the polka dot dress” was seen withSirhan by several witnesses, and then running from the scene shouting, “Wekilled him!” LAPD, in its infinite wisdom, discounted the testimony of theseeye-witnesses almost immediately. Sirhan himself appeared remarkably calm andpeaceful when he was jumped by ex-football star Roosevelt Grier among others,yet it took six men to hold him down even though he was a small, thin man.The following day, June 8, James Earl Ray—the accused assassin of Martin LutherKing, Jr. in Memphis that past April—was picked up in London trying to getaboard a flight to Belgium. Ray was an ex-convict, broke, and not too bright.But he was doing a lot of traveling around the US and Europe that year. He wouldbe brought back to the United States to stand trial for the assassination ofKing, but many were not satisfied with the evidence produced on behalf of theprosecution, and Ray himself complained that he had been manipulated by hisdefense team.> A week later Rosemary’s Baby premieres in Los Angeles, with Sharon Tate and> director Roman Polanski very much in evidence, while in the meantime the> Process goes underground in California.As with the assassination of President Kennedy, the author has no intention togo over all the detail of the assassination of his brother and to prove a caseone way or the other that a conspiracy might have been involved. As with theassassination of President Kennedy, there is enough circumstantial evidence tosuggest the role of other parties in the murder of his brother, but due tomishandling of the crime scene and conflicting witness reports there willprobably never be a definitive solution to the case. There are, however,elements of the crime that stand out as suggestive of the existence of darkerforces at work, forces that may have been called into being by the CIA’saggressive use of mind control techniques in their search for the perfect, theManchurian, assassin.One of the men who was moved to investigate the murder of Senator Kennedy wasformer FBI agent and Democratic Party Congressional candidate William Turner,who, with his campaign manager Jonn Christian, co-authored The Assassination ofRobert F. Kennedy: The Conspiracy and Cover-Up (1993). Clearly, Turner seesevidence of a conspiracy to kill the Senator, and he marshals a compelling arrayof evidence to show this.One of the chief elements of the case in Turner’s view is the possibility thatSirhan was one of the first programmed assassins. First, there is theconsideration of the cult angle. He bases this not only on Sirhan’s famousnotebook—which contains numerous allusions to the Illuminati, to “Kuthumi”(evidently a phonetic equivalent of Theosophy’s disembodied spiritual guideMaster Koot Humi), and other occult subjects—but also on several pieces ofevidence which put Sirhan in contact with people adorned with occult jewelryonly hours before the assassination. Sirhan, after his arrest, also requestedcopies of Madame Blavatsky’s The Secret Doctrine, as well as Talks on the Pathof Occultism, Volume 1: At the Feet of the Master, co-authored by Blavatsky’sTheosophical Society successor and political firebrand Annie Besant andwandering “Bishop” and Theosophist Charles W. Leadbetter. Several right-wingtheorists in California at the time attempted to put the blame for theassassination on an Illuminati/Rosicrucian/Theosophist conspiracy, another wayof saying (to them) the Council on Foreign Relations and the TrilateralCommission. However, the evidence—as Turner and Christian demonstrate—goesdeeper than a possible cult connection to Sirhan, although we see our oldfriends, the wandering bishops, turn up again in the figure of one of Turner’stop suspects in the case, hypnotist and suspected mind controller Dr. WilliamJoseph Bryan, Jr.As mentioned previously, investigative researchers tend to ignore the WanderingBishop phenomenon because it is just too weird and seemingly irrelevant;certainly, one has to be pretty much of an expert in the subject to see anyrelevance at all, and it may be doubtful whether the effort is worth the candle.Yet, the author has seen this subject come up again and again in his ownresearch, and since he has had first hand acquaintance with the eldritch worldof episcopi vagantes, the associations are made more readily, and interestingrelationships are revealed. They certainly introduce us to a web of intrigue;the Soviet KGB made use of the Eastern Orthodox Churches in their espionagestrategies—as is described at length in the memoirs of just such a spy, VasiliMitrokhin, in The Mitrokhin Archive18 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1341770]—and thechurches that harbor the wandering bishops are, in many cases, close cousins.Archbishop Valerian Trifa of the Romanian Orthodox Church in America was exposedas a dedicated Nazi leader, a member of the notorious Iron Guard, who fled tothe United States in the guise of a Romanian Orthodox priest, and wound up incharge of the entire archdiocese.19 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1342304] Many Naziwar criminals escaped to South America, and all over the world, courtesy of therat lines established by the Vatican and in many cases disguised as priests:priests who performed the sacraments, celebrating Mass and solemnizing nuptialsalong the way. The Palestine Liberation Organization also had close connectionswith the Eastern churches, particularly with the ethnic Arab denominations, andhas been known to run agents who are either disguised as priests or are actuallypriests themselves. (There are many Arab Christians. For instance Sirhan Sirhanwas not a Muslim, contrary to many assumptions, but a Christian.) Thus, itshould come as no surprise to us that American intelligence agencies also madeuse of these groups, both the venerable and legitimate Eastern Orthodox Churches(such as the Greek Orthodox Church, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia,the Syrian Orthodox Church) and the renegade churches, such as the Old RomanCatholic Church and the American Orthodox Catholic Church.According to William Turner, Dr. Bryan belonged to the Old Roman CatholicChurch, 20 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1342856]but Turner refers to it somewhaterroneously as “a fire-and-brimstone sect,” which it is not. The Old RomanCatholic Church is more self-consciously Roman than the Catholic Church in manyways; the break between the denomination that would be known as the “OldCatholics” and Rome took place because the Old Catholics would not accept PapalInfallibility, and they had some other reservations about what was decided atthe First Vatican Council (Vatican I) as well. The Old Catholics felt that theRoman Catholic Church had lost its bearing and was not being faithful to theoriginal religion. The official break occurred in the 1870s, but the groundworkhad been laid two hundred years earlier (when the Jansenists objected to Romefor pretty much the same reasons), and the line of apostolic succession held bythe Old Roman Catholics goes back to the Church of Holland, which had beenoperating autonomously since that time but which was still a legitimate Catholicbody. There has also been a lot of additional consecrations of Old Catholicbishops by different—usually Eastern Orthodox—groups and the Old Catholics inAmerica have splintered into so many different groups themselves that one needsa scorecard to tell them apart, particularly when their published claims ofsuccession are often misleading. Thus, when someone says that so-and-so is anOld Roman Catholic, detailed clarification is needed to determine just which OldCatholic group is being referenced.There is nothing fire-and-brimstone about them, however; they generally preferthe sedate and dignified approach, bolstered by elaborate ritual vestments,clouds of incense, and heavy episcopal jewelry (no matter how weird theirindividual members may be). Turner says that this sect “broke away from theVatican over a century ago,”21 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1343405] which isconsistent with the same Old Roman Catholic Church we have been discussing.Turner maintains that Bryan belonged to this group “as a preacher.” If so, thenit was certain he was a priest, if not a bishop, in that church. Turner iscorrect in mentioning that it is the same church to which David Ferrie belonged;as we saw in the previous chapter, Ferrie was on close terms with both an OldRoman Catholic bishop, Earl James, and the testimony of Bishop Carl Stanley ofthe American Orthodox Catholic Church to the FBI gives evidence of hisrelationship to that organization. Since these churches swapped ordinations andconsecrations like baseball cards, it is entirely possible (nay, likely) thatFerrie was a priest or bishop of the Old Roman Catholic Church as well as of theAmerican Orthodox Catholic Church, making Ferrie and Bryan fellow clergymen.They may have known each other—or of each other—if they had been members at thesame time. There was an Old Roman Catholic operation in Los Angeles for manyyears, as well as an American Orthodox Catholic Church operation. There werealso groups in Texas and throughout the South; and, during the Sixties, theChurch attracted all sorts of counter-culture elements. The Old Roman Catholiccathedral in New York was in the heart of Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, andthe church hierarchy at the time was composed of Black bishops, thus making thedenomination completely integrated, and it was open-minded about a lot oftheological issues that still plague the Vatican today, such as birth control,married clergy, etc.The world of the wandering bishops is a small one, and everyone knows everyoneelse. If, however, Bryan belonged to the American Orthodox Catholic Church asdid Ferrie, then it is almost a certainty that he was involved with a domesticintelligence operation that was using the Church as a convenient (and verycooperative) cover. The parallels do not stop there, however.As noted earlier, David Ferrie was something of an amateur hypnotist, and heused hypnosis and drugs in some combination in his dubious “therapies,” probablyas a method of seduction. William Joseph Bryan was a much more successfulhypnotist (it was his career), and, as a notorious womanizer, often usedhypnosis for pretty much the same purposes as Ferrie; and his resume was ifanything even more suggestive. A large, bearded man who taxed the scales atnearly 400 pounds, he was even stranger in his appearance than hairless Ferrie;a fat man who expected his secretaries to sleep with him, and who used hypnosisto sexually exploit still others. He demonstrated his hypnotic powers in publicon many occasions, even putting noted defense attorney F. Lee Bailey under,along with two other lawyers, in a seminar organized by Melvin Belli (talk abouta “dream team”). He also consulted on many famous criminal cases, and hadhypnotized accused serial killer Albert DiSalvo (the “Boston Strangler”) in hiscell.Bryan worked in the Los Angeles area, out of an office on Sunset Strip inHollywood, after a checkered career in which he was once a drummer for TommyDorsey’s band and then, during the Korean War, worked for the US Air Force inwhat he termed “the brainwashing section.”22 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1343691]If this was, in fact, true and not some of Bryan’s notorious hyperbole, then hecertainly came to the attention of the CIA, which had just geared up OperationBLUEBIRD at this time and had sent agents to Korea to investigate thebrainwashing phenomenon and to come up with ways to protect American servicemenagainst it. In fact, he would have been working for, or with, Dr. James Monroe,the Air Force officer we met in the previous chapter, who also specialized inbrainwashing and was adopted by the CIA. As an admittedly powerful hypnotist,Bryan would have been scooped up by the CIA almost at once. Hypnosis—along withdrugs—was the CIA’s immediate strategy in the development of the “ManchurianCandidate,” and they were working with hypnotists in New York and elsewhere inthe attempt to develop a workable protocol. If the records of Bryan’s successesare anything to go by, then he already had the system down pat. According toBryan’s associates, he admitted to working for the CIA; the only question is,for how long?Bryan had a flamboyant personality and a lifestyle that would have beenvulnerable for an ordinary intelligence operative; Bryan had no qualms aboutdiscussing his sexual exploits, however, so he was a poor target for blackmail.From available evidence in the public record, if Bryan was involved with the CIAas he claimed, it was probably in the capacity of a consultant, although one canimagine cases in which he would have been called in to perform a tricky hypnoticmaneuver. This is, in fact, the belief of investigators such as Turner andChristian, as well as Political Science Professor Philip H. Melanson (The RobertF. Kennedy Assassination, 1991,1994). They believe sufficient evidence exists tosuggest that Bryan was the hypno-programmer of Sirhan Sirhan.They base this on several pieces of information that have no other plausibleexplanation. In the first place, eyewitnesses to the shooting of Senator Kennedyhave claimed that Sirhan’s demeanor was strangely distant andremoved—“peaceful”—when he was pounced on by Kennedy supporters in the momentsafter the killing. Sirhan himself claims no memory of the assassination,although he did not deny that he did it.Before Sirhan’s identity was madepublic, Bryan was on a radio show giving his opinion that the assassin had beenhypnotically programmed. And one of Sirhan’s notebooks contained serial killerDiSalvo’s name repeated several times, although Sirhan himself does not knowwhy. Although Bryan would gleefully describe any of the cases he worked on,especially high-profile cases like DiSalvo, he would change the subject whenSirhan’s case was brought up, and occasionally turn angry at reporters orinvestigators who had the temerity to mention it. This was uncharacteristic ofBryan, and points to another level of knowledge about the case.Eerily, Sirhan would also turn angry and upset when the Rosicrucians werementioned, insisting that they not be brought into the investigation. This hasled Turner and Christian to wonder if that was a deliberate hypnotic suggestion,implanted by Bryan or some other programmer, to divert attention away from thereal conspirators. The “DiSalvo” reference in Sirhan’s notebooks, however,suggests that the name of this alleged serial killer was brought up duringSirhan’s programming, perhaps as a trigger word or, more likely, as a referenceback to the original programmer. This would have to have been Bryan, since Bryanfamously worked on the DiSalvo case. Did Bryan plant the “DiSalvo” reference asa kind of calling card? Or did Sirhan see the name of his programmer linked toDiSalvo in a newspaper or magazine article? There is no other connection betweenSirhan and DiSalvo that anyone has been able to discover. It is perhaps the onlypure anomaly in Sirhan’s notebooks. It has nothing to do with politics, withRobert Kennedy, with the Illuminati or the Theosophists. It is as glaring—in thecontext of the notebooks—as a black cat on a white rug. The only connection toboth Sirhan and DiSalvo is, of course, Bryan himself.At one point, and to select individuals, Bryan claimed to have hypnotizedSirhan. There is no evidence linking Sirhan to Bryan after the assassination,however. Something like that would have become a matter of public record,considering the amount of scrutiny the case was getting in the wake of thebotched investigation and follow-up of the JFK assassination. Bryan certainlywould have made loud publicity over the fact that he hypnotized Sirhan if infact he had done so; it would have made an impressive addition to his resume.Yet, Bryan claimed to have never hypnotized Sirhan when pressed by anindependent researcher, and abruptly terminated the interview. Thus, Bryan hadtwo stories about Sirhan. If Bryan did hypnotize the Palestinian immigrant, itwas before the assassination; and for this, we are on firmer ground becauseSirhan was hypnotized prior to June 1968.Researcher, and William Turner’s co-author, Jonn Christian interviewed ahypnotherapist who had encountered Sirhan in Pasadena in 1966. Thehypnotherapist—Richard St. Charles—also had a stage act, and he would hand outslips for people to fill in their names and addresses for a mailing list.Sirhan’s name and address was on one of them. Based on notes he made at thetime, St. Charles recalled that Sirhan was a good hypnotic subject and, in hisopinion, had been hypnotized before St. Charles ever met him. Thus, Sirhan hadbeen hypnotized by St. Charles in 1966, and possibly by someone else evenearlier. In fact, Sirhan was not the only assassin who had prior experience ofhypnosis. James Earl Ray had also been hypnotized in Los Angeles two monthsbefore the assassination of Dr. King—by one Reverend Xavier von Koss—and a bookon hypnotism was found in his safe house in Toronto, one of the stops he madebefore escaping to Europe. 23 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1343982]As we have already seen, the CIA’s BLUEBIRD—and later ARTICHOKE andMK-ULTRA—program was aggressive in its use of hypnosis as a mechanism for mindcontrol, and employed the services of several hypnotists in its assault on theLand of Memory. Dr. William Joseph Bryan claimed to have been one of them; andto intimate friends he also claimed to have hypnotized Sirhan Sirhan, althoughhe would officially deny it. If Bryan was as good as everyone claimed hewas—himself included—it is inconceivable that the CIA would not have approachedhim. If he did, in fact, serve in the military in Korea as a kind of“anti-brainwashing” expert, then we can assume with a great degree of certaintythat Bryan used his hypnotic powers in an intelligence capacity beginning in the1950s. Many of the people who knew Bryan—including other hypnotists andhypnotherapists—say that Bryan made no secret of the fact that he had worked orwas working for the CIA in some capacity. A lot of people make claims like that,and more often than not they are tall tales and perhaps wishful (or wistful)thinking; but in Bryan’s case we have quite a lot of smoke: it’s the location ofthe fire that remains a mystery. The flamboyant and sex-addicted Bryan mayindeed be a red herring, distracting us from Sirhan’s real programmer. Let’s seewho else was in California on June 5, 1968.THE CONTROL OF CANDY JONESAt the time I first met Candy Jones, I was unaware of the book about herexperiences as a mind control subject, The Control of Candy Jones (1976), byfamily friend Donald Bain. Bain himself is an interesting personality:accomplished jazz musician, former Air Force officer, and screenwriter for thefamous Murder, She Wrote television series starring Angela Lansbury. He hadknown Long John Nebel for many years, and when Nebel began to discover hiswife’s bizarre past, it was to Donald Bain that he turned to put the events intosome kind of focus and to tell the tale of a young woman, a fashion model famousduring World War II for her red-and-white striped bathing suit and generousdecolletage, being brought unsuspecting into CIA’s MK-ULTRA program.When the book was published, the reaction was generally one of disbelief. LongJohn Nebel himself was an outrageous radio personality with a penchant for goingfor the jugular with his oddball guests, and he had a fascination with theparanormal, UFOs and the like: a 1960s version of Art Bell. So when he justhappened to marry a woman whom he later claimed was a CIA mind control subject,there was naturally some resistance to the story. When the name of the actualcontroller was disguised in the book with a pseudonym—Dr. Gilbert Jensen—thenincredulity turned to contempt in some circles, and the book’s thesis wasignored. It was pulled from distribution sometime in 1977, amid rumors of a cashsettlement whose terms and parties were never made public, and therein the storydied. The name of the alleged controller has never been revealed, and except forthe fact that he served in the Pacific theatre as a medic during World War II,subsequently had an office in Oakland, California in the 1960s, and was ofJewish extraction, we know very little about him. What we do have is CandyJones’ story, and it is a very strange tale indeed of hypnosis, drugs, mindcontrol experiments, foreign assignments, torture, and a post-hypnoticinstruction to commit suicide. It is a story made even more bizarre by theperipheral characters involved, one of whom would become a member of the WarrenCommission and later President of the United States, the same man who would bethe focus of an alleged assassination attempt by a former Manson Family member.Briefly, then, the story of Candy Jones begins in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,with a troubled childhood, an abusive mother, a kindly grandmother, and alargely absent father. Candy—born Jessica Wilcox on December 31, 1925—waselected Miss Atlantic City in June 1941. Modeling agent John Powers invited herto New York City on a spurious offer to appear in a Chesterfield cigarette ad,and when that didn’t pan out she found herself visiting the offices ofcompetitor Harry Conover.Harry Conover had formed his modeling agency in partnership with another malemodel, Gerald Ford. Yes, the same Gerald Ford who would become President of theUnited States. Ford eventually went on to greater and dubious glory, but Conoverheld on to the agency, and it prospered for a while. He signed Jessica Wilcoxand created the “Candy” image for her. Eventually, they would marry, and CandyJones turned into something of a money machine for the Conover agency. Butbefore they married, Candy Jones signed on with the USO to do a tour of theSouth Pacific with a traveling roadshow as “Captain” Candy Jones.It was Candy Jones that people of my parents’ generation remember as the WAC andWAVE girl, urging young ladies to enlist during the War years. She was also avery popular pin-up girl in the candy-striped bathing suit that was hertrademark, as well as in a more demure gown fashioned of parachute nylon. Herpicture could be found in GI barracks all over Asia, and her tour was enormouslysuccessful until the day she contracted an illness from drinking unpasteurizedmilk, and had to be hospitalized in the Philippines. This was in April 1945.The illness was compounded by malaria and jungle rot, and eventually Candy foundher hair falling out and her complexion turning different shades from themalaria. It was during this time in hospital that she met a medic, who is namedDr. Gilbert Jensen in the Donald Bain book. It was a chance meeting amid thelast days of the War, and she did not think of it again for nearly fifteenyears.She eventually recovered from her illnesses, returned to the States, and marriedHarry Conover. She landed a number of prestigious accounts and opened her ownoffice next to Conover’s, although the billing for her accounts went throughConover’s agency as before. She was later to regret the arrangement, as Conoverdisappeared on May 18, 1958, taking all the money in their joint accounts andnot reappearing until August, when he had taken rooms at the Plaza Hotel, avenue for wild parties he hosted with some of the teenaged models from theagency. Eventually, Harry Conover would serve two years in prison for his theftof the company funds, but Candy Jones was now in financial straits, strugglingto keep her agency together.It was during this time that she met Gene Tunney, the former prize-fighter, whohad an office across the hall from hers. His office had been burgled—evidentlyby someone dressed as a cleaning woman—although not much was taken… except forphotographs. It seems that Candy remembered flash bulbs going off in the officethe night of the break-in, as if someone were taking pictures of the office orits contents. Tunney seemed nonplussed by the experience, and shrugged it off.She later saw Tunney in company with a retired Army general she had knownbriefly in the Pacific theatre. Speculation on the Internet has it that this wasGeneral William “Wild Bill” Donovan, head of the OSS during the War.One day, perhaps, someone will do some research on the intelligence activitiesof retired fighters. As mentioned in an earlier chapter, Antonino Rocca wascertainly one of these; perhaps Sugar Ray Robinson performed some service inthat regard, due to his close proximity to the Profumo affair by way of MaryAnne Moore. Gene Tunney must be another, for shortly after the break-in at hisoffice, Candy Jones is visited by an FBI agent known only as “Ted,” who asks herquestions about the break-in which then segues into a request for her to assistin an FBI mail-drop operation.In this case, she will receive mail that is addressed to specific people notworking at her agency. She is to hold the mail until an FBI agent comes to pickit up. This is all well and good, until “the general” himself phones in the latesummer of 1960 and asks her to take a letter to someone in San Francisco, whereshe will be organizing a fashion show. Since this is the same “general” in 1960as the one who met Gene Tunney in 1958, it is rather unlikely that he is GeneralDonovan, since Wild Bill died in 1959. In any event, it gradually becomes clearthat “Ted” was probably not an FBI agent, and that the mail drop was a CIA drop,because when she arrives in San Francisco she is phoned by the pseudonymousGilbert Jensen, and a meeting is arranged at his office on Cyprus Street inOakland, where she undergoes her first hypnotic trance.San Francisco was a hotbed of MK-ULTRA activity in the 1960s, incorporatingeverything from drugs to hypnosis and, later, to paranormal and occult research.In 1955, MK-ULTRA operator George White (who worked for the Federal Bureau ofNarcotics and not directly for the CIA, and thus had “plausible deniability”)had moved to San Francisco from New York City, where he had run a “safehouse”that was used to test the effects of various drugs on prostitutes and theirclients via two-way mirrors and the like. He set up an identical operation onTelegraph Hill, and wired it for sound, bringing in hookers, their johns, andeventually a whole assortment of local characters, both underworld and“civilian.” George White’s operation in San Francisco went on until the summerof 1963, covering the time of Candy Jones’ first visit to the hypnotist in theautumn of 1960. Thus, there was a proven CIA presence in San Francisco under theauspices of the MK-ULTRA mind control program at the time of her recruitment,something that was not revealed until much later, when the RockefellerCommission hearings into CIA’s domestic intelligence operations began in 1975.24 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1344271]While White specialized in drug testing—his job for the Narcotics Bureau was theperfect cover, and guaranteed him an almost unlimited supply of any type ofdrug—there were others in the area whose specialty was hypnosis. While hypnosissounds tame by comparison, it actually had great potential as an intelligenceweapon when wielded by the right hand and on the right subject. Much of what hasbeen written on the applicability of hypnosis to a Manchurian Candidate scenariois fundamentally flawed: many investigators claim that since only one in everyfive persons is a perfect candidate for hypnosis, and since a hypnotized subjectwill not do anything to which he or she morally objects, hypnosis is thereforeuseless. They ignore the obvious implication that fully twenty percent of thehuman population is capable of “going under” without too much difficulty, andthat many of these potential subjects would not find murder, rape, theft,deceit, etc., morally objectionable, particularly if the command was given by arecognized authority figure. Therefore, to the author’s mind, the rejection ofthe Manchurian Candidate-by-hypnosis possibility is ill-informed at best, ordisingenuous at worst.As an example, the CIA’s own Morse Allen—who led the hypnosis side of the searchfor the Manchurian Candidate—performed experiments on his own staff in the 1950swhich demonstrated how easy it was to get someone to pull the trigger. Asdescribed in John Marks’ The Search for the Manchurian Candidate, Allenhypnotized a secretary on February 19, 1954 sending her into a deep trance. Hethen hypnotized another secretary and told her she had to wake up the firstsecretary; if she could not, then she should become enraged, pick up a pistoland kill her. The first secretary was unable to come out of the trance unlessMorse Allen gave her the command, and therefore could not be awakened; thus thesecond secretary became enraged and picked up a pistol—not knowing it wasunloaded—and shot the first woman. When she was brought out of the trance, shehad no memory of the event and insisted she would never shoot anyone.25[../Text/ch08.html#filepos1344759] What more evidence is necessary? A woman wastold to commit an outrageous act of which she would not have been capable in awaking state, a morally-reprehensible act, in fact murder, and then had nomemory of it upon awakening. As early as 1954, therefore, the CIA had thetechnology in hand to create programmed assassins. The only difficulty theyfaced was the “delivery system”: how to snatch an unwitting person, a personwith no discernible ties to the Agency, put them under, and give them thepost-hypnotic suggestion to kill another human being? They needed to experimenton the real world, and several scenarios were developed that would enable CIAoperators to implement this technology under “battlefield” conditions.One involved the snatch of an agent of a friendly foreign intelligence servicefrom a party, putting him in a hypnotic trance, and giving him the command toassassinate a certain figure. This scenario had come up at the same time asAllen’s experiment with his secretaries. The problem was that the secretarieswere willing to be hypnotized; Allen was not sure that a man snatched from aparty with no advanced warning could be hypnotized in a short time—a matter ofan hour or so—and given a command that he would carry out. What Allen wantedwere defectors, double agents, people to which the Agency already had access,and who would undergo hypnosis as part of a routine “medical examination.” 26[../Text/ch08.html#filepos1345046]In addition, Allen wanted to know if a person who had been hypnotized to forgetcertain vital information—a lock on the Land of Memory to which only thehypnotist had the key—could stand up under torture. Allen had suggested they usethe services of a friendly foreign intelligence agency or police department,such as “Taiwan or Paraguay,” (nations where torture as an interrogation toolwas widely practiced) to test the strength of the posthypnotic amnesiac state.27[../Text/ch08.html#filepos1345337] This way, they could create a genuine,threatening and dangerous environment equal to that a real agent wouldexperience if captured by an enemy agency; plus the CIA would have distanceditself (legally, if not morally) from the actual torture of the subject. Moreplausible deniability. The subject would be tortured by these foreign agents inan effort to make him to reveal “classified” information.According to the CIA, there is no knowledge of such vile experimentationactually taking place.According to Candy Jones, it did.Her first meeting with Gilbert Jensen in Oakland included a hypnotic session. Hefirst asked her a number of questions about her personal life, including detailsabout her childhood: specifically, about imaginary playmates she had. This ispotentially the most explosive area of the investigation because, as we will seeand as has been reported by Marks and others, the CIA explored the possibilityof creating or developing alternate personalities in their mind controlsubjects, essentially manipulating what DSM-IV calls “dissociative identitydisorder,” or what used to be known as “multiple personality disorder.” The CIAfelt that if access was had to a violent personality hidden within the subject,then that personality could commit violent acts and keep the memory from theconscious recall of the core personality. It was a sophisticated approach tohuman consciousness for western science, but on the level of medieval sorcery orAfrican witchcraft. As Marks writes,The candidate had to be among the one person in five who make a good hypnoticsubject, and he needed to have dissociative tendency to separate part of hispersonality from the main body of his consciousness. The hope was to take anexisting ego state—such as an imaginary childhood play-mate—and build it into aseparate personality, unknown to the first. The hypnotist would communicatedirectly with this schizophrenic offshoot and command it to carry out specificdeeds about which the main personality would know nothing. 28[../Text/ch08.html#filepos1345624]Marks’ book was published in 1979; Donald Bain’s book on Candy Jones waspublished in 1976. Marks’ account of the CIA’s program based on officialdocuments obtained under the Freedom of Information Act in 1975-78 andinterviews with those involved, thus provides compelling corroboration of CandyJones’ account given to Donald Bain in 1974 (before the Rockefeller Commissionhearings began in June of 1975). In fairness, it must be added, rumors about theCIA’s mind control program were leaking out before then.During hypnosis there was a deliberate attempt to focus on one of Ms. Jones’“alters,” an imaginary playmate of Candy’s childhood, who turned into theaggressive and cynical personality known as Arlene Grant. The “Arlene Grant”persona was discussed during Ms. Jones’ first visit with Jensen, even includinghair coloring, much to Candy’s irritation since the questions seemed ratherbizarre for someone who was interviewing her for a possible role in Americanintelligence. During the course of several visits to Jensen’s office during 1960and 1961, Jensen “conjured” Arlene Grant to appear, using what appears to be acombination of drugs—possibly including sodium amytal—and hypnosis. Thisrelationship with “Arlene” would continue for 12 years.G. H. Estabrooks—one of the most creative specialists in the subject ofhypnosis—wrote that the goal of the military hypnotist in wartime was toactually induce multiple personalities.29 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1345911]Estabrooks was writing this in the 1940s, when the subject to most people stillseemed far-fetched, the stuff of penny-dreadfuls, but which to the CIA was righton target. According to Estabrooks, one personality would be a dedicatedCommunist (for example) and anti-American, while the other personality would bea dedicated anti-Communist and pro-American. The Communist personality wouldhave no knowledge of the anti-Communist personality, but the latter would haveall of the former’s memories as well as its own. This is, of course, classicdissociative identity disorder, a psychological illness that has been usedoccasionally as a defense for murder in the American courts.Candy Jones was a blonde; Arlene Grant became a brunette. This required Ms.Jones to wear a dark wig when she was on assignment on behalf of the CIA, usinga false passport in her “alter” personality. Photographs of Candy Jones and“Arlene Grant” in Bain’s book are quite dissimilar; one would have to know thatthey were the same person to note the physical identity. “Arlene Grant” was alsoprogrammed to endure tremendous physical pain, something that is common underhypnosis, as many can attest from public demonstrations. Candy Jones was afraidof Arlene; Arlene despised Candy as a weakling and as a far too trustingindividual. Over the course of Candy’s sessions with Jensen, Arlene would be thepersonality who would be constantly “invoked” by the hypnotist; it was Arlenewho was given the undercover assignments, acting as a courier all over theUnited States and eventually in Asia. And it was Arlene who was sent to Taiwanin October of 1966—one of the two countries mentioned by Morse Allen aspotential hosts for the “terminal” experiments in hypnosis and mind control—andtortured.The trip to Taiwan was made after the usual visit to Gilbert Jensen’s office inOakland. In this case, she was given the Arlene Grant passport and an airlineticket in Arlene Grant’s name. She left the office in the dark wig and in thepersona of Arlene Grant, where she would remain until her return from Taiwan.She was met at the airport by a man who had been president of the Taipei Chamberof Commerce and taken to his house outside Taipei. She gave him the envelope shehad carried from the States, and much to her surprise was taken to a room in thebasement of the house, and then hooked up to electrodes and tortured. She wasasked if she knew a Gilbert Jensen, and she said she didn’t; she was asked aboutthe contents of the envelope and said she didn’t have any idea. And on and on.Eventually, the man made a phone call and when he returned, he unhooked her andtold her it was all a misunderstanding and that the electro-shock was only usedto “jog her memory.” She stayed for lunch, and they drove her back to theairport that night.Due to the method of electrode placement, her hands were severely burned, enoughthat she wore gloves for days afterwards to hide the evidence, something thatfriends of hers remarked upon. She also had been gone from her office for a weekwithout any warning or advice to her staff, which was even more unusual.And then, in 1968, she was asked to return to Taiwan once more.Donald Bain has trouble understanding why the CIA would bother to go to suchlengths for what amounted to a courier. From what we know now of the CIA’sMK-ULTRA program, it has become clear that what Jensen was doing wasexperimenting with Candy Jones, and that the torture episode on Taiwan was justanother element of the program. Bain admits this might have been the case. Thisauthor, long involved with Asian government agencies and their cozy relationshipto American intelligence, also believes it to be so. Just as Morse Allen hadsuggested, the CIA was using Taiwan’s friendly intelligence service to assistthem in the experimentation on Candy Jones/Arlene Grant. The locale would havebeen even more valuable considering that to most Americans Asia is a mysteriousand “disorienting” place, due to the insurmountable language difficulties ifnothing else. Add to that a good dose of jet lag and the delivery of amysterious envelope to a mysterious Chinese gentleman, and you have created atypical—if somewhatnovelistic—espionage scenario in which to test your subject.Candy Jones was not being tested as a courier. She was being tested as a spy.And possibly something more.Her 1968 trip or trips to Taiwan involved more specific torture sessions, andseemed to include a scorpion and a coral snake, both very poisonous. It alsoinvolved being drugged, examined, pinched and interrogated by what appeared tobe a Chinese nurse, and all of this done under the observation of an American inwhat appeared to be a kind of elaborate inn or guesthouse that included aninfirmary. The location of this house is not known, except that it was not inTaipei this time, but in the south of Taiwan, probably in Kaohsiung. Ms. Joneswas pinched very painfully by the “nurse,” so much so that her arms and breastswere black-and-blue from the assaults. On her way out, she fell down a flight ofstairs, so weak was she from the drugs and the torture.She apparently passed the test, because she was escorted back to the airport,and then flew back to the States, reporting as usual to Jensen.The exact date of this trip to Taiwan is not known, except that her Taiwanvisits ended in 1968. Another trip she made that year is, if anything, even moresuggestive, as she was in California during the Democratic Primary on the dayRobert F. Kennedy was shot.This time, she was visiting an institute run by another pseudonymous hypnotist,called “Dr. Marshall Burger” in the Bain book, who had a thriving practice inChicago before moving to northern California and establishing his “institute” onbehalf of the CIA. This is not enough information to identify the hypnotist, butit does narrow down the field considerably. The CIA had financed the setup oroperation of a number of scientific and medical establishments in the UnitedStates as part of MK-ULTRA. The most famous, perhaps, was the Human EcologySociety, which fronted for a number of the Agency’s research endeavors, and theGeschickter Fund for Medical Research, which tested drugs on terminal cancerpatients and “mental defectives” in the Washington, D.C. area. The Human EcologySociety (formally known as the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology)was run by John Gittinger, a CIA staff psychologist who worked undercover as theSociety’s head, and who developed the famed Personality Assessment System orPAS. This system of psychological appraisal recognizes millions of differentpersonality types and was thus a potentially priceless tool in thepsychiatrists’ arsenal, but it seemed only Gittinger really understood how itworked. An interesting point about the Human Ecology Society was the fact thatGittinger opened offices in Tokyo and Hong Kong to service CIA stations in theFar East. This was done in the 1960s, and in the same time period as CandyJones’ many travels to Taiwan.30 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1346557] Gittingeralso traveled to San Francisco during this period to visit with George White athis safehouse for testing drugs on male and female homosexuals and prostitutes.Thus “Marshall Burger” could have been an employee—official or unofficial—of theHuman Ecology Society or one of the various fronts the CIA employed to providesufficient distance between it and its experimentation. (At this point, afterall of the revelations concerning MK-ULTRA, there is probably no longer a needto keep the identities of these individuals—Burger and Jensen—secret, and theirexposure would only serve to validate the late Candy Jones’ story.) Thedisturbing fact about Burger and his relationship to Candy Jones was the racistindoctrination she underwent at his seminars at a secret school somewhere in asmall town in Texas on the Louisiana border (possibly the town of Orange).This is the strangest, most anomalous part of the story of Candy Jones and doesnot mesh with what we know of the CIA. According to the Bain book, Jones wastaken to this class by Jensen, who introduced Burger to the class. Burger thenwent into a tirade concerning blacks, Hispanics, Asians, miscegenation, and thewhole Bible of race hatred, including a recommendation that mixed-race couplesshould be sterilized. There is no way that this could have been an official CIAsession. As much as we may distrust any secret intelligence agency—or the CIA inparticular—there would be no discernible requirement or value for the type ofclass Candy Jones describes, except in the most feverish imagination ofconspiracy theorists. More than that, however, is the lack of a clear motive forinstilling racist concepts in hypnosis subjects like Candy, or in any of theother persons who attended the class. Yet, in the transcript of the hypnosissession between Candy Jones and her husband, John Nebel, she insists that Burger“is the CIA. He’s important out here in discussions, but I don’t know how big heis.” 31 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1346854]The idea that Burger may indeed be aCIA official of some sort is not far-fetched at all, but the author suggeststhat the class he was conducting was unofficial, something developed betweenJensen and Burger for some ulterior purpose.Jensen had expressed racist feelings to Candy Jones years before, when both werein the Philippines during the War. This was before the creation of the CIA in1947, and obviously was not part of a psychological warfare or mind controlscenario. The author suggests that Jensen and Burger were genuine racists, andthat they had a hidden agenda. He further suggests that Candy Jones was adeniable asset of the Agency, an informal agent who was being used as anexperimental subject and nothing more, but that her training and progress underJensen’s ministrations were being closely observed by the CIA as a case study inthe use of hypnosis as a method for creating the Holy Grail: the ManchurianCandidate. If she could be made to express racist feelings—and if her presenceat the “training school” in Texas was somehow recorded for posterity—then wereshe involved in a political assassination, it could be put down to race hatred,as it had been in the case of James Earl Ray and the assassination of Dr. MartinLuther King, Jr. earlier that same year. It is also entirely possible thatCandy’s projected role was not as an assassin, but as a fall guy, a patsy… as itmay well have been in Ray’s case. And in the case of Sirhan Sirhan. (Andpossibly in the case of Lee Harvey Oswald, as well.)In June 1968, Candy Jones was sent to Burger’s “institute” in northernCalifornia, evidently in or near San Francisco. She was given a battery of teststo appraise her sensitivity to various stimuli such as taste, smell, etc. Duringthe session in which she recalled this visit, she relived a conversation withJensen in which she mentions his awe of Burger and “his fat friends. They’re allfat.” 32 [../Text/ch08.html#filepos1347385]Probably the fattest of all the hypnotists working in California at the timewas, of course, William Joseph Bryan, the man who is suspected of havinghypnotized Sirhan Sirhan. Indeed, Bryan had even been the technical consultanton the film of The Manchurian Candidate, directed by the man who hosted BobbyKennedy’s last dinner, John Frankenheimer. Yet, Candy Jones professed never tohave heard of him. This battery of tests may have been given to her on June 3,1968, although there was some confusion in her mind whether it was June 3 orJune 5. June 5,1968, of course, is the day Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated inLos Angeles. To be more specific it was very early on June 5, the Primary beingheld on June 4. That Candy Jones would be in California the day of the primary,undergoing hypnotic tests and experimentation by Jensen, Burger and his “fatfriends,” while Sirhan—possibly programmed by one of these “fat friends”—wasroaming the streets of Los Angeles looking for his target, is one of thosecoincidences that points to a deeper connection between events than we can seeat first glance. Candy’s not knowing Bryan could have been the result ofpost-hypnotic suggestion, of course, but even that degree of speculation isunnecessary. The fact that Candy paints both Jensen and Burger as racists—ascommitted and even rabid racists—and the parallel fact that both Sirhan Sirhanand James Earl Ray were known without a doubt to have been hypnotized inCalifornia prior to their assassinations of known anti-racists… is either acoincidence of muscular proportions, or it points to an intelligence operationin place at the time being run either by the CIA or by a secret, frantic factionthereof.One is even tempted to wonder if Candy Jones—with her height, her voluptuousfigure, and her sharp nose—was in fact the famous “girl in the polka dot dress”who was seen at the Ambassador Hotel with Sirhan; however, eyewitnesses say theactual lady in question was in her early or mid-twenties. Ms. Jones by this timewas in her forties, and anyway even the author is not prepared to go quite thatfar. Had Ms. Jones been deployed by the Agency in that capacity, she almostcertainly would have been in her Arlene Grant persona, replete with black wig,and this was not the case with the girl in the polka-dot dress. Yet, since weare on the subject of coincidence—meaningful or not—we can refer to an occultnovel first published in 1972 by one David St. John: The Coven.The novel is about a Pennsylvania Senator and his wife who are embroiled in asecret underground cult in Washington, D.C. based on the powers of a young,black African priestess. The Senator’s wife—Catherine Vane—is a tall, beautifulblonde who, for some reason that is never explained in the book, wears a blackwig. The hero of the tale, a former US Attorney-turneddetective with theappropriately Ayn-Randish name of Jonathan Gault, beds the Senator’s wifewithout too much trouble but does not appear to have done much else in theentire length of the novel except gather intelligence and illegally dispose of abody. The fact that the couple are from Pennsylvania (there is even a sceneinvolving a company in Wilkes-Barre, Candy Jones’ home town) and that the womanwears a black wig for no particular reason, Arlene Grant style, and turns out tobe a murderer who undergoes a trance in the middle of an occult ceremony in thebasement of an abandoned house in Washington… well, it would have been no morethan an interesting parallel to the Candy Jones tale except that the real nameof the pseudonymous author of The Coven is E. Howard Hunt, former CIA agent, Bayof Pigs action officer, despiser of Kennedys, and convicted Watergate “Plumber.”We may object to this linkage, saying that The Coven after all is an intendedpot-boiler and not a roman á clef. Except that Hunt himself plays name games inthe book, such as the reference on page 49 to something called the “CitywideImprovement Alliance,” an organization which is never referred to again. Theinitials, of course, are CIA. In this case, the Citywide Improvement Alliance isin court, “there to see justice done to a brother.” 33[../Text/ch08.html#filepos1347672]This was rather prescient of the futurejailbird, as the book was written before the Watergate scandal, and it isamusing to see the CIA in court watching a fellow member being arraigned.Candy Jones was taken to the Farm in November 1971.The Farm—as aficionados of CIA fiction and non-fiction are aware—is the trainingfacility in Virginia where the Agency puts its agents through a kind ofespionage boot camp. It was there that Ms. Jones was finally displayed beforeJensen’s colleagues as an example of his perfect control. According to herrecall of the event while under hypnosis by her husband, there were abouttwenty-four people in attendance watching while Jensen put Candy through herpaces, people she assumes were doctors.The demonstration eventually included Candy remaining supine and unresisting asJensen inserted a candle in her vagina. The reader may find this incident sorevolting that it seems like nothing more than one of those artificial memoriesthat are dredged up by unscrupulous therapists; recall that the “therapist” inthis case is her own husband.The CIA made a science of watching other people have sexual activity, going sofar as to audiotape and videotape the proceedings, all in the name of research.Former CIA psychologist James Keehner, in an interview that is summarized inMarks’ book, tells of becoming disgusted with “entrapment techniques” afterwatching videotape of an agent and a target in bed. He pointed out that Agencycase officers, many of whom “got their jollies” from such work, used a hiddencamera to get their shots. The sexual technology developed in the MK-ULTRAsafehouses in New York and San Francisco had been put to work. 34[../Text/ch08.html#filepos1348160]Thus, it doesn’t seem too farfetched that a demonstration of the type Jonesrecalls was actually just that; again, we still have to wonder at itsusefulness. Where would Jensen have had to go in order to demonstrate hisperfect control of his subject, however? The only other avenue would have been a“terminal” experiment, i.e., having Candy Jones pull the trigger on someone.Morse Allen had already demonstrated that this could be done through hypnosis,though, seventeen years earlier; that was not an issue. Having a female subjectsubmit to vaginal penetration by a candle in front of twenty-four witnessesmight have seemed an extreme test—yet relatively safe, if of dubious legality—atest that would show beyond reasonable doubt the extent of the power of hypnosisto control behavior. Another alternative would have been to subject Ms. Jones totorture before the assembled guests, but it is assumed that the CIA would havebeen squeamish about that.Donald Bain is careful to state at the beginning of his book that some of thematerial recalled by Ms. Jones under hypnosis—by her husband, in fact, anamateur hypnotist at best—might be tainted by leading questions and otherenvironmental cues and may not be pure memory. Fair enough. But there is a levelof credibility in the story of Candy Jones that cannot be denied. Somethinghappened to her during those long years between 1960 and 1972, when she finallymanaged to escape the clutches of her controllers by marrying John Nebel. Shewas subject to wild mood swings in public, actually complete personality changesas “Arlene” took over; she would be gone for long periods of time; she did havefriends in the government, some of whom she made during her USO stint during thewar. All in all, there is enough circumstantial evidence to suggest that atleast part of her story is true. Her details on Taiwan and on her visits to SanFrancisco are also very much to the point. She names her controllers to herhusband, although these names are disguised in Donald Bain’s book; thus we areto assume that these are people whose identities are known to a circle of peoplearound the late Candy Jones. The lack of independent confirmation of her storyis frustrating, but the internal evidence is compelling. What can be checkedagainst other sources has been checked to the best of the author’s ability, andhe finds himself supporting the basic elements of her story.Candy Jones was approached by hypnotists working for the CIA in some capacity.She was sent on errands around the country to test her competence andwillingness. She was sent abroad, where she had painful experiences at the handsof persons working with her controllers. She found herself involved in the samenexus of mind controllers in California as surrounded Sirhan Sirhan and JamesEarl Ray. She did this willingly at first, as did so many who became CIA guineapigs without knowing what they were getting into, out of patriotism.More importantly, for the scope of this book, her case is a good example of thetechniques proposed by Estabrooks and others: the creation of alterpersonalities in the hypnotic subject, the inducement of dissociative identitydisorder and the utilization of those personalities as an intelligence weaponand, potentially, as an assassination tool. In other words, the creation of amentally-ill killer, an assassin who could be programmed with a verbal cue tokill, and to forget. If apprehended, the killer’s mental illness itself wouldprovide the Agency with plausible deniability.Because it was not Candy Jones on the table in front of twenty-four CIAscientists being penetrated by Jensen and his ridiculous candle. It was heralter, Arlene Grant. But it was Candy Jones who suffered for it.One phenomenon that none of the available CIA documentation discusses is thedamage to the psychic health of these subjects, perpetrated by medical andscientific professionals with no regard for the long-term effects of theirdrugs, hypnosis and other behavior control mechanisms. The concept of behaviorcontrol is mechanistic; it views the human mind as a computer that can beprogrammed to perform certain acts, a fleshy robot at the mercy of the wise menof Langley. To people like Jensen, it was a simple matter to create amnesia intheir subjects so they would have no conscious recall of the horrors to whichthey were subjected… or of the evil acts they were forced to commit. No memory,to Jensen, meant no guilt. He had no interest in Candy’s psychic health; perhapshe didn’t even believe in it. What happened to Candy Jones’ soul was her affair,if she had one and if such a thing existed. But Candy Jones became abasket-case, never entirely free of her demons. Arlene Grant would occasionallyreappear to criticize Candy, and the two would have fights.Her eyes were closed. Her arms, fingers apart, extended over the table, and herbody began to sway. The lips were closed but from her throat came sounds of atimbre I had never heard before. There were two voices, it seemed, in angryconflict, and as I watched and heard the sensation grew that I was listening toan externalized debate of Good and Evil.> The Coven, E. Howard Hunt (emphasis in the original)Candy Jones was suffering from multiple personality disorder, or what is nowknown as dissociative identity disorder, induced by experimentation on her mindby people claiming to be patriots. She was used as a test subject, abusedhorribly both mentally and physically, and discarded. According to her ownaccount, Jensen had booked a first class ticket for her from New York to theBahamas, where she was to check into the Paradise Island Hotel, and then killherself by jumping off a rock into the sea. That was supposed to have happenedon her birthday in 1972, the very day she decided to get married to John Nebeland thus begin her long road back to some semblance of sanity.The ordeal was not over after the marriage, the tapes, the book, the minorpublicity. She continued to receive phone calls, including one six months afterher marriage from Japan Air Lines, informing her she was booked on a flight toTokyo with onward booking for Taipei. This call came at the time that RichardHelms and Sidney Gottlieb had finished shredding the CIA’s MK-ULTRA documents infear that those who had collaborated with them in their mind control programwould be revealed. Candy Jones would have been a living witness, a loose end totie up, a bit more difficult to shred than a personnel file. Evidently, Jensenstill wanted to provide the ultimate demonstration of his powers, having Ms.Jones walk into a trap and again give herself up in Taiwan. Fortunately, shenever took that flight.This tale of Candy Jones is a dark one, but there are others as dark and darker,and as well-documented. There is a parallel for example, between the story ofCandy Jones and the story of Michelle Smith inMichelle Remembers. The latter isalso based on transcripts of hypnotic sessions in which a subject is made to“remember” horrible things, in this case satanic cults and the murder ofchildren. In Candy Jones’ case, the hypnosis was carried out by her husband,Long John Nebel. In Michelle’s case, her therapist would become her husband. Inboth cases, the substance of the memories has been attacked by critics, but inboth cases the memories—real or confabulated—concern the existence of a secretorganization that tortures people in the name of a higher purpose.Under hypnosis yet again, the famous story of Barney and Betty Hill wasretrieved, and it told of alien forces who landed in the New Hampshirecountryside and abducted a married couple, who were then experimented upon andreleased back into society with no conscious memory of what had happened. Inthis case as well, the Hills were subjected to physical abuse by a secret groupin the name of a higher purpose; their story is also told in the form oftranscripts of hypnotic sessions.The CIA, satanic cults and UFOs; the mythology of the late twentieth century issurprisingly coherent even though the masks change from case to case, fromvictim to alleged victim. The CIA, of course, does exist; their mind controlprograms, from BLUEBIRD to ARTICHOKE to MK-ULTRA are a matter of public record.Their history of political assassinations and the overthrow of various foreigngovernments is also a matter of record. Satanic cults—or perhaps we shouldqualify that and say “occult secret societies”—also exist and are a matter ofpublic record; their attempts to contact alien forces by means of ceremonialmagic and arcane ritual (including the use of some of the same drugs and othertechniques as the CIA used in its mind control programs) are also well-known anddocumented. Some of these practitioners were—and are—well-known men and womenwho have not denied their involvement (such as rocket scientist Jack Parsons inthe 1950s and Army Colonel and intelligence officer Michael Aquino in the1990s). The CIA also aggressively researched American cults and secret societiesin an effort to discover the source of paranormal abilities and ancient mindcontrol mechanisms. And while the jury is still out on the question of UFOs,there is no doubt that government agencies have attempted to track them, toanalyze them, and to explain them away. Again, this is a matter of publicrecord, including FBI and CIA documents in addition to military records.Intelligence officers and cultists have a lot in common. (Marchetti and Marks’groundbreaking and controversial exposé of the Agency was entitled The CIA andthe Cult of Intelligence.) Secrecy is a way of life for both the spy and thesorcerer; they both use codes and code names; they both pretend to have accessto mysteries not available to the general public; they both claim to be able toinfluence events at a distance with their special abilities and powers. Theyboth specialize in the manipulation of reality; both are aware that things arenot always what they seem to be; and they are both ruthless and often amoral orimmoral in the pursuit of their goals, embracing illicit sex, illegal drug use,and even murder as the means to their enigmatic ends. And when one can so easilymanipulate the perception of reality, one eventually comes to the realizationthat Truth, itself, is a malleable thing. So it was only natural that thecultist and the spy would gravitate towards each other and would try to learnfrom each other.This control of reality, of the perception of reality and the creation of whatRobert Anton Wilson calls “consensus reality,” is a powerful political tool, andhas been since ancient times, when the proverbial sorcerer could appear tocreate solar eclipses by simply knowing when one would occur and acting as if hewas causing the natural phenomenon to take place. To control and manipulate thereality of the masses, one uses what is now known as psychological warfare, orsometimes as simply advertising, or “spin.” To control or manipulate the realityof an individual, drugs and hypnosis are valuable tools. And it is but one stepaway from controlling a person’s perception of reality to getting that person toact on it.

It couldn’t hope to be. Instead, the author concentrates on some ofthe better-known personalities, intending to demonstrate where individuals suchas Ferrie, Stanley, James et al. appear in the food-chain. In other words, theemphasis is more on how this phenomenon may impact any study of post-World WarII American history, particularly in the areas of intelligence, mind control,and assassination studies, as well as the parallel world of cults and occultism.While several well-known wandering bishops were felons and ex-cons, others livedon the fringes of the intelligence community, while still others were heavilyimmersed in occultism, from the ethereal Theosophical variety, with its sinisteremphasis on spirit guides and root-races, to the more hard-core rituals andbeliefs of Aleister Crowley, Theodor Reuss, and the Rosicrucian orders.The wandering bishop phenomenon largely owes its existence to a schism betweenthe Jansenists in Holland and the Roman Catholic Church in the seventeenthcentury. This culminated in the creation of something called the Old RomanCatholic Church at the end of the nineteenth century. It is from there that manyof the “wandering bishop” denominations can trace their apostolic lineage, sincethe Old Roman Catholics had valid apostolic succession but were not answerableto the Pope. Still others trace their lineage to an attempt by the RussianOrthodox Church to broaden its influence in the United States after the RussianRevolution, and thus were vulnerable to accusations of being Chekist: runningagents within US borders, as indeed was the case with the Russian OrthodoxChurch (Moscow Patriarchate) and its infamous cathedral on West 97th Street inManhattan.It should be pointed out in advance that the author himself knew personallyseveral of the individuals who come under discussion here. He was a familiarface for about a year around the headquarters of the Old Roman Catholic Churchin Brooklyn, New York in the late 1960s, as well as the American OrthodoxCatholic Church headquarters in the Bronx, the Russian Orthodox Church OutsideRussia (the Synod), the Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) andvarious other denominations of greater or lesser legitimacy, including that ofthe “Rosicrucian” denomination of George Winslow Plummer and Stanislaus deWitow. He was also familiar with members of the Gnostic Catholic Church, the OTOsect that descended in a somewhat irregular fashion from French wanderingbishops, some of whom were consecrated in the so-called Vilatte line ofsuccession.At the outset it may be useful to keep in mind that there are three primarylines of succession that concern us. There are many more, of course, but theones that most impact the world of the wandering bishops in the United Statescan trace their lineage to either Joseph Rene Vilatte, Aftimios Ofiesh, orArnold Harris Mathew... or usually all three. From these three “patriarchs” aredescended Propheta, Ferrie, Stanley and all the rest. In succeeding volumes ofthis work, other “wanderers” occasionally make an appearance, and you will findtheir lines of succession amply represented here.It is truly impossible to be exhaustive on this subject. There are manysources—both printed and electronic—which are invaluable for understanding andkeeping abreast of the latest news on the wandering bishop phenomenon. PeterAnson’s book, Bishops At Large, was bedside reading for many wanderers in the1960s, although difficult to find today; G. Gordon Melton’s series of books onthe American religious experience is also valuable for putting some of this inperspective. There are also many useful Internet sites—usually published byindividual sects anxious to prove their bona fides—as well as a database ofwandering bishops which is very helpful; unfortunately, the dates are sometimesin error (probably due more to forged or imaginary certificates of consecrationand false claims than to any carelessness on the part of the webmaster). Caveatlector.In 1871, and largely as a result of the First Vatican Council, a number of DutchOld Catholic churches formed an alliance, and left the Roman Catholic Church inprotest. The details of the squabble are beyond the scope of this book. It isenough to say that the Dutch Old Catholics were every bit as “Catholic” as theChurch in Rome and had valid sacraments and a valid line of apostolic successionat the time of their split.The Dutch Old Catholic bishops on April 28, 1908 consecrated Arnold HarrisMathew (1852-1919) as the Old Roman Catholic bishop for Great Britain. This wasthe beginning of a proliferation of irregular bishops around the world, asMathew began consecrating—without prior authorization from his Dutch Catholiccolleagues—a number of people who would go on to greater infamy. Mathewconsecrated as many as fifteen other bishops, which is not a large number whenyou consider how many bishops have been created by individual clerics sincethen, but it was enough.Perhaps the most famous was Prince Rudolph Landas Berghes (1873-1920), who wasconsecrated by Mathew on June 29, 1913, ostensibly as a bishop for Scotland. InNovember of 1914, Landas Berghes was in the United States, where he establishedthe North American Old Roman Catholic Church, consecrating Carmel Henry Carfora(1878-1958). Carfora took over as the head of the North American Old RomanCatholic Church in 1919, and consecrated Hubert Augustus Rogers (1887-1976) onJuly 30, 1942. In 1946, Rogers took over stewardship of the Church. (The authorknew Archbishop Rogers and his son, Bishop James Hubert Rogers, in 1968 at theChurch’s headquarters in Brooklyn, New York.)Among the many bishops consecrated by Mathew is one of special interest to us:the Rev. Fredrick Samuel Willoughby, who was a Theosophist, consecrated onOctober 28, 1914. Another Theosophist, James Ingall Wedgewood (1883-1923) was inturn consecrated by Willoughby on February 13, 1916. Thus, the link between thewandering bishops and occultism has a venerable pedigree. TheWilloughby/Wedgewood nexus gave rise to the Liberal Catholic Church, aTheosophical Society sect that practiced the Catholic Mass—with someTheosophical flourishes—above the Society’s bookshop in Manhattan in the 1960swhen the author knew it. The infamous C.W. Leadbeater—associate of Blavatsky andBesant, and discoverer of the young Krishnamurti on a beach in India—was also abishop in this line of succession. In addition, the Mathew line would give usHerman Adrian Spruit, who will come to our attention for a number of reasons infollowing volumes, but especially as the bishop who consecrated women, includingRayEllen Russbacher, to the episcopate. RayEllen Russbacher was the wife ofGunther Russbacher, a shadowy figure in the Iran-Contra affair.Running roughly parallel to the Mathew line is the line of Joseph Rene Vilatte(1854-1929). Vilatte’s story is a sad one. His life seems to have been beset onall sides by troubles, and it is difficult to find fault with him. Rather, itwould appear that Vilatte genuinely tried to do good but was somehow thwarted atevery turn, seduced and abandoned by a number of denominations. It is to Vilattethat we trace some other interesting lines of succession, and it should be saidthat eventually Vilatte’s line of succession will also result in the HermanAdrian Spruit consecration, thus do these “lines” become “webs.”Vilatte, an Old Catholic priest born in France who emigrated to the UnitedStates, was consecrated a bishop by Antonio Alvarez of the Malankara OrthodoxSyrian Church. This Church, located in India and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), cameunder the jurisdiction of the Syrian Patriarchate of Antioch. How this cameabout is a textbook case of the type of internecine warfare that exists amongchurches and schismatic sects. The Catholics of Goa, India—long a Portuguesecolony with cultural ties to the motherland—were told by Rome that they now hadto bear allegiance towards bishops in France and Italy. Outraged, a group ofchurches defected from the Catholic Church and elected Antonio Alvarez—a nativeof Goa and a Brahmin—to become their bishop. The Patriarch of Antioch, theJacobite Mar Ignatius Peter III, obliged and, to make a long story blissfullyshort, eventually Vilatte was consecrated a bishop by Alvarez in Colombo. Hethen returned to America, but not before a sojourn in Europe and a flurry ofconsecrations there. Altogether, it is difficult to count the number of churcheswith which Vilatte was associated; it is even more difficult to keep track ofthe bishops he consecrated. One of the men consecrated by Vilatte was theTrappist Francois Giraud, on June 21, 1907 in Paris. Giraud then consecrated anumber of others in France, with a line of succession that is claimed by MichaelBertiaux, an occultist and proponent of voudon, the Haitian religio-occultsystem better known as “voodoo,” due to his stay in Port-au-Prince as a teacher.Bertiaux is also a member of the OTO, and Kenneth Grant has writtencomplimentary things about him, although Bertiaux has since defected to theGrady McMurtry wing of the Order. At this time, Bertiaux is consecrating bishopsfor the OTO’s Gnostic Catholic Church; the validity of his succession is, ofcourse, rather in doubt, not the least by Bertiaux himself, who boasts no fewerthan eight separate consecrations, and, on at least one occasion—that of theconsecration of Forest Ernest Barber (another Spruit consecratee) on June 16,1979—Bertiaux and Barber engaged in reciprocal consecration, i.e., consecratedeach other (giving a whole new meaning to the concept of the OTO’s IXth degree).Thus, the Vilatte line eventually descends into occult practices as easily andinevitably as the Mathew line.At the same time, there were other churches abroad in the land whose line ofsuccession was equally valid and who were not in communion with the Church inRome. These included the entire Eastern Orthodox establishment, with churches inRussia, Romania, Serbia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Moravia, Ukraine,Armenia, Syria, Greece, Ethiopia, etc. The titular head of this establishmentwas, and still is, the Patriarch of Constantinople, considered “first amongequals.” Each national church, such as the Catholicos of Armenia, has its ownPatriarch or national leader.However, many of these national churches experienced further schisms after theinitial break with Rome, which took place in the eleventh century A.D., when theCatholic Church rather cavalierly excommunicated the Orthodox Church...literally. A messenger from Rome rode into the Cathedral of St. Sophia on hishorse during the celebration of Divine Liturgy, and threw the Bull ofExcommunication onto the altar. There had been dissension over theologicalissues as well as political ones, and Christendom split into two greatecclesiastical camps: the Catholic Church in the West, and the Orthodox Churchin the East.Just as the Dutch Old Catholics split from the Catholic Church in 1871, a numberof Orthodox Churches began to split from their mother churches around the timeof the Russian Revolution, a split that was reinforced by the decision of theMoscow Patriarchate to cooperate—some would say “collaborate”—with the Sovietregime. Thus, the Russian Orthodox Church became at first two distinct andwarring factions: the Church that was loyal to the Moscow Patriarchate, and theRussian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR), sometimes simply referred to as“the Synod,” which was loyal to the “Old Regime.”At the time of the split between the two Russian churches, Moscow becameaggressive in trying to control Eastern Orthodoxy abroad. Through its footholdin the United States—its cathedral on West 97th Street in Manhattan—itconsecrated an Arab clergyman as a bishop and gave him responsibility to workamong the Syrian Orthodox community in America. Later, this was extended toinclude the authority to create an “American Orthodox Church.” The Arab bishopwas Abdullah “Aftimios” Ofiesh (1880-1966).This seemed to be a purely political maneuver at first, but eventually AftimiosOfiesh became as infamous as Mathew and Vilatte in his prodigious use of thepowers of consecration. It is to Ofiesh that we can credit the consecrations ofBishops Sophronios Bishara and Joseph Zuk, who between them created another longdynasty of irregular clergymen, this time along the Eastern Orthodox lines ofsuccession instead of the Old Roman Catholic lines, although all of these linesbecame ensnarled and entangled in the years to follow.Ofiesh was consecrated a Bishop of Brooklyn on May 13, 1917 for the RussianOrthodox Church. He became Archbishop of the “Syrian Orthodox Mission of theNorth American Diocese of The Russian Orthodox Church” in 1923, and in 1927 (atthe urging of the Russian Orthodox bishops) he founded the American OrthodoxChurch. The AOC was to be an autocephalous (self-governing) ecclesiastical bodyfor America. It was from this initial inspiration that the greatest bishops’mill of them all, the American Orthodox Catholic Church (AOCC), would beincorporated in New York City in 1964 by Walter Propheta, using the same linesof apostolic succession from Ofiesh via Zuk and Sophronios… and De Witow andPlummer of the Rosicrucian SRIA.Rather than go into further detail, it is assumed that the above brief summarywill help the reader place the lines of succession as they come up. There is nolisting at present that shows all the bishops consecrated by any one bishop;such would be very helpful, not only to scholars of this religious phenomenonbut also to investigators in other areas, such as intelligence operations andassassinations. Rather, we have to work backwards from each bishop, up throughhis lines of succession to see where they meet and overlap with others. A shortguide follows.The reader is warned that being consecrated by any one wandering bishop does notnecessarily imply any kind of alliance—personal, political, or spiritual—betweenthe persons involved. Often, a consecration may take place for money or someother material reward. Sometimes, it’s just as insurance in case a previousconsecration was doubtful or invalid. And, sometimes, it’s just fun.What it does reveal, however, are personal associations between theseindividuals, associations we would not otherwise discern or understand. Theinvolvement of Carl Stanley, for instance, with David Ferrie, Earl Anglin James,and Raymond Broshears is important, for it speaks to another level ofinteraction and commitment by these individuals, as does the involvement ofthese churches with the OTO, the Theosophical Society, the Rosicrucian orders,etc.: a hidden agenda, a demi-monde of belief and ritual, occultism andpolitics, that goes far beyond the standard accounts of the assassinations.VILATTE LINEAs mentioned above, Joseph Rene Vilatte was consecrated by a bishop in Colombo,Ceylon and returned to the United States via Europe, where more consecrationstook place. One of his lines went from Bishop Lloyd to Bishop Lines to BishopBoyle to Bishop Lowell Paul Wadle and then to Bishop Herman Adrian Spruit.Another of his lines went from Paolo Miraglia to Julien Houssaye to LouisFrancois Giraud to Jean Bricaud (in 1913). Bricaud becomes important when weconsider the Martinist movement in France, the Gnostic Catholic Church, and theFrench OTO, as Bricaud was at one time or another allied with all three andinvolved with Crowley and Theodor Reuss of the German OTO. Bricaud, for example,became head of the Martinist Order (as redesigned by “Papus” or Gerard Encausse)in 1918. The line of apostolic succession from Vilatte to Wadle devolves notonly to Spruit (in 1957) but also to occultist William W. Webb and from there toRoger Victor-Herard of the Gnostic Catholic Church, and eventually to MichaelBertiaux.Yet another line from Vilatte to Bertiaux goes from Bricaud through a number ofother French clerics, winding up with Bishop Jorge Rodriguez, who thenconsecrates Bertiaux. As you can see, these “lines” of succession are not in anyway exclusive. That is, you cannot draw a straight line down from one bishop toanother, as you would in an organization chart. In the first place, such a chartwould be meaningful if one were only considering primary consecrators andignoring the assisting consecrators. This is because each consecrationpotentially has three separate lines of succession behind it, and thus resultsin a brand-new, fourth line combining all three. That bishop then joins with two(or more) others to consecrate another bishop, thus multiplying the number oflines and associations geometrically and creating enormous difficulties for thehistorian. Add to this the tendency of the wandering bishops to create newdenominations with slightly different names, and to give themselves new namesand titles without warning, and you find yourself in a veritable labyrinth ofmadness, pleading for the comforting attentions of a hungry Minotaur.MATHEW LINEFrom Mathew, we have the consecrations of Landas Berghes and the aforementionedSamuel Willoughby. Landas Berghes would consecrate Carfora in the United States,and from Carfora we have Hubert Augustus Rogers (on July 30, 1942) and EarlAnglin James (on June 17, 1945). James, however, was not content with theconsecration by Carfora (oddly enough, since Carfora’s consecration isrelatively above reproach considering he was consecrated by Landas Berghes whowas consecrated by Mathew) and obtained another consecration at the hands ofHugh George de Willmott Newman (on November 24, 1946), a gentleman who exerted atremendous influence over the wandering bishop circles, particularly among thosewith occult or Theosophical beliefs.Willmott Newman was a correspondent of Aleister Crowley and William BernardCrow, both famous occultists and authors of books on occultism and mysticism.Willmott Newman himself was consecrated by at least six other bishops at sixdifferent times (from information available to the author; there may be manymore). Crow—a Liberal Catholic bishop with a line of succession back toWedgewood and Willoughby (and thus back to Mathew)—has primacy of place, for heconsecrated Willmott Newman on April 10, 1944 into something called the AncientOrthodox Catholic Church. This was followed by a consecration from CharlesWilliam Keller on April 29, 1945, and then one by Hedley Coward Bartlett on May20, 1945, then another by J.S.M. Ward (another occultist and author of mysticaltexts) on August 25, 1945, and one by Charles Leslie Saul on July 14, 1947, andyet another by Davison Quartey Arthur on February 19, 1951. Willmott Newmanhimself consecrated the celebrated author of occult books, Montague Summers(1880-1948). In addition, Willmott Newman was a consecrator of Christopher MariaCarl Stanley, also known as Carl J. Stanley to the FBI and as Saint ChristopherMaria to his following. (And occultist J.S.M. Ward consecrated GeraldGardner—father of the modern-day Wicca movement—in the Orthodox Church ofEngland.)To continue with the Mathew line, we have Bishop Willoughby (the Theosophist)consecrating Wedgewood (another Theosophist) in 1916, who form the LiberalCatholic Church. From Wedgewood we get Cooper (in 1919) and Hampton (in 1931)and eventually Herman Adrian Spruit in 1957 as a bishop in the Liberal Catholicdenomination. Spruit would leave the Liberal Catholics in 1972 and go on togreater glory in his consecrations of RayEllen Allan Russbacher, the wife ofIran-Contra pilot Gunther Russbacher and a woman whose belief system makesAleister Crowley’s OTO look like a bunch of Christian Fundamentalists, andRoberto C. Toca (in 1992), a native of Cuba and member of a rival OTOorganization based in Florida with his own Spanish radio program. Spruit wouldalso consecrate Bishop Forest Ernest Barber (on June 15, 1971) who in turnconsecrated Michael Bertiaux, the voudon practitioner and Thelemite we mentionedabove, and Carl Llewellyn Weschke (the publisher of occult books and almanacs)via occult authors Vivian Denning and Leon Phillips in 1983. (Denning andPhillips had been consecrated by the irrepressible Spruit in June of 1982.) OnNovember 10, 1980, Spruit also consecrated Mother Serena (widow of BishopStanislaus de Witow) of the SRIA, thus ensuring a line of succession for thatRosicrucian operation on Manhattan’s Upper West Side.Forest Ernest Barber himself could claim no less than thirteen consecrations,including the one from Bertiaux, in which the two gentlemen consecrated eachother on June 16, 1979.Not to be outdone, however, Spruit also has a line of apostolic succession thatleads from Vilatte, via Lloyd (1915) to Lines (1923) to Robert Raleigh Boyle(1927) to Lowell Paul Wadle (1940) to Spruit (June 22, 1957). That’s not all,however, for Wadle’s succession also involves the Liberal Catholic succession ofWillmott Newman via Bishop de Ortega Maxey; thus the occult and Theosophical andRosicrucian connections are all there, if somewhat in knots.Bertiaux himself claims succession from both the Vilatte and Mathew lines, butthis is subject to some confusion as it is not known if these consecrationsinvolved the actual laying-on of hands or if they were “paper consecrations,”since it has been reliably reported that many of the OTO consecrations (forinstance) were paper dignities sent back and forth in the mail and whichinvolved no laying-on of hands. Such “consecrations” are patently invalid andhave no meaning to anyone other than (presumably) the persons directly involved.While the Vilatte and Mathew and Ofiesh lines were valid at the times they wereestablished, it is doubtful that all the bishops consecrated since then havebeen so consecrated according to the requirements of Canon law. This is one ofthe reasons, perhaps, for Bertiaux claiming at least eight separateconsecrations, and Willmott Newman at least six. When in doubt, get consecratedagain.For the reader this brings up a hopeless additional complication, for there areconsecrations, and there are re-consecrations, and there are consecrations subconditione, or “conditional” consecrations (performed in case one of theprevious consecrations is later shown to be invalid). There are also thosemutual consecrations, in which two bishops consecrate each other simultaneously,the reason usually given is that it’s a form of recognition of each bishop bythe other, but in actuality is often an attempt to “trade” lines of succession.Further, every consecration is performed by one “main consecrator” and at leasttwo or more assistant consecrators; these three bishops may not belong to thesame church, or share the same apostolic succession, thus creating even moreconfusion in the historian’s mind. In trying to pry apart the lines ofsuccession of any one bishop, one is thrown willy-nilly into a document stormfrom which there may be no escape.That said, let us look at the Ofiesh succession, which brings together manydisparate strands of succession and gives us, finally, everyone from Propheta toStanley to Ferrie to Broshears.OFIESH LINEOfiesh consecrated Joseph Zuk (1932), who in turn consecrated William AlbertNichols (1932), who consecrated George Winslow Plummer (1934), who bothconsecrated Theodosius Stanislaus de Witow (1936) of the Holy Orthodox Church.Remember that both Plummer and de Witow were Rosicrucians and members of theSocietas Rosicruciana in America, or SRIA.At the same time, Ofiesh had consecrated Sophronios Bishara (1928), who in turnconsecrated Christopher Kontogiorgios (1934) as Exarch of the Greek OrthodoxCatholic Church (Alexandria Patriarchate), who consecrated KonstantinJaroshevich (1949), who—in tandem with Williamovich (consecrated by Rogers ofthe Mathew line)—consecrated Peter Zhurawetzky as bishop of the Eastern OrthodoxCatholic and Apostolic Diocese of America on October 15, 1950.Zhurawetzky is a true macher, for he and De Witow and Bishop Joachim Souris (ofthe True Orthodox Church of Greece, himself consecrated by Joseph Klimovicz ofthe American Holy Orthodox Catholic Eastern Church) then go on to consecratePropheta in 1964, after the consecration of Robert Schuyler Zeiger as bishop ofthe Orthodox Catholic Patriarchate of America in 1961, and Carl Stanley (withZeiger’s assistance, as well as the assistance of Bishop Homer Ferdinand Roebkeand Bishop Colin James Guthrie) also in 1964. Stanley had already beenconsecrated by one Assendelft-Altland in 1959, and by Earl Anglin Lawrence James(date unknown), but I guess it didn’t “take.” Roebke himself had already beenconsecrated by Stanley on August 4, 1962, by Zeiger on June 9, 1963, and lateragain by Propheta (sub conditione) on March 4, 1967!Propheta, Zeiger and Roebke, along with Stanley, were forming the AmericanOrthodox Catholic Church, as was envisioned by Aftimios Ofiesh and hissuccessors. While something called the American Orthodox Church had already beenin existence under Ofiesh, Zeiger and Roebke, it had not developed into anythingsubstantial until Propheta was consecrated and then incorporated the AmericanOrthodox Catholic Church in New York in 1964. Propheta and Roebke then becamethe de facto rulers of the group when Zeiger left it in 1964, although Stanleywas still very much involved. Stanley was based in Kentucky, and according toDavid Ferrie’s testimony, had been in trouble with the law. Stanley wascharacterized as “self-ordained,” which was patently not true, and as aconfidence man, about which there are no supporting documents to hand at thistime. As for Roebke, he was consecrated sub conditione by Propheta in 1967, eventhough he had been a consecrator of Stanley in 1964… and so it goes. Eventuallyit would be Propheta who would be proclaimed the Patriarch of the AmericanOrthodox Catholic Church, and thus a legend was born.Walter Vladimir Propheta (1912-1972) was a striking individual. In a world ofeffete Theosophist bishops with real or imagined English accents and watery,vacant stares, and of glad-handing, back-slapping redneck bishops of variousdubious denominations and pending indictments, Propheta seemed to be the genuinearticle. Born into a Ukrainian Orthodox family and ordained into the UkrainianOrthodox Church, he was. Tall, portly, with bulging eyes and a thick Ukrainianaccent, he looked like the love child of Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet. Hewould wear a see-through white cassock with red piping in the summer and, it wasobvious, nothing underneath. He had two assistants—Bishop Leonard G. Hill andBishop John Christian—who cooked and cleaned at the Cathedral of the HolyResurrection in the Bronx, and who made sure that the Sunday liturgy wasperformed. Bishop Hill, the kinder and gentler of the three, was a hopelessalcoholic and of an afternoon could be seen urinating out of the second storeybathroom window and onto the passers-by below; once he had the misfortune ofrelieving himself into an otherwise refreshing beverage held by the outstretchedhand of his boss, Propheta. Bishop Christian, of French Canadian extraction whospoke fluent French, was losing his eyesight and his mind when the author knewhim. He was the fussy old maid to Bishop Hill’s rather more muscular pipefitterpose: the Odd Couple, Orthodox style.Propheta himself was another matter entirely. A fervent anti-Communist andRepublican, he surrounded himself with émigrés and spooks. Financially, though,he had the perfect scam.He had presentation cards printed showing dozens of his bishops in a grouppicture and giving the address, phone number, etc. of the Church. Bishops Hilland Christian would leave every weekday morning—including Saturdays—and drive toa different location around New York, Westchester County, New Jersey, orConnecticut, park the car with a “Clergy On Call” sticker in the window, andbegin walking up and down the main street of the area, going into shops and…begging for money. This was ostensibly to raise funds for an orphanage, but theChurch had no orphanage. In fact, if one were to extrapolate from Bishop Hill’ssecond storey escapades, the Church didn’t even have a pot to… well, you get theidea.However, the two men—dressed outlandishly in Russian Orthodox-style robes andhats with long, black veils—would raise considerable sums of money every day,money which went into supporting Propheta’s lifestyle and his new Cadillac everytwo years. It also kept the men out of the house during the week, during whichtime Propheta could concentrate on other matters.Propheta’s involvement with intelligence agencies and international affairs hasalready been noted. His colleague, Carl Stanley, had consecrated David Ferrieand Raymond Broshears into the church—two men considered suspects in the Kennedyassassination conspiracy by Jim Garrison. Stanley himself was consecrated byEarl Anglin Lawrence James, another Kennedy assassination suspect who was incontact with Ferrie’s “associate” and fellow bishop, Jack S. Martin. Propheta’sown known contacts with government officials and intelligence agents and hisworking relationship with Stanley indicates another level of activity beyond thescope of his two clueless assistant bishops. As mentioned previously, the authorhimself witnessed the presence of men who claimed to be both FBI and CIA aroundPropheta at various times during the late 1960s. These men were not bishops orecclesiastical types. These were serious men in serious suits who stayed up halfthe night speaking privately with Propheta in his office, drinking Scotch andplotting. The rest of the time, officials from various embassies could be seenvisiting the Bronx church on one errand or another. The author witnessed Italianand Nigerian embassy officials, and a number of Latin American and Slavicgentlemen, not to mention various members of American law enforcement. Yet, inall this time, and with all this activity, there were no parishioners. Nocongregation. No lay people attending the Sunday services. None. Ever. Theheadquarters of the American Orthodox Catholic Church—while possessed of a realchurch building, with ikons and incense, vestments and croziers, mitres and allmanner of ecclesiastical trimmings—never attempted to attract followers, workwith the community or in any way function as an actual religious organization,not even on Christmas and Easter. The services were held on Sunday and on thehigh holy days in relative obscurity. The rites were performed, at the propertimes and dates, but no one ever showed up except for the clergy performing therites or those there on some other, darker, purpose.Propheta’s brother in Christ, Carl Stanley, had consecrated several members ofthe anti-Castro underground, including David Ferrie. Stanley was himselfconsecrated by Earl Anglin Lawrence James, a man wanted for questioning duringthe Clay Shaw investigation. Another “Old Roman Catholic” was William Bryan, thehypnotist suspected of a role in the Robert Kennedy assassination. And Prophetahimself was up to his neck in anti-Communist activities involving EasternEurope, Italy and Africa, to name but a few, running bishops like agents… oragents like bishops. Christians and cultists; sorcerers and spies.As we go to press, the author has learned that Propheta was, indeed, deeplyinvolved with the FBI. As volunteered in a personal communication by ArchbishopColin Guthrie – one of the original founders of the American Orthodox CatholicChurch and a colleague of Carl Stanley – Propheta had contacted all the bishopsof the AOCC and informed them that he would be installed as the Primate of theChurch by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover! The recipients of this information werethen told that any bishop who wanted to retain his status within the AOCC mustprovide a complete curriculum vitae to Propheta so that it could be vetted andthe status of the bishop reconfirmed, and the bishop in question presumablyre-consecrated. Archbishop Guthrie, rightly incensed (no pun intended) at thisoutrage on behalf of Propheta and Hoover, declined to submit to Propheta’sdemands. Carl Stanley, however, raced to New York City to swear his allegianceto Propheta and presumably to submit his credentials.A month after his return to Kentucky, Stanley was dead. It is interesting tonote that Stanley died in March 1967. His erstwhile associate and fellowclergyman, Bishop David Ferrie, had died in New Orleans under mysteriouscircumstances on February 22, 1967, only a few weeks earlier and around the timeStanley had returned from New York and his meeting with the FBI-elevatedPropheta.Jack Martin, however, survived and went on to consecrate even more bishops. Thestory about his “investigating” fraudulent churches and diploma mills is thussuspect if not patently false, for we find Bishop Martin involved in severalconsecrations well into the 1970s, including that of Thomas Jude Baumler in1974. Baumler was a New Orleans politician and a known associate of GuyBanister… and a member of the American Association of Ethical Hypnotists,according to http://www.jfk-online.com/jpsbanag.html, an interest he shared withassassination suspects David Ferrie and William Bryan.One likes to think a lot has changed since then. With the arrival of theInternet, some of this dirty laundry has been aired, and the individual churchesnow try to maintain a relatively spotless reputation. However, these groupsstill operate out of storefronts—when they have the money—or more often out oftheir apartments, basements, trailer parks, or post office boxes. There is asense of cynicism among many of these men (and, now, women) since they seem tohave attained a high rank in society that is normally only the province of thewell-educated, well-connected, or well-heeled. To become a bishop in theCatholic Church is tantamount to becoming a vice president of a largecorporation or a member of the US Senate, but to become a bishop—with the sameline of apostolic succession, and hence of some kind of legitimacy—in thewandering bishop community requires not much more than a shoeshine and a smile…and sometimes not even that much. The initial euphoria wears off rather quicklywhen one returns to one’s studio apartment or trailer home after the ceremony,faced with the same grim reality as the day before: no wealthy multi-nationalcorporation behind you as there is behind the lowliest Catholic monk. Only adiploma and a title, and the sweaty company of your fellow dreamers. Unless youhave sought the consecration because you genuinely believe in its occult power—aline of initiations that stretches back to Jesus and St. Peter and, according tosome authors of mystical texts, all the way back to the priests of the pyramidsof ancient Egypt—what you wind up with is only an excuse to consecrate someoneelse, and thus begin a different kind of pyramid.Some of these bishops genuinely attempt to gather parishioners and congregationsand to do good work in their communities, but the nagging sense that they arenot “real” bishops performing “real” sacraments still lingers. This unease canbe seen in the ferocity with which they publish their lines of apostolicsuccession in mind-numbing lists of consecrators going back two thousand yearsover several different “lines,” as if to prove once and for all that they, too,are really bishops of a real church, while simultaneously scoffing at the linesof succession of their competitors.The sad thing is, there is actually nothing there to compete for since the onlyones paying any attention are usually other wandering bishops like themselves.They did nothing special to deserve the consecrations. No “service to humanity,”no saintly charisma, no odor of sanctity. And, once consecrated, theseindividuals often do nothing special with the gift they have been given. If theyare not occultists consciously using this sacramental power to further their ownspiritual growth (if no one else’s), or spies using the consecrations as aconvenient and impenetrable cover for other business, then they have nothingleft to do but look for someone else to consecrate and thus boost their ownegos—if only for a short, short time.And so it goes."},{"pageContent":"IndexSYMBOLS1st Mobile Broadcasting Company 1204th Mobile Broadcasting Company 119509th Bomb Group (Roswell, NM) 176AAbraham, Book of 39Abramson, Dr. Harold 196–199, 201, 216, 235Acambaro, Mexico 248, 251Acheson, Dean 179Acid Dreams 253Adams County, OH 51Addiction Research Center 216Adena people 51–55, 57-63, 72, 73, 75, 90, 91, 97–100, 160Adeptus Minor Ritual 261Adyar Lodge, Pasadena 298Aerojet Corporation 149, 152, 159, 248Aftermath (Farago) 46Agape Lodge (OTO) 149, 150, 155, 160Agency for International Development (AID) 264, 265Agents of the Devil (Habe) 113Agrippa, Cornelius 16, 31, 33Akhnaton Lodge, Pasadena 297Akron, OH 75Aku Aku (Heyerdahl) 49Al-Abub, Dr. Aziz 200Albany Medical College 226Alchemy 16, 17, 32, 247Aldine Hotel (Ashland) 102Alhambra 7, 8, 10, 20, 40Alice in Wonderland (Carroll) 223Alien abductions 19, 46, 144Alien Agenda (Marrs) 162, 183, 213Allan, Sir Hugh 226Allan Memorial Institute 226, 230 - 233, 238Allen, Corey 207Allen, Major 106Allen, Morse 318, 321, 326Alley, Sedley 81Allied Enterprises 152Ally, Kirstie 151, 295Alopecia 275Alpert, Richard 216alternate personalities 319Aluya, Bishop H.P.
