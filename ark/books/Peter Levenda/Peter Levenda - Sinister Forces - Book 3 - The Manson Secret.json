Then, in thecourse of my research, a strange thing happened. I learned of the actualinvolvement of Charles Manson with Scientology. In fact, there had been anE-Meter at the Spahn Ranch where his “family” stayed. Suddenly, I no longer hadany reason to use Sirhan Sirhan as my protagonist. Reality will transcendallegory every time. So, although I had announced that I was going to publishthat article, I started investigating the Manson case instead. Nevertheless,Scientology sued me for $750,000 for just those nine words— whoops, there goesthe whole petty cash account—but I chose to fight them on 1st Amendment grounds,and they eventually dropped the suit.I corresponded with Manson, visited his female killers in prison and—in aclassic example of participatory journalism—took an acid trip with familymembers Squeaky Fromme and Sandra Good. Ed Sanders’ book, The Family, mentionedthat Los Angeles police had discovered porn flicks in a loft at the crime scene,the home actress Sharon Tate shared with her director husband, Roman Polanski(in London at the time of the murders). And yet, the prosecutor in Manson’strial, Vincent Bugliosi, denied in his book, Helter Skelter, that any pornflicks had been found. It was possible that the police had in fact uncoveredthem but lied to Bugliosi.I learned why when I consulted San Francisco private investigator Hal Lipset,whose career had been the basis for The Conversation, starring Gene Hackman.Lipset informed me that not only did Los Angeles police seize porn movies andvideotapes, but also that individual officers were selling them. He had talkedwith one police source who told him exactly which porn flicks were available—atotal of seven hours’ worth for a quarter-million dollars. Lipset began recitinga litany of those porn videos. The most notorious was Greg Bautzer, an attorneyfor financier Howard Hughes, together with Jane Wyman, the former wife ofthen-Governor Ronald Reagan. There was Sharon Tate with Dean Martin. There wasSharon with Steve McQueen. There was Sharon with two black bisexual men.“The cops weren’t too happy about that one,” Lipset recalled.There was reportedly a video of Cass Elliot from The Mamas and The Papas in anorgy with Yul Brynner, Peter Sellers and Warren Beatty. Coincidentally, Brynnerand Sellers, together with John Phillips of The Mamas and The Papas, had offereda $25,000 reward for the capture of the killers. I always felt theseexecutioners had a prior connection with their victims. I finally tracked down areporter who had hung around with police and seen a porn video of Susan Atkinswith one of her victims, Wojciech Frykowski. When I asked Manson about that, heresponded: “You are ill advised and misled. [Victim Jay] Sebring done Susan’shair and I think he sucked one or two of her dicks. I’m not sure who she waswalking out from her stars and cages, that girl loves dick, you know what Imean, hon. Yul Brynner, Peter Sellers...”Manson was abandoned by his mother and lived in various institutions after hewas 8 years old. He learned early how to survive in captivity. When he was 14,he got arrested for stealing bread and was jailed. He was supposed to go toreform school, but instead went to Boys Town in Nebraska. He ran away from BoysTown and got arrested again, beginning his lifelong career as a prison inmate,and meeting organized crime figures who became his role models—and futurecontacts. He tossed horseshoes with Frank Costello, hung out with Frankie Carbo,and learned how to play the guitar from Alvin “Creepy” Karpas. Eventually, hewas introduced to Scientology by fellow prisoners while he was at McNeil IslandPenitentiary. He needed less deconditioning than his cellmates, who had spentmore time in the outside world. One of his teachers said that, with Scientology,Charlie’s ability to psych people out quickly was intensified so that he couldzero in on their weaknesses and fears immediately. Thus, one more method was nowstored in his manipulation tool chest.When Manson was released in 1967, he went to the Scientology Center in SanFrancisco. Family member “Little Paul” Watkins, who accompanied him there, toldme, “Charlie said to them, ‘I’m Clear’—what do I do now?’ But they expected himto sweep the floor. Shit, he had done that in prison.” In Los Angeles, he wentto the Scientology Celebrity Center. Now this was more like it. Here he couldmingle with the elite. I managed to obtain a copy of the original log entry:“7/31/68, new name, Charlie Manson, Devt., No address, In for processing =Ethics = Type III.” The receptionist—who, by Type III, meant “psychotic”—senthim to the Ethics office, but he never showed up.At the Spahn Ranch, Manson eclectically combined his version of Scientologyauditing with post-hypnotic techniques he had learned in prison, withgeographical isolation and subliminal motivation, with sing-along sessions andencounter games, with LSD and mescaline, with transactional analysis andbrainwashing rituals, with verbal probing and the sexual longevity that he hadpracticed upon himself for all those years in the privacy of his cell.Ultimately, in August 1969, he sent members of his well-programmed family off toslay Sharon Tate and her unborn baby, hairstylist and dealer to the stars JaySebring, would-be screenwriter Wojciech Frykowski, and his girlfriend, coffeeheiress Abigail Folger. Revenge for a drug deal gone sour.Ed Sanders wrote, “In the days before his death, Sebring had complained to areceptionist at his hair salon that someone had burned him for $2,000 worth ofcocaine and he wanted vengeance.” On Friday evening, just a few hours before themassacre took place, Joel Rostau—the boyfriend of Sebring’s receptionist and anintermediary in a cocaine ring—visited Sebring and Frykowski at the Tate houseto deliver mescaline and coke. During the Manson trial, several associates ofSebring were murdered, including Rostau, whose body was found in the trunk of acar in New York.The next night, Manson accompanied his followers to kill supermarket mogul LenoLaBianca and his wife. Ostensibly, they were selected at random, but a policereport showed that LaBianca was a heavy gambler. He owed $30,000 to FrankieCarbo’s organization. I asked Manson about a little black book he was supposedto get from LaBianca. He wrote back, “The black book was what the CIA and a mobof market players had, Hollywood Park [race track] and numbers rackets to movein the Governor’s office legally.”Ed Sanders and I were on a panel at the University of Missouri, where he stated,“In the course of my research in Los Angeles, it became evident that RobertKennedy was killed by a group of people including Sirhan Sirhan.” In The Family,he had written, in reference to the Process Church, to which Manson had ties,“It is possible that the Process had a baleful influence on Sirhan Sirhan, sinceSirhan is known, in the spring of ’68, to have frequented clubs in Hollywood inoccult pursuits. He has talked several times subsequent to Robert Kennedy’sdeath about an occult group from London which he knew about and which he reallywanted to go to London to see.”Since the London-based Process Church had been an offshoot of Scientology, thislooked like it could be a case of satirical prophecy. I was tempted to return tomy original premise involving Sirhan, but it was too late. I had already becomeobsessed with my Manson research. I recalled that, in the summer of 1968, whilethe Yippies were planning for a Festival of Life at the Democratic NationalConvention in Chicago, some zealots from the Process cult visited me in NewYork. They were hyper-anxious to meet Timothy Leary and kept pestering me forhis phone number. The Process, founded by Scientology dropouts, first came tothe U.S. from London in 1967. Members were called “mind benders” and proclaimedtheir “dedication to the elimination of the grey forces.”In January 1968, they became the Process Church of the Final Judgment, a NewOrleans-based religious corporation. They claimed to be in direct contact withboth Jesus and Lucifer, and had wanted to be called the Church of the Process ofUnification of Christ and Satan, but local officials presumably objected totheir taking the name of Satan in vain. The Process struck me as a group ofoccult provocateurs, using radical Christianity as a front. They were adamantlyinterested in Yippie politics. They boasted to me of various rallies which theirvibrations alone had transformed into riots. They implied that there was somekind of connection between the assassination of Bobby Kennedy and their own merepresence on the scene.Bernard Fensterwald, head of the Committee to Investigate Assassinations, toldme that Sirhan Sirhan had some involvement with the Process. Peter Chang, thedistrict attorney of Santa Cruz, showed me a letter from a Los Angeles policeofficial to the chief of police in San Jose, warning him that the Process hadinfiltrated biker gangs and hippie communes. And Ed Sanders wrote in Win(Workshop in Nonviolence) magazine, “[W]ord came out of Los Angeles of a currentFBI investigation of the RFK murder, the investigation growing, as the sourceput it, out of ‘the Manson case.’ Word came from another source, this one in thehalls of Government itself, that several police and investigatory jurisdictionshave information regarding other murders that may have been connected to theRobert Kennedy shooting: murders that occurred after RFK’s. A disturbing fact inthis regard is that one agency in the Federal Bureaucracy (not the FBI) hasstopped a multi-county investigation by its own officers that would have probedinto such matters as the social and religious activities of Sirhan Sirhan inearly ’68, and into the allegations regarding RFK-connected murders.”In 1972, Paulette Cooper, author of The Scandal of Scientology, put me in touchwith Lee Cole, a former Scientologist who was now working with the ProcessChurch. His role was to provide information on Scientology to the Process. Icontacted him and flew to Chicago. We made an appointment to visit the Processheadquarters. The Process men were dressed all in black, with large silvercrosses hanging from their necks. They called each other “Brother” and they hadGerman shepherds that seemed to be menacing. The Brothers tried to convince methat Scientology, not the Process, was responsible for creating Manson. But whatelse could I have expected?Charles Manson’s real family consisted of con artists, pimps, drug dealers,thieves, muggers, rapists and murderers. He had known only power relationshipswithin an army of control junkies. Charlie was America’s Frankenstein monster, alogical product of the prison system—racist, paranoid and violent—even if hippieastrologers thought that his fate had been predetermined because he was a tripleScorpio. A psychiatrist at San Quentin Prison told me of an incident he observedduring Manson’s trial. A black inmate said to Manson, “Look, I don’t wanna knowabout your theories on race, I don’t wanna hear anything about religion, I justwanna know one thing—how’d you get them girls to obey you like that?” The reply:“I got a knack.”Actually, Manson told me, “I only picked up girls who had already been tossedaway by society.” And he would fill that void. After having lived behind barsmost of his life, he ended up in the Haight-Ashbury area in the Summer of Love.Oh, those luscious runaways. And so he began to explore and exploitcountercultural values.I was gathering piece after piece of a mind-boggling jigsaw puzzle, withouthaving any model to pattern it after. The evidence indicated that members of theManson family had actually but unknowingly served as a hit-squad for a drugring. Manson had instructed the girls to do whatever family member Tex Watsontold them. When Manson was charged, Watson was also charged, but federalauthorities held Watson in a Texas prison with no explanation—not even his ownlawyers were allowed to see him—while Bugliosi prosecuted the Manson trial inCalifornia. In order to find Manson guilty, the jury had to be convinced thatCharlie’s devils were zombies who followed his orders without question. In orderto find Watson guilty, the jury had to be convinced that he was not a zombie andknew exactly what he was doing.Conspiracy researcher Mae Brussell put me in contact with Preston Guillory, aformer deputy sheriff, who told me, “We had been briefed for a few weeks priorto the actual raiding of Spahn Ranch. We had a sheaf of memos on Manson, thatthey had automatic weapons at the ranch, that citizens had complained abouthearing machine-guns fired at night, that firemen from the local fire stationhad been accosted by armed members of Manson’s band and told to get out of thearea, all sorts of complaints like this. We had been advised to put anythingrelating to Manson on a memo submitted to the station, because they weresupposedly gathering information for the raid we were going to make. Deputies atthe station of course started asking, ‘Why aren’t we going to make the raidsooner?’ I mean, Manson’s a parole violator, machine-guns have been heard, weknow there’s narcotics and we know there’s booze. He’s living at the Spahn Ranchwith a bunch of minor girls in complete violation of his parole. Deputies at thestation quite frankly became very annoyed that no action was being taken aboutManson. My contention is this—the reason Manson was left on the street wasbecause our department thought that he was going to attack the Black Panthers.We were getting intelligence briefings that Manson was anti-black and he hadsupposedly killed a Black Panther, the body of which could not be found, and thedepartment thought that he was going to launch an attack on the BlackPanthers....”If that’s true, then it was racism in the Sheriff ’s Department which turned lawenforcers into unintentional collaborators in a mass murder. But what if therewas some other, deeper reason? Guillory told me, “Before the Tate killings,[Manson] had been arrested at Malibu twice for statutory rape. Never got[imprisoned for parole violation]. Manson liked to ball young girls, so he justdid his thing and he was released, and they didn’t put any parole hold on him.But somebody very high up was controlling everything that was going on and wasseeing to it that we didn’t bust Manson.” And, in this third book of theSinister Forces trilogy, Peter Levenda presents the historical context for anunderlying scenario which could well provide that missing link. For aquarter-century, he has diligently researched political witchcraft in the UnitedStates, culminating in what he calls the “Manson Secret.”Meanwhile, Charlie has become a cultural symbol. In surfer jargon, a “manson” isa crazy, reckless surfer. For comedians, Manson has become a generic jokereference. I asked him how he felt about that. He wrote back: “I don’t know whata generic is, Joke. I think I know what that means. That means you talk badabout Reagan or Bush. I’ve always ran poker games and whores and crime. I’m acrook. You make the reality in court and press. I just ride and play the cardsthat were pushed on me to play. Mass killer, it’s a job, what can I say.”—Paul Krassner is the author of One Hand Jerking: Reports From an InvestigativeSatirist; he publishes The Disneyland Memorial Orgy at paulkrassner. com."},{"pageContent":"Prologue February – September 2003Kuala Lumpur God is great; there is no God but God, and Mohammad is his prophet. Thespeaker-amplified cry of the muezzin echoes off the tall buildings around thepark. It should be an auspicious ending. Auspicious, not suspicious. But withthe subject matter and the time of night and the thrumming nervousness of thestreets it is too tempting to be anything but suspicious. Even God is a suspectnow. God most of all.I started this when I was not yet twenty-five years old. I am now fifty-two. Itis impossible to communicate what this means in terms of a single project,especially a writing project that takes place in solitude with all the wings oflife flapping around me, beating at my windows, noisy and oblivious to my dailyanxieties and dreads, my occasional attack of euphoria and self-congratulationover a well-written line or a fortuitous discovery. There is a thin line thatseparates solitude from loneliness, and I cross it every day and sometimes evenin my sleep.During the years I worked on this book, I also worked in the world, like a Sufi,“in the world but not of it,” or so it would seem to most people. Yet, I managedto develop lines of business for American and European companies abroad, livedand worked in Asia for many years, was responsible for expense budgets thatexceeded ten million dollars and for sales that nudged one hundred million,spread over five continents and thirty countries. This type of multiplepersonality disorder is common among Americans, and is endemic among NewYorkers: this shadow life running parallel and sometimes perpendicular to thedaily life of mortgages and credit card bills, a child’s education and doctor’svisits. Yet, through it all, I have not succumbed to drink or drugs orinstitutionalized madness, and for this I am grateful.I keep a bottle of Absolut in the freezer, however, and I drink some now, thecolored lights of the city outside my window twinkling like acid-dream firefliesin the tropical night. I am alone. The files are stacked on the floor, thedining-room table, the chairs all around me. Outside, incongruously, thesing-song warble of the muezzin calls the Muslim faithful to prayer. Inside themosque, dozens of barefoot, sarong-clad men kneel, facing Mecca and its ancientlump of meteoric rock, and bow, surrendering themselves to God. God will protectthem from evil, from demons, from unclean thoughts, from Western decadence, fromAmerican imperialism and currency speculators. From Ibliss and Shaitan and allthe Islamic demons. Ein feste Burg, Luther would have said. A mighty fortress isour God.But my demons will not leave me alone. Their traces are everywhere around me,but mostly on paper, in the files. And in my head. I can feel them, whistlingthrough cranial corridors, taunting the prisoners I have chained in there andtried to forget, tormenting me with memories. With dreams. With morguephotographs. Autopsy reports. Lists of dead names. A political Necronomicon.I light a candle, the flame flickers. It glints, winking like an evil eye, offthe wavy blade of the kriss I keep near my bedside. I also need protectiontonight, from what I do not know and cannot name. Only feel.Unknown to me and to the world at large, Al Qaeda operatives met not far from myapartment and began the plotting for the September 11 attack. It was a criticalmoment in history, this meeting; “pivotal,” some in the intelligence communityhave said. And it happened in darkness, in the shadows. Two lives runningparallel to each other, one in the daylight of the mosque and the loudspeakerprayers, and the other at night in an apartment full of the mutterings ofbombers and saboteurs, like muffled oars.While I dug and dug, mining data and researching through every type of materialin an effort to disinter the sinister forces that lie dead but dreaming beneaththe American political landscape, events were in progress to change the worldforever. Fundamentalist Islamic militants were preparing to “bring the warhome,” as we used to say in the 1960s, and launch an attack on the very Americanlandscape I was writing about. And they played right into the hands of theirenemies. It was all a Republican administration needed in order to launch thetwenty-first century equivalent of an Inquisition at home, and a Crusade abroad.But I did not know this at the time. All I felt was the foreboding, the sense ofimpending doom, and I attributed this to my research and my unhealthyconcentration on evil, on mental disorders, on murder and assassination andmagic.The files. Thirty years of hunting and searching. Mistakes. Missteps. Falsestarts. Foul matter. I was a thin, nervous, sickly youth when I started.Bespectacled and academic. Solitary and anxious. I was not the type to have gunspointed at me, to have my life threatened by soldiers, spies. Not because I wasgood, or even innocent. But because I was not a soldier, not an intelligenceagency cowboy strapped with an Ingram Mach-10 and a “get out of jail free” card.I was a reader. A writer. The passive-aggressive type. I asked questions.Terrorists don’t have questions, only answers.But in the last thirty years I have been stalked, surveilled, photographed,searched, researched, detained and denounced by a variety of agencies andindividuals, in a number of countries, and for various reasons. I guess I have aproblem with authority. But in my defense I have to say that pure research—ofthe academic variety—is bloodless. Worse, it is dishonest. Historians arecheats, like crooked accountants cooking the books. They manipulate data andcreate fiction in the guise of gospel. To get the taste and smell and feel ofhistory, you have to get your hands dirty.Or wet.The vodka is ice-cold and flows like syrup, the way it is supposed to. The wayit did in Moscow in 1996, when I visited the Metropole Hotel and DzherzinskySquare and the Lubyanka with a former member of the former KGB. A pilgrimage ofsorts, shrines to espionage and assassination legend. Outside, now, thetemperature is mild for this time of year, for this tropical place. Standing inmy window, backlit by my apartment lights, I can gaze out to my right and myleft and see rain forest in the distance. Jungle. But straight ahead, behind themosque and the Citibank building, stand the tallest buildings in the world.I’m wasting time. Procrastinating. The files—like the grimoires, the workbooksof the medieval sorcerers—sit patiently inside, full of blood and secrets. Fattoads, fed on flies and their maggoty children.Darwin Scott.

I did not come toMalaysia only to wind up as the caretaker of these hideous memories, these deadand staring eyes, these voiceless corpses. But I can hear the clank of thesliding trays in the morgues back in the States and the dull hiss of the mindsgone … awry. This is the hand I fear most, the hand behind these outrages,several and satanic, for it is one hand and not many that I see, a singlenightmare, an epistemological singularity, evil in its finest—most finely-woven,most sub-atomic—form.The Muslims have finished praying. They walk to their cars. The women in veilscalled tudung, the men in those narrow, dark, brimless caps called songkok, madefamous by news photos of Sukarno back in the 1960s, in the Year of LivingDangerously. The Malaysian Prime Minister, beleaguered on all sides by the Asianeconomic crisis of 1997-99, blamed his country’s decline on international Jewishbankers and other, unnamed, “sinister forces.” Sinister forces. A blast from thepast. Our past.It’s all in the files.Here, photographs of the mass graves at Auschwitz. Here, photographs of Catholicmonks and priests, monsignors and bishops, reviewing the Nazi troops marchingthrough small towns in Croatia.There, crime scene shots in California, New York, Mexico, Texas … there,declassified documents coyly hinting at monstrous deeds committed by governmentofficials; there, the arrogant testimony of colonels, crusaders, and Companyshrinks.I walk over to the windows, but am afraid to look up, worried that the hand willstrike from there as easily as from a cluttered government office cubicle or aslowly cruising Lincoln Continental. MacArthur was afraid to look up.Hillenkoetter was afraid to look up. Who am I to second-guess these men?Generals and admirals, men with the stink of blood on their hands from thedefense of America in time of war; men who sent boys off to the jungles of Asiato fight the Japanese, or commanded naval convoys where flames burned the waterin some kind of alchemical allegory, to the deranged counterpoint of screams.This is the hard math of life and death, the calculus of survival. War makes usall scientists for a time. And these men—these military commanders with ribbonsand medals who saw tens of thousands march into battle or sail into holocaust,who ordered planes and bombs and all our technology into the feverish, frenziedair—feared space, and the threat of alien, sinister forces from above.Daylight is worrying the edges of the Asian night. The files are open, tossed,backs broken, pages marked. The connective tissue to all of this is here.Strong. Unbreakable. Strings of connections that weave fatal chains whose linkslaugh at canned history, at consensus reality.

That they are real, independent souls is shown by the factthat not only do the contents of the mind differ—which might conceivably be afake—but their handwritings, their voices, and that in ways which are quitebeyond anything we know in the way of conscious simulation, or even possiblesimulation.These personalities are constant quantities; they depart and return unchanged.It is then sure that they do not exist merely by manifestation; they need nobody for existence.—Aleister Crowley1Osiris married his sister Isis and succeeded Ra as king of the earth. However,his brother Set hated him. Set killed Osiris, cut him into many pieces, andscattered the fragments over a wide area.Isis gathered up the fragments, embalmed them, and resurrected Osiris as king ofthe nether world, king of the land of the dead.… Isis and Osiris had a son,Horus, who defeated Set in battle and became king of the earth. Thus in thismyth we see the fragmentation, death, healing, and resurrection of the self in anew form. This is the cycle through which the successfully treated DID(dissociative identity disorder) patient must pass.—Colin A. Ross2To me, black and white films from the early days of cinema have always seemedsomewhat … existential. Something to do with film noir, I suppose. One is forcedto concentrate more on the story being told, the characterizations, cameraangles, etc., as if searching for a hidden meaning. Since there is no color, theshadings are all done with light and darkness, with strips of shadow and sharp,cutting edges: like some kind of Zoroastrian struggle taking place, frame byframe.This is especially true, I think, of Fritz Lang’s masterpiece, M.This is Lang’s first sound film, and it is also the first film ever made about aserial killer. Though released in 1931, its issues are strikingly modern andrelevant. The film could have been made yesterday, and it humbles us to realizethat people agonized over the same moral and legal issues in Weimar Berlin asthey do in twenty-first century New York. Briefly, the story is this:A series of child abductions and murders is taking place in a city in Germany.Little girls are being seduced by gifts of candy and balloons, their bodiessometimes found, sometimes not, a little while later. Details of the crimes arenot given, but we are meant to understand that they are hideous. The killer issending letters to the police and the newspapers, taunting them. The letters arebeing analyzed by police graphologists in what is perhaps the first instance onfilm of “profiling.”We know the identity of the killer from the beginning. It is a man named Beckertwho is played to perfection by a young Peter Lorre, a Hungarian actor who at thetime was also working on a Brecht piece (and similarities between the Lang filmand Brecht’s work have been noted before). Lorre would rise to prominence inAmerican films later in his career—notably Casablanca, Passage to Marseilles,etc.—and his pop eyes and strange, lisping voice would become the mainstay ofcartoon villains for decades to come.Beckert has a nervous habit of whistling a melody from Grieg’s Peer Gynt, andthat is how he is eventually identified, by a group of street criminals who wantto stop the intense pressure being put on their illegal businesses by the policewho are turning the city—and the underworld—inside out in their search for themurderer. Thus, we have both the police and the criminal organizations lookingfor the killer, the criminals somewhat more successful in that they do not haveto rely on the niceties of search and seizure laws to conduct their sweep of thecity. That Beckert is eventually captured is a foregone conclusion; what isfascinating is how the killer describes the uncontrollable compulsion that leadshim to murder, the fact that he cannot remember the murders themselves, and thestruggle of society over what to do with a man who is an “involuntary” killer, aman who cannot be held responsible for his actions. The discussion of how themurderer—if brought to the police—would probably get off with a “not guilty byreason of insanity” plea and be free to walk the streets and kill more littlegirls is so contemporary that we are shocked into a realization that thisconundrum has been going on, continuously and unresolved, since at least thattime.The term “serial killer” is not used, as that phrase was developed in Americafifty years after the release of the film; yet the pattern of murders, amnesia,the killer’s taunting letters to the police, etc. are identical to those withwhich we are now familiar from both real-life instances of serial murder as wellas the more fanciful treatments by Hollywood.Is the serial killer a metaphor for something deeper? The Fritz Lang film stopswell short of the type of mythologizing of, say, The Silence of the Lambs. The1931 film treats the murderer as a human being suffering from a serioussickness—perhaps mental, perhaps spiritual—that renders him unfit for humansociety and which puts both the police and the criminal organizations intocounterpoint against a case of “real” criminality: we are forced to admit thatperhaps the common criminal is simply the mirror image of a policeman, whereasthe serial killer is beyond all comparison with normal human activity, legal orillegal.Modern writers like Thomas Harris (who created the unforgettable HannibalLecter) have taken this idea one step further: if the serial killer is indeedoutside the normal realm of human behavior, then—on an existential level—whatdoes he represent? By comparing the bizarre actions and beliefs of a serialkiller to those of cannibals, primitive shamans, etc., we are drawn to theconclusion that these extreme cases of human behavior—eating human flesh,becoming possessed by spiritual forces—point the way to a different view ofsociety, and of reality itself. Thomas Harris’ killers are seekingtransformation: either spiritual or psychological transformation or actualphysical change. They use murder, torture, and pain as means to this end. Inthis they are no different from organized killing societies such as the SS, forHitler himself believed he was using the Nazi Party to create a “new man.”This almost visceral urge to evolve into something different, something other,may indeed be the manifestation of a genetic impulse. Transformation is a themeof many ancient spiritual practices, from the Siberian shaman changing himselfinto an animal to the dead Egyptian Pharoah becoming a god, to thetransformative rites of the Catholic Mass, to the intense ecstatic rituals ofHaitian voudon in which the devotee is temporarily possessed by a god andbehaves accordingly. Ancient religion and primitive religion are obsessed by theidea of personal transformation; it is only in the richer and more developedcountries that this concept is forgotten as people desperately try to hold on tothe status quo. They suddenly have a lot to lose if they become something …other.Thus, the mythology of the serial killer is a warning, perhaps, that this urgeis not to be ignored because otherwise it will manifest in very dangerous, veryunhealthy ways. And should the reader believe that this “mythology” is afabrication of novelists and Hollywood scriptwriters, let us examine the mythsof some of America’s most famous serial murderers to see how deeply religiousconcepts and iconography adorned their chambers of horrors.DSM-IVBefore we delve directly into the shamanistic and initiatory aspects of somecelebrated serial murderers, let us define our terms. We will discuss thereligio-occult terms as we come across them, but for now we should focus on whatmainstream psychiatry thinks about such things as multiple personality disorder(MPD), dissociative identity disorder (DID), post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD), and the whole field of acute mental illness in general. In order to dothis, we must consult that bible of the psychiatric profession, the Diagnosticand Statistical Manual: Mental Disorders, more commonly referred to as DSM.The first edition of the DSM was not published until 1951, following a period ofconfusion and disorganization in the profession that began in the 1920s, whenefforts were undertaken to create an international “Standard Nomenclature ofDisease.” Various attempts at codifying mental illness by adopting a specificvocabulary were attempted—with varying degrees of success—throughout the 1930s.All of this changed with the onset of World War II. Many readers may besurprised to learn that the celebrated DSM is actually the result of an Americanmilitary mission to provide a comprehensive classification system of mentaldisease. As the war broke out, psychiatrists realized, “There was a need toaccount accurately for all causes of morbidity, hence the need for a suitablediagnosis for every case seen by the psychiatrist, a situation not faced incivilian life. Only about 10% of the total cases seen fell into any of thecategories ordinarily seen in public mental hospitals. Military psychiatrists,induction station psychiatrists, and Veterans Administration psychiatrists,found themselves operating within the limits of a nomenclature specifically notdesigned for 90% of the cases handled.” 3In other words, ninety percent of themental illness cases encountered by the military fell outside the normal run ofwhat was experienced in a civilian setting. As an example:Relatively minor personality disturbances, which became of importance only inthe military setting, had to be classified as, “Psychopathic Personality.”4(We may be forgiven if we suggest, therefore, that perhaps some of what we havecome to know as mental illnesses are in actuality mental states or conditionsnot conducive to following orders, marching in lockstep, and blowing someone’sbrains out.)The Navy then began to develop its own classification system in 1944, and theArmy came up with its own version in 1945, a version that eventually became theone used by the Veterans Administration in 1946. However, by 1948 there were “atleast three nomenclatures (Standard, Armed Forces, and Veterans Administration)”in general use, none of which agreed completely with the new InternationalStatistical Classification.5 What happened next seems dull and unexceptional,except perhaps to a Burgess (A Clockwork Orange) or maybe a Blatty (Twinkle,Twinkle Killer Kane). To quote once again from the very first edition of theDSM:Following the adoption of new nomenclatures by the Army and VeteransAdministration, the Committee on Nomenclature and Statistics of the AmericanPsychiatric Association postponed change in its recommended officialnomenclature pending some evidence as to the usability of the new systems. In1948, the Committee undertook to learn from the Army and Veterans Administrationhow successful the changes had been …6In other words, the American military was guiding the American PsychiatricAssociation in the creation of what would become the Diagnostic and StatisticalManual: Mental Disorders.Many Americans know—or are dimly aware—that the excellent interstate highwaysystem in the United States is the result of a Defense Department initiative,designed to enable motorized armor to move swiftly from one area of the countryto another in the event of an attack or evacuation. What many Americans do notknow is the extent to which the Army and the Navy contributed to other aspectsof American life that we take for granted, such as for example theclassification of mental disease.There were many other details to arrange; the consideration of a proper placefor the operation gave rise to much mental labour. It is, generally speaking,desirable to choose the locality of a recent battle; and the greater the numberof slain the better. (There should be some very desirable spots in the vicinityof Verdun for black magicians who happen to flourish after the vulgar year1917).—Aleister Crowley, Moonchild7“Shell shock” was a common concept among the medical profession during World WarI. Some of our more famous psychiatrists—such as William Sargant, mentioned inBooks I and II in the context of his relationship to Dr. Frank Olson—cut theireye teeth on treating shell shock in World War I veterans. They used everythingfrom drugs to hypnosis to analysis in an effort to ease the suffering of thesementally-wounded soldiers. In fact, Andre Breton—the celebrated eminence gris ofthe Surrealist movement—worked in the same capacity, treating shell shockvictims with such occult techniques as automatic writing. (We will examine theSurrealists in more detail in a later chapter.)Another celebrated therapist of the First War was one W.H.R. Rivers, who exertedconsiderable influence over the lives and thought of such important individualsof the time as the poet Siegfried Sassoon and the poet, novelist and mythologianRobert Graves (who was also a confidant of Sargant, another therapist whospecialized in shell shock and the application of psychotherapy in a militarysetting). Rivers had spent some time studying the enigmatic Toda tribe of India,a strange ethnic group that seems to trace their origins to the ancient MiddleEast, including—according to some observers—ancient Sumeria. Rivers treatedSassoon at a military hospital for shell shock (or, as it seemed to somecritics, malingering) and began to derive a philosophy of the mind from theexperience as well as from his background in ethnology and the study ofprimitive cultures.In a lecture given after the War, he had this to say about the relationshipbetween mental illness and combat:Perhaps the most striking feature of the war from the medical point of view hasbeen the enormous scale upon which its conditions have produced functionalnervous disorders, a scale far surpassing any previous war, although theRusso-Japanese campaign gave indications of the mental and nervous havoc whichthe conditions of modern warfare are able to produce.—W. H. R. Rivers to the John Rylands Library, April 9, 1919This idea that modern warfare contributes to a serious rise in mental disordersis one that would influence William Sargant and others following in thefootsteps of the great therapists of the first decades of the twentieth century.Rivers would devote a great deal of his time towards an understanding of therelationship between “Medicine, Magic and Religion” (as a collection of hisessays is entitled), looking for a solution to the problem of the mind-bodydichotomy. This, of course, is the bedrock of what would become the mind controlprograms of the Americans, the Soviets, the Chinese and others, althoughRivers—a humanitarian and idealist—would presumably have been horrified to seehis insights result in such experimentation.As World War I became World War II—and “shell shock” became “battlefatigue”—military authorities were under pressure to counter the growingincidence of soldiers unfit for combat due to mental disturbances. Thissituation became quite severe during the Korean War, when a newwrinkle—“brainwashing”—was added to the mix. In November 1951—the height of theKorean conflict—the very first edition of the DSM was finalized.By the time we were coming out of the Vietnam War, the DSM had gone throughseveral editions. “Battle fatigue” had become institutionalized as “posttraumatic stress disorder” or PTSD, in DSM-III. And suddenly the era of the“crazed Vietnam veteran” was upon us, introducing a new breed of menace inAmerican streets: the lonely, alienated warrior who had seen and experienced toomuch in the Southeast Asian jungles, had taken too many drugs, had killed toomany people, had learned loyalty and sacrifice under fire only to see thesevalues mocked by his Stateside friends and family. He hallucinates, hasflashbacks of the jungle, cannot relate to his wife or girlfriend, and winds upwandering the streets at night, stoned, armed, and believing he is back in thejungle. A killing machine. A powder keg ready to explode.It was an urban myth to a certain extent, of course, pumped up and exploited bythe media in novels, movies, and television shows, but it was a short slide fromthe “crazed Vietnam veteran” to a particular refinement of the archetype in themore robust “serial killer.” With the serial killer, we forgot all about thecrazed Vietnam vets and began worrying about the quiet, soft-spoken, sociallyinept young white man next door with the foul body odor, the rotting teeth, theuneducated English, and the basement full of corpses. It was a pop-culture seguefrom the Age of Manson to the Age of Lucas, Dahmer, Gacey, and Bundy. Manson hada retinue of young women and men to carry out his bizarre plans; the serialkillers worked alone, or in pairs. They derived pleasure from committing theacts directly, themselves, and would never have dreamed of “farming out” thework to a “Family.” The body count of a single serial killer such as Dahmer orGacey would be far greater than that of a Manson. And what’s more, they weresolo acts.For some reason, the serial killer captured the American imagination. Murder hasalways been interesting to people, but usually in the slightly claustrophobicand socially-refined venue of the detective story. The stories of AgathaChristie, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Edgar Allan Poe (the father of the detectivestory) defined our notion of how to handle the grotesque and the morbid: we havebrilliant amateurs who trace minute specs of evidence or apply an unassailablelogic to the conditions of the crime to identify and apprehend the perpetrator.They are crimes solved by science and logic tables.With the serial killer, however, we enter the world of the motiveless crime, aworld where the abilities of a Sherlock Holmes or a Miss Marple would shatterlike a stained glass window in the rays of a hideous insanity, a lust for blood,a ritualistic slashing of the carving knife. We are desperate to understand theserial killer, finding in him a fascinating and compelling introduction to thedark corners and fetid basements of our own troubled psyches. And, just as Freudsought to understand the human mind by examining its pathologies, we come tounderstand not only the substance of our own souls by studying the serial killerbut—as authors of serial killer fiction such as Thomas Harris have implied—alsothe possibilities of our transformation. We seek, in the blood and madness andgore of the serial killer’s frenzied occupation, the rites of the shaman, theillumination of the magician, the ecstatic trance of the medium, the possessionby a god.The hallmark American film which sensationalized the serial killer was AlfredHitchcock’s masterpiece, Psycho (1960). It was based, loosely, on the case of agenuine serial killer, Ed Gein, who murdered women and saved their skin to sewtogether as garments, creating a kind of “woman suit” that he could wear. Thecharacter of Norman Bates—played by Anthony Perkins—is in the grip of what wouldcome to be known as multiple personality disorder (MPD). He is sometimes NormanBates, and sometimes his abusive (and dead) mother. The idea that Norman grew upin a physically-abusive household which molded his personality—or, to be moreprecise, dissociated his personality—is hinted at in the film but notemphasized. It is Norman’s own insanity that confronts us, not that of hismother.As the psychiatric profession developed its theories of personality disorders,it abandoned the concept of “multiple personalities” to embrace one of“dissociated personalities,” i.e., taking the philosophical stance that there isonly one personality allowed per human being but that it can, at times, becomedissociated: splinter into several parts, as it were. Whatever name we give it(and some psychiatrists are not happy with the dissociative identitydisorder—DID—classification and retain MPD as their preferred nomenclature), thedisorder is easily confused with what our ancestors thought of as demonicpossession, for in a case of DID the personality undergoes a profound change,sometimes even in front of the therapist. The patient will speak in a differentvoice, perhaps that of a different sex, different age group, act differently,use a different vocabulary and “present” differently from the other personalityor personalities. Each personality may remember what has happened to the otherpersonalities, or more usually may not. This type of amnesia is common in casesof DID, and was of intense interest to the CIA scientists of MK-ULTRA.Yet, involved with the already heady experience of dealing with a serial killerwho may be suffering from DID, we also have—in the fictional case of Psycho butalso in the actual case of Ed Gein—the concept of transformation.This idea that one can transform oneself spiritually (or physically) throughmurder and mutilation was explored by novelist Thomas Harris in his famous TheSilence of the Lambs, since made into a film (1991) starring Jodie Foster as FBISpecial Agent Clarice Starling and Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Inthis story, the serial killer is a virtual Ed Gein, capturing women and starvingthem so that their skin would become loose on their bodies, and then killingthem and removing the skin. His goal—after being turned down by severalsex-change clinics—was to become a woman, and to do this he would don a woman’sactual skin, or a skin suit composed of pieces of various women.That this smacks of pure lycanthropy, as practiced by shamanistic cults theworld over, albeit with animal skins, usually goes unnoticed. Yet, to furtherdrive home his message, Harris has his serial killer insert the larva of aspecific type of moth into the mouths of his victims when he dumps their bodies.The moth, of course, is a symbol of transformation. The mythology is carefullyworked out and, it must be said, beyond the imagination and creativity of mostserial killers one comes across in the news. That does not mean, however, thatthe genuine serial killer is not (subconsciously at least) seekingtransformation. But we must ask ourselves, Is transformation a code word forpsychic integration? Or does it mean something more?THE MANCHURIAN SERIAL KILLERA favorite topic in the underground press is the concept that some serialkillers are the victims of a government mind-control project run amok. With theRockefeller Commission investigations in the 1970s and the subsequent revelationthat the United States had carried out a number of experiments on violentoffenders—dosing them with enormous amounts of LSD, for instance—one comes tothe natural conclusion that the experience must have made a deep and seriousimpact on the already fragile psyches of these dangerous felons. Did they getreligion? Did they become mystics, eschewing their former lives of murder andrape, under the benign energy flowing into their souls from the kindlygovernment medical men in their white robes and insincere smiles, hypodermicsyringes raised to the heavens? Or, as is more likely, did the intensepsychological pressure of the massive dosage of hallucinogens force some other,less savory, response of these men in prison cells and iron shackles?Unfortunately, we shall never know. The files have been destroyed. We don’t evenknow their names. We don’t know what streets they wander, or what diseaseddaydreams occupy them as they gaze upon the rest of us in their madness.As we saw in Book II, Congressman Leo Ryan believed that the leadership of theSymbionese Liberation Army might have been victims of an MK-ULTRA program duringtheir incarceration at Vacaville prior to their assault on California banks andthe kidnapping of Patty Hearst. Congressman Ryan would be murdered in thepresence of the local CIA resident only a few months after he made his inquiriesof the CIA.A more pressing case before us, however, is that of convicted serial killerArthur Shawcross. In Shawcross we have all the elements of a paranoid fantasythat even Hollywood would find a hard time digesting. A Vietnam veteran, childmolester, rapist, and murderer who is set free only to kill again. A man whoclaimed a history of violent encounters in Vietnam … but whose official Armyrecords deny any substance to the stories. A man whose brain shows evidence ofsurgical intervention, but whose Army medical records were classified and notpermitted to be reviewed by his own defense team. A man who claimed he heardvoices, haunted by ghosts no one else could see.A common defense for serial murder—entertained, if not actually implemented attrial—is the insanity plea. We will look at that more closely a little later,but for now it is enough to know that this plea (with its origins in nineteenthcentury British jurisprudence) is honored more in the breach than in theobservance. The insanity plea is rarely used, not quite so often as Hollywoodwould have us believe, but it is a tantalizing plea nevertheless. As in theFritz Lang film mentioned above, society seems to realize that there exists inthe world the “involuntary” killer, the man (or sometimes the woman) driven tokill by uncontrollable impulses; a man who is not whole, or not wholly human. Aman who cannot be held accountable for his crimes.A traditional tactic of the defense attorney—and defense psychiatrist—inattempting to convince a judge and jury of the insanity of their client is todemonstrate the existence of some kind of organic mental illness, something thatcan be proven in the laboratory: a chemical imbalance, say, or severe braindamage. Perhaps a tumor, or lesions in the temporal lobe. Many of our mostfamous serial killers have, indeed, such a medical history. Bobby Joe Long ofKenova, West Virginia had been hit on the head as a child, beaten with an ironpipe. The damage was severe, and could be seen in X-rays of his head. He alsohad a demonstrable chemical imbalance and all sorts of hormonal problems. BobbyJoe Long had to have sex many times during the day, and when no sexual partnerwas available he resorted to constant masturbation. Eventually, he became knownas the Want-Ad Rapist in southern Florida, a man responsible for the rape andmurder of many young women. Incidentally, Long served some time in the US Armybefore being discharged due to his peculiar personal habits and his violencetowards authority.When the mental disorder is not organic, it is not uncommon for the defense towonder if their client is the victim of multiple personalities, the DissociatedIdentity Disorder of the DSM-IV. In the case of a true “multiple,” theperpetrator of the crime is only one of the many personalities inhabiting thedefendant. The others may have no knowledge at all that a murder has beencommitted, much less that they are actually responsible. They have total amnesiaof the event, and only the personality who actually committed the murder willknow anything about it. This, of course, is exactly what the CIA wanted toachieve in the MK-ULTRA experiments.What many casual observers do not realize is that the “not guilty by reason ofinsanity” defense was, itself, originally a politically-motivated one. Like theDSM, and so much else in American science and psychiatry, it had its origins inpolitics.NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITYSome criminals in the United States and in other countries have managed toescape a harsh penalty—death or life imprisonment—due to this strange, evenprofound, concept. It is understood that moral responsibility and madness do notmix; therefore, the insane can only be hospitalized and not penalized. Readersmay be forgiven if they believe that “insanity” is a clinical term, a medicaldesignation. It is not. It is a legal term, and pretends to describe a state ofmind in which the accused is unaware of the difference between right and wrongand therefore incapable of making moral choices. There is even a special subsetof this condition, known as “temporary insanity,” in which the accused was inthis state of mind only during the time necessary to commit the crime and wasremarkably “sane” later. In this latter case, there is no need for eitherhospitalization or prison; the accused often walks.In Malaysia, a particularly ugly episode took place in 1969. It is known as the“May 13th Incident.” Without going into detail about Malaysian politics, sufficeit to say that the Malay racial hegemony over this multi-ethnic society wasbriefly challenged by a coalition of opposition parties chiefly composed ofethnic Chinese, who in Malaysia are generally either Christian or Buddhist.Rather than celebrate their victory indoors, out of sight of the restlessMalays, the Chinese supporters decided to stage an ad hoc parade through theirneighborhoods. The ethnic Malay (and religiously Muslim) politicians beganchurning up their followers, fanning the flames of fear, paranoia and hatred.What happened next is a matter for the history books, and has been told to me bymany persons who lived through it. Malay men—some of them in uniform, troopscalled out to quell the violence but who, instead, found themselves contributingto it—fell upon the Chinese with knives, both the long, machete-like parang andthe wavy-bladed kriss. Thus began hours and then three days of terror as ethnicMalays attacked ethnic Chinese in the streets and in some cases house to house.More than 6000 Malaysians—90% of them ethnic Chinese—were homeless in KualaLumpur by the end of this savagery, as their houses and shops were burned to theground; the official government statistic shows 178 dead although this figure ischallenged, many critics insisting the death toll was much higher.No one was ever brought to trial for this outrage. The reason? The Malays had“gone amok.” Amok is one of a handful of Malaysian words that is familiar toWestern audiences, being rather colorful and exciting. It is classed nowadays asa kind of momentary pathological state of blood lust. Like going “berserk”—amental state closely related to “amok”—the victim is possessed by an insensibleviolent spirit that can only be diminished over time. Since the Malays were amokat the time of the massacres, they could not be held accountable for theiractions. It was a group version of “not guilty by reason of insanity,” andtemporary insanity, at that; it was used to excuse an outbreak of politically,racially and religiously-motivated violence that is still remembered with horrortoday.The first case in which the verdict “not guilty by reason of insanity” waspronounced was not during a normal criminal trial, but in a notorious politicalassassination scandal. In 1843 the accused, a Mr. Daniel M’Naghton, had attackedBritish Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel. M’Naghton—a Scotsman and awood-turner—believed that the British Prime Minister was oppressing him. Knowingthe historic relationship between the people of Scotland and the people ofEngland, we must at least admit this was a theoretical possibility…. Be that asit may, Mr. M’Naghton believed that demonic forces were bent on his destructionand that they were personified by Sir Robert. He fired into a carriage carryingboth Sir Robert and his secretary. He mistook the secretary for Sir Robert(there being no television in those days and precious little photographiccoverage, so mistaken identity was perhaps more of a problem then than now) andthe secretary was wounded. The secretary walked to his home after the attack, sohe was not in mortal danger at that time. However, he had very poor medical careand died shortly thereafter from complications. Sir Robert managed to survivethe attack. The Queen was outraged, and was looking forward to the death penaltyfor such an outlandish and willful attack on her ministers, but Mr. M’Naghtonwas sent to the mental asylum known as Bedlam after having been judged not to bein the possession of all his faculties. The verdict? Not guilty by reason ofinsanity. This has since become known as the M’Naghton Rule, after the famouswould-be assassin. And, at the same time, the stereotype of the “crazed, loneassassin” was born.In the United States, we marginalize political assassins. They are either crazedloners—like Oswald, Hinckley, Chapman—or they are marginal people, such as thePalestinian Sirhan B. Sirhan. The established ruling class of a country cannotaccept a sane, reasonable assassin any more than they can accept the points ofview of their political or military enemies. Assassins are, by definition,insane or somehow racially or ethnically “other,” if not actually inferior. Theydo not come from the body politic. They are outsiders, and their outsider statusis what causes them to commit these crimes. We cannot afford to give theseassassins a soap box from which to convince us of the rightness of theiractions, because we may be swayed by a person who is so consumed by politicalconviction that he picks up a gun and rids the country of someone we may betempted to realize was a tyrant, and by extension therefore to question thepresent government altogether.So, we eventually accept a subliminal message every time an assassin is murderedor otherwise silenced before he or she can stand trial: to attack the king isinsanity.Oswald was a perfect case. A misfit, a loner, a defector who had spent time inthe Evil Empire (the Soviet Union, which had a practice of putting politicaldissidents in mental institutions, thus implying that the entire non-Communistworld was psychotic). He returned to America with his Russian wife and shortlythereafter found himself in Dallas, accused of killing the President. Well,anyone who desires to attack and kill the ruler of a kingdom is, by definition,unhappy. A misfit. Someone who feels he has already been marginalized by a statethat has no room for him; or by life itself, perhaps, which is so full ofcontradiction and hypocrisy that the only healthy state of mind may be insanity(vide psychiatrists Laing and Szacs, not to mention visionary literature fromGogol to Vonnegut and Tom Robbins). The assassination of a president may, fromthis point of view, be an act of clarity cloaked in ritual: an attempt to awakena sleeping population and, at the same time, to exact revenge for anunimaginable list of perceived crimes against humanity.Those who may be scandalized by the above few lines should realize that there isno truly objective state of sanity; that the psychological states so carefullyenumerated and tabulated in DSM-IV are so socially-loaded that it becomesobvious that the people who threaten us or our perceptions of life are the oneswe declare mentally ill. As in Euclidean geometry, there are certain—in thiscase, unspoken—axioms which we take to be self-evident, such as “parallel linesdo not meet” or “sociopaths feel no guilt.” In other words, what we havedetermined to be mental disorders are reflective of a certain point of viewabout society itself and not about the human mind or the human spirit, which is(or perhaps should be) much more than merely its social function.As mentioned, “insanity” is a legal term, not a medical one. It is a complexknot of moral, social, cultural and behavioral assumptions; much more so“temporary insanity.” But it can be an excuse for some of the most hideouscrimes ever committed. In our society, a man who kills and eats his enemy can bepretty safely considered “insane.” Serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer had a collectionof body parts in his apartment, and had built an altar there to display them,after the fashion of a Borneo headhunter. These actions revolted us, and withgood reason. But in the case of the Kwakiutl Cannibal Societies of North Americamentioned in Eliade, for instance, such behavior was central to the rites oftransformation and accepted by these societies as such. 8Talking to spirits mayprovide one’s peers with enough cause for certification to a mental hospital,but many primitive (and not so primitive) religious societies could not existwithout this essential component. And what of Catholics who believe that theyare eating the flesh and blood of a man who died on a cross two thousand yearsago … and that they are partaking of his divinity, his godhead by doing so … andthat he rose from the dead and ascended bodily into heaven?To be ‘crazy’ is a social concept; we use social restrictions and definitions inorder to distinguish mental disturbances…. It is not an absolute increase ininsanity that makes our asylums swell like monsters, it is the fact that wecannot stand abnormal people any more, so there are apparently very many morecrazy people than formerly.—C.G. Jung9One of our more famous serial killers of the past century—Earl Nelson, who wascharged with committing more than 20 murders over a period of only 18 months—wasthe subject of an intense debate over the insanity plea. He was charged inCanada in 1927, where some of his murders were committed, and subject to theBritish legal system which gave us the M’Naghton Rule. Insanity was invoked as apossible defence, but no one could agree on just what insanity (or sanity, forthat matter) meant. The two prevailing opinions were that “insanity” only meantnot knowing right from wrong; or that insanity was of a “cyclic” nature andknowing right from wrong one moment did not mean that one knew right from wrongat another moment (hence, “temporary insanity”). The issue, though is with“right” and “wrong.”Normally, it seems to be the case that these are interpreted in a purely legalway. In other words, insanity is an inability to understand whatsociety considers legal and illegal. I submit that in this rapidly shrinkingworld where it is possible for me to be in Beijing at 10 A.m. and in New YorkCity at 5 P.m. the same day due to jet travel and time zones, that not knowingwhat is legal in one country does not necessarily mean one is insane. Of course,many readers will object to this oversimplification; obviously, killing anotherhuman being is wrong anywhere, it is illegal everywhere. But that itself is anoversimplification and begs the question: what does it mean to be insane?Killing the enemy on the battlefield is considered legal and sane; killing thesame man a year later on a city street is illegal, and if the person who commitsthat crime does not realize this, then he is insane. Is it perhaps a problem ofsociety itself, that sanity is a moveable feast to be determined not by sciencebut by politicians? And that somehow the State has managed to arrogate to itselfthe power to determine the state of our souls?Clearly what is needed is a new approach to the concepts of sanity and insanity,as well as of blood lust, psychopathology and sociopathology, eventransformation, initiation, and spiritual growth. We are accustomed to believingthat spiritual growth is possible only by prayer and meditation and good works.Unfortunately, the record of the world’s religions will show that spiritualgrowth may be dependent on such horrors that we may be forgiven forrelinquishing advanced states of spirituality, exchanging the possibility for anew lawn mower, video game or the latest Britney Spears CD.Susan Sontag has given us a brilliant invitation to the world of the insane inher article on the French actor, playwright, author and director Antonin Artaud,“Approaching Artaud.” She discusses the provincial nature of the concept ofmadness and cites the outrage over the practice in the (now former) Soviet Unionof locking political dissidents up in insane asylums as “misplaced.” Furtheralong she states,In every society, the definitions of sanity and madness are arbitrary—are, inthe largest sense, political.10And further,Artaud … saw the insane as the heroes and martyrs of thought, stranded at thevantage point of extreme social (rather than merely psychological) alienation,volunteering for madness—as those who, through a superior conception of honor,prefer to go mad rather than forfeit a certain lucidity … (emphasis added)11Far from being the province of privileged academia, however, the study ofmadness and politics has a more pedestrian, more utilitarian purpose. Madness,you see, can be harnessed for political ends … if only we know how to induce it,how to maintain it, and how to get rid of it when necessary.In other words, we need to know how to become shamans.Artaud saw his own escalating mental disorder as just such a pathtowards illumination. While Sontag, above, interprets madness as a politicalterm in her discussion of Artaud, Artaud himself writes,My confinement was thus a religious matter, an affair of initiation and spells,of black magic and also most importantly of white magic, however unpopular thatmay be.12Without realizing what they were doing, this is precisely what the CIA attemptedto do from 1950 to 1973, and probably much more recently than that. This is alsowhat the military tried to do beginning roughly at the same time and continuingfor an unknown period, possibly even to the present day. The goal was to createthe perfect spy and the perfect assassin. The CIA claims they did not succeed ateither, at least not through their mind-control projects which fit under theumbrella of MK-ULTRA. However, when we examine the claims and counterclaims ofthose involved in debunking or supporting the “repressed memory syndrome”concept, we will see that someone, somewhere must be lying.The central concept behind the shamanistic initiation is the controlledderangement (reorganization?) of the human mind in such a way that it follows apredictable and useful pattern. I use the term “shamanistic” in the sense thatMircea Eliade and others have done: not to devalue the process or to attributeit only to “primitive” peoples or practices, but to refer to a natural andvibrant mystico-psychological process to accomplish what Jung might have termed“individuation,” but which (because of the paranormal abilities involved) mightbe closer to the presumed accomplishments of certain yogis. The descriptions ofthe torments the shamanic initiate had to undergo are close in feeling andcontent to those of an early Christian ascetic in the desert: everything from asensation of dying to complete dismemberment, decapitation, disembowelment, andworse. What is interesting is that this process is undergone voluntarily andwillfully, and this fact perhaps more than any other points out how relativelyeasy it must be for any of us to go “insane.” As Eliade writes,The strange behavior of future shamans has not failed to attract the attentionof scholars, and from the middle of the past century several attempts have beenmade to explain the phenomenon of shamanism as a mental disorder. But theproblem was wrongly put. For, on the one hand, it is not true that shamansalways are or always have to be neuropathics; on the other hand, those amongthem who had been ill became shamans precisely because they had succeeded inbecoming cured…. But if shamanism cannot simply be identified with apsychopathological phenomenon, it is nevertheless true that the shamanicvocation often implies a crisis so deep that it sometimes borders on madness….But I should like even now to stress the fact that the psychopathology of theshamanic vocation is not profane; it does not belong to ordinary symptomatology.(emphasis in original)13One is reminded of the case of August Strindberg, the Swedish playwright whodescended into madness for a period of years (fueled by occult and alchemicalresearches, by the way; he claimed to have made gold from base metals and therewas talk of proposing him for a Nobel Prize in science) and then came out on theother side, “sane” and productive. Others were not so fortunate: Nietzsche,Artaud, Van Gogh are easy examples. Eliade wrote the above passage in 1958, whenMK-ULTRA was in its heyday. It is tempting to wonder if the G-scaleexperimenters were familiar with his work, and if they understood what they weredoing to the psyches of the subjects—both willing and unwilling—at theirdisposal. The evidence we have suggests not. Both in the LSD testing that wasconducted on violent offenders—with huge doses administered over days andweeks—to the notorious “psychic driving” systems developed by Dr. Ewen Cameronin Montreal, it is obvious that there was no thought at all to what theprocedures were doing to the mental, emotional or (dare we say it?) spiritualstates of the unwitting test subjects. In fact, the CIA (and the military) wereopening a Pandora’s Box of demonic forces: the black box of consciousness. It isthe story of a modern day Dr. Frankenstein, or a laboratory full of Drs.Frankenstein, and the monsters they made: monsters that wander the streets ofour cities today. The complexity of the human experience is such that we canonly wonder what trigger mechanisms exist in the environment—on television, innewspapers and magazines, and even the Internet—that suggest modes of behaviorto these victims that are dangerous to themselves and to us. The records ofthese experiments were destroyed. The names and identification of the testsubjects have been erased. Those few who have come forward with bizarre memoriesof mind-control scenarios are laughed off the stage; they are so obviouslyderanged that no one can take them seriously. Or they are in prison forcommitting various crimes—some of them violent—so their testimony is ignored astainted. Isn’t it ironic? Don’t you think?POSSESSION, DEMONIACAL AND … OTHERThe question as to what extent the investigator, the exorcist, the therapist oreven the community generally contribute towards the creation of multiplepersonalities is by no means an easy one even to formulate satisfactorily …—T. K. Oesterreich, Possession, Demoniacal and Other14Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it isthe rule.—Friedrich Nietzsche15A reading of DSM-IV is an education, though not necessarily in the way intendedby the authors of this grimoire of mental illness. When we look at some of themore infamous disorders—such as sociopathy, psychopathy, dissociative identitydisorder (the old “multiple personality disorder”)—we see lists of symptoms thatcould easily apply to our most cherished Hollywood film characters … or theprotagonists of some of our most popular novels. Certainly one could make a casefor some of our revered political leaders being absolutely off their rockers,according to the list of symptoms given in the DSM. Nixon comes to mind when wediscuss the Paranoid type, for instance.The psychotic have always made good copy, and great movies. Hannibal Lecter, forexample, as the cannibalistic psychiatrist and serial murderer; the psychoticarch-enemies in the James Bond films; Anthony Perkins as Psycho, itself a filmbased on the real-life serial killer Ed Gein. Dracula has been identified bymany authors as a thinly-veiled sexual psychopath. And, of course, the madscientists of Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, and a host of othersspanning the history of cinema, and of Romantic-era literature generally,attempting to penetrate the mysteries of nature by taking the most awful risksand jeopardizing the very nature they are trying to understand. They go insane,eventually, either because of their blasphemous studies (most of which are beingundertaken quite blandly today in the world’s most modern laboratories) orbecause of the guilt that overcomes them when they realize what they have done.But the factor that most interests us in this case when speaking of mentalillness is the use made of mental disorders by shamans and the proverbial “witchdoctors,” who see this type of (sometimes voluntary) madness as a prerequisiteto spiritual understanding and occult power. And in order to understand that, incontext, we have to look at how thinking about mental illness in the ages beforepsychiatry was often confounded with thinking about demonic possession.Since we have access to the unconscious only through pathological material, ourefforts arouse the resistance of the conscious, awake individual. Yet all thisis inconsequential compared with the one great fact which [Freud] did notmention: that it is of the essence of his simple and ingenious approach to makesomething unconscious comprehensible by grasping it in illness and kindredstates. Only through pathological material could sure knowledge be won …—Lou-Andreas Salome, Freud Journal, Oct 26, 1912According to Oesterreich, in his landmark and definitive study Possession,Demoniacal and Other, the phenomenon of possession is a central element toreligious faith, because it seems to offer concrete proof of an afterlife, andof the existence of spiritual forces. Whether the possession is by a demon, ananimal spirit, or a divine being, the displacement of a human’s personality bythe personality of an Other is considered by most to be proof positive of theexistence of spiritual forces. This type of phenomenon is very hard todiscredit, because in so-called “actual” cases of possession, the newpersonality is so alien to the original that the only explanation that comes tomind is that the old personality has been evicted, so to speak, from theorganism and a wholly new—i.e., “other”—personality has taken its place. Thisother personality must therefore be a spirit that is lacking a physical body,and therefore there must exist spirits in addition to whatever animates ourbodies while we are alive.Demonic possession became a household phrase in the 1970s with the publicationof the novel The Exorcist, written by William Peter Blatty, a Hollywoodscreenwriter. As is well-known by now, the novel was based on an actual case ofpossession that took place in a small town in Maryland while Blatty was astudent at Georgetown University. What is not so well-known is that Blattyhimself had been an intelligence officer, specializing in psychological warfare,in the years before writing his famous novel. It was Blatty who also wrote thescreenplay for a film that came to be known as The Ninth Configuration (1980)after his original novel Twinkle, Twinkle Killer Kane, a book and film that comeas close to describing the arcane world of military psychiatry as any (imagineCatch-22 meets The Manchurian Candidate). It was Blatty who took us through thestrange and horrifying world of possession and gave it a scientific-soundingname—briefly—before taking it away again: somnambulaform possession. Not exactlya genuine scientific term, it can be found in Oesterreich’s work, which was asource for Blatty when it came to organizing the material around a scientificviewpoint, but it will not be found in DSM-III or -IV. Unfortunately, in thenovel, the scientists cannot help the possessed girl later played by LindaBlair, and priests—exorcists—are called in to perform the rituals that willdrive out the demon and save the child.There are many interesting points of contact between The Exorcist and Stoker’sDracula, and this is probably not the place to go into them. One could suggestwondering why the demon is invisible in The Exorcist even though we have a younggirl in mortal danger being rescued by an older expert in occult phenomena whois also a scientist; in Dracula, the demon—this time in the form of CountDracula, the vampire itself—is very much visible. Does Regan’s demon representan element in ourselves—psychological or cultural—that we do not wish to face,or admit?No matter. What is interesting is that the novel, and then the film, sparked anearly global interest in demonic possession and kept movie theaters—andchurches—filled for some time to come.Until the devil we knew was replaced by a devil we didn’t know.We have become accustomed by now to accounts of Multiple Personality Disorder(MPD), what is now also known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Theformer designation implied the existence of more than one personality in asingle human being; the new designation implies a breaking down of the unitarypersonality into a group of fragmentary personalities. Regardless of themechanism behind the phenomenon, what we have in this type of condition is theinvasion of a human’s consciousness by an alien personality. Now, thispersonality may be a fragment of the original, or it may be a kind of “split”from the original now functioning independently of the original. In any case, itcould appear to be demonic to the lay observer and the person could seem to besuffering from an involuntary possession.The new personality or personalities often has information that the originalpersonality does not; is able to speak in different accents or even in differentlanguages and even to be conscious of much biographical information of which theoriginal was not. In the case of MPD or Dissociative Identity Disorder, this mayonly be a temporary or fluctuating situation; i.e., the new personality is incontrol for a short period of time and then retreats into the background,allowing the original personality—or another personality—to regain control. Itis typical of these cases that the original personality has no memory of whattranspired when the “alter” was in control.This condition would have been of utmost interest to the mind-controlresearchers for all that was implied in terms of memory and control. If thescientists could create an alter personality in a given subject, for instance,they could create a robot. This would be true only if the scientists were ableto control the alter themselves. This would probably be difficult to do, sincethe evidence at the moment suggests that the alter is a defense mechanism of theoriginal personality, to protect it against a traumatic episode (child abuse,for instance, being the most common and most documented cause). Also, there is adanger that the alter—possessed of a perfect memory—would not be the idealmechanism for creating spies and assassins.Yet, the basic functions of multiple personality disorder would have attractedthe scientists and they would have sought ways in which they could create and/ormanipulate multiples. Fortunately for them, there is a large literature onvoluntary possession. As documented by Oesterreich and in other places, thisexperience is worldwide, and the author has been privileged to witness thisphenomenon firsthand in various countries, notably in Haiti, in the UnitedStates, and in parts of Asia.What is perhaps not so widely known to the general public is the fact that thevery concept of multiple personality disorder (and its recent incarnation asdissociative identity disorder) has led to a schism among psychiatricprofessionals. There are those who deny that the disorder is genuine, and accuseeither the psychiatrists of fraud or gullibility, or the patients ofmalingering. There are those—also professionals in psychology and psychiatry—onthe far opposite side of the spectrum who feel that MPD and DID are proof of theexistence of an afterlife, of reincarnation, and the like. There is even onepsychiatrist who has alleged that a woman suffering from multiple personalitieswas a witch and had cursed him, causing his ulcer to flare up.The division between those who “believe” in MPD/DID and those who do not seemsto be a function of whether the therapist had ever confronted such a case. Thosewho have treated this disorder claim that there is no way their patients couldpretend to have multiple personalities, that the personality changes are sodefined, so extreme, as to be beyond the capabilities of all but the mostaccomplished, Oscar-winning actor. In addition, there is the problem that someof these “alter” personalities may have powers and abilities—such as in foreignlanguages, or certain of the sciences—that the other personalities do not have,and which the “core personality” has never studied or learned. There is also thequestion of amnesia, with some of the personalities remembering events in theperson’s life and others not—which has led to a controversy over legalresponsibility in the case where a person suffering from MPD/DID has committed acrime and only one of the personalities is aware of this.Those who snicker at the claims of MPD/DID do so based largely on thephilosophical platform that each person has only one personality, i.e., thatthere is only one personality allowed per body. In other words, the argumentruns (as it does for most subjects considered even remotely “paranormal”) fromthe conclusion backward to the proof. The assumption is that no twopersonalities can inhabit the same consciousness, much less fifteen or twenty ormore in some documented cases of MPD/DID. And the fact that spiritual possessionoccurs in so many “primitive” cultures does actually provide an argument againstthe validity of MPD/DID, since the medical professionals point to what theyinterpret as the natural credulity and superstition of these cultures as beingthe breeding ground for this particular form of “hysteria.” If the condition canbe acquired voluntarily, they argue, then it is obviously not a uniquepsychological disorder but a simple case of delusion, paranoia, or hysteria.But, if the condition can be acquired, then the mind-control researchers ofMK-ULTRA had something to work with.Those who submit to the voluntary form of possession are doing so in order tocontact the world beyond life; to speak with spirits; to effect material changesin this world by utilizing supernatural “connections.” Voluntary possession—suchas that made famous by the practitioners of voudoun (or “voodoo,” as it isusually spelled) seems to our eyes a kind of sorcery. The possession is of acontrolled nature: there is a limited hierarchy of spiritual forces that canpossess the devotee, and each member of this hierarchy can be recognized bycertain visible signs. For instance, someone possessed by Baron Samedi will beseen to smoke cigars, drink rum, walk with a limp, and comport him- (orher-)self in an old-worldly, gentlemanly way. Erzulie, the Goddess of Love, isobvious by her behavior and her love of flowers, etc. It is to be noted thatthese cases of possession only occur within the rigidly controlled andstructured environment of the ritual itself. That being said, another phenomenondoes take place—again, witnessed by the author, both in Haiti and in New YorkCity’s borough of Queens—in which a bystander, heretofore unexposed to this typeof experience, is himself or herself possessed by one of the Haitian gods, orloa. This “contagious” aspect of possession is remarked upon by Oesterreich, andperhaps the most famous example in literature is that reported by Aldous Huxleyin The Devils of Loudon, in which nuns, priests and the exorcists themselvesbecame possessed by an epidemic of demonic forces. Actually, in the case of thevoudoun rituals, the dynamics of the rituals themselves are catalysts and canconceivably act upon anyone, even uptight middle-aged white executives fromSilicon Valley. The timbre and rhythm of the drums, for instance, and the dark,candle-lit peristyle with the waving of flags, the chanting, the sacrifice ofanimals, etc. all contribute to a kind of psychodrama in which this authorbelieves subtle levels of consciousness are triggered, possibly due to theeffect of some of these elements on the autonomic nervous system (the drumbeats, for instance, causing the drummers to gain control over the pulse rate ofthe listeners and slow it down or speed it up as the ritual demands).It would be the contagious form of possession that would crystallize thisphenomenon for the men of MK-ULTRA. A contagious psychological condition isanalogous to a contagious biological agent, and both were under examination andtrial by the CIA and the military in the years after World War II. For, if welook at the scientific reactions to cases of possession and reincarnation (inwhich a living person suddenly “remembers” another life and can speak in aforeign tongue, etc.) and take the time to see these cases as the mind-controlexperimenters would, we notice a glaring admission which is not framed as such.In these cases—especially when the subject speaks in a foreign tongue— we aretold by the psychiatrists and the scientists that this is not evidence of aspiritual agency; rather, the subjects had been exposed to this material at somepoint in their childhood and subconsciously recorded it before forgetting allabout it. While that explanation may satisfy the need of a rationalist approachto paranormal phenomena, it is a double-edged sword, because it admits thatthese unconscious powers exist … with the implication that they could beharnessed in service to the government, or to some faction thereof. None of thephenomena associated with either possession or “reincarnation”-type personalitychanges are accepted as spiritual or metaphysical evidence; the same phenomena,however, have to be explained and categorized in some way that does notinvalidate the modern scientific model. When the scientists—and Oesterreichincluded—came to the conclusion that this type of phenomenon had a basis inscientific reality they unwittingly opened the door to the men of MK-ULTRA. Inboth cases of involuntary and voluntary possession, memory is tapped in itsdeepest layers and everyday consciousness is suspended while this powerful newentity controls the subject, sometimes even wiping the memory of the subjects sothat they have no recollection of what they were doing while “under theinfluence.” In cases of voluntary possession, the condition is easilyreversible; even in cases of involuntary possession, exorcism sometimes works,rendering the condition equally reversible. And in the case of multiple—ordissociative—personality disorder, it is possible to exert some control over themanifestation of the alters, but only at considerable expense of time and money,which would not be an attractive proposition to the government scientists who,after all, had a Cold War to win.Therefore, it would be only a matter of time before the mind-control researchersbegan to scour the records of occultists, magicians, witches, voodoo priests andSiberian shamans to isolate the techniques that were used since time immemorialto supplant a person’s normal, comfortable, everyday consciousness and replaceit with a powerful, all-knowing (and sometime violent, and always deceptive)alter personality; and to use those alters to uncover the action of deep memory,for MK-ULTRA was, at its core, an assault on the Land of Memory: the creation ofnew, false memories and the eradication of old, dangerous ones.The techniques included drugs, various types of hypnosis including auto-hypnosis(as pioneered by CIA psychiatrist George Estabrooks, among others, who sawoccult phenomena as evidence of MPD), and even more extreme measures such asthose developed by Dr. Ewen Cameron in Montreal, procedures known as “psychicdriving,” which involved drastic sensory deprivation sessions in an effort towipe the consciousness clean and record a new consciousness over the old, muchthe same way we record over a used cassette tape or floppy disk file. But evenmore distressing and bordering on the incredible are reports that are startingto surface of a systematic effort to create perfect assassins and espionageagents from the ground up … using children.One of the salient features of multiple personality disorder is that its majorpredisposing factor is childhood trauma, particularly physical and sexual abuse.What this told the researchers was that the human child was an eminentlymalleable subject, and with the right sort of conditioning a child could beturned into virtually anything the researchers could come up with. We, asAmericans, cannot give credence to these stories because we do not believe thatsuch activities ever took place within our shores. And we may be right. The bulkof the evidence that is coming to light is that the worst of these excesses tookplace under CIA aegis and completely within the parameters of the CIA charter:i.e., the CIA is forbidden to conduct its intelligence gathering activities inthe United States; that is properly the jurisdiction of the FBI. By runningoperations of questionable morality in foreign countries, the CIA was able toavoid a great deal of oversight. It was also able to keep the operations “legal”in the sense that they did not take place in the United States, but abroad.Further, by using a number of cover or front organizations it was able toutilize that wonderful elocution, “plausible deniability.”That children are routinely used and abused all over the world outside theUnited States is beyond any reasonable doubt. Child prostitution has become aplague, especially in Southeast Asia, where the prepubescent prostitutes (maleand female) of Thailand, the Philippines and now Cambodia, Burma, Vietnam andother countries are infamous. This prostitution takes place with the tacitapproval—and sometimes the insistence and cooperation—of local governmentagencies, such as the military in Burma. The murder of orphans and “streetArabs” in the city streets of Central and South American countries is a tragedyof epic proportions, even as many of these murders were—and are—carried out bymembers of the military and police forces of those countries. As if that wasn’tenough, children are being increasingly recruited into army organizations inAfrica and Asia. It has become a staple of television news to see children underthe age of twelve holding Kalashnikovs and taking fire from the treeline. Thishas become such a global problem that the United Nations has considered a treatythat would forbid the recruitment of any child under the age of eighteen. (Oddlyenough, one of the main opponents of such an agreement has been the UnitedStates, which wants the option of bringing seventeen-year-olds into the Army.)The Chinese organized crime clans—known as the Triads or sometimes theTongs—routinely use children as assassins, as they cannot be tried as adults inmany American states, even for murder. That horrendous and appalling medicalexperimentation was carried out on children in Nazi Germany and theNazi-occupied territories within the living memory of many adults is alsowithout question. Yet, somehow, we tend to disbelieve that all of this could betaking place today and in our own country or under the supervision of ourgovernment agencies, (even though we imported many Nazi medical scientists aspart of Operation Paperclip and other operations after World War II). This typeof blindness could only exist in a culture where we have begun to believe ourown propaganda, since it is so much more attractive than the awful, theheartbreaking, truth.As stories surface concerning something called Operation Monarch, and as thesestories are blasted by critics because of the outlandish claims being made—highgovernment officials sexually abusing the young children of military families incontrolled settings; young children being programmed as assassins; etc.;etc.—there appears substantiating evidence of an even more troublesome (becauseperfectly believable) nature. Although there are many documented cases ofchildren being trained as fanatic soldiers and killers—especially in Asia, insome celebrated cases in the Golden Triangle, and in Africa—we choose to believethat this is a bizarre aberration. Yet, as we investigate the evidence in thefollowing pages, we will walk into the center of a nightmare of unbelievableproportions because this single, documented, American case contains withinitself all the elements that we—as serious researchers, journalists andhistorians—have been taught to treat with skepticism and condescension. We willuncover an organization that was trolling for child subjects (victims) all overthe globe; that used these children in strange rituals involving animalsacrifice; that sent these children to secret schools abroad; and that—when onthe verge of discovery and exposure—was finally protected by the CIA.FINDERS, KEEPERS?On February 5, 1987 the US Customs Service received a phone call from SergeantJoAnn VanMeter of the Juvenile Division of the Tallahassee Police Department inFlorida. Six very young children—aged 2 to 7 years— had been found in theapparent custody of two well-dressed men. The children were scampering in a parkin Tallahassee, but they appeared to be ill-fed, ill-clothed—some not wearingunderwear—and filthy. An anonymous tip to the Tallahassee PD was enough for thepolice to undertake a routine investigation, questioning the adults and thechildren. When the adults proved to be evasive, and their van—a 1980 blue Dodgewith Virginia license plates—which was as filthy and foul-smelling as thechildren, was discovered to be full of books, maps and a single mattress, thepolice had enough to charge the two men with child abuse.One of the two men now in custody gave the police a business card witha statement on one side saying that the “bearer knew his constitutionalrights to remain silent and that he intended to do so.” The children could notname the two men either. In fact, they didn’t know the “function and purposeof telephones, televisions and toilets” and further stated that “they were notallowed to live indoors and were only given food as a reward.”They further said that they were on their way to Mexico to go to a school forsmart kids. Tallahassee PD phoned the Customs Service to see if they had anyinformation on the adults, the kids, or the alleged school in Mexico and todetermine whether or not there were grounds for holding the men on a federalcharge. The Tallahassee police suspected that the children were being used in achild pornography ring, and the Customs Service has a database devoted tocollecting information on international child pornography operations. The factthat Mexico was stated as their destination aroused the suspicions of both TPDand the Customs Service even further; Mexico is a haven for every type ofpornography production, including child pornography—still photos and filmsincluding child prostitution—as well as for purported “snuff film ” factoriessouth of the Rio Grande.Customs said they would investigate the links of the men to an address in theD.C. area, discovered through a check of the license plate on the van. And thisis where it all came together … and then exploded apart.The Tallahassee Police Department and the Customs Service coordinated theirefforts with the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), as thevan was traced to an address in the District and other identification was foundin the van leading the detectives to two addresses in Washington. A searchwarrant was obtained, and a Detective Bradley of the Washington MPD informed theCustoms agents that an informer reported that a cult known as the Finders wasoperating out of those addresses, and that the Finders were involved in bloodsacrifice, sex orgies involving children, etc. The two men in custody weredetermined to be known members of the Finders, and several of the children wereidentified as “belonging” to the cult.By the time the warrant was served, there were no children at the cultheadquarters at 3918/20 W. Street, NW, but a large quantity of children’sclothing was found, including diapers and other clothing, though nothing forchildren past pre-school age. The worse was yet to come, however.In another part of the building, filled with computers and files, the detectivesfound detailed instructions for “obtaining children for unspecified purposes.” Iwill let Special Agent, US Customs Service, Ramon J. Martinez continue in hisown words:“The instructions included the impregnation of female members of the communityknown as the Finders, purchasing children, trading, and kidnapping. There weretelex messages using MCI account numbers between a computer terminal believed tobe located in the same room, and others located across the country and inforeign locations. One such telex specifically ordered the purchase of twochildren in Hong Kong to be arranged through a contact in the Chinese Embassythere.… Other documents identified interests in high-tech transfers to theUnited Kingdom, numerous properties under the control of the Finders, a keeninterest in terrorism, explosives, and the evasion of law enforcement.”The next day, Friday February 6, 1987, Martinez and Bradley then proceeded tothe Finders’ warehouse at 1307 4th Street, NE. If anything, the take in thewarehouse was more horrifying than what was discovered at cult headquarters.Again, to quote Special Agent Martinez:“I was able to observe numerous documents which described explicit sexualconduct between the members of the community known as Finders. I also saw alarge collection of photographs of unidentified persons. Some of the photographswere nudes, believed to be of members of the Finders. There were numerous photosof children, some nude, at least one of which was a photo of a child “ondisplay” and appearing to accent the child’s genitals. I was only able toexamine a very small amount of the photos at this time. However, one of theofficers presented me with a photo album for my review. The album contained aseries of photos of adults and children dressed in white sheets participating ina “blood ritual.” The ritual centered around the execution of at least twogoats. The photos portrayed the execution, disembowelment, skinning anddismemberment of the goats at the hands of the children. This included theremoval of the testes of a male goat, the discovery of a female goat’s “womb”and the “baby goats” inside the womb, and the presentation of a goat’s head toone of the children.”There can be no doubt, therefore, that what was discovered in the photographssatisfies the criteria for a “satanic” cult involving blood sacrifice andchildren. The graphic nature of the photographs emphasizes still further that nomere ritual sacrifice of the goats was intended, but a complete disembowelmentand dismembering, including a concentration on the sexual organs of the animals.A ritual sacrifice would have been bad enough; hideous, even, for children to beforced to take part. But to carry the bloody ritual to its specific conclusionof the mutilation of the bodies seems to be an attempt to either traumatize thechildren to an extent that dissociative identity disorder would be a likelyoutcome, or to anesthetize the children against the performance of bloody andbarbaric acts. The author can think of no other purpose that would be served.However, in fairness to the reader it should be mentioned that the author hasspent many years in Asia and in countries and regions where Islam and Hinduismare popular religions. In both these world religions, animal sacrifice is anaccepted part of ritual practice and male children of a certain age can be seenparticipating in or observing these rituals. And, during a Shi’ite festivalwhich commemorates the martyrdom of a Muslim saint, it is not uncommon to seefathers cutting the heads of their own children with swords or machetes to theextent that the children are screaming and covered in blood, as a sign of theirgrief over the death of Ali.I submit, however, that the practice of animal sacrifice in a community wherethere is general support for this practice within the context of an acceptedreligion has a different effect on a child’s understanding than the barbaricbutchering and mutilation of an animal in secret, in a country, a city and amongpeople for whom the closest they would normally come to animal sacrifice is themeat counter at their local supermarket. (And isn’t this the point, that“insanity” is a social concept, dependent on the mores of the society in whichone finds oneself?)The discoveries at the Finders warehouse were not over, however.“Further inspection of the premises disclosed numerous files relating toactivities of the organization in different parts of the world. Locations Iobserved are as follows: London, Germany, the Bahamas, Japan, Hong Kong,Malaysia, Africa, Costa Rica, and “Europe”…There was one file entitled “PentagonBreak-In,” and others referring to members operating in foreign countries.”What the agents faced was a mountain of evidence pointing to an internationaltrade in children and the use of children in horrible rituals which werephotographed for posterity. They found passports and other travel documents,details for trafficking in foreign currency and in high technology transfer toforeign countries. In effect, they had a gold mine and what could have been themost scandalous, most astonishing case in the history of modern jurisprudencebecause it has it all: child abuse, slavery, rituals, sex, money, and power. Butthe Finders case had still another aspect, one which the Customs agents couldnot have predicted.Martinez arrived at MPD to discuss the case with Detective Bradley, aspre-arranged. Bradley was unavailable. Instead, Martinez was asked to speak toan unidentified third party who could only speak “off the record.”And what he told Martinez was the last straw.All passport data had been turned over to the State Department, who told MPDthat the passports and the travel represented by the passports was within thelaw,” even though this involved “travel to Moscow, North Korea, and NorthVietnam from the late 1950s to mid 1970s.” Further, Martinez was told that “theinvestigation into the activity of the Finders had become a CIA internal matter.The MPD report has been classified SECRET and was not available for review.”A cult. Kidnapped children. Sexual abuse. Blood sacrifice. Mutilation.A world-wide organization. Covered up by the CIA. This sounds like a bad Ludlumnovel, but it was reality. In Washington, D.C. In 1987.In Unholy Alliance, I wrote extensively of another such cult, this one based inChile. Called Colonia Dignidad, it was run by a former World War II Luftwaffeofficer and defrocked (?) Baptist minister, and was involved in the traffickingof children from various countries, torture of political prisoners, and otherNazi pastimes. It was covered up by the Pinochet government and by its secretservice, the dreaded DINA. It was finally uncovered, raided several times, andits back broken. We think. Its owner and founder was apprehended and is nowawaiting trial as you read this.There is a lot of hysteria on the subject of “satanic cult survivor syndrome,”and much of the skepticism which greets these claims is well deserved. However,when confronted with a real-life children-sex-sacrifice-CIA cult what are we tobelieve? How do we answer the skeptics who insist that it’s a figment ofoveractive imaginations and underactive libidos? How do we answer the believerswho accept that there is a world-wide satanic conspiracy involving stolenchildren and cult members impregnated to give birth to sacrificial babies? TheFinders case has robbed us of the luxury of disbelief. And the CIA has robbed usof the answers we need to put the Finders in some sort of perspective, somemethod in which to handle this bizarre information in a way more suitable to ourearly 21st century sensibilities.One set of sinister questions remains, and has yet to be answered: not in theCustoms documents, not in any of the news reports. The answer may be buriedBobby in the MPD files marked SECRET (if they still exist at all) or in theCIA’s own files on the matter.What did the Finders do with the children after they”found” them? Where did theygo? Where was the school in Mexico? What did they do there? How many more werethere?And … where are they now and what are they doing? And to whom?Item: When Lee Harvey Oswald made his famous trip by bus to Mexico City in 1963,ostensibly to obtain a visa for Cuba, he sat next to an Englishman by the nameof John Howard Bowen, alias Albert Osborne. Bowen was an “itinerant preacher” ofthe Baptist persuasion, an elderly gentleman who traveled frequently to Mexico,according to Warren Commission exhibits (mostly FBI interrogation reports). Whenconfronted by the FBI, Bowen claimed he had borrowed the identity of AlbertOsborne, an Englishman who was also an itinerant Baptist preacher, wheninvestigated by the Mexican authorities at a time when he couldn’t find his ownidentification. He claimed that Osborne was an Englishman but that he, Bowen,was born in the United States. Unfortunately, the other passengers on thatfabled bus trip to Mexico City identified Bowen as an Englishman, and eventuallythe FBI concluded that Bowen and Osborne were one and the same.16 What isinteresting is the fact that Bowen-Osborne was a devoted Nazi both before andduring World War II, opposing America’s entry into the war, and ran a fascistcamp for boys in rural Tennessee until it was closed down in 1942.17At the time of the Kennedy Assassination in 1963, there were persistent rumorsthat Bowen-Osborne was running a school for assassins in Mexico, somewhere inPueblo, under the guise of a “missionary effort.” (When Bowen was firstinterrogated by the FBI, he claimed that he had been ordained a minister in 1914by the Plymouth Brethren in Trenton, New Jersey. The Plymouth Brethren is thesect to which Aleister Crowley’s parents belonged and from whom he “discovered”his true identity as the Great Beast 666.) Even the Warren Commission could notaccept the testimony of Bowen-Osborne, and they were easy marks. Gradually,stories of Bowen’s connections to American paramilitary organizations began tocirculate, including his involvement with the Minutemen. It was Fred Crisman’spurported relationship to the same paramilitary group that led to hisinterrogation by Jim Garrison in 1968.A Mexican school for assassination. The recruitment of young boys. Nazis. TheChristian Right. 1963.Item: Los Angeles, May 13, 1964. Less than six months after the Kennedyassassination. The 19th Annual Convention and Scientific Program of the Societyof Biological Psychiatry takes place. During the convention, it is reported that450 children, aged 4 to 15, at Creedmore State Hospital have been subjected to amassive program of hallucinogen experimentation, incorporating everything fromLSD to psilocybin to various other drugs. Doses are 150 mcg of LSD or 20 mg ofpsilocybin, daily, “for periods up to several months.” The children ranged fromautistic to “slightly schizophrenic” (whatever that means).WHOEVER FIGHTS MONSTERSWhoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not becomea monster. And when you look long into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you.—Friedrich Nietzsche[../Images/00011.jpg]It wasn’t until the mid-1970s that the term “serial killer” became the householdword it is today. Coined by FBI profiler Robert K. Ressler, it has taken on alife of its own. Often, the term is applied when it shouldn’t be, but we stillunderstand the basic concept: a repeat murderer who doesn’t kill for money orfor revenge or some other, commonly understood, motive but to satisfy a deepneed, a “lust to kill.” Serial killers come in two basic flavors, organized anddisorganized, but there are killers who partake of both characteristics and aretherefore sometimes more difficult to capture. Typically, a serial killer is ayoung white male, although there have been female serial killers and serialkillers of other races.(As I write these lines, Pakistan has just convicted a serial killer in theircountry. Their mode of justice? They will strangle him in front of the parentswhose children he himself had strangled to death, and then they will destroy hisbody with acid, again as he did to his victims.) But in the United States, whichhas become a kind of serial killer capital of the world, we have hundreds on thestreets at any given time and they are all mostly young white males.Many theories have been advanced to explain their strange behavior: the ritualsof killing, the cycles or periods, the trolling for victims, the fugue statebefore the kill and its aftermath, the sometimes gruesome souvenirs, thetaunting of police officers, etc. Psychoanalysis of some of our most famous 20thcentury cases reveals a depressing similarity among these “monsters”: horriblechildhoods, in some cases horrible beyond description; physical abuse, includingsevere head traumas and sexual abuse; perhaps one absentee parent. In fact, manyof these events are also characteristic of cases of dissociative identitydisorder (“multiple personalities”), so it should come as no surprise that theinsanity defense is often invoked for crimes committed by serial killers. Wewant to classify these people as something other than human, and in the lasthundred years or so the easiest, most “politically correct” way to do this hasbeen to use insanity as an excuse.But when we examine the individual cases we see that there is a social componentto the genesis of their mental condition. It seems that serial killers are notborn, they are made: in much the same way dissociative identity disorder is acreature of a hideous childhood and a violent upbringing. That presents aproblem for the death penalty lobby, because if the development of a personalityinto a serial killer is not a matter of choice (such as, for instance, dealingdrugs, etc.) then how can we punish the offender? If the shrinks are correct,then the killers have no conscious control over their actions. And it wouldcertainly seem to be the case, since the pattern is so well-known by now: theearly days of torturing small animals, sexual abuse of children or othervulnerable persons, the first kill which leads inevitably to the second, andthen the cycle increasing in intensity with the time period between eachsuccessive kill growing shorter and shorter until it seems that the killer willexplode in a homicidal frenzy. It has all the hallmarks of a psychologicalsyndrome, a psychopathology that demands treatment instead of punishment.But we have no way to “treat” a serial killer; by the time he has begun killinghe is usually too far gone to be treated. The best we can do is jail him,hospitalize him, or execute him. There is no other alternative; he certainly cannever be returned to society. And we can’t treat a serial killer because—evenwith all the understanding of how a serial killer is “made” in childhood—we feelhe is beyond salvage. He is too cunning for psychoanalysis, a cunning born ofsurvival in the “straight” world. He will say what the analyst wants him to say;he will appear ingratiating, accommodating, perhaps feigning sanity or insanityas the situation warrants, playing with his captors. Intelligence is one of thecharacteristics of the serial killer: usually above-average and sometimes evengenius-level intelligence, particularly in the case of the so-called “organized”killer. We have the modern-day icon of Hannibal Lecter as a model for this typeof highly intelligent, highly organized killer. It also reinforces an attitudeAmericans have towards the intelligent, that they are somehow “different” fromthe rest of us. It makes us feel better to see the intelligent as psychotic,or—as pointed out in Unholy Alliance—Nazis. At the same time, serial killers areobsessed with their dark yearnings. They have somehow equated sexualgratification with violence and murder, arousal with the blood and pain and fearof their victims. And we abhor the crime and the criminal especially because ofthe sexual aspect of this disorder, an aspect that can include necrophilia andworse.There is another aspect of this phenomenon, however, that concerns us moreclosely because it may hold a clue not only to the serial killer himself but tothe human condition in general. A careful examination of many of the more famouscases in the last one hundred years will reveal that many of these killers had areligious or occult obsession that ran parallel to their lust-murder obsession.This combination has lent some of these killers a superior attitude towardstheir captors, an air of smugness and complacency, as if they were in possessionof secret knowledge. Certainly, a man who has killed dozens of victims in citiesacross the country, constantly evading capture and baffling law enforcement,probably feels a little superior to his captors. More importantly, the actualact of murder itself—especially in this case, in taking the life of anotherhuman being without motive but by deeds of unspeakable violence—must cause astrange disorientation in the murderer, a kind of twilight state in whichreality is distorted. A killer is different from the rest of us: he hasperformed an action that is the ultimate in what society considers heinous. Aserial killer’s experience is even more bizarre, more outlandish. He kills astring of people for no socially-identifiable purpose. He takes their liveshimself, one after the other, repeatedly, in a complex ritual that has meaningonly for him. He has stared into the eyes of his victims as they expire. In manycases, he defiles their bodies, or dismembers them, keeping parts as souvenirs;Jeffrey Dahmer and Edmund Kemper come readily to mind.We have not had these experiences. We know nothing of this. We can read thewords, or hear them spoken, but we cannot imagine the sensations; we cannot putourselves in the killer’s place, although we can probably identify with thehorror of the victims. There is nothing in our experience, generally, to equatewith a lust killing. Most of us have never killed a human being under anycircumstances, including war. We certainly have no psychological analog to alust killing, unless it is lust—sexual desire and arousal—itself. Those of uswho feel guilty about our own sexual desires may believe they can understand tosome extent the sexual component of the serial killer’s strange actions. Thinkagain. DSM-IV has no category for this. Thus, the superior (even smug) attitudeof the serial killer towards the rest of us. He has walked with demons. He hasdefiled himself in the most extreme manner possible for a human being. He hasseen deeply into the abyss. The problem is, he is still there and cannot getout.If the CIA in their desperate zeal to combat a perceived brainwashing threatfrom the Chinese or Russians had attempted to open the black box ofconsciousness in order to create the perfect assassin—a man or woman who wouldkill as programmed and forget why (which could be a clinical description of theserial killer’s functions as well)—then they were also experimenting with thesame mechanism that creates serial killers … and shamans. The horrifying visionsof the shaman-in-training are nearly identical, if not exactly identical, tothose that obsess the serial killer: the dismemberments, the excruciating pain,the visions, the voices in the head, the blood lust. It is, as Eliade pointsout, tantamount to psychopathology. In the case of the shaman, he is eventuallycured of this disorder even though it may last for a long time. His societyunderstands what is going on, and they have mechanisms for dealing with it; theshaman will be a valuable addition to their society after the cure, because thenhe will be able to communicate with the spirit world, to intercede for hisneighbors and to foretell the future. The crucial difference between a shamanand a serial killer may be that the latter has externalized the psychologicalprocess. What for a shaman—as well as for the artist, the poet, the musician—isan internal nightmare of hallucinogenic proportions becomes, in the hands of theserial killer, a dreadful reality. In another example, Christianity teaches thatJesus was beaten, and crucified, and then had his side pierced with a spear. Theterrible tortures (analogous to the tortures of the shaman) happened to him; hedid not visit them upon his fellow human beings. But a serial killer enactsthese same crimes, which first began as childhood or adolescent fantasies, uponinnocent victims, one after the other, until he is stopped.Is a serial killer a shaman who has not made it back?In 1998, the following was reported in the Indonesian press as well as by theAgence France Presse: An Indonesian practitioner of black magic—a type ofsorcerer called a dukun—one Ahmad Suraji, was sentenced to death for the murderof forty-two women. He claimed that his father came to him in a dream and toldhim if he killed seventy women and drank their saliva, his magic powers would beincreased and he would—paradoxically—become a better healer. The bodies of allforty-two women were found in a sugar cane field, most of whom had beenstrangled by the man they came to for help with love and money problems. In aseparate trial, one of Suraji’s three wives was named as an accomplice.Obviously, there is a logical problem with a shaman who has to kill seventypeople in order to become a better healer! But in any event, we are faced withthis instance of a serial killer who is a shaman, albeit a poor one. SoutheastAsia is still full of examples of shamans, dukuns, bomohs, and other types ofsorcerers who resort to murder in order to enhance their occult abilities. Thereare many examples in Indonesia, as well as in Malaysia, Thailand and thePhilippines. While these shamans may be nominal Muslims, Buddhists orChristians, they are really animists at heart: pagan occultists for whom theirreligious affiliations are more of a vehicle for reaching more people in theirrole as healers or witches. Serial murder is not unknown; a case in Malaysia ofsorcerers who killed a number of foreigners in an attempt to use their skulls togain greater powers was reported in the press around the same time as the Surajicase in Indonesia.Thus, in Asia, we have compelling evidence of a link between serial murder andoccult practices. What we do not know is if this is a cultural phenomenon, or ifthe type of killer such as Suraji fits the accepted FBI profile of a serial or“lust” killer such as a Dahmer or a Gacey … or if this is a different phenomenonaltogether. We do know that Dahmer, for instance, was fascinated by occultismand believed that he could create zombies from his victims, and also had analtar adorned with the skulls of his victims when he was finally apprehended.Yet, in Dahmer’s case, we don’t know if the occult beliefs preceded the lust formurder, or if they were only window-dressing, a ritualization to heighten thesexual pleasure he derived from his actions. Perhaps a closer look at Dahmer’scase would be revealing of larger issues.PROM NIGHTI saw and think ‘The Exorcist’ was the best saterical comedy that I have everseen.—letter from the Zodiac Killer to the San Francisco Chronicle, January 30, 1974(Candlemas), misspelling in the original.18Jeffrey Dahmer was the prototypical awkward teenager, but one with a secret.According to FBI interview transcripts, Dahmer knew he was homosexual since hewas about thirteen years old. In 1970s small-town Ohio, that meant that he hadto disguise his sexuality and pretend to be as heterosexual as everyone else.For someone like Dahmer, however, that was not going to be easy.Thin, shy, and nervous, Dahmer would never come across as a macho man.Nevertheless, he had a date for the high school prom in June of 1978. Theunfortunate lady was Bridget Geiger, and she would later participate in a séancein Dahmer’s home.According to press reports published at the time of the grisly Dahmerrevelations, Ms. Geiger described herself as an unpopular high school sophomore,and Dahmer was equally unpopular as a senior. A mutual friend had arranged their“date” for the prom, during which Dahmer ignored her for hours, ostensibly to goout and get hamburgers. He was obviously painfully shy around girls, and couldnot even bring himself to pin the obligatory corsage to her prom dress, but hadto enlist the aid of her mother.19The prom took place in May 1978. A month later, Jeffrey invited her to a partyat his house. It was not much of a party, according to Ms. Geiger, but just ahalf dozen people sitting around with no food, no music, not much of anything.At one point during the evening, Dahmer decided he wanted to have a séance tocontact the spirit of someone who had died in the house. According to Dahmer, anevil spirit had contacted him and spoken to him, asking him to do things thatscared him. As the candles were lit and started to flare up and sputter, BridgetGeiger realized that Dahmer was not joking, and she fled the house, never to seeor speak to Dahmer again.20That same month, Dahmer claimed his first victim, the young hitchhiker StevenHicks.It is important to put the events in perspective. Dahmer—described variously asa loner and as the class clown, capable of practical jokes but never having anyclose friends—attends his senior prom, probably through social pressure from hisparents or what he felt society expected of him. Although he knew he washomosexual at this time, he had not actually acted out any homosexual acts withothers (except for a brief interlude as a younger child with a friend which didnot progress beyond some mild groping or fondling). He attended the prom with ayoung lady who described herself as unpopular as Dahmer himself. One would havethought that Dahmer would have been eager to put that episode out of his mind,but a month later he invites the same girl to a “party” that is not a party atall, but a prelude to a séance to contact an evil spirit; moreover, an evilspirit that has been telling Dahmer to do things that scare him. The séanceseems to have proceeded without Ms. Geiger’s participation. What occurred, we donot know; but that same month, possibly only days or at most weeks later, Dahmeris cruising a country road and finds his first victim.Steven Hicks was a personable nineteen-year-old, socially adept, and accordingto Dr. Joel Norris the diametric opposite to Dahmer in terms of personality.Hicks was on his way to a rock concert, and Dahmer picked him up and convincedhim to return with him to Dahmer’s home for a drink. What transpired next issubject to some controversy, as Dahmer has given conflicting accounts. We do notknow if Dahmer had sex with Steven Hicks, but what is certain is that when Hicksattempted to leave Dahmer went berserk and killed him with a barbell.He then proceeded to the next phase of his pattern, which was the dismembermentof the body.Mircea Eliade has described the curious process of “election” of a shaman; itbegins with some notification from the spirit world that the subject has been“elected” to become a shaman. In other words, there is a spiritual force—demonicor angelic or simply an amoral spiritual entity of some kind—which makes itspresence known to the future shaman. If we take the above story at face value,this is exactly what happened with Dahmer. As an outsider, a loner, he fit thebill in every other respect. Even as someone sexually confused, or homosexual,or a transvestite: all of these sexually ambiguous or “deviant” behaviors wereevidence of a shamanistic vocation in some cultures. The process of initiationbegins immediately upon notification to the future shaman that he or she hasbeen elected.This initiatory process involves a gradually worsening stage of mental disorderand illness, as described above. This includes a sensation of being murdered anddismembered, of having one’s organs removed, of being reduced to a skeleton. Insome cases, as in Siberian shamanism, it was not unusual for the fully-initiatedshaman to wear a coat covered in animal (or human) bones, as a marker of hisinitiatory death and dismemberment. These are all steps taken by Dahmer himselfin the intensification of his disorder, as he began to kill and eviscerate anddismember his victims. To a shaman, it would appear as an externalization ofwhat should have remained an internalized experience.Dahmer had dismembered and eviscerated animals before, always “road kill” thathe found on the highway. According to Dahmer, he never killed an animal himself.What argues against this, however, is the scene close to his house of a kind ofritual setting in the woods in which it seems dogs were killed as part of anoccult rite. This had taken place the previous year, in 1977, amid reports ofmissing dogs in the Bath, Ohio neighborhood where he lived. The scene wasdescribed by Jim Klippel to the Akron Beacon-Journal:“Somebody must have had a lot of fun with that dog…if that’s what you want tocall it. It was skinned and gutted. And about a hundred yards away there hadbeen a large fire and thirteen little fires around it. It looked so much likecult worship that it scared us to death.”21The dog that Klippel referred to had been found nailed to a tree. It fits theprofile of a serial killer that Dahmer would have started torturing animals,eventually moving up to humans. Dahmer insists that he did not kill any animalshimself, that he did not want to inflict pain. His human victims were said tohave been drugged first before he killed them—usually by strangulation—so thatthey would not feel pain. It is possible that the drugging only made it easierfor Dahmer to subdue and murder his victims, and that pain (or the avoidance ofit) had nothing to do with it. In any event, the disappearing and murdered dogsin 1977 pointed to a disappearing and murdered Steven Hicks in 1978.It is worthwhile to note here that missing dogs—especially German shepherds—area recurring theme around cult murders and cult activity, and that the slaughterof dogs was an element of the cult surrounding the Son of Sam killings that wewill investigate shortly. (About a year before the Son of Sam killings began,the author lived in Brooklyn Heights and heard stories of dogs being torturedand killed in a warehouse near the Brooklyn Bridge. This is the sameneighborhood where the Warlock Shop once stood, the occult store referred to byMaury Terry several times in The Ultimate Evil as an informal meeting place forsome of the Sam cultists.)Dahmer disposed of Hicks’ body, burying the pieces in the earth near his home(where they would be found thirteen years later), and went about his life as ifnothing had happened. He enrolled in college, but was kicked out due to hisexcessive drinking, a habit that began when Dahmer was still in high school. Atthe end of 1978, we find Dahmer enlisting in the Army and being sent to Germany.His military record, obtained by the FBI and part of his declassified FBI file,shows that Dahmer had severe problems in the Army, problems with drinking andproblems with authority. He was eventually discharged from the Army when theyrealized they couldn’t do very much for him, and he could do nothing for theArmy. So many of our nation’s most famous serial killers have spent time in theArmed Services: Dahmer, David Berkowitz, Bobby Joe Long, Arthur Shawcross … thelist is long and gruesome. Dahmer may be relatively unique in that he begankilling before he enlisted; the others did not begin until after they had beenin the service.What transpired after his discharge is by now well-known among aficionados ofthe bizarre and the morbid. He returned home, eventually found a job or seriesof jobs in Milwaukee, and began trolling for victims. He honed his skills, andrefined his rituals. His victims were all gay men, of various races—Black,White, Asian, Hispanic—mostly young, people he met in gay bars as far away asChicago. He would work during the week, and then go crazy on the weekends,drinking and hanging out in gay strip clubs, gay discos, adult movie theatersand bookstores, and when he was finally apprehended the body count came toseventeen, including his first victim, Steven Hicks. Their bodies had beendismembered, dissolved in vats of acid in his apartment, stored in a largefreezer. Their skulls had been retained, cleaned and defleshed and in some casespainted, and were adorning his altar, his “power altar.”22 The number of skullson the altar has been given variously as six (Ressler) or ten (Norris), alongwith a planned hanging skeleton on either side, a central hanging lamp, and twogriffins. The altar was not complete at the time of his arrest, but some of theskulls and the two griffins were in place, as well as candles, incense, andother vaguely occult paraphernalia.The griffins are interesting, only in that we encountered a pair of griffins inBook I: atop the incredible wandering house in Ashland, Kentucky, where—it wasclaimed—they had the power to ward off evil. In Dahmer’s case, the griffins hadnames: one was Leon and the other was Apal, according to an FBI report on aninterview with Dahmer on August 3, 1992. These words were written on thegriffins themselves, which were knocked over during his session with victimCurtis Straughter who rolled off the bed and crashed into the altar, alarmingDahmer. According to the FBI report,DAHMER stated that these griffins were part of the occult, and symbolizedpersonal power and made it that he did not have to answer to anyone. DAHMERstated that there were words written on each griffin, one had Leon and the otherhad Apal. DAHMER again stated that this symbolized personal power, and he feltthat this was a sign to show that he was losing control.23For those interested in these things, the names of the griffins may provide atype of clue. “Leon,” of course, is simply the Spanish word for lion, and, ofcourse, the lion represents the kind of strength and power that attractedDahmer. “Apal” is somewhat more problematic. It could simply be the Hebrew wordלפא which means “darkness, gloom,” in which case the combination of lion withdarkness is most apt.When asked about his occult beliefs, he made an interesting revelation. Again,according to the FBI:DAHMER was asked if he was involved in the occult, and DAHMER stated that hestarted dabbling in the occult and reading, and his favorite movie was EXORCISTIII, because it helped fit into his fantasy. DAHMER stated that in the movieEXORCIST III the guy could create illusions, and DAHMER felt that he himselfcould create illusions.24For those who have not seen this film (Exorcist III, 1990), or who don’tremember it, it is a sequel to the original William Friedkin film, and wasactually directed by Friedkin himself. (Exorcist II was not a Friedkinproduction.) In addition, it had some members of the original cast. Theimportant thing about this film, however, is that it links serial murder withdemonic possession, something which the earlier Exorcist films did not do.That this was Dahmer’s favorite film is very revealing. The throwaway line about“creating illusions” is just that, a decoy. As we read famed FBI profiler RobertK. Ressler’s interview with Dahmer, the reason Dahmer was fascinated by ExorcistIII was the power the possessed had over reality, over the minds and bodies ofthe rest of the world.25 The element of “creating illusions” was only a tool, ameans to an end. There are many films concerned with the creation of illusions,but only Exorcist III marries this theme with that of demonic possession andserial murder. Dahmer went so far as to procure yellow contact lenses, to givehis eyes that feral, haunted glow when he trolled the bars, looking for victims.He believed that they “exuded power.”26Further evidence of this is given by an intended victim who escaped, one TracyEdwards.Edwards had been invited back to Dahmer’s Milwaukee apartment, and during adrinking session managed to have one hand handcuffed at knife point but retainedenough common sense or sobriety to refuse to have the other hand cuffed. Dahmer,however, although angry, was calm because he had drugged Edwards’ drink. Hisvictim would soon be unconscious, and a little later dead.While waiting for the drug to take effect, and with knife in hand, Dahmerdemanded that Edwards watch a videotape with him. It was Exorcist III.Dahmer watched the film intently, at times rocking back and forth, chanting in ahumming sound, and seeming to go into a trance (as described in Book II, thesame process was used by Mark David Chapman when invoking Satan or talking tohis Little People). Then a personality change would take place during the partsof the film that depicted possession sequences. At this time, Dahmer himselfwould become aggressive and demand that Edwards place the other handcuff on hiswrist. Then, as the filmed possession sequence would change to something moremundane, Dahmer’s mood also shifted and he began to complain about his life andhis loneliness.Eventually, Edwards escaped through a combination of luck and intelligence. Heplayed Dahmer’s moods and in a moment of inattention managed to hit Dahmer withenough force that he fell to the side, allowing Edwards to escape out into thenight, running as fast as he could.The mood changes may indicate some form of dissociation on Dahmer’s part, suchas we have already discussed, although Dahmer never presented as a sufferer fromDID or MPD at the time of his arrest or subsequent medical examinations. Indeed,psychiatrists were never able to completely analyze Dahmer, as Dahmer himselfcomplained. They could point to his necrophilia (he would have sex with thecorpses of his victims before they were dismembered, copulating with them oreven drawing slits in their chest for this purpose) or his other symptoms, butnever be able to integrate these symptoms into a single diagnosis. FBI profilerRessler would say that Dahmer represented a new phenomenon, and partially blamedHollywood (even though he himself had been a technical adviser on Silence of theLambs). He saw Exorcist III as some kind of triggering mechanism for Dahmer, assomething that gave the killer a kind of validation.I believe this is a hard point to prove, as one would have to show otherinstances in which this film instigated murder, dismemberment and cannibalism.Nonetheless, by blaming cinema and also to an extent pornography for the Dahmerphenomenon, Ressler was raising the ante: he was stating, simply, that Americanculture had contributed to the creation of Dahmer. If we look at other instancesof serial murder around the globe, however, including the Indonesian casementioned above as well as Chikatilo in Russia, and cases in Pakistan, China,and everywhere else, it is obvious that it is not American culture that createsserial killers—not even of the cannibalistic variety—but perhaps culture ingeneral offers a social medium for the phenomenon. In Indonesia, it manifestedas witchcraft; in Milwaukee, as a string of homosexual and racist hate crimes.The common denominator, however, in so many cases of serial murder and othervicious crimes seems to be theological. There is a supernatural element whereverwe look, if we look deeply enough. A taste for ritual, for horror films, forspiritual evocation, for demonology. A taste for Satan.In a macabre example of art imitating life imitating art, we have The Exorcist,which was a favorite film of the man eventually identified as the Zodiac Killer,and then Exorcist III, in which the demon-possessed serial murderer, the GeminiKiller, is based on the same Zodiac Killer (who, unknown to the film’s writer,director and producer, was a fan of the first Exorcist movie). This real-lifeconnection then leaps into Jeffrey Dahmer, who is mesmerized by the characterand who probably does not realize that the fictional Gemini Killer is based on areal person, a genuine serial murderer such as he himself is becoming, a famousmurderer with a taste for the occult and for Satanism, as Robert Graysmith’ssequel to his definitive work on the Zodiac killer, Zodiac Unmasked, amplyillustrates. And this, a movie based on a book written about a genuine case ofdemonic possession … a book written by a psychological warfare officer, a manhimself laboring in an occult tradition of Giordano Bruno, as identified andclarified, by poor, murdered Professor Culianu. The links examined by Culianu—oferos and image, of magic and sexuality—are in this single example drawn socarefully and completely that I feel it safe to say that no one would be able toignore the obvious conclusion that both Bruno and Culianu were correct and sawthe inner workings of the sinister force with tremendous clarity, as we shallsoon see.The cannibalism factor increased the fascination the public has had with Dahmer.The killer admitted that he ate various body parts of his victims, so that hecould feel them as part of him. It gave him a sexual thrill, but was obviouslysatisfying on some deeper level as well. Like the fictional Hannibal Lecter hewould fry pieces of his victims on a skillet over a stove.I would ask the reader to stop for a moment, inundated as we are with all ofthis hideous detail, and try to imagine the atmosphere of Dahmer’s apartment. Itwas not a large place. It was a one-bedroom affair of the type one would see inmost large cities: a sitting or living room, a bedroom, a toilet, not much else.In this apartment was a giant freezer filled with body parts. There was a vatcontaining acid and more body parts. There was a pot in which he cooked piecesof his victims. And there was the altar with its complement of skulls.He lived in that apartment; it was not a kill zone, a special secret placehidden away in the woods like the witch’s house in Hansel and Gretel (anotherexample of murder, witchcraft, cannibalism and child abuse). It was where hewent to sleep and woke up every morning. Showered. Shaved. Left everyday to goto work, or to find more victims. Once he had killed them, and had sex withtheir bodies, he would begin the laborious process of cutting them up intosmaller pieces, some of which he would eat and some of which he would freeze forlater. The rest would get dissolved in acid, and the blood and offal poured downthe normal bathroom drains. Police investigators found pots in the apartmentcontaining severed hands, genitalia, and other body parts, like something out ofa nightmare. Or a children’s fairy tale.Put yourself there. Try to imagine Dahmer—a chain smoker—standing over hislatest victim, a large sharp kitchen knife in his bloodied hand and a cigarettein his mouth, spilling ash, as he sawed away at someone’s thigh or arm. Someonewith whom he had had sex—alive and dead—perhaps only hours before. Try to tellyourself that this is life, this is how some people live, that this is anexperience to which a human being can become inured, accustomed, habituated.With the black walls and dark furniture and altar of skulls and griffins, thelighting must have been dim. There were blood stains on the carpet. At times,the giant freezer leaked. There was a smell.And the next weekend Dahmer would go out again.There was a great distance between Dahmer’s childhood home in Bath, Ohio and theapartment in Milwaukee, a spiritual distance most of us will never cover. We cantalk about isolation, about confused sexuality, about alienation, even aboutmultiple personalities and sexual dysfunctions. We can try to reduce thisphenomenon to something we can live with, something within the boundaries of thereality we know, rather than the reality we suspect exists.Adolf Eichmann, the prototype and exemplar of Hannah Arendt’s “banality ofevil,” rarely saw the victims he consigned to the death camps as part of theThird Reich’s “Final Solution.” He did not wallow in their blood and gore. Hedid not dismember his victims, much less devour their flesh. He was anaccountant, making sure quotas were filled and trains ran on time. If the evilthat Eichmann represents is, indeed, “banal” or at least masquerades asbanality, then what do we make of the evil represented by Dahmer?What do we make of evil itself?Dahmer, with his thin build and owlish, bespectacled appearance could have beenOhio’s answer to Eichmann. They were both matter-of-fact during their respectiveinterrogations. Eichmann’s responsibility was for the deaths of millions ofpeople; Dahmer’s for seventeen. Do we measure evil in terms of body count? Thisquestion has never been answered. It seems beyond human ability to answer. WereEichmann and Dahmer evil? Were they sane? Were they equally evil, equally saneor insane? What does this question demand of us as human beings? Does it demandthat we question … no, that we examine the consequences of our actions, nomatter how “banal”? Do we have to kill, dismember and devour our victims beforesociety can pass a judgment of “evil” upon us? Or is it enough simply to signthe execution orders? Or to pay the taxes that will pay for the construction ofmissiles, or for the covert actions of anonymous assassins in Third Worldcountries?Or is it enough to imagine acts of evil, like a Stephen King or a CliveBarker, or a Thomas Harris? Or an H.P. Lovecraft?Or like you? Like me?In an American court of law, it is enough to be convicted of responsibility todeserve the death sentence, as in the case of Charles Manson; but that is, initself, not enough of a verdict of evil. It is a verdict of guilt in the eyes ofthe law, but not necessarily of evil, or of sanity.In Dahmer’s case, we have what appears to be an unequivocal example of pure,unadulterated, evil. Yet, his defense attorneys attempted to win their case onthe basis of diminished capacity, i.e., the insanity defense. Dahmer had alreadyconfessed to the crimes, including that of Steven Hicks thirteen yearspreviously. There was no doubt in anyone’s mind that Dahmer had actuallycommitted these crimes. What the trial was to determine, before a jury, waswhether or not Dahmer was “insane.”Dahmer’s meticulous planning of each crime and the effort he made to dispose ofthe bodies before going out again to perform the same actions were enough forthe jury to come back with a verdict of “sanity.” There were, of course, othersocial issues surrounding the trial, including the Rodney King case in which ablack man was beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers and the entireepisode captured on videotape. Much was made of Dahmer’s victims, that they wereall homosexual and that eleven of the seventeen were black. Dahmer’s crimes werepainted as “hate crimes,” i.e., that Dahmer—conflicted about hishomosexuality—took out his shame and rage on homosexuals and extended that via abasic racist streak to include blacks. To equate Dahmer’s murder, dismembermentand consumption of his victims—not to mention his attempts to turn at least oneof them into a zombie by drilling holes in his skull while he was still aliveand filling the holes with acid—to the LAPD brutality in the case of RodneyKing, was quite a stretch. Although both crimes were hideous, the case of Dahmerreveals a sickness and depravity that even the LAPD could not match on its bestdays.The expert witnesses and other observers on the case admitted a degree ofbafflement when it came to Dahmer. The language became, in fact, embarrassinglytheological.John Liccione, the chief psychologist of the Milwaukee County Medical HealthComplex at the time of the Dahmer arrest, claimed, “We may think we know theperson, but rare is the case we really know what a person feels and thinks deepdown in the bowels of his soul.… Soul can be concealed. Who knows what is inthere?”27Theresa Smith, the sister of Dahmer victim Eddie Smith, put it more succinctlywhen she said, “I just know Dahmer’s evil.… And if they had a plea for that,that’s what he’d get—evilness.”28The drawing Dahmer made of his proposed Power Altar included a black table withten painted skulls, a standing skeleton on either side of the altar, what appearto be incense burners on top and at either side of the altar, and an overheadhanging lamp with four blue globes. The four globes (or six globes, according toRessler, p. 128) are the mysterious element; they don’t seem to fit the overalllayout of death and darkness. There might be a clue—however tenuous, but we arein very murky territory—in several works by noted occult scholar and head of oneof Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) organizations in England,Kenneth Grant.Quoting from the Lovecraft tale, “The Lurker at the Threshold,” he writes (in1980),The globes, or bubbles, comprise ‘that tentacled amorphous monster … whose maskwas as a congeries of iridescent globes, the noxious Yog-Sothoth, who froths asprimal slime in nuclear chaos beyond the nethermost outposts of space andtime’.29And previously, in 1972, quoting the same story and linking it to a designin Crowley’s own Pantacle:Not stars, but suns, great globes of light … and not these alone, but thebreaking apart of the nearest globes, and the protoplasmic flesh that flamedblackly outward to join together and form that eldritch, hideous horror fromouter space …30Had the stories of H. P. Lovecraft influenced the dreams and forbidden fantasiesof the introverted young Ohio homosexual who held séances in his home as ateenager to confront the evil spirit who, he said, was telling him to do “scarythings”? We shall probably never know.Jeffrey Dahmer was beaten to death in prison in November 1994 by a black inmate,Christopher J. Scarver, who was serving a life sentence for murder.Scarver said that voices in his head told him that he, Scarver, was the Son ofGod.31MURDER AND TRANSFIGURATIONWe are accustomed to thinking of the fictional killer as someone who is infiendish pursuit of a kind of transformation. The killer in Thomas Harris’famous Silence of the Lambs is trying to transform himself into a woman bysewing the skin of his victims together to make a kind of suit, à la real-lifeserial killer Ed Gein; the symbol of that novel-turned-movie is a moth: a motifof transformation from caterpillar to pupa to winged creature. How much moreinteresting an evil character who is in search of self-transcendence! Itelevates the discussion beyond a mere carnal craving for blood; and why? Becausewe want to elevate our own sexual urges into something more … divine? A tantrictake on lust murder? Or is there something fundamentally correct in theassumption that the serial killer—like the shaman—is in search (consciously orunconsciously) of a kind of transformation? Before our minds were filled withstories and images of vicious and depraved serial killers, there was in NorthAmerica an institutionalized form of murder, evisceration and dismemberment: theritual killings that took place among the Aztecs and Mayas, and all as part ofpublic displays that merged religious intensity with dramatic scenes of bloodyknives and hearts, still beating, ripped from the chests of victims. Thislinkage of hideous slaughter with communication with God and the preservation ofsociety was not exclusive to the ancient Mexican civilizations, of course. Jesusis another such example. Transformation by way of torture, bloodshed, andmurder.Is this what compelled the CIA to dig deeper into the mentality of violentoffenders and psychopaths? Not because they wanted to see God, but because theywanted to control that urge for transformation, for transcendence and re-directit towards a more politically useful target?Critics of Thomas Harris’ novels point to an obvious “flaw” if his work is to betaken scientifically, and that is that serial killers by and large do not havethe intellect, the control, and the deep inner resources of a Hannibal Lecter;they are usually underachievers, usually white men who are marginal in societydue to physical or mental defects or social ostracism, a lot closer to thebrutal redneck antagonists in Deliverance than the urbane, literate Lecter. Yetit is just these men who, in other societies, may find themselves called to theposition and function of shaman, and not to the role of theintellectually-astute, the suave, cultivated man of science and society.David Sexton—literary editor of the London Evening Standard—has written athoughtful and stimulating book on Thomas Harris and the themes in his novels:The Strange World of Thomas Harris.32 In this tightly-focused essay, we arestartled to read that the themes we have been pursuing are echoed quite clearlyby this British critic, for he draws a comparison between the mind of HannibalLecter and The Art of Memory by Frances A. Yates,33 showing that the number andtype of connections and correspondences in Harris’ work is a deliberate creationof a kind of memory palace, and that numerous Web sites have sprung up devotedto unraveling these connections and demonstrating the superb depth of eruditionand culture that permeate the Lecter novels, giving them a resonance far beyondthat of a traditional thriller or horror story. Hannibal Lecter is, himself, akind of memory palace, which is why he is able to spend long days, weeks andmonths in his cell without his books as he pores over a vast mental library andmuseum that is his own memory. Further, while giving homage to Sherlock Holmes,Harris also draws his inspiration directly from Edgar Allen Poe and the Americantraditions of the detective story and the horror story (as did Sir Arthur ConanDoyle), traditions steeped in that peculiar American culture that Europeancritics deny we possess while they simultaneously admire and emulate it, for itis, after all, a tradition born in the darkest of human impulses: conquest,heresy, the ripping of the veils of Temple and Kingship.It was Ioan Culianu who revealed the close association between eros and magic,and called it the birthplace of the modern sciences of propaganda andadvertising. The serial killer is, after all, a “lust” killer; his crimes arereferred to as “sexual homicides” and it is for this reason that we have becomefascinated with the serial killer, as he represents the “link” or “bond” betweensex (eros) and magic, sex and transformation. The transformation that is so mucha part of the Harris novels is also the core impulse behind the shaman; it wasalso a major factor in the thinking of serial killers such as Jeffrey Dahmer.Yet, before we examine the deeper processes of the shaman and the serial killer,let us remind ourselves of the political uses of psychology and of“brainwashing,” so that we can put this all into some kind of context. It wouldbe useful to understand that there exist in the United States—and probably inmany other countries as well—two “sciences” that run parallel to each other. AsJames Bamford described in his definitive study of the National Security Agency,The Puzzle Palace, in 1982, the scientific establishment is not necessarilycompletely up-to-date on new developments that affect national securityconsiderations. Much science is conducted behind closed, locked, and even hiddenand disappearing doors. The NSA itself has had an enormous influence on thedevelopment of computer science, as they needed more and more powerful machinesto create cyphers and to decrypt the cyphers of other countries. The NSA alsohad a tremendous influence on the development of space science, as theystruggled to design spy satellites that could eavesdrop on conversations manymiles below their orbits. The NSA—and similar organizations around the globe—ofnecessity have to be several years, or even several generations, beyond what istaking place in the civilian scientific community.34 The same, it may be safelyassumed, is true of psychiatric science as well.Psychiatry being generally beyond the purview of the NSA, the militaryintelligence groups and the CIA had a monopoly on new developments in this area,as we have seen. Like the NSA and computer technology, the CIA financed manyspecific psychiatric projects but always with an emphasis on memory and control.The creation of amnesia, the embedding of secret orders via hypnosis, or drugs,or “brainwashing” or some combination of these or other techniques, were allvitally important to intelligence organizations, and CIA-funded research madeits way into the general literature (just as NSA-funded research contributed tothe explosive growth of computer science and telecommunications; just as theArmy’s Psychological Warfare effort funded and directed the new science ofcommunications; just as the military directed the creation of the DSM with itstremendous influence on generations of American psychiatrists). Otherauthors—such as the psychiatrist and hypnosis expert George Estabrooks, whoworked for CIA—have described how the CIA was interested in the creation ofmultiple personality disorder. As we uncover more and more concerning theparallel interests of the Army and the Navy in these matters, we can only assumethat they were also fascinated by this disorder and the potential uses to whichit could be put.Item: Lt. Commander Dr. Thomas Narut—a US Navy psychologist—claimed before aNATO conference of psychologists in Oslo that ONI (the Office of NavalIntelligence) had been using convicted murderers in a bizarre scheme to createthe perfect commando. These were men from military prisons who were sent tovarious US embassies abroad after having been “treated” with behaviormodification techniques and turned into assassins “who could kill on command.”Narut was later reprimanded by the Navy and forced to retract his statement, butthe cat was already out of the bag.35While disturbing and possibly unethical, this program used individuals who werealready murderers. In another program, it is possible that the CIA actuallycontributed to the creation of a famous killer:Item: It is revealed that Ted Kaczynski, the famed “Unabomber,” had been a testsubject in a CIA mind-control project during his university days. A brilliantmathematician, Kaczynski would escape from society and hole up in a cabin in theMontana woods until his capture by federal agents, after his letter bombs killedthree people and wounded twenty-three over a course of seventeen years. The manwho experimented upon him was none other than Dr. Henry A. Murray, the formerOSS psychiatrist for whom Timothy Leary had developed a psilocybinexperimentation program at Harvard in 1960 after his return from a trip toMexico. Kaczynski was one of only twenty-two Harvard undergrads who were part ofthis secret project from the fall of 1959 to the spring of 1962, a program basedloosely on OSS interrogation methods and designed to break down the student’spersonality. The personality assessment tests devised by Murray for the OSSduring the war were conceived as an attempt to find out which candidates woulddo well under interrogation and torture; some OSS candidates broke down evenbefore the tests were administered, so frightening were the rumors about theirintensity. Kaczynski, who needed the money and volunteered for these testswithout being told what to expect, began to develop signs of emotional stressand a hatred for society as his Harvard years progressed. Eventually, less thanten years after the completion of the Harvard tests, he disappeared into theMontana woods, wrote his journals and a long Manifesto that some critics havecalled “brilliant,” and mailed bombs all over America.36MISBEGOTTEN SONSStuart Clark, a Professor of History at the University of Swansea (and winner ofthe Royal Historical Society’s Gladstone History Prize in 1997) has written abook that examines the politics of witchcraft. Entitled Thinking With Demons:the Idea of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe, it is a thorough examination notonly of the political issues surrounding the idea of witchcraft but also ofpolitics and religion in general, especially the uncomfortable relationshipbetween political institutions, and particularly political leaders, and theChurch, and how witchcraft at once tested and in some cases validated thesupernatural role of the King. Although he is writing of a time hundreds ofyears in the past, his theme could just as easily be ported to a modern context:To add confessional uniformity to institutional centralization—to control mindsas well as bodies—was an understandable ambition of governments, and the pursuitof spiritual dissidents in the courts could be its practical outcome. Control ofpolitical loyalties was, after all, felt to rest on control of denominationalones.37It is this strange alliance between political loyalties and denominational onesthat paved the way for the excesses—not only of the Inquisition, which beganafter all with the persecution of the Cathars, a heretical sect that threatenedpolitical hegemony in France—but also of the mind-control efforts of moderngovernments. In the last hundred years, as psychiatry became become more popularand influential, especially as it tried to mimic the scientific method on whichso much technology is based, the social role of religion in the West came underincreasing pressure. Religious beliefs were considered in the light ofpsychopathologies, for instance in William Sargant’s study of religiousconversion and “brainwashing,” but also in the Soviet Union, which saw religiousaffiliation in the same light as political dissidence, both of which were causefor commitment in a mental institution. Religion—at least in the eyes of thosepsychologists and psychiatrists working for the government—was seen inmechanical terms, as a kind of hysterical reaction, a nervous disorder; and,just as psychopathology could be put to the service of the State (such as in thecase of multiple personality disorder), so also could religious sentiment which,after all, was only a complex of mental disorders as seen in the light ofpsychiatric illumination.In the West, religious affiliation implied political loyalty, and still does tosome extent (witness the abortion controversy as a test not only of religiouscommitment but also of political action and party loyalty). In the CommunistEast, to be religious at all was tantamount to treason. Instead of burning thereligious (or politically dissident) at the stake, they were committed toinstitutions or, in China, to re-education camps.That does not mean, however, that the powers unleashed by intense religiousdevotion would be ignored. Neither in the West nor in the East could governmentsafford to disregard the weapons potential of the “disordered” mind. Strip thedenominational dogma from the religious experience and one can see a range ofstriking similarities among the spiritualities of many cultures and beliefs.These similarities are the bedrock of the psychological approach to religion, awellspring of unconscious mental ability that finds expression in religioussentiment, but which can just as easily be molded to other beliefs, other …loyalties. But to do that, to at once evoke and control, manipulate, this powerone has to dig down and get one’s hands dirty. And, it should be stressed,bloody.Nietzsche wrote that what we perceive as higher culture is nothing more than theelevation of our innate savagery to a divine state. He wrote of the canonizationof evil, the social consensus that transforms acts of hideous cruelty intospiritually redeeming metaphors. Society has this power, the power to blessbarbarity. The early history of Christianity—of Jesus, of the Martyrs, all thosedead Virgins—is of the sacralization of the Victim; the later history ofChristianity is of the sacralization of the soldier, the witch-burner, thefirebrand: of the Inquisition and the Crusades. Saint Ignatius Loyola, he of theCounter-Reformation, said that to give him a child for a year was to bind thatchild to the Church for life.Take a child, then. As young as possible. Remove him from his family, from hisparents, and bring him up in a commune with other children. The only adults arethe wardens of this commune, the “trainers.” Authority figures, authoritywithout love. Keep him isolated from the rest of the world. Do not give him aname; do not allow him to develop an independent personality. Feed him poorly;dress him poorly. Keep him hungry and cold. Subject him to scenes of bloodshedand violence; make him partake in these scenarios. Brutalize his consciousness.You will be creating a monster, who will one day go out and kill … orself-destruct in some addicts’ hallway. A terrorist, an assassin, a psychopath …a killer.The serial killer fixates on a certain type of victim, a type that makes senseonly to him. Someone who reminds him of his mother, maybe, according to thestereotype. Or women with long hair. Or white women only. Or prostitutes only.Or young boys.What if—in the course of this “instruction” in our special school forchildren—we implant a different fixation? What if we create the psyche of thechild from the ground on up? This, as discussed in Book I, is what Dr. EwenCameron of Montreal had pledged to do, and with CIA funding, until that fatefulday in November 1963 when his services were no longer required. Like Otto Rahn,the reluctant SS officer and historian whose goal was the Holy Grail, Camerondied on a mountaintop. His records and documentation were seized by CIA officerWilliam Buckley, who later found himself at the mercy of Arab terrorists whoworked on him the same foul black magic that Cameron had used on his victims.Cameron created the technique of “depatterning,” which—in its application aswell as its theory—could just as easily be called “dissociating”: a subject hadhis or her mind methodically erased, broken into pieces and scattered to thewinds. Long established patterns of thought and behavior were disassembled, thepatient reduced to a blank slate on which Cameron could write anything hewished. Tapes played constantly, day and night, with speakers under thepatient’s pillow, formulating a new purpose, a new identity, a new set oflearned behavior. Like the central character in A Clockwork Orange, the patientwould become a “New Man.”But the interest of the CIA was not in developing a technique for the soul’sindividuation. That would have no military or intelligence value at all. TheCIA’s approach was purely mechanical: how do we turn an ordinary person into akiller, in fact a killer with selective amnesia? Cameron claimed to be able tocreate selective amnesia. A combination of drugs, sensory deprivation,monotonous tape recordings of command phrases … but were the side effects toocumbersome? What about surgery? What if we did a little nip-and-tuck in thecerebral cortex? What then?The example of Arthur Shawcross may be a case in point. A convicted serialkiller and rapist, Shawcross had spent time in Vietnam. He claimed to have seenbloody combat in the jungles, and to have first cannibalized his victims there.The Army denied that Shawcross was anywhere near combat, and instead insistedthat throughout his tour he had remained “in the rear with the gear.” When hewas finally apprehended for a string of ghastly homicides in and aroundRochester, New York, his defense team were not allowed copies of his militarymedical files. Pictures of his brain, however, showed evidence of medicalintervention: symmetrical scarring that his team believed had to have been theresult of surgery and not from natural causes. It was Shawcross who claimed tohear voices in his head, ghostly spirits urging him to kill. To the prosecution,he was simply malingering and faking mental illness. To the defense, he was acipher. They needed the medical files. They could not get them.The perspective of modern science and modern jurisprudence seems to be that, forthe most part, killers are killers because they want to be killers. They havechosen evil as a way of life, and for that reason they should be punished if notexecuted. Society agrees in principle, of course; who needs killers loose on thestreets? But when it comes to the serial killer, we are on shaky ground. Asqueried earlier, is a serial killer a voluntary or an involuntary murderer? Whoare these “misbegotten sons”?Any answer depends, first of all, upon determining who is, and is not, a serialkiller, because the loose application of this term has caused some confusion inthe popular media. By simple arithmetic, a serial killer is a killer who killsmore than once; i.e., who kills victim after victim over a period of time.Obviously, hired assassins or Mafia hit men are not included in this category.That is because the term “serial killer” is a more modern term for what used tobe termed a “lust killer.” In other words, the criteria for labeling a person a“serial killer” is more complex than simply a long hit list of victims. A serialkiller—popularly understood—is someone who kills more than one person over aperiod of time (i.e. “in series”) due to an emotional urge (a “lust”) to kill.These killers are very personally involved in their crimes; they need to see thevictim up close, to spill blood with their own two hands. The act of murder isfor them a kind of sexual act, and quite often the crime scenes show evidence ofsexual activity with the victim, pre-mortem and/or post-mortem. The victims areall selected according to a pattern that involves either their profession(prostitution, for example) or their physical appearance, or some other qualityknown only to the killer.In this way, we can see that killers such as Charles Manson do not fit theprofile. The crimes for which Manson was convicted were all committed by otherpeople, the members of his “Family.” No self-respecting serial killer, motivatedby the lust of killing, would assign murders to other people to carry out. Norwould they attack at a distance.In most serial murders, then as now, the weapon of choice was the knife, withthe second most favored method being strangulation and the third, suffocation.Serial murderers, in general, do not use guns, which kill people from adistance; serial murderers want the personal satisfaction of causing death rightthere at hand.—Robert K. Ressler38The same may be said for David Berkowitz. Try as they might, psychologistsworking on the Son of Sam case could not squeeze the round peg that is DavidBerkowitz into the square hole that is the “lust” or serial killer. WhileBerkowitz admits to several of the killings, he insists that he did not commitall of them and that the murders were, in fact, carried out under the orders ofa cult to which he belonged. As he is in prison for life with no possibility ofparole, he has no ulterior motive for making this claim. Nothing that he says atthis point will reduce his sentence and he has, as mentioned, freely admitted tocommitting some of the murders anyway. By pleading guilty immediately after hisapprehension, he denied the rest of us an examination of the available evidencewhich would have pointed to the existence of the murderous cult to which hebelonged. In fact, the evidence collected in the twenty-five years since thetime of the killings is now leaning heavily to support this allegation of a cultof murderers operating in the New York metropolitan area as well as in otherparts of the country, including North Dakota and California. While many criticssincerely doubt the claims of Maury Terry and others who point to a vastconspiracy of Satanic killers (and some of Terry’s claims are weak and poorlysupported), the preponderance of the evidence in the Son of Sam case is strongenough to suggest that what Berkowitz is saying is, in fact, true.Thus if we include Manson and Berkowitz in any study of serial murder, thestatistics will become skewed and much valuable data will be lost. Whatever thepsychic disorders suffered by Manson and Berkowitz—and they may be legion—thelabel of serial killer cannot, in all honesty, be used in their cases. In fact,Terry’s evidence goes far to suggest that the Manson and Berkowitz cases mayactually be related; that the cult to which Berkowitz belonged in New York Citywas a branch of the one to which Manson had allegiance. Just as in our study ofcoincidence and politics, when it comes to serial murder the coincidences alsopile up, suggesting that the same dynamic applies. It is but another indicationof the existence of a powerful, hidden force in nature that surfaces in time oftremendous stress in the fabric of reality.For although there are definite and critical differences between Manson andBerkowitz on one hand, and Dahmer and Gein (for example) on the other, there arecertain deeper threads that can tell us a great deal about these killers as wellas about the forces they represent. In the case of Manson and Berkowitz, we canpoint to the dim outlines of a cult of killers using occult jargon and ritual tobuttress what may have been simply a drug-related criminal operation, much thesame way the Matamoros killers used palo mayombe as a front for what wereessentially normal, criminal operations. The killers themselves believed intheir respective cults (whether or not their leaders did), and committed theircrimes out of a sense that they were being initiated into a circle of tremendousoccult power.In the cases of both Jeffrey Dahmer and Ed Gein—killers who operated alone andnot as part of any cult or criminal organization—they were still interested inideas of transformation (and, in Dahmer’s case, occultism) and in the techniquesof empowerment that murder would afford them both. In Ed Gein’s case, he wantedto transform himself physically into a woman; in Dahmer’s case, he simply wantedmore power than he had: he wanted to create a zombie that would be his personalsex slave, a human being devoid of will who would simply not exist if Dahmer wasaway but who would become his plaything when he was home. On the other hand, andin the context of our argument, neither Manson nor Berkowitz were “shamanistic”;that is, they were carrying out the murderous wishes of a cult to which theybelonged in the expectation (perhaps) of attaining some degree of occult powerin the process, power that would be bestowed by the cult leadership as a rewardfor their efforts, or obtained through the very act of killing in a cultcontext. This is similar to the mechanism of normal initiatic cults the worldover, where certain tests and trials are administered to the initiand, both totest the candidate’s loyalty as well as to cause emotional and psychologicalstress conducive to illumination. (Even in Freemasonry, one is initiated at thepoint of a sword—blindfolded and bound—and made to swear all manner offrightening oaths.)But both Dahmer and Gein were prime examples of loners, outcast from any kind ofsociety, people with sick fantasies of blood, dismemberment, cannibalism andnecrophilia, as well as confused sexual identities. They had secret chambers towhich non-initiates were not allowed, places reeking of gore and offal that weremonuments to their dreams of godlike power and psychic integration.SHAMANISM AND SERIAL MURDERNeurosis and initiation are the same thing, except that neurosis stops short ofapotheosis, and the tremendous forces that mold all life are encysted—shortcircuited and turned poisonous.—Jack ParsonsAs the West became increasingly Judeo-Christian, and a split was created betweenhumanity and nature, with nature being suspected of harboring evil, the role ofthe shaman was relegated to the dustbin of personal spiritual illumination.Church and temple were organized, social places that contained all thespirituality that any normal human being could ask for. They channeled thespiritual desires of men and women into socially-acceptable forms, cookie-cutterspirituality. In the process, Westerners began to lose their contact withnature, their reverence for nature, and by so doing became alienated anddesperate. Jung said somewhere that Christianity caused Europeans to becomeschizophrenic, and perhaps he was right. We lost the ability to nurture theshamanic impulses into mutually beneficial manifestations. The pseudo-shamans weproduce—the Dahmers, the Geins, the Gaceys, the Bundys—know only the impulse,but not the technology, for spiritual integration. They experience the nightmareof the “future shaman,” but not the communication with God.Sexuality was another victim of the rise of Christianity in the West. Theexpression of sexuality was severely suppressed by the Church, and a caste ofcelibate priests and nuns was created—after a period of hundreds of years as theChurch consolidated its political and economic power in Rome—and sex wasconsidered to be a kind of necessary evil, useful only for procreation. To enjoysexuality was to be sinful. Women were characterized as wanton sexual creatures,whose constant thirst for sex made them easy prey for the Devil, who turned theminto witches and made them kiss his buttocks as a sign of their submission tohis infernal will.The sexual content of serial murder is well-known. Virtually all serial killingshave a strong sexual element, whether it is actual sex with the victim before orafter death—or during the murder itself—or sexual mutilation, or display of thevictim’s genitalia, etc. Why, then, is serial murder not simply serial rape? Whydoes murder become involved in what seems to be only a sex crime, a mutation ofnormal sexual affection and desire into something violent and morbid? Is itbecause we in the West have associated sex with punishment, with death—withspiritual death—for so long that our serial killers are only demonstrating to usour own repressed desires? Perhaps. And perhaps there is even a deeper contextin which to look at serial murder.Human sexuality is, quite apart from Christian repressions, a highlyquestionable phenomenon, and belongs, at least potentially, among the extremerather than the ordinary experiences of humanity. Tamed as it may be, sexualityremains one of the demonic forces in human consciousness—pushing us at intervalsclose to taboo and dangerous desires, which range from the impulse to commitsudden arbitrary violence upon another person to the voluptuous yearning for theextinction of one’s consciousness, for death itself.—Susan Sontag39The historian of religion Mircea Eliade has written about sexuality andshamanism, albeit briefly. In his monumental work entitled Shamanism, he hasexamined the role of sexual energy and gender-transfer in shamanistic circlesaround the world. Some shamans are called to change their sex; to wear theclothing and adopt the mannerisms of the other sex and even to marry as if theyhad truly changed gender. It is interesting to note that in some cultures,although the call to switch gender is understood to occasionally be part of theinitiatic process, some “future shamans” prefer suicide. 40Thus, the call isseen as powerful and demanding, and the shaman sees no way out of hispredicament other than self-extermination. Eliade goes on to state that“transvestitism and ritual change of sex are found, for example, in Indonesia(the manang bali of the Sea Dyak), in South America (Patagonians andAraucanians), and among certain North American tribes (Arapaho, Cheyenne, Ute,etc.).”41In a later chapter, one devoted to Asian shamanism, Eliade confronts certainshamanistic cults of Tibet in which the identical stage of decapitation,dismemberment, and cannibalism is undergone by an initiate—albeit in a state ofmeditation and trance and not in actuality—at the hands of a goddess,brandishing a sword. The flesh and blood of the initiate is given to demons andwild beasts, and eventually the initiate is reborn after this horrifyingexperience.42Eliade sees in tantrism remnants of ancient shamanistic practices concerning sexand sexual energy, such as the Tibetan practice of “mystical heat” in which theinitiate is made to conserve his sexual energy and transform it into a kind ofbodily heat so intense that he is able to dry wet blankets on his skin outdoorsin the winter.43 This idea of “mystical heat” was not unknown to shamans ofvarious other countries and climates, and was inextricably linked to healing ofphysical illnesses in others, and in a bizarre form of self-mutilation in whichthe body of the shaman is “heated” in this mystical fashion, as well as hisknife. When both knife and body have been heated to the right temperature, theshaman opens a wound in his own abdomen without pain.44The shamans may also be the sexual partners of spiritual forces, spirits of theopposite sex who come to the initiate on his sick-bed (for the initiation alwaysbegins in illness of some kind) and tell the future shaman that he has beenselected as a husband. To refuse is to die. The shaman thus selected may findhimself unable to satisfy a mortal woman, or to refuse all sexual contact exceptwith this ethereal entity who nonetheless teaches him shamanism over a period ofyears. Many of the public rituals performed by shamans are sexual in nature,using elaborately carved wooden phalluses for example, accompanied by thebeating of the drum and hypnotic incantations.45 We are reminded of Dahmer onhis couch, in trance, in mystical communion with the demon who tells him to do“scary things.”We may also remember Foucault and his “blood and sex” theory. Does the shamanlive on the tangent between blood and sex? Is the “place between the worlds”that is symbolized (or actualized) by the magic circle, the hounfort, thetemple, the place between blood and sex, between death and rebirth, betweennature and … murder? Is the magic circle really a place of healing, not only ofphysical ailments and mental disorders, but of the rift between who we are andwho we wish to become, between what is our nature and what society demands ofus? Possibly the only way for the sick, the disturbed, to become whole—to becomehealed—is to communicate directly with God.If the shamanistic process is allowed to continue on its normal route, thefuture shaman will recover from his illness after an experience of ascendinginto the heavens and becoming reborn as a shaman. It is an ecstatic journey thatputs the shaman into contact with higher forces, centering him and empoweringhim not only as a shaman but as a human being, as a productive and importantmember of his tribe: someone who has been to the Other Side and come back withthe ability to predict the future and heal the sick. And if the shamanisticprocess is not allowed to continue?The total crisis of the future shaman, sometimes leading to completedisintegration of the personality and to madness, can be valuated not only as aninitiatory death but also as a symbolic return to the precosmogonic Chaos, tothe amorphous and indescribable state that precedes any cosmogony. Now, as weknow, for archaic and traditional cultures, a symbolic return to Chaos isequivalent to preparing a new Creation. It follows that we may interpret thepsychic Chaos of the future shaman as a sign that the profane man is being“dissolved” and a new personality being prepared for birth.—Mircea Eliade46For modern psychiatry, every mental breakdown—every mental illness, every mentaldisorder—has its origin somewhere in the patient’s life. A person does not goinsane for reasons that are not part of his personal history. Therefore, whatEliade is saying would be considered suspect by psychiatrists. How could aperson go insane—how could his personality disintegrate to that extent—due to anexternal influence? There is either an organic reason (such as a hormonalimbalance or some other chemical reason, or physical trauma of some sort, suchas a blow to the head), or there is a precipitating cause in the patient’simmediate environment. Yet, in the context of shamanism, the precipitating causeis the summons of a spirit. Even more threatening, the shaman is a person whohas gone “through” madness and has become “cured” without the benefit of modernpsychiatric technique. Even more astonishing, this person who had once been madis now a valued and even a revered member of his society, and all due to thefact of his madness and subsequent cure.The controversial Scottish psychiatrist (and sometime visitor to theTimothy Leary/William Hitchcock estate at Millbrook) R. D. Laing wrote in 1967,in The Politics of Experience,When a person goes mad, a profound transposition of his place in relation to alldomains of being occurs.… Nevertheless, he can often be to us, even through hisprofound wretchedness and disintegration, the hierophant of the sacred. An exilefrom the scene of being as we know it, he is an alien, a stranger signaling tous from the void in which he is foundering, a void which may be peopled bypresences that we do not even dream of. They used to be called demons andspirits.… Madness need not be all breakdown. It may also be breakthrough.(emphasis added)47Madness and psychic disintegration (dissociation?) leading to … spiritualbreakthrough, psychic powers, attainment, illumination: the shaman, the medicineman, the magician.When the governments of the world undertook their various and individualprograms for exploring the possibility of mind control, they were seeking a wayto “disintegrate” the personality of a subject and then rebuild it in someother, more convenient, form. The efforts of Dr. Cameron in Montreal werecertainly perfect examples of this approach. If the government—or, at least, itsintelligence agencies—could arrogate to themselves the power of initiation thenthey could indeed create a “cult of intelligence” to which their most valuablemembers would not even be aware they belonged. In Eliade’s world of shamanism,the shaman-to-be began in illness—mental illness or even epilepsy or someepileptoid disorder—and found his personality “disintegrating,” his body beingdismembered and disemboweled on some level, and then gradually became wholeagain and the proud owner of a “new” personality. The problem with thisprocess—in the eyes of government agencies—would be the time it took to developthis new personality and the ambiguity of that personality: why not design thenew personality from scratch and drag the unsuspecting “shaman” through theentire initiatic process in record time with drugs, sensory deprivation, and allthe other tools of the trade? To that end they explored the shamanisticrepertoire of hallucinogenic drugs, ritual, hypnosis, and whatever else theycould find, not realizing that they were—in the eyes of shamans, mystics,magicians everywhere—becoming “black magicians” in the process. Just like everyother wistful and lazy would-be occultist with the flowery titles and advanceddegrees of imaginary spiritual attainments, the CIA psychiatrists wanted all thebenefits of the initiatic process but without the expense of time and effortrequired to do it right. They also wanted complete control over the finishedproduct; this, from people who had not been through the process themselves andhad no idea what changes it would create in the minds—dare we say “souls”?—oftheir subjects. They were wading into deep waters, the same waters that couldcreate a shaman … or serial killer.The real problem is that people like Dahmer present a dilemma for society, whichhas not evolved proper ways to deal with them. Focusing on notions of right andwrong does not begin to approach the complex reality of what Dahmer did.—FBI Profiler Robert K. Ressler48It is a cliché of modern psychiatry that a child who has been abused will growinto an adult who abuses children. What about the serial killer? Obviously, hewas not “killed” as a child, was not dismembered or eviscerated. What causes theescalation from physical and sexual abuse into serial murder, into lust killing?If an adult abuser is only “acting out” what he has experienced as a child, isthe serial killer acting out a different experience, a different reality? Whatwere the nightmares of Jeffrey Dahmer like? Did he wake up one morning, feverishand shaking, from a vision of hell? Did he truly hear a voice telling him to do“scary things”? A normal therapeutic course would probably not have helpedDahmer very much; he would have known to keep the darker elements of his naturequite hidden. Patients fool therapists all the time, particularly sociopathicpatients. Perhaps what Dahmer needed was not therapy, but initiation.If, as Mircea Eliade said, those who were mentally ill “became shamans preciselybecause they had succeeded in becoming cured,” then I submit that those who werementally ill (like Dahmer, like Gein), became serial killers precisely becausethey had not succeeded in becoming cured. I submit that the shamanic impulse hasnot died, it has only been suppressed in our society, and thrown in withdiagnoses of schizophrenia and other mental disorders; that characterizing whatused to be understood as a mystical state as, instead, evidence of psychosis hasrobbed us of any hope of spiritual comprehension. And generations ofpsychiatrists and psychologists since at least the time of Freud have warned uswhat to expect when strong emotional impulses are denied.This is not to suggest that serial killers are somehow holy or spiritual beings;far from it. The call to become a shaman is not necessarily divine; it could aseasily be demonic. How would we know the difference? We have lost our moralcompass in a society that tolerates priestly pederasty, the avarice oftelevangelists, the cupidity of politicians. We get our education in ethics frommade-for-tv-movies and obnoxious political talk show hosts. Our spiritual liveshave been canned for so long, we wouldn’t recognize “fresh” if it grew in ourbackyards. The spiritual aspirations of Americans—like that of mostWesterners—have been manipulated by social forces for so long, it would beamazing if modern America could produce a single person worthy of canonizationby a church worthy to canonize. Monotheism brought with it a political structurethat mimics that of the monarchy; even Hell, in the medieval grimoires, ispeopled with kings and dukes and princes and, yes, presidents. More thananything else, the Postwar 1950s brought with it not only the man in the greyflannel suit, but the priest, the minister, and the rabbi in the grey flannelsuit. The excesses of the 1960s were an obvious and predictable reaction againstthe stifling of the spiritual impulse to celebrate, to worship life in all itsforms, to experience spiritual ecstasy.The serial killer is the dark side of that force, the symbol of a twisted andcorrupt spiritual desire forced to feed in silence and solitude on its own fleshand blood.And when the CIA began to experiment on the minds of violent offenders withdrugs and behavior modification and God knows what else, they were playinghide-and-seek in the dungeon with Hannibal Lecter. And when they experimented onchildren, dosing them with huge amounts of LSD and other hallucinogens, theywere opening the very gates of hell itself. This is not to apportion blame, butto state a simple fact regardless of who or what is to blame, if anyone, ifanything. With respect to the study of serial murderers and shamans, the CIA wascontributing with ravaged minds and body bags, courtesy of Doctors Cameron,Gottlieb, Estabrooks, and so many others.Imagine a government-run Zen monastery in which the penalty for not solving yourkoan is execution by a firing squad.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Aleister Crowley, Moonchild, Mandrake Press, London, 1929, p. 29-30 2 Colin A.

These things really are dangerous and ought not to be meddledwith in our typically Western way. It is a meddling with fate, which strikes atthe very roots of human existence and can let loose a flood of sufferings ofwhich no sane person ever dreamed.—C.G. Jung, “Psychological Commentary” to the Tibetan Book of the Dead, p. xlvi… what we are basically talking about is an activity which took place in thecountry that involved the perversion and the corruption of many of ouroutstanding research centers in this country, with CIA funds, where some of ourtop researchers were unwittingly involved in research sponsored by the Agency inwhich they had no knowledge of the background or the support for. Much of it wasdone with American citizens who were completely unknowing in terms of takingvarious drugs, and there are perhaps any number of Americans who are walkingaround today on the east coast or west coast who were given drugs, with all thekinds of physical and psychological damage that can be caused.

This intolerability has given rise to the consolingworld-views of religion …—Peter Dale Scott, Deep Politics1The séance was the true laboratory for the study of multiple personality.—Daniel Lomas, The Haunted Self 2We in the West have always had a hard time with madness. We can’t define it, butwe know what it is when we see it. Like the term “insanity,” it is not aclinical definition of a mental state or disorder, but a general epithet orlegal characterization. Michel Foucault has written extensively and eloquentlyabout the ways in which the West has viewed and treated the “mad,” and we areall familiar with the cliches that tell us that primitive people believed themad were “touched by the gods,” and were therefore revered.Mircea Eliade has written at length about the shamanistic vocation and hasdescribed the agonies of the shaman-to-be as a psychopathology, thus linking therituals of initiation with the frightening madness of the berserker and “witchdoctor.” Yet, Eliade was not the only one to see something redemptive andsalvageable in the acute mental disorders of the primitive occultists.Government leaders and military men also found reason to rejoice in thegibberings of the hopelessly insane.While a detailed examination of the official attitudes towards mental illness isbeyond the scope of this work, a brief look at the unwholesome way in whichmental illness has been confused with both government policies and tacticalweapons is in order.What we undertake to show in this chapter is nothing less than a technique forgoing insane. So far, most discussions of this topic have been general andallusive. We will attempt a more direct approach here. Based on the practices ofvoluntary madmen going back millennia, and refined by modern psychiatric andbehaviorist methods as shown in the papers and reports coming out of militaryand intelligence agency mind-control and behavior-control programs, the goal ofthis technique is to go mad temporarily and return in one piece.Because this is probably the first time such a technique has ever been describedfully, the vocabulary and concepts may appear strange at first, bordering on thesuperstitious. Remember that this is a process of going insane, and a bizarre oroff-beat appearance should not be demoralizing.What we are going to do is utilize the methodology of the shaman and themagician, the artist and the visionary—who have made a kind of science out ofthis temporary insanity but within the framework of the projects of Cameron,Estabrooks, Gottlieb, et al. In other words, we will use occultism and mindcontrol to describe each other and so come to a better understanding of both.Once the basic method of “voluntary madness” is understood by examining theactual processes, then we can better understand how it is being used today.Merely reading the following pages will not cause madness; but puttingthe methods into practice in a serious attempt will cause serious psychicdislocation. Therefore caution is necessary.SET AND SETTINGMagick is the art and science of causing change to occur in conformity withwill.—Aleister CrowleyMany of our more famous artists, writers and musicians have had serious mentalproblems. We can think of Van Gogh, Artaud, Nietzsche, and many others who havegone insane, either temporarily or permanently. It almost seems a prerequisitefor creativity. What is not so well known, though, is that there was a tendencyamong artists of the past hundred years or so to court insanity as a means ofreaching altered states of consciousness. The boundary between the artist andthe psychopath is a shifting one, more of a twilight horizon in which it isdifficult to separate sea and sky than a solid firebreak designed to protecthearth and home. What is even more interesting is that the same concept is atthe heart of mysticism and magic. Shamans, artists, mystics … and psychopaths.When the CIA began to unravel the smoking entrails of consciousness, theyunderstood that the artistic community was an obvious medium for theirexperimentation. After all, didn’t novelist and philosopher Aldous Huxley—acolleague of CIA drug experimenter and psychic researcher Dr. Humphrey Ormond,who provided some of the drugs Huxley took—write the seminal manifesto for thedrug culture in The Doors of Perception? And didn’t the cult-rock band The Doorstake their name, inspiration and modus vivendi from Huxley’s work? And didn’tJim Morrison of The Doors eventually become initiated into witchcraft? Justpulling at that single thread is suggestive enough. See what happens when wepull at the entire tapestry.The psycho-biographies of artists and writers—full of alcohol, drugs, sex, and“derangement”—are rarely informative when it comes to the actual processes thatled them on their individual paths to perdition. We can read a biography ofAugust Strindberg and still be no closer to the process he (successfully)followed that led him into insanity and back out again. Yet, if we take a pagefrom the acid book of the Sixties, we just might be able to understand whathappened to these people and what really goes on in the heart and soul ofcreative thinkers when they decide to test the boundaries of reality andconsciousness.Anyone who went through the Sixties (and can still remember them) will find thephrase “set and setting” very familiar. Basically, it means that before onetakes an acid trip—before, that is, one ingests a tab of LSD-25—it is vitallyimportant to ensure that the environment is conducive to the “trip” and thatone’s mental state is likewise calm and receptive. This “hallowing” of the spacebefore a religious ritual (and, indeed, before the twentieth century the onlypeople who took hallucinogens were those being initiated into shamanistic cults,in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia) is something we come across in everyinstance of occult and religious practice. While this is perceived byanthropologists and archaeologists as a kind of superstitious identification ofthe city-state or the temple with heaven itself, when we apply this samereasoning to the acid trip or the psilocybin experience, we discover that it isvitally important to the success of the undertaking that the environment withinwhich one “drops acid” has been carefully selected and prepared beforehand. Itwas not unusual in the Sixties to see the environment prepared with burningincense, candles, soft music, etc. And, as in the tantric and yogic ashrams ofthe East, there was generally also a Guide.The guided trip was a mainstay of the acid culture in the early days of thePostwar era. It was patterned—consciously or unconsciously—after the rites ofthe Mexican shamans who performed their initiations with peyote (mescaline) ormushrooms (psilocybin). Naturally, as acid became more and more popular andeasily available, it lost its “sacramental” allure and simply became anotherdrug, another escape valve from society and the environment, and then weexperienced the burn-outs and the suicides and all the trauma of the “bad trip.”There was a precedent for all of this in the workbooks of the Europeanceremonial magicians, the mysterious grimoires. While it was believed that thedruggies who were going “voluntarily mad” were some kind of modern socialaberration, the grimoires were evidence that going insane voluntarily was a longand serious tradition going back for nearly a thousand years. Before themedieval grimoires, however, there were books of magic spells in ancient Egyptand even spells carved into wet clay cylinders in the firelight of Mesopotamiaand Sumer. Yet, the casting of spells is not, in and of itself, the centralelement of ceremonial magic, and these practices—while cognate with magic—arenot what we seek, for a successful practitioner of magic is one who has madesome contact with the Other. The spells and workbooks of the sorcerer and witchare only recipes to assist one who has already become a “cook.”In the grimoires, we find the same reliance upon set and setting that we willcome across again, hundreds of years later in a different context. (Set andsetting will also be recognized as a crucial element in psychological warfareand interrogation techniques. The process is all of a piece, and we may be ableto understand the entire gestalt better if we look at how each of thesepractices describes and reinforces the others.)In order to become a successful magician—according to the grimoires— one mustfirst evoke spiritual forces. One must make contact with the spirit world. Thisis identical to the training of a shaman, the more primitive and evenpre-literate school of magic. For the ceremonial magician, “set and setting” iscrucial. It lays the groundwork for the ritual to follow, and if it is notmeticulously planned beforehand then the entire endeavor is doomed to failure.The day and time for the ritual of evoking spiritual forces must be selectedlong in advance. This will be based on the nature of the spiritual force to beevoked. For the European ceremonial magician—as for the Asian fakir, tantrist,saddhu, or Daoist—this is linked to astrological data. For instance, there arespiritual forces (angels, demons, elementals) that have particular affinity forone or other of the stars or planets or zodiacal signs or elements. Once theappropriate spiritual force has been identified, and its affinity understood,then a day and hour appropriate to that affinity is selected for the ritual.This is “set and setting” taken to an extreme, perhaps, but it is based on anassumption that was quite common in medieval times and, actually, for thousandsof years of recorded human history before then: the doctrine of correspondences.This doctrine may fairly be said to be the doctrine of “coincidences” as well,as we shall see, and is very probably the key to the entire realm of what wehave been calling “sinister forces.”The Romanian-born historian of religion, Ioan Culianu, was probably the first todelve deeply into the medieval doctrine of the occult link and to show itsrelevance not only to the history of the Renaissance but to modern history aswell. His published writings on the subject are nothing short of revolutionary,both for their breadth of scholarship as well as for the brilliant way heexpresses his theories. It is a serious and tragic loss to the history ofreligion that he was murdered at the University of Chicago in 1991, a crime thathas remained unsolved but, which has been laid at the door of the Romaniansecret police.Culianu’s most fascinating contribution was Eros and Magic in the Renaissance, awork that is based in part on the writings of the philosopher-magician GiordanoBruno and particularly on his De vinculis, a work that surpasses Machiavelli’sThe Prince in its sheer audacity. De vinculis—or “Of the link”—is a virtualoperating manual for consensus reality. While it appears on its face to be anintroduction to a method of conjuring demons, it is also a guide topsychological warfare, probably the earliest ever written. Culianu understoodthe relationship between magic and politics as no other before him, and whilehis scholarship may be daunting to a non-academic it is nonetheless a valuablecontribution to this discussion.There is no space to go into a detailed exposition of Eros and Magic, butinstead we will focus on De vinculis and Giordano Bruno, because De vinculis isabout more than just the magical link, and Giordano Bruno is more than just aphilosopher who ran afoul of the Inquisition. In fact, Bruno was himself amagician-spy, in the mold of the English magician-spy John Dee, and their pathscrossed more than once.Giordano Bruno was a Neapolitan philosopher, writer, former priest, heretic, andwas excommunicated from the Church when he wrote his literary masterpieces.Bruno is probably the closest the western world has come to the livingembodiment of the satanic priest, a character that Dennis Wheatley has createdin several of his occult novels and which seems fantastic in the present-day. He“aspired to the mantle” of Dr. John Dee,3 the magician, mathematician,astrologer and spy in the service of Queen Elizabeth I of England, a manrenowned throughout Europe for the breadth of his knowledge of both the mundaneand the spiritual realms. It was to the same service of Elizabeth I thatGiordano Bruno once worked as a deep-cover intelligence officer, uncoveringCatholic conspiracies against the Queen during his stay at a house in London.Bruno’s hatred of the Catholic Church ran very deep. He had been a Catholicpriest himself, one who abandoned the Holy Orders and “defrocked” himself,becoming in the process excommunicate and forbidden by the Church to even attendMass, much less celebrate it. His hatred of what he saw as Papal idiocy andcriminality led him to support various Protestant groups and operations at everyopportunity, although he did not consider himself a Christian at all much less aProtestant, and could be more correctly identified as a kind of pagan, a New Agephilosopher quite ahead of his time; certainly, he was a magician, and the bulkof his writings after the “Embassy affair” of 1584—in which his espionageactivities against French Ambassador to England Michel de Castelnau resulted inthe arrest and execution of various individuals who were conspiring with theChurch against the Queen—were about occultism.4Bruno is described as using or contemplating four “arms” or methods of topplingthe Papacy: armed force, fraud (or, as Bruno called it, the “art ofdissimulation” which, in Bruno’s case, included espionage), ridicule, andmagic.5…his last works … are indeed about magic … showing that he intended to pull offthe ultimate coup against the papacy by personally enchanting Pope Clement VIII… one might well think that having failed to shake the papacy by force, fraud orridicule he was driven to magic as a last resort. And I doubt that we can useagainst it the history of a cool-headed secret agent we now know, for it seemsfairly clear to me that, in exploring in De vinculis the ways by whichaffinities personal and cosmic might be manipulated for political ends, Brunowas thinking of his management of Castelnau as a model of how the thing shouldbe done.6In Giordano Bruno and the Embassy Affair, John Bossy records several instancesin which Bruno and Dr. Dee met each other, either at Dee’s home in Mortlake orin Prague. Dee was reputed to have the best library in England, and they shareda common interest in the occult as well as in espionage. As mentioned in UnholyAlliance, there is no doubt now that John Dee was a spy for the court of QueenElizabeth I at a time when religious, colonial and territorial wars wererampant. The original 007—literally—Dee was involved in espionage for the queenduring his visits to the Continent, where he ran into Bruno once again inPrague, the site of the famous evocation of the angelic forces that has comedown to us as the system of Enochian magic, a system very badly understood bymany of today’s practitioners.Bruno would eventually be captured by the Inquisition and put to death by beingburned at the stake in Campo dei Fiori in Rome on February 17, 1600, on ordersof the same Pope Clement VIII he had attempted to destroy through magic. Tounderstand what Bruno was up to—and to understand even better how this systemhas been used since then by politicians, military strategists, spies andterrorists—we will look at De vinculis, which gives the show away.As far as I know, this small book has not been translated into English althoughboth Latin and Italian copies exist. I base my brief discussion on my owntranslations of same as well as on Ioan Culianu’s extended study of Bruno andhis work.Is the Western State, in our time, a true magician, or is it a sorcerer’sapprentice who sets in motion dark and uncontrollable forces?—Ioan P. Culianu7Ioan Culianu (whose patronymic is spelled variously as Culianu, Coulianu,Couliano) was born on January 5, 1950 in Romania at a time of tremendouspolitical upheaval in that country, due to the Communist takeover of thegovernment and the abdication of the young King Michael. His story is onefamiliar to many Eastern Europeans of a certain age: political repression,poverty, lack of exposure to the West and its suspiciously alluring ideas ofdemocracy and capitalism. The man who would become his mentor, the extremelyinfluential Mircea Eliade, was also a Romanian, and one who had made his home inthe West … specifically at the University of Chicago where he made a name forhimself as an authority in the history of religions. Eliade’s books—notablyShamanism, The Myth of the Eternal Return, The Quest and Images and Symbols—havebeen and will be cited many times during thecourse of this work.Eliade was a hero to the young Culianu, who worked assiduously to get himselfnoticed by the master with an eye to working with him in the United States.Emigrating to Italy—actually overstaying on a special exit visa from Romaniathat allowed him to attend a seminar there—he wound up in a camp for displacedpersons and even attempted suicide, driven to despair over his lack of legalstatus and any way to earn a living, coupled with increasingly dismal news fromhome. Eventually, however, he managed to work his way out of his depression andthrough a series of contacts and clever networking his brilliance came to theattention of the University of Milan, and he began to write many excellentarticles, reviews and monographs on Renaissance studies, philosophy, religion,and related subjects during his tenure there and at the Netherlands Institutefor Advanced Study, where he was a Fellow.This outpouring of work and garnership of professional accolades finally earnedhim the attention of Mircea Eliade, and he eventually wound up in America with aprofessorship at the same University of Chicago in 1985.This was largely due to the impact of two important works published by Culianuin 1984. One was a study of shamanism and ecstasy; the next was Eros and Magicin the Renaissance, a work begun when Culianu was only nineteen. It is on thebasis of this last work that his reputation was assured, both in Europe (whereit was first published in France) and then in the United States when Eros andMagic became available in English translation. (It was also in 1984 thatArchbishop Valerian Trifa of the Romanian Orthodox Church was finally deported,when it became known that he had been a Nazi and member of the Iron Guard duringthe war; in fact, it fell upon Culianu’s shoulders to defend his mentor, MirceaEliade, from the same claim, once it was revealed that Eliade—à la Carl Jung—hadwritten admiringly of the Iron Guardists, albeit before their name becamesynonymous with the worst sort of atrocities.)Culianu himself was fascinated by the occult and what occultism says aboutreality and consciousness. He studied the medieval witchcraft trials,Renaissance magic, the Tarot, even conducting seminars on the symbolism in thepopular David Lynch television series Twin Peaks. He wrote about gnosticism,shamanism, the use of drugs in altered states of consciousness … and all from aserious, academic viewpoint with virtually every line buttressed by extensivecitations and primary sources in Latin, Italian, German, English, and many otherlanguages. He was at once serious and playful, a man who felt that modernsociety had lost its connection to the miraculous, to the metaphysical, and thatbecause of this loss we were in no position to understand the writings of menlike Bruno who formulated entire technologies for reorganizing the human mind,beginning with memory and extending to every mental and psychological faculty.Eros and Magic in the Renaissance concentrates on three seminal figures inRenaissance philosophy, magic, and—at least in Bruno’s case—politics. Aside fromGiordano Bruno, Culianu discusses Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola:three men who had an enormous influence over the development of hermetic thoughtduring the Renaissance. Pico della Mirandola was a student of Ficino, andGiordano Bruno drew his inspiration from both.Although Bruno had written a number of famous and influential works, Culianuconcentrates on De vinculis en genere, sometimes referred to simply as Devinculis or “Of Links.” These links, according to Bruno, are those between humanbeings, but they could just as easily be those that link God to humans; thelinks to which he refers are any connections that could be made between anycreated objects at all. Magic is the art of manipulating these links, linkswhich have been activated through the desire of the magician; thus magic is, inother words, eros.Eros forges connections between human beings, as we have all witnessed and as weare all the tangible result. Eros is a field of attraction between two objects;in human terms, we may call this attraction “love” or “fascination” or“chemistry,” etc. When the attraction exists between inanimate objects, otherterms might be used, but according to Bruno (and the generations of hermeticists before him) they are all variations of the same theme. This is magic,pure and simple. Even Aleister Crowley was not able to refrain from using averse from the Book of the Law as a kind of slogan: Do what thou wilt shall bethe whole of the Law; Love is the law, love under Will. This is an accuratesummation of Bruno’s technology, and what Culianu discovered, for Culianu—indescribing Bruno’s contribution to occult philosophy—states that Bruno’s idealmagician “epitomizes the most perfect, hence the least human, product of the ageof phantasms: a person capable of free will untrammeled by the turgid forces ofhis nature, which he has learned to dominate” (emphasis in original).8This is virtually identical to Crowley’s much-overused and misunderstood slogan,and reveals that both the late-Renaissance magician Giordano Bruno and theearly-twentieth-century magician Aleister Crowley were in agreement on the coreissue of magical technology. What is important for us to consider is whether ornot the knowledge of this technology was disseminated more widely than thenarrow and shadowy corridors of the secret societies.For Bruno took this hermetic concept one step further, to the realm of politics.And so did Culianu.Securitate, a friend once said, they’re all mystics.—Ted Anton9It is no secret that the goal of the Nazi Party under Hitler, Hess and Himmlerwas nothing less than the creation of a “new man.” Hitler mentioned thisrepeatedly, and corroborating evidence is given in the author’s previous work.The goal of the occult and political programs of the Third Reich was thejump-starting of human evolution to the next stage. Whether or not such aprocess is possible is beside the point; what concerns us here is whatthe leaders of the Reich understood this next stage to be.Throughout the writings and declarations of the “theologians” of the ThirdReich—everyone from Eckart to Rosenberg to Darre to Rahn to Wiligut there is anemphasis on the idea of the lost psychic powers of the Aryan race due topollution of the blood. That the New Aryan Man would be possessed of thesepowers was taken for granted by Wiligut and his protégés. That the Third Reichitself was perceived to be the result of a “triumph of the Will is clear, bothfrom the writings of Hitler and his colleagues as well as from that famous filmby Leni Riefenstahl. The early anti-Semitic mystics—men like Lanz von Liebenfelsand Guido von List—wrote of the seductive charms of the Jewish woman, and of theenslavement of Aryan men to these erotic creatures; and of the necessity toreject their advances and to gain control over one’s own libidos: to put one’semotions and sexuality under direct conscious control. In this sense, thephenomenon of the Third Reich can be seen as a validation of the occult theoriesof Bruno and others; indeed, the attraction of Jung, Eliade and others to theinitial appearance of the Nazi Party is most likely due to this transcendentalnature, this occult platform of the Party that was so much in agreement with thetechnologies of the Hermeticists. It was an error to suppose that just because apolitical party—or, more correctly in this case, a cult—should have adopted suchtheories and technologies, they were, therefore, spiritually enlightened orilluminated. When the horrors of the Third Reich became known, men like Jung andEliade distanced themselves from it as much as possible and came away with arude awakening: that not everyone who puts occult theories into practice is a“white magician,” and that having occult abilities does not automatically implymoral superiority. If anything, one lesson of the Third Reich can be summarizedas the realization that occult technologies can be utilized by any individual orgroup, regardless of their political affiliation or spiritual growth. This was alesson that was taken to heart by Soviet intelligence, Chinese and Koreanintelligence, the Romanian secret police (the Securitate), Hamas, Hizbolleh,Al-Qaeda, and by the men of MK-ULTRA.But before terrorism became an accepted tool of international diplomacy, andinterrogation refined to the astonishing degree that it has been in thetwentieth century, there was the Renaissance. At that time, the West was dividedby religious wars. Catholics and Protestants were the main combatants, althoughthe Jews were still being persecuted as well. And even among the Protestantsthere was conflict, with various groups claiming to be the sole authority on thepure, unadulterated practice of Christianity. The Catholic Church, with specialemphasis on the Pope in Rome, was considered to be a great evil: a debauched,degenerate, corrupt organization that was more interested in material wealth andtemporal power than in spiritual attainments. By the time Martin Luther nailedhis famous ninety-five theses to the door of the cathedral (October 31, 1517 …Halloween and the day the gates of the underworld are opened), the Reformationhad begun.While authorities are divided as to the dates when Renaissance and Reformationboth began and ended (and, indeed, the dates are different for differentcountries, with England coming in later than the Continent), it can be said thatthe Renaissance began in Italy either as early as the twelfth or as late as thefourteenth century, as Europe shrugged itself awake from the so-called DarkAges, and reached its height with the fall of Constantinople in 1453 andparticularly with the discovery of America and the expulsion of the last MuslimCaliphate from Spain in 1492. Thus, Martin Luther’s attack on the CatholicChurch took place in a time feverish with theological, philosophical,metaphysical, artistic and political changes.For Marsilio Ficino, it was the rebirth of Platonic philosophy thatcharacterized the era, a kind of pagan sensibility that was refined andredefined by Pico della Mirandolla and then, eventually, by Giordano Brunohimself. This amalgamation of Greek and Byzantine philosophy and metaphysicswith Arab science, Jewish mysticism and Catholic ritual and liturgical practicescreated an explosion of consciousness among the intelligentsia of Europe. TheGreek gods were rediscovered and became a kind of esoteric shorthand for theartists, poets, and philosophers of the time; Egyptian religion—particularly theas-yet undeciphered hieroglyphics—became a fascination for many, as it seemed tobe a kind of system that communicated directly to the soul, to the unconsciousmind. The Renaissance was a time of Image, both in the Art of Memory and in theArt of Magic, and at the time of the Inquisition’s investigation of Bruno it wasbelieved that there was really no difference between the two. Indeed, Bruno washard put to defend the Art of Memory as a science that had nothing to do withMagic; a sly dissimulation by the master of the art of subterfuge, since he knewas well as anyone else that the two practices are mutually dependent.That the manipulation of a human being’s memory is tantamount to control overhis consciousness is something that was clearly understood by the magicians ofthe Renaissance and rediscovered by the intelligence officers of the twentiethcentury; but while the latter threw the entire weight of hypnosis, drugs,electroshock and other heavy-handed machinery at their subjects, Bruno cautioneda lighter touch. It was necessary that his subjects be unaware of hisintentions, that they be charmed into performing those actions he required. Youcouldn’t accomplish this with drugs and psychotherapy unless you wiped thememory and consciousness of the subject clean, as Ewen Cameron tried to do, andthat took a lot of time and energy and resources, and the results were neververy reliable or consistent. Bruno’s approach might today be called“subliminal,” that is, below the threshold of conscious awareness. While theoperator may train himself in these techniques while in a heightened state ofawareness brought about by meditation, ritual, drugs, “Tantric” sex and otherdevices, it was necessary that the target be free to go about his lifeuninterrupted and oblivious. Just as one is not aware of the process of fallingin love—of all the thousand impressions and subconscious signals that are sentand received in the course of a relationship—just so the target of Bruno’s magicwould not be aware that he was being “bewitched,” i.e., psychologicallymanipulated, until it was too late. The process, according to Bruno and thosebefore him, was virtually identical. Hence, eros is magic because eros chargesor activates the link.According to Bruno, there is a network of “links” (or we may call them“connections”) that “fills the universe.” This is actually a sophisticatedconcept for a fifteenth century philosopher to expound, for it turns up again inthe idea of the “matrix,” both in quantum physics as well as in the popularmotion picture series of the same name. These links may be activated by a forcethat resides in the body and that proceeds from the body, what Bruno callsmetaphorically the “hand that binds” which “throws out its snares” (De vinculis,I).No one is immune from this phenomenon. Every type of person may be affected bythe judicious application of this technique. The type of “knot” or “binding”used depends on the target; the use of images is especially employed as amechanism for attracting the binding energy. According to Bruno, one must studyone’s target carefully and create what today we would call a psychologicalprofile of the intended victim. This will give an accurate picture of the stateof the victim’s consciousness: the mental images with which he surroundshimself, images that can be manipulated by the magician. The Chinesephilosophers say that in order to know someone or something, “know what iteats”; Bruno would have said, “know what it loves,” for in that love is the keyto its submission.For Bruno, love is the occult force that binds the universe together, and if onecan understand love and understand how others love and what they love, then onecan control them through their passions and their appetites. If reality is whatour conscious minds make of it—a deliberate ordering of sensations in categoriesof priority, translated by our brain as images of light and dark, color, sound,dimension, etc.—then the way into the mind of another is through the images heor she manufactures. Rather than create a whole, complex reality that will betranslated and identified by the subject’s brain, one simply creates the imagesof the desired reality, working backwards from the image to the result desired.Bruno understood that thought is a succession of images in the “mind’s eye”;that memory is a storehouse of images, as his promotion of the Art of Memoryexploits. Culianu calls the magician the “artist of memory,” and this is anextremely important point; else, why did the mind-control experts concentrate soprofoundly on ordering and redesigning the memory of selected subjects? Bruno’sstrategy employed a technique of going directly to the brain through the use ofimages, creating an alternate reality over which he was the master. In order forthis system to work, it was necessary that the target be “seduced” by theimages, i.e., “fall in love” in a sense with the image presented by the magicianand thereby allow it to work in his consciousness. For this to happen, themagician himself must expend great amounts of energy—of passion, really—throughthat image in order to create the “link,” in order to “enchain” the other personor persons and make them instruments of his will. As a corollary, Bruno insiststhat the magician not allow himself to fall in love with his own images, lest hebecome enslaved by them and ultimately destroyed. Thus, the magician placeshimself above love—above all the human passions and desires—so that he is notenchained in turn. Culianu understands that this seems at first glance to be acontradiction: the magician employs love and all the machinations andsubterfuges of love, of eros, of passion and desire in order to seduce—toenchain or enslave—the will of others; he must experience love deeply, that“derangement of the senses” of which Rimbaud is the most famous exponent; yet hemust not be affected by love, not “fall in love” himself even as he seems to bethe ultimate lover, the most desirable suitor, working on the sensory apparatusof his victim with all the stored erotic energy at his disposal for, finally,the perfect magician is one who remains celibate, who retains his seed and usesthe accumulated energy to power his magic. He must believe he is in love withhis subject at the time he works his magic, and not at any other time. This isour introduction, not only to the Manson Secret, but also to the televisionpreacher, the popular politician, the salesman, the advertising executive.Culianu understood all of this, and was perhaps the first person to clarify andenlarge upon this idea.At least, until he was murdered on May 21, 1991 at the age of 41.Culianu’s political involvements were largely unknown or misunderstood by hiscolleagues. One would have had to have a good working knowledge of the Byzantineconspiracies and intrigues of Romanian politics to get an inkling of Culianu’sdangerous activities. He could not resist writing against the dictatorialCeaucescu regime, although at times his writings were more in the way of a ludusserius, a kind of game involving symbolic figures, than they were out-and-outbroadsides against the Communist leader and his secret police, the Securitate.But Culianu was a living symbol of the rewards that freedom of thought, freedomof expression, and the free and open exchange of intellectual ideas could bring.Further, he was a problem for both sides of the Romanian problem: right andleft. Although there is no doubt that he was a sincere anti-Communist—living andsuffering under a Soviet-style Eastern European dictatorship is enough toconvert anyone to democracy and the free-market system, without even knowingwhat those concepts really represent—he was also anti-Nazi. This, in the contextof Eastern European politics, was a difficult position to maintain, for it meantthat he attracted enemies from both the Securitate and from various undergroundmovements that had their origins in the ideas, if not in the actual membershiproles, of the Romanian Nazi Iron Guard.Six years previously, Valerian Trifa had been deported from the United States.This former Iron Guard leader and dedicated anti-Semite had come to America andtaken by force the Romanian Orthodox Church, proclaiming himself its archbishopand leader. This was a man who had never been ordained a priest, nor had he anytheological or ecclesiastical training whatsoever, a man who was little morethan a violent thug and ringleader of a network of Iron Guardists from NorthAmerica to South America, Europe, and Australia. When some US governmentofficials discovered that Trifa had actually been a Nazi, they worked at gettinghis citizenship revoked, which resulted in his eventual deportation in 1984.Although Trifa himself was deported, he was not removed as the head of theRomanian Orthodox Church nor is there any evidence that he relaxed his controlover the global Iron Guard network.At the same time, Romanian secret police were active in the United States; thus,Culianu was surrounded by enemies who would have stopped at nothing if he wasidentified as a threat to the regime, or to the underground Iron Guard network.As Mircea Eliade’s literary executor after his death in 1986, he also had accessto documents concerning his mentor’s Iron Guardaffiliations, evidence that he had written articles in the 1930s supportive offascism and the Iron Guard itself, evidence that troubled Culianu deeply.10Culianu himself had written articles condemning the right-wing in Romania, whichenraged the fascists who had thought he was one of them. Truly, the shots thatwere fired in the men’s toilet at the University of Chicago from a .25 caliberBeretta—killing Culianu execution style, to the head—could have come fromanywhere. Although the crime remains unsolved to this day despite heavy FBIinvolvement in the case, it is a certainty that what killed the young professorof religion was the very force he had been studying and writing about soextensively and with such penetrating insight.INITIATION, INTERROGATIONThe doctrine of correspondences assumes that everything in reality is somehowlinked to everything else in some way; that the microcosmic world is a perfectimage of the macrocosmic world; and that if we can cause a change to occur inthe microcosm it will reflect in a corresponding change in the macrocosm. Thisis the essence of practical magic, and it is nothing less than a realizationthat there is a way to defeat the space-time continuum. It is an attempt tounderstand—and to exploit—“non-locality,” a concept familiar to quantumphysicists and which we shall examine in a later chapter. For now, suffice it tosay that for the magician there is no such thing as a coincidence; for themagician, every coincidence is the manifestation of a subtle correspondence.While we experience coincidences in life as if they were accidents, the magicianturns the tables and utilizes coincidence proactively as a way of causing changeto occur in the real world.We will examine this mechanism more fully a bit later on. For now, let us lookat the technology of magic where we will see some parallels in modernpsychology, particularly in multiple personality disorder and other forms ofpsychosis.The magician, having selected the day and time of his ritual, must also selectthe appropriate location. Many grimoires give suggestions ranging from abandonedchurchyards to lonely forests to a room in one’s own home that has been strippedof all ornamentation. The idea behind each of these recommendations isparticular to the type of ritual being performed. In the evocation of demonicforces, for instance, a graveyard would be an appropriate locale because itwould cause feelings of dread and heightened anxiety in the magician, sentimentswhich are conducive to the experience of confronting evil firsthand. Even moreimportantly, such an environment would be a reminder to the magician that whathe is undertaking is a dangerous endeavor and that he should not turn his backfor a moment on the forces thus externalized.There is another reason for choosing an outdoor site, and that is one of simpleexpedience: spiritual forces need to clothe themselves in bits and pieces ofreality in order to become “visible” to the magician. This is known as the“material basis” in modern occult parlance. Something must be available for theforce to “inhabit,” if only briefly, so that it may become sensible to themagician. This can range from the smoke of burning incense to a drop of ink in abowl of water, to the rustling of leaves on a nearby tree or even a haplessforest animal who may be in the vicinity.In a closed room, where the environment is one hundred percent controlled anddesigned by the magician, this basis may be incense smoke or ink in water, asmentioned, or may even be a pure hallucination caused by the sensory deprivationtechniques we will examine shortly. Whatever the case, the environment for theritual must be carefully chosen in advance and prepared for the ritual by themagician.Space and time, the ritual location and the day and hour of its performance,have now been manipulated by the magician to a certain extent, based on thedoctrine of correspondences. That is “setting.” Now the magician must concernhimself with “set.”“Set,” in this case as it is in the case of the LSD trip, is the mental state ofthe person undergoing the experience. The grimoires usually specify a period offasting, celibacy and prayer to precede the actual performance of the ritual.This period may be anything from a few days before the ritual to months inadvance. During this time, the magician must concentrate on the ritual to beperformed, and must become “inflamed with prayer.” As the day and hour of theritual approaches, the praying and fasting is stepped up. The entire being ofthe magician—body and soul—is devoted to the ritual and everything else, everyextraneous thought and desire, must be eradicated from his consciousness. Thisis a kind of controlled fanaticism, fanaticism focused towards a specific goalat a specific time and place.The shaman, for his initiation, becomes ill at first: feverish, delusional, neardead, psychotic. The magician also becomes deranged, for as elevated as thisspiritual state may seem—constant prayer, celibacy, fasting—it shares a greatdeal with the psychotic state. After all, this entire uncomfortable existence issurrounded by images of spiritual forces, by the manufacture and preparation ofexotic instruments designed to force obedience from those forces, by thecreation of a blank book in which to record the experience and—in the case ofsome grimoires—to actually receive the signature and seal of the spirit evoked.After a long period with very little food, no sexual activity of any kind, andconstant focus and concentration on invisible beings, one could safely say thatthe magician is entering a state of controlled psychosis, a state leadingdeliberately up to the evocation of one of these invisible beings to visibleappearance. What the shaman was doing in the forest or jungle by himself, at themercy of visions of hideous torment, the magician does to himself deliberatelyin his European city or town, driving himself slowly insane, loosening his gripon “reality” so that he may catch a glimpse of the sinister forces that operatebelow the radar of even our most sophisticated science. The very predicate thatthese forces exist, and can be summoned, would be enough to sentence many amodern man or woman to thirty days of observation in a mental ward. Theinvestment of time, money, and consciousness in the effort to summon, and tocommunicate with, these forces contribute to a state of mind in the magicianthat is difficult to describe. He builds up within himself a determination toknow the unknowable, to see the unseeable, to do the undoable, and this sets upa psychic tension in the magician that can easily lead to a nervous breakdown,or worse.One of the most accessible of the modern practitioners of this art was the lateFrancis Israel Regardie, one time secretary to Aleister Crowley and—oddlyenough—one-time associate of Kennedy assassination researcher Mary Ferrell.Regardie went on record several times insisting that anyone desiring to go onthe path of occult attainment represented by ceremonial magic first undergo aperiod of psychological analysis and therapy.11A disturbed mind would find the ceremony and ritual of magic too comfortable,and would find itself a prisoner of the unreal, of the Other. The practice ofmagic by such a mind would further its derangement, but without the hope orexpectation that a state superior to sanity would be achieved; rather, thehealth of such a mind would be forfeit if it undertook a practice of magicalone, without the benefit of a strict and observant guide. The resultantanxiety—in which the “magician” would see signs and portents everywhere, in achaos of iconography that is perhaps best represented by the type of conspiracytheorist who believes that the goal of all those wealthy men and governmentacronyms is to destabilize him personally—leads easily to what the DSM calls“paranoid schizophrenia,” from which the road back to mental health is long andpainful. This is because magic, as it is known in the West, is a highlyintellectual art. The psychological edifice created by a knowledge of ancienttongues and scripts, the minutiae of astrology, the language of symbolism, allcombine in a structure whose internal logic serves as a means by which one canboth create the ritual and decipher its outcome. A certain objectivity isrequired, and this is why a strong grasp of the principles of the doctrine ofcorrespondences is so necessary, for this is the alphabet and the vocabulary ofvisions, dreams, nightmares, and the disturbing coincidences that surround themagician once embarked on this mysterious quest.To make matters even more confusing, the set of correspondences is not identicalfrom culture to culture, from society to society. A Siberian shaman may use oneset of correspondences familiar to him due to the flora, fauna and folk religionof his environment; the European ceremonial magician will use another, even moreelaborate, set; and the voodoo priest yet another. However, attempts have beenmade to show that these different sets of correspondences do share some basicinformation, that there is a common denominator to all cultures and practiceseven though they may seem to differ widely. The Golden Dawn of the latenineteenth century sought to do just that, by using the Jewish Qabala and Treeof Life as a template upon which to “fit” the belief systems (and, thus, thecorrespondence systems) of every known culture, past and present. AleisterCrowley, himself an initiate of the Golden Dawn, attempted to perfect thatsystem with the help of several of his friends, and the result is the impressiveLiber 777. This is nothing less than a kind of database of religious and occultbeliefs and practices, all set out on the 10 spheres and 22 paths of theQabalistic Tree of Life. Thus, we can see at a glance how specific symbols inreligious processes as disparate as Hinduism and Islam, Christianity andBuddhism, Greek and Roman mythology, etc. all correspond to each other in someway. While this was intended both as an aid in understanding different religionsand as a means of creating occult rituals that would take into consideration aprofound depth of meaning cutting across geography and millenia, it is also auseful place to begin comprehending the activity of what the Dutch novelistCouperus called “the hidden force.” An understanding of the system ofcorrespondences enables us to grasp the mechanism of what we have becomeaccustomed to call “coincidence.”We will investigate coincidence and synchronicity in greater detail in a laterchapter. For now, we should understand that—for the occultist—there is truly “nosuch thing as coincidence,” or, more accurately, that coincidence is a clue thatdeeper connections exist between observable phenomena, that another force ofnature is at work that we don’t understand, but which has something to do withwhat quantum physics means when they refer to “non-locality.” To New OrleansDistrict Attorney Jim Garrison, the accumulation of coincidence in the Kennedyassassination case meant that intelligence agencies were at work behind thescenes. That he was correct should be beyond doubt, regardless of whether or notyou believe Oswald acted alone. What we will do in this chapter, and in thisentire book, is to go a layer deeper than political conspiracy and examine amysterious and dangerous structure of sinister forces that “conspire” at a levelwhere science and magic, magic and politics, meet.That is our “set and setting.”The magician’s magic circle is designed with a dual purpose in mind, and that isperhaps why it is usually portrayed as two concentric circles. In a sense, themagic circle—the setting—is needed to contain the mental focus of the magicianwithin a narrowly structured (nine foot diameter, according to many of thegrimoires) space; in another sense, the circle is also designed to keepeverything else out. The grimoires are full of the direst warnings should thecircle ever be breached: such an accident would prove the destruction of themagician. For the duration of the ritual, the magician stays inside the circleand ensures that its physical integrity is maintained.The famous Beat poet and novelist William Burroughs, in a letter to the editorof the Necronomicon, wrote that the magician is like a mafia don, safe withinhis magic circle, sending spiritual forces to do his bidding and not getting hishands dirty. In a very real way, that is the idea. The magician, by expendinghuge amounts of energy and intense mental focus during the days and weeksleading up to the culmination of the ritual, is creating a psychological statein which the energy must be directed somewhere. To a psychologist, this may meanthat the energy is directed inwards, leading to an imbalance in the psyche ofthe operator. To an occultist, however, while there is a very real danger ofjust that, the structure of the ritual is such that channels are designed tomove this energy away from the conscious mind of the operator and outwards, intoa specific space for a specific goal or target. The success or failure of theoccult ritual largely depends, therefore, on the ability of the operator toexternalize this accumulated energy: whether in an evocation of spiritual forcesto visible appearance, in an attempt to heal someone of an illness, to findmoney, or to cause physical or mental harm to another.In order to properly focus the mind and will of the operator, then, the magiccircle and its environment—the setting—must reflect the nature of the specificritual being undertaken. This is where the doctrine of correspondences comesinto play. We have seen that an appropriate time is selected for the ritual,based on astrological principles that correspond to the nature of the ritual orto the spiritual force being evoked. We have seen that a space is also selectedthat would be conducive to the performance of such a ritual. Now that space andtime must be manipulated in such a way that only the stated purpose of theritual—and nothing else—will be permitted in the consciousness of the operator.The selection of the appropriate space and time is already half-way there; it isas if we have chosen a specific highway to a specific town. The performance ofthe ritual itself is akin to driving the car along that highway to reach thattown.By beginning at the right time, at the precise moment specified by the ritual,the magician “stops time” in a sense. The magic circle is commonly thought of asa place between two worlds, a place where the usual laws governing space andtime are waived. As long as the ritual begins at the right time, and no matterhow long the ritual lasts, it is still “that time” in the sense of the ritual.Just as a human being, born at a specific time, is said by the astrologers tobear certain characteristics of that day and year and hour no matter how long helives, so the ritual is “born” at a specific time and place and contains withinitself the characteristics of that time and place. In fact, occultists routinelydraw up horoscope charts for the proposed rituals in advance, as if the ritualswere persons.Before we go much further in this examination, let’s stop here for a moment andlook at how set and setting are used by interrogation experts the world over.It is a truism that the first duty of an interrogation specialist is todisorient his subject. The idea is to make the subject feel as uncomfortable aspossible, and to become confused as to the time and place he is being held.Lights are turned on and off at whim; meals are served at random intervals;sounds are broadcast in close proximity, from the screams of the damned to theshouts and commands of the interrogators/torturers. This is the “softening up”process, designed to make the subject more malleable during the actualinterrogation itself. From a combination of fear, anxiety, and confusion it ishoped that the resistance of the subject is broken down. Rarely is it necessaryto apply actual physical torture to a prisoner to gain cooperation. Those whotorture their prisoners usually do so because they enjoy it, and not because itis necessary. Psychological torture is much more powerful, and is easier toregulate. Physical torture can result in the death or incapacitation of thesubject, rendering the whole exercise a failure.While the magician needs to control every aspect of his environment prior toundertaking the ritual, the interrogator needs to control every aspect of theenvironment of his subject prior to the actual interrogation itself. He beginswith the physical environment and, if he is skilled or lucky, moves on to themental environment. He begins perhaps as an adversary, and then transformshimself over time into a kind of “accomplice” of the subject, someone thesubject can trust. The interrogation subject has become a kind of “materialbasis” for the information the interrogator needs; he is a medium through whichthe information will “speak.” The actual subject himself is of no real use tothe interrogator; his only concern is for the information the subject is hiding.Let us look at a recently declassified CIA manual on interrogation, the famous“KUBARK Counterintelligence Manual,” which was originally circulated (internallyat the CIA) in July 1963 and was declassified (albeit with heavy censorship) inJanuary 1997.12 The following is from Chapter VII: “Planning theCounterintelligence Interrogation,” Section C: “The Specifics”:3. The Interrogation SettingThe room in which the interrogation is to be conducted should be freeof distractions. The colors of walls, ceiling, rugs, and furniture should notbe startling. Pictures should be missing or dull. Whether the furnitureshould include a desk depends not upon the interrogator’s convenience butrather upon the subject’s anticipated reaction to connotations of superiorityand officialdom. A plain table may be preferable. An overstuffed chair forthe use of the interrogatee is sometimes preferable to a straight-backed,wooden chair because if he is made to stand for a lengthy period or isotherwise deprived of physical comfort, the contrast is intensified andincreased disorientation results.… If a new safehouse is to be used as theinterrogation site, it should be studied carefully to be sure that the totalenvironment can be manipulated as desired. (emphases added)As we can see from the preceding, the goal of the interrogator in designing the“setting” for the interrogation is virtually identical to that of the magician.Total control of the environment is uppermost in the mind of the carefulinterrogator. As the document goes on to describe in much more detail,everything from telephones to electrical generators to a “do not disturb” signon the door of the interrogation room is taken into consideration to eliminateevery single instance of interruption and distraction. The need for thedisorientation of the subject is also noted. This type of disorientation willalso take place as a result of the occult ritual, properly performed. It isnothing less than the “derangement of the senses” demanded by the French poetRimbaud and echoed throughout the surrealist movement; or the dictum of TimothyLeary, “Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out,” to which it may be compared. The differenceis that the interrogator is using these techniques on an unwilling and resistantsubject; it is the application of a very old occult technique for modern,intelligence-gathering purposes.In a chapter of the manual entitled “IX. Coercive CounterintelligenceInterrogation of Resistant Sources” we find the following, very revealing,paragraph:1. The more completely the place of confinement eliminates sensory stimuli, themore rapidly and deeply will the interrogatee be affected. Results produced onlyafter weeks or months of imprisonment in an ordinary cell can be duplicated inhours or days in a cell which has no light (or weak artificial light which nevervaries), which is sound-proofed, in which odors are eliminated, etc. Anenvironment still more subject to control, such as water-tank or iron lung, iseven more effective.The purpose of all this sensory deprivation is further clarified:4. The deprivation of stimuli induces regression by depriving the subject’s mindof contact with an outer world and thus forcing it in upon itself. At the sametime, the calculated provision of stimuli during interrogation tends to make theregressed subject view the interrogator as a father-figure. The result,normally, is a strengthening of the subject’s tendencies toward compliance.And there is the crux of the matter: “regression.” As the authors of the manualstate at the beginning of the section, “All coercive techniques are designed toinduce regression.” Even hypnosis is considered a means to this end. On page 96of the manual, reference is made to the work of Merton M. Gill and MargaretBrenman, who state, “The psychoanalytic theory of hypnosis clearly implies,where it does not explicitly state, that hypnosis is a form of regression.” Inother words, the idea is to regress the subject to “a level at which theresistance can no longer be sustained. Hypnosis is one way of regressingpeople.”Therefore, the interrogation environment is designed to disorient a subject andthen regress that subject to the point where he or she has become, in apsychological sense, a child. This is clear from the statement above that “theregressed subject view the interrogator as a father-figure.” The subject becomesa child, the interrogator a father; or the subject becomes a candidate forinitiation, and the interrogator, the initiator.The blindfolding and binding of the Masonic candidate (from which we get theword “hoodwinked”), the mock burial of candidates in the European mysteryreligions, the isolation of the shamanic candidate and his reduction to achildlike state of helplessness by his mental or physical illness, are all meansof reducing sensory stimuli and regressing the candidate to a childlike state,in order to be “reborn.”In occult matters, this disorientation is a preliminary phase. Like the shamanin the forest, sick and hallucinating, this initial period serves to “unlock”normal mental and psychological perceptions. We have all heard of the expression“to change one’s mind,” and of the difficulty of “changing the mind” of aparticularly stubborn person (or resistant interrogatee). The purpose of thedisorientation phase is to allow the mind to be more easily changed. This is astrue of the CIA’s interrogation methods as it is of spiritual or occultinitiation. In the case of the shamans, this disorientation was achieved byillness—either physical or mental, or a combination of both—as well as by thefuture shaman’s isolation in the wild. In the context of modern Westernoccultism, this disorientation is achieved by a refinement of the “sick in thewoods” shamanistic type, and involves sensory deprivation. The Masonic initiateis brought in blindfolded and bound; without sight, and without the unrestricteduse of his limbs, he is reduced to hearing and smell: the chants of his fellowMasons and the aroma of incense. All other sensory input has been—as the CIAmanual would have it—“manipulated.” In the more ancient mystery religions—aswell as in some initiatory cults in the West today—the candidate for initiationwas buried alive, his sensory input slowly reduced to nothing as he lay in agrave or a tomb, awaiting his rebirth or “resurrection.” This is mirrored insome Eastern Orthodox ceremonies in which the candidate for the bishop’s mitrespends the night in the church, prone on the church floor, and covered with asheet as if dead; heavy candlesticks hold down the four edges of the sheet. Atdawn, he is “risen,” the sheet and candlesticks removed, and he joins thecompany of his fellow bishops for the formal consecration ceremony.It is perhaps this state of disorientation that enables the interrogation toproceed more smoothly as the subject searches for the next stage of initiation:“rebirth” is not putting too fine a point on it. The subject is expected to dothe unthinkable: to give his enemy vital information that may lead to the arrestor death of his colleagues or cause some danger or threat to his country. Hemust find a way to do this, to live with this decision to side with his enemy,even if under coercion and torture.The CIA manual contains bibliographic information for the interrogator’sreference, including many of the “usual suspects” (such as works by LawrenceHinkle and Harold Wolff, Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Singer, and Brainwashing: AGuide to the Literature, published by a CIA front, the Society for theInvestigation of Human Ecology) plus an interesting offering by psychiatristJames Clark Moloney, “Psychic Self-Abandon and Extortion of Confessions,”included in the January/February 1955 edition of the International Journal ofPsychoanalysis. This article, according to the CIA manual, relates the“psychological release obtained through confession (i.e., the sense ofwell-being following surrender as a solution to an otherwise unsolvableconflict) with religious experiences generally and some ten Buddhist practicesparticularly.”13Thus, even as early as 1955, it was realized by some observers that there is adistinct relationship between the gestalt of the interrogation room and that ofthe meditation chamber or other religious experience. The CIA held a dim view ofMoloney’s work, even as they cited it in the Bibliography of the interrogationmanual; they recommended the serious interrogator read Hypnosis and RelatedStates: Psychoanalytic Studies in Regression, by Merton Gill and MargaretBrenman.Also cited in the annotated CIA bibliography was an obscure article by John C.Lilly, he of “talking with dolphins” fame. This article—entitled “Mental Effectsof Reduction of Ordinary Levels of Physical Stimuli on Intact Healthy Persons,”in the Psychological Research Report #5 of the American Psychiatric Association(1956)—is devoted to a study of sensory deprivation: “The effect was to speed upthe results of the more usual sort of isolation (for example, solitaryconfinement). Delusions and hallucinations, preceded by other symptoms, appearedafter short periods. The author does not discuss the possible relevance of hisfindings to interrogation.”14In one of the many coincidences that shadowed the writing of this book over theyears, there is another worthwhile to mention, as it occurred as these wordswere being written.In order to identify the source of my information that Francis Israel Regardierecommended a course of psychological analysis prior to undertaking occultpractice, I located a copy of An Interview with Israel Regardie: His FinalThoughts and Views, edited by Christopher S. Hyatt, buried deep within mylibrary, and found the relevant quotation. Scanning through the book, however, Icame upon an article by Regardie at the rear of the book which is an attack onJames Clark Moloney and is entitled “Cry Havoc!” This attack is due to Moloney’spublished distaste for the practice of chiropractic, which was of seriousinterest to Regardie.Thus, I read the references to Moloney in at least two places: in the CIAdocument,15 and then immediately—the same day, perhaps an hour or solater—another in a book so far removed from the subject matter of theinterrogation manual as to render the occurrence even more meaningful. As if toemphasize the bizarre nature of this “coincidence,” the preceding article in theRegardie collection is entitled “What Is Psychotherapy?” and contains, on page113, a reference to (actually, a quotation from) that notorious andby-now-familiar CIA mind-control psychiatrist and inventor of “psychic driving”and “depatterning” techniques, Dr. Ewen Cameron! Although the collection ofarticles and the interview was published as a book in 1985, there is no mentionof when the articles in question first appeared in print, nor is there a sourcefor the Cameron quotation, alas.Before we close the section dealing with “set and setting” it will perhaps beuseful to look once more at the CIA interrogation manual, in the section dealingwith “coercive interrogation,” i.e., where the subject is resistant tointerrogation, such as a political prisoner might be. The CIA manual quotes atlength from Lawrence Hinkle (who, with Harold Wolff, was asked to studybrainwashing at the request of Allen Dulles, becoming, in the process, “thechief brainwashing studiers for the U.S. government”) 16and then again fromLilly. The CIA found Lilly’s description of the sensory deprivation experiencedby, for instance, arctic explorers to be particularly fascinating and relevant,especially the passage from his article that states, “The symptoms most commonlyproduced by isolation are superstition, intense love of any other living thing,perceiving inanimate objects as alive, hallucinations, and delusions.”17These are all symptoms that we may, with confidence, also ascribe to heightenedstates of mystical or occult awareness. Unfortunately, the terms “hallucination”and “delusion” are, of course, emotionally loaded. We may wish to substituteterms like “vision” or “altered mental state,” or even the Golden Dawn’ssuggestive “evocation to visible appearance,” in the cases where theseexperiences are the result of a deliberate attempt to penetrate other levels ormodes of consciousness. It is interesting that Lilly discovers superstition asone of the side effects of lengthy isolation and sensory deprivation; this maybe understood as the willingness of the subject to see relationships betweenevents that are not seen or not recognized by the mentally healthy. Theserelationships, of course, are precisely what the occultist is seeking tounderstand; Jung called this phenomenon “synchronicity” and science calls it“coincidence.”The setting of the occultist is just as consciously controlled and manipulatedas is that of the interrogator. Every detail must be considered, and the entireenvironment must reflect the purpose of the ritual. In the case, for instance,of a ritual designed to evoke spiritual forces which may be represented by theplanet Venus—a planet that represents for the occultist, as for the mythologianand the anthropologist, ideas cognate with love, luxury, beauty, fine arts,etc.—the color scheme must represent what his culture identifies with Venus. InEurope, this would be the color green; the metal would be copper; sweet incenseswould be burned; the entire environment of the ritual chamber would reflect theconcept of Venus and no other. For Mars, these elements would be replaced by thecolor red, iron as the metal, and so forth. These correspondences may be foundin any work of ceremonial magic such as those by Agrippa, pseudo-Agrippa,pseudo-Solomon, or in Liber 777 aforementioned. This is a type of sensorydeprivation, in which all extraneous ideas and mental triggers are removed fromthe chamber and replaced by a single, strident pulse in which sound, sight,smell, touch, and even taste are of a piece: one insistent message beingbroadcast from the environment back onto the senses of the magician or operator.Further, the operator has himself designed the room or chamber to reflect thispurpose, so the message has gone out from the operator to the environment andback again. The chamber thus designed acts as a kind of externalization of theinner thoughts and desires of the operator, much the same way we decorate ourhomes to reflect personal taste. Yet, this chamber’s design is temporary; itwill serve for the performance of a single ritual—or ritual series—only. Onanother day, it will be completely re-arranged to reflect a different spiritualforce.Thus, the magician is at once interrogator and interrogatee; he is the one incharge of manipulating and controlling the environment, but not for the effectit will have on someone else, but on himself alone. What the CIA has done in itsinterrogation manual—itself the product of MK-ULTRA, as is obvious from theworks cited in its Bibliography, entire entries of which have been redactedwhile the others are overwhelmingly works by MK-ULTRA and military mind-controlspecialists—is to separate the magician from the ultimate goal of all occultism,which is a kind of spiritual perfection and elevated consciousness, and insteadfocus all the powers of occult technique on an unwilling and uninformed subject,to manipulate him as well as the environment, to change the subject andtransform him into something more useful to the interrogator and of mortaldanger to the subject’s own people. It is, in the jargon of occultism, blackmagic; and black magic in the service of the State.The interrogator himself must be of a very special and unique character. He mustbe capable of what Robert Jay Lifton has called “doubling.” That is, a CIAinterrogator must be capable of being two persons at once. Lifton used the“doubling” metaphor to describe those German scientists who—although from gentleand cultured backgrounds, with wives and children of their own—were able tobecome monsters in the service of the Nazi state. They had, in effect, twototally distinct personalities, which was the only way they were capable ofcarrying out the horrendous experiments they did while at the same timeconsidering themselves human beings and men of science. While Lifton stops shortof calling this a case of multiple personality disorder or dissociated identitydisorder, it is so borderline a state as to be confusing to thenon-professional. The CIA interrogator, as per the declassified manual, mustalso be capable of this type of “dissociation”:Once questioning starts, the interrogator is called upon to function at twolevels. He is trying to do two seemingly contradictory things at once: achieverapport with the subject but remain an essentially detached observer. Or he mayproject himself to the resistant interrogatee as powerful and ominous (in orderto eradicate resistance and create the necessary conditions for rapport) whileremaining wholly uncommitted at the deeper level, noting the significance of thesubjects [sic] reactions and the effectiveness of his own performance. Poorinterrogators often confuse this bi-level functioning with role-playing, butthere is a vital difference. The interrogator who merely pretends, in hissurface performance, to feel a given emotion or to hold a given attitude towardthe source is likely to be unconvincing; the source quickly senses thedeception. Even children are very quick to feel this kind of pretense. To bepersuasive, the sympathy or anger must be genuine; but to be useful, it must notinterfere with the deeper level of precise, unaffected observation. Bi-levelfunctioning is not difficult or even unusual; most people act at times as bothperformer and observer unless their emotions are so deeply involved in thesituation that the critical faculty disintegrates. Through experience theinterrogator becomes adept in this dualism.18If some careful reader sees in the above an echo of the Stanislavski Method, hemay be forgiven. As we will see in a following chapter, the Method resonatesquite well with both occult practices and intelligence work.Thus, we have examined set and setting; set is the mental state of the occultistand of the interrogator, a mental condition conducive towards obtaining adesired result. Setting is the environment, which is designed, controlled andmanipulated in such a way as to reinforce the mental set. Mind control andmagic: not very far apart at all. It is perhaps a natural reluctance on the partof many government scientists and brainwashing experimenters to take occultismand its literature and practitioners seriously that has prevented the CIA andthe military from becoming even more powerful and omniscient than they havebeen; or, perhaps, we don’t know the half of what they have already achieved andthe lengths to which they have gone to achieve it. That the literature ofoccultism, spiritual initiation, and shamanism could contribute greatly tomind-control programs was acknowledged by some specialists. As we have seen,Moloney noticed it; and some of the operations already described in this workinvolved consultation with psychics, magicians, and others of that industry. Itis the fact that the initiatory process itself is time consuming and highlysubjective that probably prevented its use as a mind control weapon; however,the rites and methods of the occultist and shaman were scoured carefully by themen of the CIA to see if there were short-cuts and indications of othertechnologies that might be employed, such as, of course, hallucinogens.That there are no short-cuts to either initiation or occult abilities—whetherone chooses to believe in them or not—did not occur to them, however. Techniquesand tools were taken out of context and bent to serve the urgent needs of thestate. This is similar to a prince hiring an alchemist to churn out gold; or amonarch hiring a seer to divine the intentions of an enemy. While occultabilities have always, since the dawn of recorded history, been used in theservice of the state, there used to be an acknowledgment of the spiritual natureof these powers on the behalf of the rulers, and of the necessity of appeasingthe spiritual forces thus evoked. Today, with a totally mechanistic andtechnological approach to science, this basic perspective has been lost, andwith it the moral imperative to treat the use of these powers (and, byextension, the hearts and minds of human beings) with care and respect.BORN AGAINEliade and other commentators on initiation myths have remarked often that thegoal of the initiation is to cause the initiand to be “reborn”; the symbolism ofwombs and tombs, of death and resurrection, all point to a dramatic rebirth ofthe initiand before he or she can take a place among the members of the cult.Naturally, this rebirth experience is quite different from an actual birth;after all, one undergoes this process voluntarily with the expectation of agreat reward at the end of it. One is reborn with all one’s memories intact. Onehas been conscious of the progression from lay person to initiand to initiate,which is more than can be said for most of us who have only been born once, thenormal way. Yet, this insistence on the rebirth of the initiand into a “newlife” is so widespread among so many cultures around the world, that it musthave something important to convey to us. This may reside in the concept of anew identity.When one is baptized in the Catholic faith, one is given a “Christian” name.When the author was a child, this had to be the name of a saint. One could notbe baptized as “Phoenix” or “Serendipity” or “Moon,” there being no Catholicsaints with those names.But then came the rite of Confirmation. This is the ritual where a Catholicchild must repeat the baptismal vows which were said on his behalf by hisgodparents when he was an infant. Now that the child is of age—usually aroundten or eleven years old and safely before the actual onset of puberty—he or sheis expected to participate in this ritual which “confirms” those vows. Dressedin white, carrying a candle or a flower, the child makes his way to thecommunion rail of the church where a bishop confirms the child in its vows,slaps the child on the cheek, and then calls the child by a new name. This isprobably as close as traditional Roman Catholics ever come to a “born again”experience. It is a replay of Baptism but with a totally conscious and awarechild taking the place of the infant. The slap has been described as a means ofwarning the child that he or she will not have an easy road ahead as aChristian. I am not so sure if this is its true intention. But it is the newname that concerns us, because after all the child already has a Christian name,conferred at the time of Baptism. Why another name?Of course, since the child is now conscious and capable of making moraldecisions and knowing right from wrong, it is expected that the child will alsotake another name as an indication that he or she is fully conscious in a moralsense. The child selects this name beforehand. It also must be the name of asaint, preferably a saint whose example the child admires and emulates.This rite may have had as its inspiration the Jewish ritual of the bar mitzvah,in which a Jewish boy of thirteen years or so “becomes a man” and is introducedto the community of men as a full-fledged member. Whatever its origin, it is thebestowal of a new name that concerns us.When one converts to Islam, one is also expected to take a Muslim name, which isusually Arabic and is usually either the name of a prophet or other holy figure,or which means something appropriately spiritual. (We are reminded of theprizefighter Cassius Clay becoming Mohammed Ali.)The same is also true of virtually every occult society. The name is selected bythe initiand beforehand, and may be in any language. In the tradition of theGolden Dawn, this new name was usually in Latin but may also have been in Greek,Sanskrit, Hebrew and even Gaelic. The name was believed to be especiallymeaningful and to contain within itself an entire occult program. Its numerologywas carefully examined, as well as its linguistic roots and occult “heredity.”Within the cult’s chambers, the initiate was only known by his or her cult name.In the Manson Family this was not unusual, either. Lynette Fromme was “Squeaky,”Ruth Ann Moorehouse was “Ouisch,” and there were “Gypsy,” “Sexy Sadie,” and somany others. This idea of naming served the purpose to unite the group but alsoto delineate its boundaries from the rest of society. To Ms. Fromme’s parents,she would always be Lynette. To the police, to the government, she would alwaysbe known by her “Christian” name. But to her friends and colleagues, she wasSqueaky, even as she attempted the assassination of President Ford long afterthe Tate/La Bianca killings.And, of course, in the intelligence community, false names and code names are acommonplace. In this instance, it is to protect the user and conceal his or heridentity from those without a “need to know”; but it has the same psychologicaleffect on the agent who must use that name as his identification within the“cult of intelligence.” His membership in the elite group of intelligenceofficers is known only to his colleagues; he must use a different persona whenoutside of that charmed circle. Another case of “doubling”?A book could be written on this topic of identity, and the reader will berelieved to learn I am not going to explore the theme thoroughly here. I am onlypointing out the obvious, that the tradition of taking a new name begins inreligion and culminates in the cult—whether of murderers, such as the MansonFamily, or of intelligence, such as the CIA—and that the psychological effect ofthis new name has not been fully investigated.We understand that the person suffering from dissociative identity disorder ormultiple personality disorder also uses a multiplicity of names. Each “alter”personality has its own name and its own identity, usually vastly different fromevery other alter. The goal of MK-ULTRA was, of course, the creation of thistype of disorder in its subjects in the search for the perfect—and perfectlydeniable—assassin. In the case of DID or MPD, this disorder is the result of atrauma inflicted from outside the subject: an abusive parent or other olderperson, usually. In the case of the cult, this name is often bestowed upon thesubject by its leader or guru or, as in the case of the Golden Dawn or theCatholic Confirmation ceremony, chosen by the subjects themselves. Again, theemphasis is on willing versus unwilling participation in the rituals ofconsciousness. The CIA wished to manipulate the subject completely, physicallyand mentally. They and their agents were mostly unaware that this could alsolead to a spiritual crisis in the subject, one from which most people would notrecover; one from which it was almost impossible to claim a heightened spiritualstate or initiation. When they incorporated drugs into the program and, as inthe case of Dr. Cameron, bizarre sensory deprivation techniques coupled with theendlessly droning tape players—a suggestion first bruited about by AldousHuxley—we had all the elements of a serious occult experience, but man-handledby men of science and government who had no interest in the spiritual dimensionsof their work, nor in the spiritual state of their subjects, and whose own levelof spiritual development and awareness would have been equally suspect.I have witnessed what may happen to a person when unwittingly “possessed” duringthe course of a voodoo ceremony. At times, uninvolved observers of such a ritualwill, themselves, fall into a state of possession even though they are notmembers of the cult nor are believers in possession specifically or voodoo ingeneral. The person becomes a danger to themselves and to others. The voodoopriest in charge of the ritual will usually bring this unfortunate person out ofthe trance (I have seen this done with a whispered prayer and a spray of rum inthe subject’s face), whereupon the person is led back to their seat in a dazedstate, remembering nothing of what has transpired. Possession, trance, amnesia.In the case of Dr. Cameron and the other practitioners of this “black art,”there was no attempt to bring the subject out of trance, or to protect thesubject from the consequences of accidental “possession.” The trance was thething; the creation of multiple personalities was the goal; selective amnesiawas a necessary side effect. Anything that stood in its way was, of course,anathema, but whatever contributed to these strange and dangerous psychologicalconditions was welcomed and enhanced.To understand why this effort by Cameron was so evil, it is perhaps a good ideato compare Cameron’s methods with normal psychotherapy. There are many forms ofpsychotherapy, of course, but the most common is what is sometimes referred toas the “talking cure.” For fifty minutes a day, several days a week, a patientgoes to see a psychiatrist or a psychotherapist, sits on a chair or lies on acouch, and talks. The therapist is usually silent, or perhaps gently prods thepatient with a mumbled “hmmm” or “ah” or “how does that make you feel?” This cango on for years. It is used to treat various low-level neuroses; nothinglife-threatening, no voices in the head or snakes on the walls. This is the typeof therapy we are accustomed to hearing about when we read the gossip columns orthe movie star magazines. The regularity of the therapy—a strict fifty minutehour, according to a strict schedule laid out in advance—is designed to givesome order and structure to the patient’s life. The patient, after all, is inthe midst of chaotic feelings, confused emotional responses, anxieties, moodswings, depression. The unvarying routine of the therapy sessions forces a kindof artificial edifice within which these emotions are contained; it is liketelling the patient that, no matter how chaotic life becomes, tomorrow atprecisely four o’clock and for precisely fifty minutes, he will have theundivided attention of his therapist, just as he has had for the past threeyears and can reasonably expect to do for the next three or thirteen or thirty.It is also a safe environment in which to externalize these deeper emotions,anxieties, rages. The therapist will never criticize the patient, or laugh athim, or humiliate him in any way. And, at the end of the fifty minutes, nomatter what is being discussed or how emotionally charged the atmosphere hasbecome, the session is over and the patient must leave to make way for the nextpatient. While that seems harsh and annoying, it is actually part of the “cure”:it once again reminds the patient that no matter what he or she is goingthrough, there is a structure and routine to life and tomorrow is another day.There are, of course, other therapies and therapeutic techniques. There isprimal scream therapy in which patients are encouraged to re-live the moment oftheir birth as mewling infants, screaming in a kind of frenzied catharsis toovercome feelings of abandonment by the mother, etc. There is Jungian therapy,in which great attention is given to dreams and other symbolic material. StrictFreudian therapy, of course, involves the therapist speaking very little whilethe patient does all the talking, or doesn’t talk at all. And so it goes. Butthe constant in these therapies is the sense that the therapist is a safe andtrustworthy person, and that the therapeutic environment is a safe haven inwhich it is permissible and encouraged to reveal one’s innermost thoughts,dreams, desires.Therefore, when this environment is used for an attack on the mind and body ofthe patient, a grievous harm has been committed. The sense of betrayal of trustis enormous. Imagine going to a doctor with a minor ailment and leaving hisoffice with a mortal disease, deliberately injected into your skin by the man orwoman you trusted with your life. The same was taking place at Cameron’s clinicin Montreal. Many of his patients became vegetables; some never recovered. Whenthe CIA manual on interrogation was first promulgated within the Agency—in July1963—Cameron’s experiments were still ongoing, as was MK-ULTRA. Instead of hispatients being “born again” into a healthy, robust psyche, they were beingpsychically murdered.I hasten to add that some therapies may require confrontational techniques, suchas in the use of psychodrama by some therapists. Again, this is done within thecontext of a therapeutic setting, and the patients are not strapped down to ahospital bed, fed drugs intravenously, and made to listen to subliminal messageson endless tape loops for days on end, like a scene out of A Clockwork Orange.In the case of Cameron—and in other cases in which helpless victims were made tosuffer the very pains of hell at the hands of men and women of science—thepatients were, quite simply, guinea pigs. They had become objects, and had losttheir humanity. Isn’t this how the serial killer views his victims? How the Nazidoctors viewed their prisoners?What MK-ULTRA and the other government mind-control programs revealed was thatthe techniques of occult initiation and psychotherapy could be used not only toelevate a human being and sanctify his life; they could also be used to maim andkill. This was analogous to the relatively secret methods of using acupuncture(for instance) as an instrument not only of healing, but of torture.The spiritual rebirth promised by the secret society, the mystical cult, theshamanistic initiation is not the end of the road for the initiate. It is anecessary prerequisite to greater accomplishments, and the path of the initiateis neverending. While many professional skeptics—such as the Amazing Randi,among others—take delight in debunking the paranormal, there are aspects ofoccult initiation that transcend sleight-of-hand and legerdemain. While Randihas gone to great lengths to try to debunk the powers of Uri Geller, forinstance, his own demonstrations of Geller-like abilities have always been weak.Yet, it is in the incredible mental abilities of the more “primitive” culturesthat we find the greatest expression of what can only be called paranormalabilities, even as we try to define them using outmoded scientific vocabulary.For instance, every year in Southeast Asia and parts of India there is thecelebration of the Hindu festival of Thaipusam. This is the day when devoteesfulfill promises made to the gods by having their half-naked bodies pierced withlong needles from which are hung heavy fruits and other equally weighty objects.The devotees feel no pain, and there is no blood from these wounds. They walk inthe tropical heat in a trance, their chests, cheeks, and other parts of theirbodies run through with needles. Some of them carry huge float-like ornaments ontheir heads, secured by more needles run through their skin. This is a commonfestival, drawing crowds every year, and yet no one has been able to adequatelyexplain how these people—no Uri Gellers or Amazing Randis among them—are able toenter into the kind of hypnotic trance necessary to demonstrate these startlingabilities. They are under the tutelage of a guru, of course, who cautions thebystanders that no attempt must be made to break the trance of the devotees, forif they were to “snap out of it” they would find themselves in excruciatingpain.When the rite is accomplished, the needles are removed and there are typicallyno scars to show where the needles had been inserted and, of course, no evidenceof bleeding. In Kuala Lumpur, where the author lived for several years, thisrite takes place annually at the Batu Caves, a Hindu shrine devoted to thegoddess Kali. In Singapore, the same festival is celebrated with the devoteeswalking on hot coals, showing neither pain nor burns or blisters. These feats ofparanormal control over the body’s natural responses—responses of pain,blistering, bleeding, etc—all take place within a religious context. Apologistsfor the scientific viewpoint would try to extricate the phenomena from theircontext, and explain them away as a kind of autohypnosis; yet, the field ofhypnosis itself is not without its critics among the scientific community. Whatis the state of mind of the devotee during these painful (to watch) proceedings?Some have described it as a kind of “out of body” experience, as if they werewatching what was being done from afar; what some theorists have called“splitting.” The “center of gravity” of their consciousness is removed from aphysical locale and suspended somewhere over their head. It is a trance, verymuch like a hypnotic trance, and indeed some of this same phenomena may beduplicated in the hypnotist’s parlor. In a famous scene from Edgar Cayce’s life,this “sleeping prophet” would go into a trance and critics would poke needlesthrough his skin. No blood, no pain, no scar tissue.In China, dedicated practitioners of the martial arts show the same abilities toignore pain and stop the flow of blood, using swords to make their “point.” Whatwould be the therapeutic value of these techniques to modern medical science,one wonders?In Africa, in the “village of the sorcerers” at Yho, in the Ivory Coast, thereis a reported birthing ritual in which small children are put into a hypnotictrance and tossed into the air like sticks, from one man to another, eachholding a sharp knife. The children have their eyes wide open, but are frozensolid, deep in trance. This tossing of the children from one man to anotheroutside the hut where a woman is in labor continues as long as necessary, untilthe woman actually gives birth. The children in the air, the men with theknives, are said to simulate the actual moment of birth and to facilitate theentry of the child into the world. Like most such explanations, it has lostsomething in the translation, I am sure.19The fact that hypnotic trances have been used in various ways by cultures aroundthe world—as the above, very few, examples illustrate—indicates a knowledge ofthe powers of the mind that is at least as extensive as that of modernpsychiatry, albeit in different, culturally-specific, garb. The “splitting” ofconsciousness necessary for the Thaipusam devotee or the Shaolin Temple monk orthe Yho village sorcerer all represent a kind of voluntary madness, a temporarystate of dislocation, of dissociation, of the personality that is considereduseful and appropriate under certain, socially-approved, conditions. The exampleof spirit possession—such as that in Haitian voudoun as well as in Africanreligious rites, Chinese Daoist mediumship, Siberian shamanism, and the moregenteel European séance—is another type of dissociation, one that has beenclassified as “hysteria” by early modern psychiatry, but one which is a coreelement of much spiritualism and occult practice. The body is seen as a vehiclefor spiritual forces, a kind of horse that can be mounted by the spiritual forceevoked. Indeed, in Haitian voudoun this is the symbolism employed, for thepossessed person is called a horse. In Malaysia, there is a virtually identicalritual—called Kuda Kepang—in which men carrying large wooden horse figures(similar to the western “hobby horse”) dance around in a circle until theybecome possessed by spirits, all under the watchful eye of the shaman, or bomohas he is called in the local language.This leads us to the next element of the occult ceremonies in which forces areevoked: the “material basis.”Having regard to the nature and antecedents of the Intelligences with whichBlack Magic professes to be concerned, it must be highly important that theoperator should know the kinds of apparitions which may be expected.… Accordingto the Grimorium Verum, the spirits do not invariably manifest under the sameforms … being disengaged from all matter, they must of necessity borrow a bodyin order to appear before us, and then they assume any shape and figure whichseems good to them. Beware, however, lest they affright thee …—A.E. Waite20We have seen how the belief systems of ancient peoples allowed for the temporarypossession of human beings by spiritual forces. This is a belief that persiststo this day, from the Caribbean to Africa to Asia, and in virtually everycontinent and among virtually every race. The conscious evocation of forces, theinvitation to these forces to inhabit a human being, is as commonplace in Haitias it is in Malaysia and Africa. While spirit possession may also occur withoutconscious invitation—such as in the cases of demonic possession to whichOesterreich refers in his monumental Possession, Demoniacal and Other—we willfocus for the moment on the voluntary kind. Normally, this takes place in anenvironment that has been under the conscious control of a shaman of some sort;the shaman provides a physical area that has been “blessed” or sanctified insome way, an area that will contain the forces summoned. This is as true forEuropean ceremonial magic as it is for Haitian voudoun. Then, the shaman ormagician begins the ceremony that will summon these forces into the bodies ofthe worshippers. The worshippers then become possessed by these forces under thewatchful eye of the shaman, and depart as well under his supervision andobservation. In the jargon of modern ceremonial magic, the person thus possessedwould be considered a “material basis.”This is a well-known idea in European magic. In some of the early grimoires, weread of the advisability of having a young boy act as a seer under the controlof the magician; the boy should be a virgin (perhaps to ensure that hisemotional state was unencumbered by the heavy calculus of adult desires andworries), and at or below the age of puberty. In the literature concerningpoltergeist activity—the “noisy ghost” phenomenon in which household implementsare thrown through the air, furniture levitated, bangs and explosions and allsorts of startling occurrences take place without any obvious human ormechanical agency—it is believed that the presence of young children reachingthe age of puberty are (unconsciously) at fault. There is a tentative theorythat children reaching that age possess telekinetic powers due to some hormonalimbalance taking place as their bodies prepare for the onslaught of adolescence.In other, more recent, cases we have the example of Aleister Crowley and hissometime disciple, the poor doomed Victor Neuberg. In the sands of northernAfrica, Crowley and Neuberg were involved in the evocation of spiritual forcesusing basic ceremonial techniques. In these experiments, a magic circle wasdrawn within which the chief operator or magician would stand throughout theceremony. A triangle was drawn outside the circle, and in this figure the“material basis” would sit during the same period. This “material basis” couldhave been anything from an animal to a magic mirror to a brazier of burningincense, but in the case of at least one of the operations carried out in thenorth African desert, Crowley himself sat in the triangle while his assistant,Victor Neuberg, stood in the circle and recorded everything that transpired.During the course of this ritual, it seems Crowley became possessed by aspiritual force—in this case, identified as Choronzon, the Beast of theAbyss—and attacked Neuberg, leaving the triangle and jumping inside the magiccircle whose integrity had been breached by Crowley/Choronzon throwing smallamounts of sand over the circle, obliterating it in places. Neuberg reactedquickly, stabbing outward at the “apparition” with his magic dagger, andCrowley/Choronzon retired to its triangle as Neuberg repaired his circle.A “material basis” is a medium whereby an invisible, formless spiritual forcemay manifest itself in three-dimensional terms. This basis can be anythingmalleable enough for a force to inhabit and animate in some way. Billows ofincense may collect themselves into the semblance of a demon or a genie, muchthe way children see faces in clouds. Images may coalesce on the surface of amagic mirror or crystal ball. A cat on a leash or a bird in a cage may, whenplanted within the magic triangle, become agitated in ways that evince anoccult, occupying force. And a human being, especially one mediumistic, artisticor sensitive enough to begin with, can also become a material basis for theoccupation of a spiritual force. This happens with regularity among people allover the world, but usually in a socially-powerful setting like a voodooceremony or shamanistic séance. In Western ceremonial magic, the same goal isdesired but within a very strictly controlled setting and with a very specificforce in mind. The rituals of ceremonial magic are less Dionysian than those ofHaitian voudoun; they are more ponderous, more complicated, and are created withthe evocation of a particular entity in mind, to the exclusion of all others.The Haitian ceremonies are like occult cocktail parties to which a variety ofguests are invited and the music and the drums are an integral part of the“entertainment.” By comparison, the ceremonies of western magic are more likejob interviews. But in either case, the material basis is necessary.A more detailed description of this concept may be found in a novel by Englishmagician Aleister Crowley: Moonchild. In this work, a room is fitted withdecorations all designed to invoke lunar qualities, so that a young woman maybecome pregnant therein and give birth to a child of lunar characteristics. Itis a concept that has its origins in the idea of sensory deprivation, but of amore refined type in which every sensory stimulus is removed save the ones mostconducive to the desired goal of the ritual. It is a study of the completecontrol of a physical environment in order to similarly control the mental andemotional state of a human subject, so that the subject becomes the “materialbasis” for a spiritual force that has been summoned by the operator. Just as awoman becomes the material basis for the soul of the child she is carrying—sogoes the argument—other physical media can become (temporarily or permanently)the material basis for other “souls” or spiritual forces.If we stop to consider for a moment how this works, we will see at once ananalogy to the theme of this book, for the spiritual forces are invisible, yetwe know they are there. To evoke them only needs a suitable medium, and the willto summon them. They will then clothe themselves in the molecules of whatevermedium is available, arranging them around themselves into a semblance of whatthey are and what they represent, a kind of mask or persona, much the same waywe dress ourselves in our everyday costumes, making a statement with everyarticle of clothing we wear. The intelligence agent does the same thing, ofcourse. Beginning with the assumed name, he is “born again” as someone else. Hedresses the part, speaks the part (possibly even in a language foreign to him),and acts the part. He occupies a space in front of his enemies, but they knowhim not. He is, essentially, a spiritual force moving through their environment:the physical representative of the will of some other government, some othercountry, some other agenda, some other reality. Some of these agents may simplybe gathering information; others may be bent on more sinister ends:assassination, sabotage, the overthrow of a political regime. They are analogousto spiritual forces, sent by magicians to investigate the “Other Side.” And whenthey are discovered, it is usually by the enemy’s own “magicians,” whounderstand the secret world of the spies and who can read the signs they leaveon the aether.When the interrogator begins his ceremony, the subject is brought into acontrolled environment and his entire consciousness is manipulated coldly andeffectively by the interrogator. The subject has information the interrogatorneeds. The subject is the “material basis” for the information; the poor wretchdestined to occupy the dread Triangle of Art while the magician—theinterrogator—is safe within his magic circle.The interrogatee has been unwillingly led onto an initiatory path fromwhich—according to the point of view of the theologian, the mystic, theoccultist—he may not escape. Irrevocable forces have been set in motion; theinterrogatee has been forced to see inside himself, to witness profound truthsabout the state of his soul and, by extension, the state of the world—ofreality—as well. His world has been turned inside out: an adult, he has become achild again; an enemy, he has become a collaborator; a man who thought heunderstood how the world works, he has become an initiate into a deeper, darkermystery.When these techniques have been amplified by the use of drugs, hypnosis, and theother paraphernalia of medical men like Ewen Cameron or Sidney Gottlieb, theybecome intensive initiatory experiences, but without the saving graces of aspiritual context that would permit some kind of growth. Instead, it is as ifthe initiation chamber had been taken over by the sorcerer’s apprentice: anon-initiate with no real, personal knowledge of the initiatory process but whomanaged to get hold of the book and recite the incantations carelessly, thusdamning both himself and whoever happened to be in close proximity. It is noaccident, I believe, that Dr. Frank Olson—arguably one of the first victims ofthe CIA’s mind-control program—was made to visit an important stage magician inthe hours before he plunged to his death from a window at the Statler Hotel. Thereason for this unusual visit has never been satisfactorily explained.L’ART MAGIQUEIf within the last century art conceived as an autonomous activity has come tobe invested with an unprecedented stature—the nearest thing to a sacramentalhuman activity acknowledged by secular society—it is because one of the tasksart has assumed is making forays into and taking up positions on the frontiersof consciousness (often very dangerous to the artist as a person) and reportingback what’s there.—Susan Sontag21Le Poete se fait voyant par un long, immense et raisonne dereglement de tous lessens, toutes les formes d’amour, de souffrance, de folie; il cherche lui-meme,il epuise en lui tous les poisons, pour n’en garder que les quintessences.Ineffable torture ou il a besoin de toute la foi, de toute la force surhumaine,ou il devient entre tous le grande malade, le grand criminel, le grand maudit—etle supreme Savant!—Car il arrive a l’inconnu!— Rimbaud, letter to Paul Demeny, 15 May 187122How, then, to compare the “sacramental human activity acknowledged by secularsociety” with a sacramental human activity not acknowledged by secular society,such as magic, Tantra, shamanism, etc., which has the same ends and often verysimilar means? If, as Rimbaud insists above, the duty of the Poet is to become aseer, by “an immense and systematic derangement of the senses,” and therebyarrive at sure knowledge of the Unknown, then where do we draw the line betweenart and shamanism, between poetry and psychological warfare? We have spoken inprevious volumes about the strange interrelationships that exist between certainfilms and actual political events, such as The Manchurian Candidate’s directorJohn Frankenheimer being the host of Bobby Kennedy’s last meal. Film, of course,is an art form and—as stagecraft by other means—one of the oldest forms of artin the world, and one of the most sacred in a mystical and religious sense, theactors inviting possession by the gods they represented in the theater, a sacredspace. Can art be used to understand magic, and vice versa? Or can the lives andtechniques of the artist be used to reinterpret the lives, techniques and evenaddress the accomplishments of the magician? The reader may be surprised tolearn that there is a body of literature on the subject of art as occultism, andart as psychology … with very revealing things to say about all three. Theapplication of this literature to our theme will become obvious in the followingpages.We saw in Book I how communication science developed out of the requirements ofpsychological warfare, or what the Germans called “world-view warfare.” We havealso seen how the bible of modern psychiatry, the Diagnostic and StatisticalManual, Mental Disorders (DSM), arose from US military requirements. While wehave not yet investigated the impact of psychological warfare concepts on themost pervasive artistic media of modern times—music and cinema—we will firstexamine the development of one influential artistic movement and itsrelationship to both modern psychiatry and modern occultism: surrealism.There have been several attempts to understand surrealism from the point of viewof psychology and of occultism. An excellent example of the former is TheHaunted Self: Surrealism, Psychoanalysis, Subjectivity by David Lomas. Publishedin 2000 by Yale University Press, it is a profound study of thecross-pollination of surrealism, psychoanalysis and various “fringe” practices,such as hypnosis and automatic writing. As an example of the latter, we haveNadia Choucha’s Surrealism and the Occult: Shamanism, Magic, Alchemy, and theBirth of an Artistic Movement. Published in 1991, it covers much of the sameground as the later work by Lomas, but with a more specific—and equallyrevealing—focus.The man largely considered to be the father of the surrealist movement is AndreBreton. During World War I, he worked in a military hospital treating victims ofwhat is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A medical student atthe Sorbonne, he was heavily influenced by the writings of Pierre Janet, thefamous psychologist who also exerted a great influence over Freud and Jung and ageneration of philosophers and thinkers. Janet’s work Psychological Automatismwas a seminal study of the role automatic writing and free association couldplay in an understanding of the unconscious mind. Breton took this technique toheart, and used it in his treatment of shell-shocked veterans.Automatic writing is a technique whereby one either closes his eyes or isotherwise distracted from what his hand is writing on a sheet of paper, the ideabeing that the hand will write words that come directly from the unconsciousmind, sneaking in below the super-ego, the radar of consciousness. To thespiritualists, automatic writing was a form of communicating with the OtherWorld, the spirit world, and mediums would use this as a means of obtainingmessages from deceased loved ones. (This technique was dramatized in the NicoleKidman film, The Others.) Breton and many of the other Surrealists, however,denied the existence of spiritual forces, ghosts, etc. and insisted thatautomatic writing—like all of the occult arts—was only a means towards releasingimages and information, even heretofore hidden powers, from the unconsciousmind. Although heavily involved in occult studies—as Nadia Chouchademonstrates—they were unconvinced of the existence of the spirit world per se,and instead preferred to conceive of the occult arts as a kind ofproto-psychology:The surrealists all rejected the idea of spirits, believing that these messagesand drawings came from the unconscious mind of the medium as a result ofdissociation of the personality.23This idea of the “dissociation of the personality” was as important to thesurrealists as it was for later generations of psychiatrists and mind-controlexperimenters. To the surrealists, the human consciousness was normally in astate of dissociation and it required techniques such as automatic writing andother trance-states to unify the unconscious material with consciousness; thatis, they believed dissociation was a sign of the breakdown in communicationbetween the conscious and unconscious minds. They sought to re-integrate,individuate, the human personality (in much the same way as did thepsychoanalysts and the shamans) by uncovering repressed unconscious data andmaking it available to the consciousness. Yet, while the psychoanalyst workedone-on-one with a patient, the surrealists intended to explore the mind’spotential in their poetic and artistic expressions and thus, perhaps, instigatea move towards illumination among larger numbers of individuals.The study of cases of double and multiple personality (so-called‘disaggregations of the personality’), of which there was a near epidemic in thelate nineteenth century, caused a number of investigators to raise doubts aboutthe philosophical premise that the human subject is a unity.—David Lomas24Breton was heavily influenced by the writings of the French symbolist poet,Arthur Rimbaud. He believed, like Rimbaud, that a “derangement of the senses”was necessary before true illumination could be obtained. At the same time, hewas as strongly influenced by the writings of Janet, who believed that hysteriawas caused by dissociation, or by the dissociation of a traumatic episode in thepatient’s past, with a host of related ideas that could only be accessed throughsuch methods as free association and automatic writing. This equation ofdissociation with hysteria is important; after all, modern psychiatry hasinsisted that the incidence of witchcraft in Salem—for instance—was simply amanifestation of hysteria; and writers on demonic possession put forth thetheory that possession is either a form of hysteria or of dissociation. A personsuffering from dissociative identity disorder may appear to be “possessed”; apossessed person may only be suffering from a form of what Janet or Freud wouldcall hysteria. This complex of ideas surrounding what other cultures believed tobe a spiritual phenomenon is at the core of shamanistic practices, just as it isof the CIA’s MK-ULTRA and similar programs for unlocking the secrets of themind. To Breton, surrealism was nothing more or less than “a form of psychicautomatism”25 and “magic dictation.” The use of what had originally been anoccult technique—automatic writing, a mediumistic method of contacting spiritualforces—to understand hysteria and dissociation (which had originally beenbelieved to be evidence of possession by spiritual forces) is revealing, for notonly the symptomatology of the mental disorder had its origins in witchcraft andmagic, but the method for treating it also claimed similar origins. All thatchanged, really, was a set of labels.The surrealists as a group struggled with the relationship between word andimage; they felt that language was paramount (after all, automatic writing iswriting, not drawing), but those who were artists rather than poets wereconfused as to how the newly discovered ideas of psychology, science andphilosophy could be expressed through image. There was a great deal of strugglebetween the poet-surrealists and the artist-surrealists at the birth of themovement, the poets claiming that the artists could not hope to duplicate theirefforts since the mind was, at its heart, verbal. “In the beginning was theWord.” Much of what Janet and, later, Freud wrote concerning the functions ofthe mind stressed the verbal quality of consciousness. To Breton, the spiritualmentors of the movement were Rimbaud and Baudelaire, and of course Lautreamont:poets, not painters.Asian languages, however, show that frequently both word and image are combined.Chinese characters have their origin in hieroglyphics, and there is little in aChinese character to indicate its pronounciation. Ancient Egyptian writing was,of course, pictographic and evolved into the famous hieroglyphs we all know.Ancient Mayan writing—only recently deciphered—was also hieroglyphic. The ideathat a word could also be an image, or could contain an image inside of itsomehow, was also the essence of Qabala. As Hebrew letters were also numbers,which meant that each Hebrew word contained within itself hundreds or thousandsof associations, that also meant that each Hebrew word contained within itselfimages corresponding to those associations. The Golden Dawn used a technique for“translating” Hebrew words into images, as a kind of coding system. They furtherrefined this method as the Enochian system, in which the four elements each havetheir symbolic animals (the Eagle, the Lion, the Bull, the Man, representing thefour fixed signs of Scorpio, Leo, Taurus and Aquarius respectively, whichthemselves represent Water, Fire, Earth and Air respectively), and combinationsof the elements meant one could combine the four elemental “animals” intovarious configurations, producing what were certainly “surreal” images: perhapsthe head of a Man, the body of a Bull, the legs of an Eagle and the tail of aLion? Using the Hebrew alphabet, one could also translate that combination intoa word using the Hebrew letters for the four elements as found in theunpronounceable name of God, YHVH.One of the surrealist artists connected with the occult was Austin Osman Spare.Spare was also concerned with the connection between word and image, and in hiswork (what he called “automatic drawing”) he created a “magical alphabet” thatused Roman letters arranged in such a way as to create occult symbols or“sigils.” Spare claimed to have been initiated into witchcraft by a descendantof the original Salem witches, and was also a member of Aleister Crowley’soccult society, the Argenteum Astrum or A... A.·.. His work has also had aprofound influence on occult author and Crowley-initiate Kenneth Grant. Sparebelieved that the method of automatic drawing was “a means to art,” as an essayof his—published as a chapter in his The Book of Pleasure (Self-Love): ThePsychology of Ecstasy—attests. What Spare and many other surrealists had donewas to take the essentially passive approach of Breton—as reflected in theirfascination with automatic writing and the hypnotic trance—and raise the stakesby incorporating a more aggressive approach to unlocking the secrets of the mindby using formal occult methods involving spirit conjuration, drugs, andsexually-oriented rituals. It was taking Rimbaud’s “derangement of the senses”much more seriously, much more energetically. It was the “voluntary madness” ofArtaud, which even Artaud understood in occult terms.The list of surrealist painters who were also occultists is actually quite long,and many art critics are not aware of this relationship, just as many occultistsare not aware that some of the more well-known authors on occult subjects werealso surrealist painters. Spare is only one example of an occultist who was anacknowledged surrealist artist. There was also Ithell Colquhoun, who wrote ahistory of the Golden Dawn entitled The Sword of Wisdom. There was respectedsurrealist painter Kurt Seligmann, who wrote a history of occultism: Magic,Supernaturalism and Religion. Aleister Crowley himself was a painter, althoughone hesitates to classify him as a surrealist.The other surrealists who were fascinated with occultism and incorporated occultthemes in their works or occult knowledge in their approach to art includevirtually every famous name of the movement: Max Ernst, Antonin Artaud, MarcelDuchamp, and many others were heavily influenced by occultism and read avidly inthe subject, and were, in their turn, subject to occult “analyses” by arthistorians and critics who came after them. Kandinsky, a kind ofproto-surrealist, was also very involved in occult theory and Theosophy and wason familiar terms with the works of Blavatsky, Rudolf Steiner, and MauriceMaeterlinck, as his own writings demonstrate. He, too, wrote of art as arevolutionary act, equating mysticism, revolution and art, with references toNietzsche, Blavatsky, and the other “revolutionary” thinkers of the day. Picassowas considered by Breton to be a forerunner of surrealism, and Picasso’sinterest in primitive art parallels that of Freud as well as the surrealists’.The primitive, the childlike, the insane: these were the vocabularies thatBreton wanted to investigate, like a fortune-teller over a pack of Tarot cards,for their hidden meanings and their clues to the unconscious world; and thesethree categories of being represented opposition to the social status quo.There can be no doubting that Breton’s wartime experience as a medical auxiliarypredisposed him to view hysteria as a form of insubordination—a protest, albeita mute one, against military and medical authority.—Lomas26The surrealist perspective is echoed in that of Scottish psychiatrist R.D. Laingwho, in his controversial and thought-provoking essay The Politics ofExperience, makes many of the same points concerning schizophrenia and thepossibilities of spiritual growth through madness. It should be noted that Laingalso began his medical career in the army, in this case the British Army, wherehe worked as a psychiatrist before going on to the Tavistock Clinic. Laingagrees with the surrealists when he states that “… we are bemused and crazedcreatures, strangers to our true selves, to one another, and to the spiritualand material world—mad, even, from an ideal standpoint we can glimpse but notadopt,”27 and, “We are potentially men, but are in an alienated state, and thisstate is not simply a natural system.”28The Politics of Experience includes afinal section, entitled “The Bird of Paradise,” that would have satisfied many asurrealist, as it seems to be a free-association-like account of a journey intoand out of madness. Concerning the voyage into madness, Laing is unequivocal:We can no longer assume that such a voyage is an illness that has to betreated…. Can we not see that this voyage is not what we need to be cured of,but that it is itself a natural way of healing our own appalling state ofalienation called normality?In other times people intentionally embarked upon this voyage. Or, if they foundthemselves already embarked, willy-nilly, they gave thanks, as for a specialgrace.29Thus Laing, more than forty years and a World War after the first SurrealistManifesto, is seen endorsing what is really a surrealist agenda, except he isdoing so as a trained, experienced, and respected member of the psychiatricprofession and not as an artist. He recognizes that “in other times peopleintentionally embarked upon this voyage,” the condition of voluntary madnessthat is a hallmark of poets like Rimbaud and Artaud, as well as of occultistsand shamans, and people like Breton, Masson, Ernst, Duchamp and so many others.The energy of the surrealist movement perhaps finds its culmination in Laing; weare certainly living now in a state of denouement in which the ideas of Lainghave been discarded or ignored by a profession that seems to have found itssavior in chemical therapies that treat symptoms, and make the neurotic andpsychotic more productive members of an increasingly unhappy and alienatedsociety.It was not only Laing who represented this new appraisal of surrealist ideas.Even Mircea Eliade—cited earlier for his insights into the link betweenshamanism and madness—speaks directly to the problem, writing in 1969:It is naively believed that six months of “field work” among a tribe whoselanguage one can scarcely speak haltingly constitutes “serious” work that canadvance the knowledge of man—and one ignores all that surrealism or James Joyce,Henry Michaux, and Picasso have contributed to the knowledge of man.The contemporary artistic experiments are capable of aiding the historians ofreligions in their own research … It is not without interest to note, forexample, that in their revolt against the traditional forms of art and theirattacks on bourgeois society and morality the surrealists not only elaborated arevolutionary aesthetic but also formulated a technique by which they hoped tochange the human condition. (emphasis in original)30Eliade recognized the attempt by the surrealists—more than any other “artisticmovement”—to actually change humanity. This historian of religion, mysticism andshamanism saw kindred spirits among the surrealists, and wondered openly aboutthe value of his anthropological colleagues living with primitive tribes forshort periods and writing up elaborate explanations of their culture andbeliefs, when there was such a rich storehouse of knowledge about the humancondition sitting ignored in the texts and artworks of the surrealists and othervoluntary madmen. He goes on to state in the same paragraph that the exercisesof the surrealists “recall certain Yogic or Zen practices” and that the effortof the surrealists to enter into a state of consciousness that combines both thesleeping and the waking states—à la the hypnotic trance—was nothing less than“the desire to effect in concrete the coincidence of opposites, the hope ofbeing able to annul history in order to begin anew with the original power andpurity—nostalgia and hopes rather familiar to historians of religions.”31Did the surrealists succeed? Did they leave a map for others to follow?I will take a very big chance of alienating many people by stating that it maybe wrong to consider surrealism as simply another artistic movement. The statedgoal of the surrealists—as revealed in the succession of manifestos thatappeared in the 1920s and 1930s, usually from the pen of Andre Breton, butsigned and ratified by the surrealist luminaries of the time—was nothing lessthan open communication between the conscious and unconscious minds, and theexpected resultant freedom and empowerment of the individual. They intended toaccomplish this in ways that were, in a sense, anti-intellectual, although theliterature of surrealism see-saws between the intensely intellectual and theplayfully poetic. In a sense, the surrealists used artistic media as weapons intheir revolutionary struggle to liberate human consciousness. As a socialmovement—that is, as a movement with the intention of affecting as many membersof society as possible, rather than through a slow and arduous process ofinitiation—they did share a few elements in common with both the psychologicalwarfare officers (engaged in “world-view warfare”) and the men of MK-ULTRA.The surrealists sought to tap the powers of the mind using psychiatry andoccultism (whatever would work, whatever would help them break through thebarrier between consciousness and unconsciousness), and in this they are notvery different from shamans, not very different from the men of MK-ULTRA.Art—painting, sculpture, poetry, fiction, and even (with Bunuel and Dali)cinema—happened to be the medium in which they worked, but surrealism was bornon the battlefields of World War I, as the confrontation between life and death,between existence and non-existence, forced a generation of artists to chosebetween the dangerous ignorance of a cultivated sanity and the seemingly crystalclarity of madness. The hideousness of that conflict, the first“high-technology” war using tanks, airplanes, mass communications, and chemicalweapons, traumatized a generation. Breton began life as a medical student, andworked with shell-shocked soldiers at the front. Andre Masson, another importantsurrealist, fought in the War and spent agonizing hours wounded, lying in aditch face-to-face with a dead German soldier, literally “facing death.” Usingautomatic writing, hypnosis, and later various occult techniques and occultstudies such as alchemy and ceremonial magic, the surrealists tried to penetratethe secrets of the mind; this endeavor would be repeated by the CIA a few yearsafter World War II, continuing for decades until fear of discovery made themeither cancel their projects or disguise them in some way. The preliminary goalsof the surrealists and the spies were the same: unlock the secrets of theunconscious mind, understand amnesia, hypnotic trance, hysteria, dissociation,multiple personalities and “the self,” and the human will. Yet, the ultimategoals were quite different. For the surrealists, the liberation of humanity—theperfect freedom of men and women—was their target, their raison d’etre. For theCIA and the military, the aim was the enslavement of those minds and theharnessing of consciousness to political and military purposes. The surrealistsused the garret, the artist’s studio, the writer’s desk; the CIA used thelaboratory, the interrogation room, the torture chamber.This is not to say that the surrealists were apolitical. A little-discussed andperhaps consciously-ignored aspect of the surrealist movement is the strength oftheir political commitment. Art historians tend to avoid political analysis asmuch as military historians ignore the religious or spiritual framework ofcombating forces (such as the occult nature of much of the Third Reich, andespecially of the SS). However, the widespread and energetic politicalinvolvement of the surrealists is as important to a complete understanding ofwhat they were as are their psychic explorations. As early in the movement as1925, when the French government began to suppress Moroccan tribesmen in theirAfrican colonies, the surrealists expressed a political agenda that wasanti-authoritarian, anti-colonial and—eventually—anti-fascist as well. Breton’sManifesto of the 121, for instance, was an attack on the Algerian war of the1950s.Most importantly, though, was surrealism’s clear-cut opposition to both fascismand Stalinism. While they supported revolution against oppressive authority ingeneral, and could be considered a kind of socialist movement in sympathy withMarxism-Leninism, they opposed totalitarian governments. Their aim, after all,was the liberation of the human soul. Breton spoke out publicly against fascismin the 1930s (for instance, in Belgium in 1934), and surrealism eventually cameto the attention of the Nazis. The Nazi “art exhibit” of 1937, Degenerate “Art,”was a clear attack on the surrealist movement which was, after all, an affrontto fascism not only politically but also “spiritually.” The surrealists were onthe Nazi death lists, and they had to flee.As noted in Book I, virtually the entire surrealist movement managed to escapethe Third Reich and go into exile abroad: Breton, Ernst, and so many othersavoided the death camps through the assistance of Valerian Fry and others, thesame people who helped Hans Habe escape to America. It is of great interest tothis study that the artistic movement most singled out by the Nazis fordestruction was surrealism, for the surrealists may have been polar opposites ofthe Nazis when it came to political ideas, but they were just as fascinated bythe occult and by the possibilities of human consciousness. The Nazis, however,were a cult, and cults can admit of no competing cults. While it would be rashto label surrealism a “cult,” it was not purely an artistic movement, either.Art was their medium of expression, but the experiments entertained by themovement—including in one case hypnotic trances carried out every day for morethan a year by surrealist Rene Crevel—were more in line with psychic researchand psychoanalysis than sculpture.In 1938, Breton famously met exiled Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky inMexico, accompanied at the time by painter Diego Rivera, and they penned yetanother manifesto, this time on revolution and art. It was an attack onStalinism, of course, and the photo that exists of Trotsky, Breton and Riverastanding around in Mexico, chatting, tells us more about why the surrealistswere despised—and why they were important—than any volume of art analysis. FromBreton the medical man, Breton the psychotherapist in the trenches, Breton thepoet and founder of the surrealist movement, Breton the psychic researcher, toBreton the anti-fascist and revolutionary: a single man can so succinctlyrepresent the entire flow of ideas in this work:He managed to escape the Nazis during World War II and wound up in exile.In December 1945, he gave a speech on surrealism in Haiti.A few days later, the Haitian government was overthrown in a popular uprising.John Lilly on sensory deprivation and hallucinations; James Clark Moloney on thesimilarities between interrogation and religious experience; the surrealists andthe occult … and anti-fascism. Perhaps the reader will agree that the thesis Ihave been promoting is not so far-fetched after all. Intelligence agency andsecret military mind-control programs, psychological warfare, and … art and …religion. In Books I and II we have looked at CIA programs affiliated withMK-ULTRA which investigated paranormal phenomena as well as occultism of varioustypes. We have examined the CIA’s promotion (and investigation) of hallucinogenssuch as LSD-25, as well as shamanistic resources like psilocybin and mescalineand the Flesh of God. We’ve watched as OSS scientists such as Henry Murraybecame involved in drug research (with Timothy Leary) and interrogationtechniques (on Ted Kaczysnki, the Unabomber). If we match what the CIA was doingunder BLUEBIRD, ARTICHOKE, and MK-ULTRA with religious conversion phenomena,mystical practices, shamanistic rituals, and the initiatory cults of Europe,Asia, Africa and other areas, we will better understand the role of psychology,philosophy, and organized religion in modern American politics.In Book I we saw how Nazism infected many American political and industrialleaders, and in another place (Unholy Alliance) I showed how Nazism was (and is)in fact a cult, with an ideology all its own. We have seen how the ChristianRight has supported a political agenda at home in America and abroad in thedeveloping nations. We have witnessed the merger of organized religions such asRoman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy with both fascist and Nazi politicalparties and with “ethnic outreach” programs in Europe and the United States. Wesaw how the churches helped many Nazi war criminals not only escape justice, butthrive and prosper in their new countries.We will also see how this moral blindness has contributed to the phenomenon ofthe serial killer, the mass murderer, and to the present state of world affairs.I apologize if this perspective is disturbing, and I am sensitive to thecriticism that there may be other explanations for the data I have alreadypresented, as well as the data I am about to describe. However, the state of theworld today requires us more than ever to seriously consider these strangearguments, for they offer an explanation for modern events that no other, lesscontroversial, course of study so far has been able to contribute.There is no such “condition” as “schizophrenia,” but the label is a social factand the social fact is a political event.—The Politics of Experience (emphasis in original)32--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Peter Dale Scott, Deep Politics and the Death of JFK, University of CaliforniaPress, Berkeley, 1996, p. 12 2 David Lomas, The Haunted Self, Yale University Press, New Haven, 2000, p. 67 3 John Bossy, Giordano Bruno and the Embassy Affair, Yale University Press, NewHaven, 1991, p. 101 4 Ibid., p. 154 5 Ibid., p. 146-154 6 Ibid., p. 154 7 Ioan P.

Naturally, I am interested in theactors, character actors, director, producers, cinematographers, and writers;but I am also interested in the locations, the musical score (the composer, thearrangers, the selections of pre-recorded music and their performers andcomposers, etc.), as well as in the organizations and people thanked by theproducers, usually at the end of the long list of credits and just before thecopyright notices. This means I am usually the last person sitting in thetheater when the house lights go up.Now, with the advent of video tape and especially of DVD technology, I am ableto watch these credits more carefully, rewind and re-read, and generally perfectmy education. What I am doing with film is what I do with novels, non-fiction,government files, police reports, interviews and news reports: data mining. It’shard on the eyes and taxes the brain—and the patience of those around you. Whenyou discover connections no one else has, you are elated until you find yourselfgreeted by annoyed glances of “so what?” and “here we go again.” Yet, therewards can be great if your prey is the dark matter at the heart of existence.I grew up watching old films on a small black-and-white television. These weremostly gritty gangster flicks and propaganda films from World War II. My motherwould share bits of information about the personal lives of some of the actors,and this made me aware of another world hiding behind the celluloid world. Iwatched James Cagney, Errol Flynn, Humphrey Bogart, Ronald Coleman … A Tale ofTwo Cities, The Light That Failed, Casablanca, and all the sentimental,swashbuckling tales of the 1930s and 1940s. Singin’ in the Rain, Easter Parade,Oklahoma!, The Wizard of Oz,The Bells of St. Mary’s, Boy’s Town … Like it ornot, the themes and attitudes of these films helped mold a certain way oflooking at the world, a way of expecting heroism, self-sacrifice, humor,gallantry, and resolve in the face of danger. A Passage to Marseilles, The Crossof Lorraine … I learned how to be a gentleman watching performances by RonaldColeman, Michael Rennie and George Sanders … and then learned that there was noroom for gentlemen in the Postwar world. Gentlemen, I discovered, weredinosaurs: obsolete, like the black-and-white screen I grew up watching, inwhich the world itself was reduced to a case of black versus white, of evilversus good.When I left home at the tender age of eighteen, I moved to a tiny studioapartment in Brooklyn Heights not far from the legendary haunts of Henry Miller,Walt Whitman, and Norman Mailer. I did not have a television set, and would notown or watch a television set for another ten years, all through the decade ofthe 1970s. Co-workers felt this was an indication that I was some kind ofsubversive, or perhaps an alien. Others would say I had not missed a thing.Instead, I went to the movies.Things had changed since the propaganda flicks of the 1940s. Now we had a moresophisticated medium, offering us Catch-22, A Clockwork Orange, The KremlinLetter, Anne of a Thousand Days, Joe, The Revolutionary, The StrawberryStatement, Slaughterhouse-Five. And then I discovered foreign films. Murmur ofthe Heart, Sunday Bloody Sunday, Belle de Jour, Satyricon, Roma, La NuitAmericaine. Suddenly I had developed a taste for Truffaut, Malle, Fellini,Bunuel. When a new film was screened in Manhattan—usually on a Thursday—I wouldtake off work, call in sick, and be the first one into the theater for the firstrun of the film in New York. Sometimes I would see two films on the same day, anunheard-of luxury for a young man working at minimum wage as an inventory clerkwho sometimes had to walk to work across the Brooklyn Bridge and up to 32ndStreet—a jaunt of several miles—just to save the subway fare to buy an ice creamfor lunch at Grand Central Station on 42nd Street. At night, I would return hometo my studio apartment—really a former pantry that had been blessed with amodern bathroom, the largest and most comfortable room in the damp, freezingstudio—and work on my short stories, which were experiments along the line ofsurrealism.I foraged for Grove Press books at a store in a subway arcade under MadisonSquare Garden, and began to read Burroughs and Kerouac and Ginsberg. I wasalone, my parents had separated, my brother and sister were still in high schooland living with our mother in the Bronx, and the books—and the movies—were mycompany and my education and culture. The artistic nudes in Evergreen were myintroduction to the female form. Paperbacks by Abbie Hoffman and Regis Debrayand Chairman Mao were my introduction to subversive politics, politics as a kindof culture, a kind of artform. Movies, books, politics all became a homogenousmass, a black mass of revolution, freedom, exhilaration. I wore a beret, andread French newspapers. I made friends in Brooklyn Heights and spent time insidewalk cafes, talking about Vietnam and Palestine, assassinations andrebellions, art and film and poetry. I might as well have been in Paris. OrBarcelona. Or Prague, until that deadly Spring.But underneath all of that was another reality, one I had suppressed; a realityof séances and Ouija boards, churches and liturgical celebrations, Russians andSyrians and spies. I had befriended students of similar ethnic background asmyself, people of Czech and Slovak ancestry who spoke the languages and had onefoot in the Old Country. I was introduced to the world of the Eastern Orthodoxchurches, a demimonde in the middle of New York City populated by exiledcountesses and bearded archimandrites, of low-level agents and fascistsympathizers. It was a fascinating, glamorous world for a sixteen- andseventeen-year-old boy from the Bronx and one in which I easily fit. I wasdesperately hungry for culture, for knowledge, for an explanation of the thingsI had lived through in my life so far. America did not provide much in the wayof culture beyond television and sports, or so I thought, and the exiledEuropean communities presented me with entire, fully-articulated culturalexperiences involving languages, cuisines, religions and politics. I soon beganto study Church Slavonic, to the point where I could read it effortlessly andchant along with the monks in the Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian, Bulgarian,Slovenian, Carpatho-Russian orthodox churches of New York City.And one day, in the company of one of my friends, I went to see a film starringAnthony Quinn and Michael Caine, The Magus. Based on the best-selling novel byJohn Fowles, the film made a great impression on my young mind. I left thetheater wondering if everything I saw around me was an illusion; if the peoplearound me were merely actors, playing a role designed to elicit from me somespecific reaction, like the Michael Caine character in the film who is anEnglishman living on a Greek island, befriended by the mysterious Anthony Quinncharacter who stage manages an entire experience for him, to the point whereCaine does not know if he is going mad.Film had that ability, I realized. An ability to alter perceptions of reality,if only for a moment. What power! And this was long before I ever heard ofsubliminal messages in advertising or films: little snippets of film, a fewframes long, inserted into the tape so that your conscious mind did not recordthe images but your unconscious mind—which sees everything—did. No, this wassimply the artistry of the motion picture, the power of actors and plot andlighting and music to work on your mind to such an extent that you lost contactwith your historical world and entered into one invented by the filmmakers. Anunconscious suspension of disbelief. An open challenge to your “worldview.” Mindcontrol.My father had been an actor for a while, and had copies of Stanislavksi’swritings on the Method, alongside a complete set of the works of Edgar AllanPoe. Maybe, I thought, there was more to this than simply memorizing lines andpretending to be someone else and looking pretty while doing it. As I grewolder, I discovered that the writings of Stanislavski were applicable to a widerange of human experience. No wonder Hollywood actors feel they have somethingto say about everything, I thought, even if they don’t! Stanislavski makes thembelieve they do, makes them believe that acting gives them an insight that isrelevant to all of human experience. The true Method actor is a kind ofinitiate, a voluntary madman, and opens himself or herself up to forces he orshe does not understand, but which are potent nonetheless. And theseforces—being summoned—then act upon those in close proximity. That was thepoint, after all, of the very first theatrical performances in ancient Greece,which were sacerdotal in nature, a conjuration of the gods. That was whytheatrical performances were banned by the medieval Church as occasions of sinand tools of the Devil. And that is why the American film industry is seen assuch a threat to the cultures and mores of people living in developing nationsaround the world. It is, as the splendid German phrase has it, “world-viewwarfare.”THE METHODLet me remind you of our cardinal principle: through conscious means we reachthe subconscious.— Stanislavski4“They told me that you had gone totally insane, and … uh… that your methods wereunsound.”“Are my methods unsound?”“I don’t see any … method … at all, sir.”—an exchange between Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) and Captain Willard(Martin Sheen) in Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now! On October 7, 1947—a few months after the first modern American UFO sighting inJune and the Roswell “crash” in July—the Actor’s Studio was opened in New YorkCity. An organization dedicated to teaching actors the Stanislavski “Method,” itwas mentored by Lee Strasberg and Sandy Meisner, both strong adherents of theMethod who at the same time became mortal enemies due to “artistic differences.”Thirteen days later, on October 20, 1947 the House Committee on Un-AmericanActivities or HUAC began its investigation into Communist infiltration of theHollywood movie business. Ronald Reagan (FBI agent T-10) was one of the first tobetray his friends as Communists, thus paving the way for a career in Americanpolitics, first as Republican Governor of California and later as President ofthe United States. Walt Disney was another one eager to cooperate with theCommittee, as was Jack Warner of Warner Brothers and Louis B. Mayer of MGM.While the two events are seemingly unrelated, it is ironic to realize thatStanislavski—a Russian who stayed in Russia after the Revolution and who died inMoscow in 1938—would wield such an influence over American acting and filmmakingeven as HUAC was attempting to clean out Hollywood of Communists, Communistsympathizers, and fellow travelers.Eventually, one of Lee Strasberg’s most famous pupils at the Actor’s Studiowould be Marilyn Monroe.Konstantin Stanislavksi was born Konstantin Sergeyevich Alekseyev in Moscow in1863. The child of a wealthy family of manufacturers, he had the freedom tochoose his career and went wholeheartedly into acting, forming—in 1897—thecelebrated Moscow Art Theater or MAT. His performances as an actor in roles byChekhov and Ibsen, as well as Shakespeare’s Othello, earned him renown not onlyin Russia but throughout Europe. One of his other, more famous, accomplishmentsas a director includes Maurice Maeterlinck’s The Blue Bird, and of course withthat, as detailed in Book I, we are back at the ranch. The Blue Bird would onceagain be performed in Moscow, but this time in 1976 as a film directed by GeorgeCukor and starring Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Fonda, Ava Gardner, Cicely Tyson, andmany others in a star-studded cast that was the first ever US–Soviet joint filmproduction. It was not, however, the first film version of Maeterlinck’s play,but it has been the last to date. (Oddly enough, the first was a 1940 offeringby Walter Lang starring Shirley Temple, released just one year after The Wizardof Oz.) Stanislavski was evidently very much taken with Maeterlinck, for hementions him and The Blue Bird several times in An Actor Prepares. AsMaeterlinck was well-known as a mystic, an astrologer, and a spiritualist aswell as a Nobel-Prize winning author, we should not be startled to realize thatStanislavksi’s “method,” for all its naturalistic emphasis, has its roots veryfirmly in the occult tradition, particularly that represented by the surrealistpoint of view.Consider the following:I have no desire to prove whether Prana really exists or not. My sensations maybe purely individual to me, the whole thing may be the fruit of my imagination.That is all of no consequence provided I can make use of it for my purposes andit helps me.5In discussing Prana—the Sanskrit term for “the breath of life” or spirit, power,vitality, etc.—Stanislavski was applying yoga and yogic techniques to husbandingthis energy and using it in performance for everything from breath control tophysical presence on the stage. (Is it a coincidence that the film company thatproduced the first vampire film, Nosferatu—a company created by Germanoccultists—would also be named Prana?) Stanislavski’s approach is a common-senseone that the surrealists would have approved, for he does not care if Pranaexists in an objective sense, only that he can use the concept to help him inhis work. This fits in very well with Breton’s insistence that there was no suchthing as a ghost, but that mediumship was useful and interesting.Stanislavski was clear about the cardinal principle of the Method: “throughconscious means we reach the subconscious.” This was, of course, the surrealistagenda, except that for Stanislavski it was dangerous and pointless to penetratethe subconscious realm directly. One had to approach it obliquely, to coax itinto making an appearance, and then when it did, not interfere. This ability ofthe subconscious he called “intuition,” and it was an actor’s greatest asset.In order to summon intuition—in order to consciously reach the subconscious, inhis words—he made use of physical gestures and of providing background storiesfor the characters portrayed, thereby developing actors’ sense memories. One ofthe most difficult aspects of the Method for many actors is this delving deeplyinto one’s past, dredging up past traumas in order to use the energy, thegestures, the reactions constructively in a role.It is a type of psychoanalysis, after all, in which an actor is made to undergopainful experiences from his past in a classroom full of his fellow students.This conscious invocation of pain and memory is an echo of the shamanisticinitiations we discussed briefly in the previous chapter. It is a deliberateattempt to induce a kind of hysteria in the student-actor while maintaining hisor her conscious control over it. A very difficult and very demanding process,and one that does not have psychological integration as the goal. Rather, thissystem can be used to create a kind of dissociation necessary for the kind ofspectacular performances we have come to expect of a Brando, a Pacino, a DeNiro.A Christopher Walken.For what is an actor but a person who specializes in multiple personalities? Whodeliberately invokes—on a stage, night after night—an alien presence into hisbody, his consciousness?The structure of the play, the static form of the lines to be recited, thenecessity to react to the other actors in the right time and place, act as akind of ritual, enabling the performers to retain their sanity to the end. (Mymother told me the story—certainly apocryphal, for I have found no record ofthis—that the Broadway theater cast of Erskine Caldwell’s Tobacco Road had gonesomewhat insane as a result of portraying the same miserable, defeatedcharacters night after night, and could not “get out of character” once theperformance was over. Such was the reputed pernicious power of the “Method.”) Asnoted previously, theater was originally presented not as entertainment but aseducation and illumination. It was sacerdotal in nature, a religious andmystical experience, and the actors prepared for this accordingly. WhatStanislavski did was to put down on paper and in practice a codified form ofthis ancient system, for acting had in a sense degenerated since that time intoone-dimensional pantomime. Actors no longer thought of their function as sacredor mystical, but as a vehicle for ego, for self-dramatization at the expense ofthe play. Stanislavski brought the actors back to a realization of theimportance of their art by speaking of the subconscious and of “psychicprocesses,” thus elevating acting to a kind of priestly role.Our subconscious is inaccessible to our consciousness. We cannot enter into thatrealm. If for any reason we do penetrate it, then the subconscious becomesconscious and dies.6What Stanislavski means here is that the raising of the subconscious toconsciousness robs the subconscious of its energy. Freud understood thatsubconscious (or unconscious) material drew energy into itself from the veryfact of its suppression. Stanislavski did not want perfectly individuated andpsychically integrated actors, for they would not have the artistic temperamentrequired to make their performances come alive. Yet, he did want to tap thatenergy in a conscious way. He wanted, in other words, to play with fire: to havehis cake and eat it too.Fortunately there is a way out. We find the solution in an oblique instead of adirect approach. In the soul of a human being there are certain elements whichare subject to consciousness and will. These accessible parts are capable inturn of acting on psychic processes that are involuntary.To be sure, this calls for extremely complicated creative work. It is carried onin part under the control of our consciousness, but a much more significantproportion is subconscious and involuntary.To raise your subconscious to creative work there is a special technique. Wemust leave all that is in the fullest sense subconscious to nature, and addressourselves to what is within our reach. When the subconscious, when intuition,enters into our work we must know how not to interfere.7What he is discussing are the physical gestures that can “accidentally” releasesubconscious energy, and the evocation of personal memories which are“accessible” and which can act on involuntary psychic processes. He is askinghis students to allow themselves to become vehicles for the roles to beperformed. This can have its dangerous aspect, but the method used byStanislavski—while much more intense than normal acting classes which rely onbasic stagecraft—is primarily safe insofar as it goes, although in unstablepeople some of the exercises could cause emotional distress if the teacher isnot experienced enough to handle the rough psychological fallout. In any event,the Method is a viable means of awakening the unconscious, and it does so withina socially-acceptable context of theater arts.The problem—from the point of view of initiation—is that the unconscious isawakened and put to use for different roles, different performances, in aconsciously-controlled environment that is not conducive to spiritual growth inand of itself. Today you are Othello, tomorrow Romeo. You have no control overthe order or nature of the roles you take on. Unlike a magician or shaman whohas a set path to follow and a set order of experience, an actor puts on andtakes off personalities like a voodoo practitioner who becomes possessed bydifferent gods. The spiritual growth of a voodoo devotee (from the point of viewof shamanistic initiation) is not clear. His ability to become possessed by hisgods does not immediately suggest that he has entered upon a spiritual path withintegration or individuation (to use the Jungian term) as its goal. The voodoopriest, however, is another matter, and in order to be successful and attaincredibility among his congregation he must have passed through a completeinitiatic program, much as his ancestors and present-day counterparts in westernAfrica.The Method actor is—for all his preparation and soul-searching and intensity ofconcentration—still at the whim of the demands of the theatrical world. It is abusiness, a job, and requires one to be able to be different people at differenttimes, all on command. The audience is in a similar situation. They do notprogress through a set program of theatrical events, rising in spiritual orpsychological understanding with each passing performance. Instead, theirexperience is as willy-nilly as that of the actors themselves. Unlike thecalendar of ritual used by the Catholic Church, for instance, in which Epiphanyfollows Christmas with unerring regularity and the Christian year moves slowlyinto Lent and then Holy Week and Good Friday and Easter, a theatrical calendarcan be anything, in any combination, at any time. It is considered“entertainment,” but those of us who have witnessed great performances—whetheron stage or screen—instinctively know that entertainment is a weak descriptionof what has transpired. For westerners in the 21st-century world, theater andespecially cinema is the closest thing to a spiritual experience many of us willever have. That is why we so easily misunderstand and miscalculate thetremendous influence of religion in developing countries that do not have theirown movie industry … and the horror with which many non-westerners viewHollywood Babylon.ANGER MANAGEMENT“The only performance that makes it, that really makes it all the way, is theone that achieves madness.”—Mick Jagger as “Turner” in Performance (1968)Filmmaker Kenneth Anger (1929 - ) began his career as a child actor in aproduction of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1935)—the only sound film ever made byMax Reinhardt, the Austrian stage director, which was also the film debut ofOlivia de Havilland, and featured an all-star cast including James Cagney, DickPowell and Mickey Rooney (as Puck). He eventually moved behind the camera towrite and direct such cult classics as Kustom Kar Kommando (1965) and ScorpioRising (1963), Invocation of My Demon Brother (1969), and Inauguration of thePleasure Dome (1954-56). Some critics have insisted that Anger is the precursorof—and inspiration for—such directors as David Lynch, Pier Paolo Pasolini,Martin Scorcese and Francis Ford Coppola. His involvement with Thelema—the cultfounded by Aleister Crowley—is clearly evident in everything from Pleasure Dome,which featured Anais Nin and Marjorie Cameron (Jack Parsons’ wife) to DemonBrother, which featured Manson Family member and convicted murderer BobbyBeausoleil as well as Anton LaVey of the Church of Satan. When we search forlinks and connections between the Ordo Templis Orientis (OTO), the Church ofSatan, the Manson Family, Hollywood, and Sixties rock ’n’ roll, we can do worsethan to begin with Kenneth Anger.The ’69 Tate massacre was not Old Hollywood. What befell the red house on CieloDrive resembled the devastation caused by a jet plane crash: the Bad ShipLollipop piloted by Uncle Sugar. Charlie Manson—programmed puppet, deus exgarbage can.—Kenneth Anger 8Now more than 75 years old, Anger made his impact on Hollywood with a filmentitled Fireworks, which was released in 1947 and caught the eye of French poetand filmmaker Jean Cocteau. Cocteau (1889-1963) was one of the earliest“surrealist” filmmakers, with his Le Sang d’un Poete (The Blood of a Poet)released in 1930, and he was part of the symbolist entourage around suchnotables as Claude Debussy, designing the sets for Debussy’s Pelleas etMelisande, which was itself an operatic version of a Maeterlinck play onMerovingian themes. He is perhaps better known for his film Orphee (Orpheus),released in 1950, which received wide critical acclaim and which was aninterpretation of the myth of Orpheus who descended into the Underworld,certainly an initiatic theme. Even more importantly for us, Cocteau wasidentified as one of the leaders of the Priory of Sion (the French societywhich, it is claimed, holds secret information concerning the bloodline of JesusChrist) by the investigative team of Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln in theircontroversial bestseller based on documents found in the Bibliotheque Nationalein Paris, Holy Blood, Holy Grail,9 and for some background on the French occultsocieties that interpenetrated French artistic circles, Holy Blood, Holy Grailis a good introduction, and shows how deeply artists like Cocteau and Debussywere involved in everything from Rosicrucian mysteries to Cathar revivalism.(Cocteau’s design for a mural of the crucifixion in the Notre Dame de Francecathedral in London is a blatant Rosicrucian—and Templar—allegory which wouldhave appealed to Anger, with its hints of Egyptian and occult symbolism.)Anger followed Fireworks with Rabbit’s Moon in 1950 and Eaux d’Artifice in 1953,having become deeply involved in occultism of the Aleister Crowley varietyduring his high school years. One of his films, the early Les Chants deMaldoror, now lost, was based on the famous pre-surrealist “prose poem” of thesame name by the doomed visionary, Lautreamont, who was such an influence overBreton and the surrealist movement. This fusion of occultism with art and cinemaplaces Anger firmly within the surrealist category, at least for a time early inhis career.With his critical bonafides supplied by Cocteau, he spent time in France workingfor the director of the Cinematheque Francais and wrote what would become anunderground classic: Hollywood Babylon, published originally in French in 1959.This was an exploration of Hollywood’s seamier side, revealing scandal afterscandal, murder, suicide, drugs and sex, which opens with a famous quotationfrom Aleister Crowley’s Book of the Law, the “Bible” of his religion of Thelema:“Every man and every woman is a star.” A sensation in France, it eventually madeit into an English version in the United States in 1975. In the interim, Angerhad become part of the Rolling Stones’ entourage and had traveled with them ontour, finding time to cultivate friendships within the sinister nexus thataccumulated around Charles Manson, the Church of Satan, and the OTO. MansonFamily member Susan Atkins had already performed for the Church of Satan as avampire in a black mass, an effort that was caught on film and preserved forposterity.In fact, it is with Anger that we gain a backstage pass to the ebb and flow ofthe sinister forces at work in America, for he seems to be either at the centeror the periphery of some of America’s most pivotal cultural events from the1950s through the 1970s, and beyond. From his early film starring MarjorieCameron and Anais Nin, to films featuring performances by Bobby Beausoleil, MickJagger, Keith Richards, Anton LaVey, and so many others, we find that Anger isthere for everything from the doomed Thelema Lodge of the OTO to the MagickPowerhouse of Oz to the Church of Satan to the Charles Manson Family to Altamontand “Sympathy for the Devil.” For a while, death and destruction seemed to hoveraround Anger like demented groupies at a Megadeth concert.In 1955, Kenneth Anger went to Cefalu, Sicily, the site of Aleister Crowley’sAbbey of Thelema during Mussolini’s rule, with the intention of doing adocumentary on the place, and found it essentially intact, from an occult andartistic point of view anyway. Many of the murals painted by Crowley were stillin evidence, albeit whitewashed over by nervous villagers who had the placeexorcised after Crowley’s departure, much as the cottage where Stephen Wardresided at Cliveden was exorcised, and Anger shot a lot of film on-site, at onepoint escorting famed sexologist Alfred Kinsey around the place. 10This was ayear after he had released Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome featuring MarjorieCameron. Thus, by the mid-1950s, Anger was thoroughly in the midst of a magicalquest, and used his preferred artistic medium—film—to record, celebrate, andilluminate the fact.This fusion of occultism and film was not the first attempt to use the medium topromote a surrealist agenda, but it was one of the more accessible toavant-garde American audiences. By the 1950s, it is doubtful whether surrealism,per se, was still a force to be reckoned with in the artistic world; the Beatswere taking over the imagination of the disaffected young with poetry byGinsberg and Ferlinghetti, fiction by Kerouac and Burroughs, and a generation ofthe beret-wearing, black-turtlenecked, finger-snapping, bongo-playing,professionally-alienated “artistes,” so charmingly portrayed by the cartooncharacter GoGo Man Van Gogh in the bizarre animated series Beanie and Cecil. Thedifference between Anger’s offerings and surrealist art in general was thatAnger’s was a specifically occult production, attempting to convey occult ideas,as well as other “marginal” concepts such as homosexuality, sadomasochism, etc.Whether or not Anger deliberately attempted to cause change in humanconsciousness with his films (most of which were quite short) or whether hisgoal was simply self-expression in the context of a radical approach tofilmmaking cannot be easily understood. What is easier to trace is hisinvolvement with occult organizations, especially as they connect to the arts ingeneral.Among the most influential rock bands of the late 1960s and early ’70s were theRolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, and The Doors. All three of these bands had verystrong links with occultism. Jim Morrison, the leading light of The Doors,married Patricia Kennely, a Welsh Traditionalist witch whose Craft genealogy canbe traced directly back to Gerald Gardner and Aleister Crowley. Led Zeppelin’sJimmy Page became so involved with Crowley’s occultism (some say, due to KennethAnger’s proselytizing) that he bought Crowley’s old estate in Scotland:Boleskine. Even the Beatles would put a picture of Aleister Crowley on the backof their Sergeant Pepper album among the “People We Like,” and we remember theirpilgrimage to India to sit the feet of the Maharishi (along with Mia Farrow, ofRosemary’s Baby fame).But it is the relationship of the Rolling Stones—and specifically of Mick Jaggerand Keith Richards—to hard-core occultism and satanism that fascinates us, andthe compelling figure of Kenneth Anger who lurks at the center of this uneasyalliance.One of the Stones’ most famous songs is “Sympathy for the Devil,” an intelligentand sinister paean to “his Satanic majesty.” It was the song being performed atAltamont when the Hell’s Angels killed a man in front of the stage beforethousands of witnesses. What only serious followers of the Stones already knowis that the strange “wooo-wooo” backup vocals are being performed by AnitaPallenberg and Marianne Faithfull, the lovers of Keith Richards and Mick Jagger,respectively. These two ladies were also very involved in occult practices,under the tutelage of Kenneth Anger, and had appeared in his Crowley-themedfilms. Pallenberg would later become involved in the suicide of a young man atthe home she shared with Keith Richards; Faithfull would record a song in honorof witchcraft, and would appear in the magazine published by the Process Churchof the Final Judgement.One of the entourage around Anger, Pallenberg, Faithfull and the Rolling Stoneswas a somewhat more successful filmmaker, Donald Cammell (1934-1996). Cammell isinteresting in this context because his father was none other than Charles J.Cammell, a biographer (the first) of Aleister Crowley. C.J. Cammell was a friendof not only Crowley but a whole coven’s worth of occultists, including VictorNeuberg, the man we discussed in the previous chapter as working at rituals withCrowley in North Africa. Donald Cammell grew up around occultists of everyvariety due to his father’s interests and claimed that he sat on Crowley’s lapat least once when he was a child (surely a cause for parental alarm?). Cammelldirected Pallenberg and Mick Jagger—as jaded rock star “Turner”—in his acclaimedfilm Performance (filmed in 1968, released with heavy cuts in 1971), and JulieChristie in his bizarre Demon Seed (1977), about a computer that impregnates ayoung woman played by Christie. His film Wild Side (1996)—starring ChristopherWalken, Anne Heche and Joan Chen—never saw theatrical distribution due toartistic differences between the director and the studio, NuImage, which waslooking for something less artistic and less different, and so retained finalcut and made a mess of Cammell’s vision. Wild Side eventually made it into thecable-tv world, albeit heavily cut and edited.His last completed work was White of the Eye (1988), about a serial killer andthe woman who loves him. Although it died at the box office, it was consideredan artistic success.Four films in his entire career, the themes running from a gangster and rockstar ménage à trois in Performance, to a computer fathering a child in DemonSeed, to another gangster and another ménage à trois in Wild Side, to a serialkiller in White of the Eye. He had false starts such as Ishtar, (a film thatwould have starred William Burroughs, Mick Jagger and Norman Mailer, about theBabylonian goddess returning to earth) and Fan Tan (a Marlon Brando projectabout piracy in the South Pacific). For various reasons, these projects nevercame to fruition. Performance, which made his name as a director to watch, washeavily influenced not only by the Rolling Stones and the rock ’n’ roll world ofLondon in the late Sixties, but also by occult mythology, in this case the worldof Hassan i-Sabah, he of the Assassins cult which figured so prominently in BookII. In addition, the shadows of Genet, Borges, the artist Francis Bacon andthemes of death, identity transfer, gender transfer, and transformationgenerally haunt this production from the very beginning. His cast included MickJagger and Anita Pallenberg, already wired into the British occult scene, andJames Fox (the brother of actor Edward Fox) who would do an about-face and beginworking for a Christian missionary organization right after filming was completeon Performance. He would not return to acting until 1983, even though he was awell-known actor who had starred in such films as The Chase (1965) with JaneFonda.Donald Cammell came to the attention of Kenneth Anger early on, and played therole of Osiris in Anger’s Lucifer Rising (1970), made during Anger’s RollingStones period. Anger said it was “type-casting.” Cammell was already well on theway to making surrealist films, and admitted his influences were Antonin Artaudand Jorge Luis Borges, the famous Argentine writer who gave the world some ofits most interesting and unearthly prose, fortified by prodigious learning andintellectual vigor, made all the more remarkable considering that Borges wasblind.It is said that Cammell’s last words were about Borges, as the bullet thatentered his skull did its damage and slowly dimmed the light of one ofHollywood’s least appreciated and certainly least understood directors,reprising the scene in which Turner is killed in Performance, as the camerashows us the bullet entering his skull (from above, the same awkward angleCammell chose for his own death) and culminating in a picture of Borges. Cammellcommitted suicide on April 23, 1996 when on the verge of revitalizing hiscareer, and it took him forty minutes to die in the arms of his wife, China(Patti Kong) Cammell.In his final years, Cammell—son of an occultist and a crypto-occultist himself,surrounded by witches and magicians—became mentally unhinged. He developed analternate personality, called “the uncensored Cammell,” who did outrageousthings in public (such as driving at high speed in the Hollywood hills,completely naked) that the other Cammell would never have done, and neverremembered afterward. This was a clear sign of dissociated identity disorder,and his friends asked him to seek medical help but it was no use. He claimed theanti-depressants he was prescribed actually made his situation worse. It is notknown whether the doctor he visited for only a few sessions was aware ofCammell’s increasing dissociation, or if he was just being treated fordepression. It is also entirely possible that Cammell was right, and that theanti-depressants made things worse by empowering the “uncensored Cammell.” Alas,we shall never know.In the same category of actors plagued by their art to the extent that they dothemselves damage is a more recent case, that of Hong Kong actor and singerLeslie Cheung, who committed suicide on April 1, 2003 by plunging from his HongKong hotel room window to the streets below. Mr. Cheung—a handsome young manwith an intelligent and knowing visage, an idol to Chinese men and women alikefor both his immensely popular songs and his movies—had starred in a recentstring of hits, including Double Tap (2000) and Inner Senses (2002). In DoubleTap he had portrayed a gunsmith and expert marksman who kills a man in an effortto save lives, only to discover that he enjoys killing, becoming, in effect, aserial murderer. It was a powerful performance by the boyish-looking singer, andled to Inner Senses, his last film.In Inner Senses—one of a growing number of excellent Asian horror films—heportrayed a psychotherapist who tries to help a young woman who is being driveninsane by visions of ghosts. As he cures her, he becomes “haunted” himself. Thefilm explores themes such as suicide, spiritual possession, the paranormal, andmadness with a rare, deft touch, and we watch as Mr. Cheung’s character goesslowly insane from guilt over the suicide of an old girlfriend when he was stillin secondary school. He begins the film by stating that repressed memoriesshould stay repressed, as they have been repressed for a reason (an odd positionfor a psychoanalyst!); and, in a kind of corollary, that “there are no suchthings as ghosts,” that ghosts represent useless information that cannot beaccommodated in other ways. As the film progresses to its climax, the Cheungcharacter’s own memories come to haunt him and nearly kill him. The penultimatescene is of the psychoanalyst, confronted with the ghost of his dead girlfriend,at the edge of a tall building saved at the last minute from falling to hisdeath by neutralizing his feelings of guilt over her suicide in a conversationwith her ghostly form. It’s the type of ending that would make sense to apsychotherapist, but perhaps not to Leslie Cheung himself, who became strangelywithdrawn and isolated after the completion of the film.The rumors in Asia at the time of his death were that the film had so shatteredhis psyche that he did not recover from its effects, and that theHollywood-style ending—so Western in its resolution of the problem by making theghost and the analyst “talk out” the problem, so that both ghost and analystcome away whole—was so artificial in an Asian context that Leslie Cheung couldfind no other way to resolve a deeper, mysterious personal problem except byresolving the film’s central problem with his own death, in exactly the same wayas it would have happened in the film: falling from a tall building. No oneknows why the actor committed suicide, and it shocked and saddened the entireChinese-speaking world to an extent reminiscent of the death of RudolphValentino nearly a century earlier. While in the West ghosts are the stuff oflegends and scary movies, in Asia ghosts are taken very seriously, and it isperhaps this cultural disconnect that opened a door into Mr. Cheung’s sensitivenature and caused a psychic imbalance. While James Fox left filmmakingaltogether after Performance in order to become a Christian missionary and sortout his inner turmoil in a more constructive manner, Leslie Cheung was not sofortunate. And, as it turned out, neither was Donald Cammell.It is interesting to think of the two director-occultists together on the sameset, as they were for Lucifer Rising: Donald Cammell, the pedigreed visionarywhose father knew Aleister Crowley and who himself met Crowley when he was achild in his Edinburgh home filled with art, music, fantasy, and magic; andKenneth Anger, the black magician wannabee who came at the occult from the darkside of satanism, sadomasochism, and sexuality. While neither man could claim tobe a Hollywood success story, it is clear that, from the point of view of thestudios, Cammell had somewhat more going for him. His four completed films werefull-length Hollywood movies with intricate plotting and character developmentand a profligate use of flashbacks, intercutting and hallucinogeniccinematography and special effects. By contrast, Anger’s films are shortsubjects on interesting themes, with some recognizable actors and film scores byJagger and Bobby Beausoleil, but on the whole curiosities of the art andextremely experimental, rather more in the line of filmed rituals, no matter howbeautifully realized. Both directors have become cult idols, of course, andcritics point to the influence of both Cammell and Anger over generations of newdirectors.Cammell himself confessed that he was an admirer of Anger and that Performancewas largely inspired by Anger’s work. At the time Performance was being filmed,Cammell was part of the entourage around the Rolling Stones including Pallenberg(who was leaving Brian Jones for Keith Richards), Marianne Faithfull (who wassupposed to have played Pallenberg’s role—Pherber—in the movie, but who had toleave the production due to pregnancy by Mick Jagger), Mick Jagger, KeithRichards and Brian Jones themselves, and Anger. It was also the year that“Sympathy for the Devil” was released, a song sung by Satan himself which becamethe soundtrack for the Altamont homicide the following year. It was Pallenbergand Faithfull who came up with the idea to use the “woo-woo” chant as backgroundvocals to the song and it is the two witches who actually perform it in the 1968recording. On a more recent note, the music of the Stones was employed almost asa physical presence in the occult thriller Fallen (1997), starring DenzelWashington as a police detective attempting to solve a series of murders whichare, in fact, being committed by a demon. In the beginning of the film, thedemon has possessed a serial killer, who sings “Time Is On My Side”—a song madefamous by the Stones—during his execution, and this song is picked up and usedthroughout the film as the signature tune of the demon. The credits go up,however, not with “Time Is On My Side” but with that other classic, “Sympathyfor the Devil.” The idea of a demonically-possessed serial killer was firstintroduced to American audiences with Exorcist III (1990), however, and is atheme whose powerful attraction is difficult to describe, but whose affect ongenuine serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer has already been noted.It is claimed by music historians that the Stones’ fascination with Crowley,magic and satanism ended with the tragedy at Altamont, a rock festival that waspromoted as a kind of “Woodstock West,” but which somehow degenerated into acatastrophe culminating in murder. That did not affect Anita Pallenberg orMarianne Faithfull in quite the same way, however, and there is no evidence thatthey abandoned their occult beliefs or practices after 1969. While there is alot of speculation that Kenneth Anger had relationships with members of theProcess Church of the Final Judgement, I have been unable to verify this.However, his close relationships with the Church of Satan and with the OTO isbeyond doubt, as they are heavily documented in Anger’s own films.With Pallenberg and Faithfull, however, we are on firmer ground, as we know thatFaithfull, for instance, once posed for the Process in a photo published intheir magazine (the same magazine that featured writing by Charles Manson in oneof their issues). Thus, through Faithfull and in the same time period asPerformance and Lucifer Rising, we have solid Process connections. In fact, a1999 update of Maury Terry’s 1987 book on the Son of Sam and Manson cases, TheUltimate Evil, shows that Manson met the Process as early as 1968—the same yearPerformance was being filmed—and in one case actually met Process members in theTate-Polanski home on Cielo Drive before the doomed actress moved in.11 WhileTerry’s conclusions are not always to be relied upon, his raw data is usuallytrustworthy. I believe it is safe to say that the circle around Anger knew theProcess fairly well and had contacts with them. To what extent exactly thesecontacts involved the darker side of both the Process and the Anger circle issubject to speculation.Pallenberg for her part was involved in a death that took place at the home sheshared with Keith Richards in 1979. The death is startling enough, but it tookplace in an area that was known as the “eastern headquarters” of the Process, inupstate New York near the Connecticut border, in the town of Pound Ridge.According to Terry, the Process had their headquarters nearby in theappropriately-named Salem, New York. The victim was a seventeen-year-oldcaretaker, Scott Cantrell, who shot himself to death in her bed. The death wasruled a suicide, but for a while it looked as if Pallenberg would be accused ofmanslaughter. It seems that Cantrell was talking of playing Russian Roulette.The nexus of events surrounding this location is compelling, however, for thesmall and remote area around Pound Ridge comes up several times in thisinvestigation, showing the twisting threads of coincidence and conspiracywrapped around themselves in a Gordian knot of sinister forces.For instance, actress Ali MacGraw (Love Story, Goodbye Columbus) grew up in thesame area—in the town of Bedford Village—which is not unusual in and of itself;but her father was rather unusual. A failed artist, he cultivated an interest inUFOs, Egyptian hieroglyphics, the mysterious Easter Island script, and manyother languages.12 He was a genius, born a little too late to be recognized in aworld that does not value arcane erudition, or, indeed, erudition of any kind atall. An embittered, angry man, he made life unpleasant for his family, even ashis gaze was turned towards a borderland reality they could not see.Ms. MacGraw’s first brush with the movie industry came in 1967 when she was partof the entourage around Barbarella, which was being filmed in Italy at the time.She met Jane Fonda and Anita Pallenberg off the set of that strange piece ofscience-fiction erotica; ironically, Fonda had already turned down the leadingrole in Rosemary’s Baby, the part that would eventually go to Mia Farrow.(Pallenberg’s role in Barbarella was as the Great Tyrant, a black-robed queen ofthe night.) Our interest in Ali MacGraw does not end there, however, for shebrings us into the world of Rosemary’s Baby producer Robert Evans, a man brieflybelieved to have been responsible for a murder connected to both the Son of Samcult and the Manson Family.Another link with Pound Ridge is a scandal that brewed there a few years ago,when local parents and teachers were upset over what they perceived to be a cultoperating among their schoolchildren. As it turned out, this “cult” was based onthe card game Magic, and Pound Ridge residents were convinced that the game wasteaching its children occult ideas and practices. Perhaps the good citizens ofPound Ridge were a little sensitive on the issue, considering the suspectedsatanic activity of their neighbors, from Anita Pallenberg to the Process.Before we leave Kenneth Anger, a closer look at two of his films—among the threeinvolving overt occult themes—is well-deserved, for they will set the stage forwhat is to follow.In Invocation of My Demon Brother, released in August 1969 (the same month asthe Tate/La Bianca murders in Hollywood), Anger himself plays the role of theMagus; Anton LaVey of the Church of Satan portrays Satan; and Bobby Beausoleil(one of the convicted Manson murderers) is the Trickster, smoking a pipe in theshape of a skull. The Rolling Stones make an appearance in the film, in footageshot in Hyde Park three days after the death of their colleague Brian Jones. Allthis, in a film only eleven minutes in length. Anger’s portrayal of himself asthe Magus—as the master magician in control of the environment—could beinterpreted as everything from wishful thinking and cinematic hyperbole to adarker (perhaps unconscious?) statement of moral responsibility. The year 1969is, after all, the year the energy summoned by the Summer of Love two yearspreviously began to die out, turn sour, and putrefy. The Manson murders inHollywood, Altamont … all this counter-culture evil taking place the same yearthat human beings first set foot on the moon in answer to the call of a martyredpresident.For Lucifer Rising, released definitively in 1980, Anger had a more ambitiousagenda. The producer of this film was none other than Anita Pallenberg, withAnger’s credits as director, editor and the film’s creator. Music was providedby Bobby Beausoleil, then in prison for life for the crime of murder (ofmusician Gary Hinman) in the first degree. Actors included Marianne Faithfull(as Lilith), and Donald Cammell as Osiris opposite his sometime lover MiriamGirbil as Isis. Kenneth Anger once again assumes the role of Magus.The footage was shot in various potent locations, from Gizeh, Luxor and Karnakin Egypt to Stonehenge in England … to Externsteine in Germany, the sacred paganshrine so venerated by the Nazis. Anger, Faithfull and Donald Cammell were alongfor the ride, shooting in the Egyptian desert at the foot of the pyramids atGizeh or at the temples of Luxor and Karnak. One can be reasonably certain thatmore than just filmmaking was taking place during this time. Bobby Beausoleilwas originally cast as Lucifer, but his incarceration made shooting a trifledifficult, and a total of five “Lucifers” were cast over the years—includingMick Jagger—before Anger settled on Leslie Huggins in the title role. Jimmy Pageof Led Zeppelin was writing music for the soundtrack, but he and Anger foughtover various issues, with Anger famously cursing Page and—according to thetabloids—causing all sorts of evil things to befall the Crowleyan musician andresident of Boleskine, where some of the footage was shot. Anger was upset overthe music Page had produced, and dismissed him as a mere occult dilettante. Whenthis author met Anger—in the company of the OTO in New York City about the timeof the release of Lucifer Rising—he appeared rather quick to denounce those withwhom he disagreed.One of the myths surrounding the film is that of the stolen footage, buried inthe California desert by an irate Bobby Beausoleil and never seen again.Beausoleil denies this episode, but Anger has claimed that it is true.Beausoleil, in an interview published on his own Web site, beausoleil.net,claims that no film footage ever existed, and implies that Anger was trying toplacate his “German backers” by saying that the film was stolen, when, in fact,he hadn’t shot a single frame. In any event, the production was beset by allsorts of difficulties and would not appear for more than ten years. Beausoleil,it should be remembered, had appeared in films before, notably as an Indianbrave in the soft-core porn epic Ramrodder, shot in Topanga Canyon not far fromthe Spiral Staircase in Malibu, the strange house where both the Process andManson used to hang out. Appearing with him in Ramrodder was Catherine “Gypsy”Share, another Manson Family member, who would be involved in a shootout withpolice after a failed attempt to rob a gun store. Their plan was to break intoprison, rescue Manson and head for the desert and freedom.Lucifer Rising—only twenty-nine minutes long—concerns the invocation of Luciferby Isis, Osiris, Lilith and of course the Magus. The characters play humanspossessed by these gods at the various sites of power in Egypt, Germany andEngland, and the scenes are intercut with various images Anger found compelling,such as a solar eclipse, fires, volcanoes, and a goat. The finale of the film isa shot of a flying saucer sailing over the Sphinx. A pink flying saucer.This identification of Lucifer with the God of Light—essentially the same as theEgyptian god Horus—is a familiar one, found in Theosophical writings as well asNazi ideology. Indeed, the name “Lucifer” is Latin for “Light-Bringer,” an echoof the belief that Lucifer was the brightest of all the angels and rebelledagainst God due to his sin of pride. Others have tried to show how Lucifer ismerely another manifestation of Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods to giveto humanity and was punished for his transgression. In a sense, then, Luciferand Prometheus are both personifications of an older myth, perhaps reminiscentof Adam in the Garden of Eden, who disobeys God in order to know both good andevil and then is also punished.Anger’s only other film to incorporate occult themes is his earlier production,Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954), with Anais Nin as Astarte. This is thefilm that boasts Marjorie Cameron—the widow of OTO’s self-appointed Antichrist,Jack Parsons—in a cameo role. Ms. Cameron remained involved in occult practiceslong after the death of her husband in 1952, and various works by British OTOleader Kenneth Grant mention her writings and activities since that time. WhileAnger was interested in invoking Lucifer, Parsons was dedicated to Babalon, theCrowleyan Goddess, and was sure she had been incarnated sometime in theimmediate Postwar era. As described in Book I, some of Parsons’ letters toMarjorie Cameron on a variety of occult themes have survived, and they provideinsightful, intelligent commentary on the entire movement.It would be Parsons and Cammell who would die violently, both consumed by theiresoteric visions; Beausoleil and Manson who would live on, but in prison, asmurderers; Pallenberg and Faithfull who would survive addiction and worse andcome out the other side. Jagger and Richards were never touched deeply enough bythe forces swirling around them to derail them from their careers. And KennethAnger is now in his seventies, contemplating a filmed version of Crowley’sGnostic Mass and a second sequel to Hollywood Babylon, the Magus safe in hisCalifornia home and surrounded by the ghosts of so many dead and dying gods.Was Manson a “programmed puppet”? Of course, that is the thesis of this book aswell as a throw-away line of Anger’s. My information, however, comes second-handfrom primary sources: from memoirs, police files, declassified governmentdocuments, and the like, seasoned with an extensive background in the esotericaof many countries. Anger was part of Manson’s circle, or perhaps we should sayManson was part of Anger’s. More importantly, Anger refers to the Tate killingsas a plane crash of the “Bad Ship Lolllipop” being piloted by “Uncle Sugar,” anickname for Uncle Sam or the United States government. What does Anger knowabout the Manson killings? What does he suspect?One wonders if he thinks back to the days of The Magick Powerhouse of Oz, BobbyBeausoleil’s band in California during the “Equinox of the Gods” ceremony at theStraight Theater on September 21, 1967? Or of the Himalayan Academy that hehelped to establish with Timothy Leary and, it is said, Abigail Folger, whowould die so violently and hideously at the hands of the Manson Family at thePolanski-Tate residence? Or of Altamont and “Sympathy for the Devil” in 1969 andyet another murder, this time of a black man by Hell’s Angels gang members? Orthe even more bizarre story circulated on the Internet that Kenneth Anger metMark David Chapman in Hawaii six weeks before the Lennon assassination in 1980;to accentuate the eeriness of the tale, it is insisted that Chapman gave Anger agift of some live bullets. It would account for Chapman showing up in New YorkCity with a gun but no ammunition.Regardless of the fact or fiction of the stories woven around Anger—many wovenon Anger’s own loom—it may be agreed that he has staying power. Whether he isstill the Magus, still ordering the universe to fit his peculiar Gnostic vision,remains for history to decide.QUEEN OF THE NIGHTAt one of the Polanskis’ wild, drug-fueled bashes at 10050 Cielo Drive in tonyBrentwood, the housekeeper could not get into the bathroom and began pounding onthe locked door.Eventually, the door opened and out came Jane, hair mussed and clothing askew,with another male guest.… “I hate it,” she said, “when something’s halffinished.” A guest recalled that the mysterious “other man” may have beenhandsome millionaire hairstylist Jay Sebring, who had been Sharon Tate’s loverbefore she met Polanski.13“You know you’re only allowed out on Halloween!”—Jane Fonda as “Night” in The Blue Bird, 1976One of Jane Fonda’s more bizarre cinematic appearances is as Night in the filmversion of Maurice Maeterlinck’s play, The Blue Bird. We discussed this workextensively in Book I, due to its compelling relevance to (and possibleinspiration for) the CIA mind-control program of the same name. Maeterlinck’splay was first performed in Russia, and was important to KonstantinStanislavski. It was only fitting, then, that a film version be made in Russiaonce again, this time starring Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Fonda, Ava Gardner, and ahost of other bright Hollywood lights and using a local Russian film crew. Byall accounts, the film was a disaster. George Cukor had never made a fantasyfilm before, being remembered more for classics such as Gaslight, and thislavish attempt seemed doomed to failure even before the rushes were in. Fondaspent six weeks filming in Moscow, only to find that the bulk of her performancewound up on the proverbial cutting-room floor.It is the fact that the film was made at all that interests us, for the onlyother time anyone had filmed The Blue Bird (in 1940), it had starred ShirleyTemple, who eventually wound up as the American Ambassador to Czechoslovakia.This time, the film was being made in the Soviet Union as a gesture of détente,and thus rife with political undertones. Fonda was known in Russia only barely,and primarily for the fact that she had visited Hanoi during the Vietnam War.Her husband, Tom Hayden, accompanied her for a while to Moscow, only to becomedisgusted at the bourgeois appetites of the Muscovites, who seemed moreinterested in blue jeans than politics. What is not discussed in any of thesources I have been able to locate is the extent to which American intelligenceused this first American–Soviet cinema co-production to advance their own agendain Russia. It seems like a heaven-sent opportunity to infiltrate an agent or twointo the entourage, using the production as a cover for more nefariousactivities, but, alas, there is no documentation to support such a contention.Yet, how The Blue Bird—the operational name for the CIA’s first mind-controleffort came to be associated with Russia and filmed in Moscow (the evil empire,after all, that had used mind control on Cardinal Mindszenty to force him tomake outrageous confessions before television cameras) is one of the“coincidences” in this study that hum beneath the threshold of our hearing. Onehas to ask why it was important to Cukor and his producers to make the film atall, and at considerable expense. It must have seemed an eccentric choice. As itwas filmed on location in early 1975 and released in 1976, seven years after theManson killings and the year of the U.S. bicentennial, I like to think that TheBlue Bird production was Jane Fonda’s wake-up call, literally. After all, asdetailed in Book I, she was likely present—along with husband-director RogerVadim—at the Polanski home on the day that a drug dealer was pistol-whipped infront of Polanski’s guests, only days before the actual murders of Sharon Tateand her friends. She studied Krishnamurti for a while, largely due to herbrother’s influence, but generally avoided occultism (according to one of herbiographers, Christoper Andersen14), even though it was very popular in hercircle and especially among the Polanski clique.The Blue Bird is about memory, and fear, and conspiracy, and ultimatelysalvation. It is about innocence, and about traveling far and wide, onlyeventually to find happiness at home. Like the Oz books—the stories by FrankBaum that inspired the name of Beausoleil’s band, The Magick Powerhouse ofOz—its message is faintly fascistic: “there’s no place like home.” To get tothis primeval state of bliss, one has to proceed through a nightmare of anxiety,mortal attacks, and terror. The children do this in The Blue Bird, just asDorothy does in The Wizard of Oz. (Strangely, and again according to MauryTerry’s informants, one of the cults connected to the Son of Sam operation wascalled “The Children.”) It is a spiritual voyage straight from the world’sshamanistic traditions, and at least in Maeterlinck’s case the analogy wasprobably deliberate.Maeterlinck wrote extensively on occult themes, as we have seen, and was abeliever in spiritualism and psychic phenomena in general. His influence overStanislavski was due at least as much to his spiritual worldview as it was hisNobel Prize in Literature. Maeterlinck was a man with a mission, a believer. TheBlue Bird—while seemingly a story for children—is, like most fairy tales, acoded message for adults, one the CIA took very much to heart, ransacking it fortechnique and theory while ignoring its higher meaning.While the Cukor film is worth mentioning simply because we have spent so muchtime with Maeterlinck and the play before—in the context of the CIA—Fonda’s rolein it is compelling for two reasons: one, she was obviously very close to thecircle around Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski and was even suspected of havinghad sex with Tate’s former lover, Jay Sebring, as well as of having been presentfor the unfortunate punishment of the drug dealer at the Polanski home:connections that lead us straight back to Charles Manson and the Family. But theother reason is perhaps even more bizarre. It involves her brother, Peter Fonda,and his marriage to Susan Brewer.Peter Fonda, of course, became a film idol with the release of Easy Rider(1969), another film that has become a cult classic. With co-stars Dennis Hopperand Jack Nicholson—“Indians!”—Peter made his indelible mark on Hollywood historyand personified a generation of young Americans during the time of the VietnamWar. (According to audio commentary on the DVD release by the film’s director,Dennis Hopper, the famous LSD scene towards the end of the movie was based onthe Gnostic Gospel of St. Thomas found at the Nag Hammadi library.) One JerryKay, the art director for the film, was—according to the first edition of EdSanders’ The Family—a member of the infamous Solar Lodge of the OTO, theThelemic organization that was involved in the “boy in the box” affair thatcaused Grady McMurtry to reactivate his OTO status and fly to California to wardoff the sudden interest of the FBI in the Order and deflect it towards the“unofficial” OTO lodge, a series of events that were put in motion during apolice raid on the Solar Lodge on July 26, 1969 to investigate charges of childabuse … the day before Bobby Beausoleil murdered Gary Hinman.15 There was alsocircumstantial evidence linking Charles Manson to the Solar Lodge, and muchstronger evidence showing his relationship with the Process. It is strange,then, in the context of our study, to discover that Peter Fonda—in New York Cityin October 1961—would marry the stepdaughter of Noah Dietrich.Noah Dietrich was probably the one man on earth who knew Howard Hughes insideand out. An employee, and CPA of the Hughes empire for thirty-two years after1925, he ran Hughes Tool and, according to former Hughes insider and CIACastro-assassination plotter Robert Maheu, delivered “net profits as high as $55million annually.”16 Dietrich was the steady, efficient businessman andfinancial genius behind the Hughes empire, but when Dietrich asked for the stockoptions he had been repeatedly promised by Hughes, Hughes fired him in May of1957. To be sure, this was also at the height of Hughes’ troubles with TWA.Hughes had wanted to buy more planes, and needed the support of the banks to doso. They refused to put more money into TWA, and it seemed that Dietrich alsorefused to cooperate with the scheme. No matter which way the story played out,by the end of 1957 Howard Hughes had retreated from public view, by his lightsabandoned by his friends and cheated by the courts and the government. It wasthe beginning of the great Hughes disappearing act.Dietrich eventually published his memoirs, Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes, butnot before it became something of a cause célèbre. A circulating manuscript ofthe book was supposedly used by Clifford Irving to forge the infamous Hughesmemoirs.Strange, then, that Peter Fonda would marry Dietrich’s stepdaughter four yearsafter the 1957 debacle with Howard Hughes. No, not evidence of any kind ofconspiracy, but the nexus of Hughes-Dietrich-Fonda is fascinating, because itconnects us—matrix-like—to Fonda-Polanski-Tate-Manson and, of course, The BlueBird, which is, after all, the “Manson Secret.” Remember also that Jack Parsonsworked for the Hughes Corporation for a while, and the strong links between theHughes Corporation and the CIA on the one hand (particularly with regard to theGlomar Explorer and the raising of a sunken Soviet submarine) and the Mormons onthe other, with tendrils that slither out and wrap around the Watergate officebuilding in 1972.Conspiracy theorists usually concentrate on political phenomena and criminalsuspects at the expense of other types of information, but if we extend oursearch to include Hollywood on the one side, and religion and even mysticism onthe other, we can come up with revealing angles to every political event thatare nowhere else considered. We have to dig down deeply in the evidence lockers,looking at the inventories of books, films, and documents from the crime scenes,ones that were rejected by the detectives and inspectors as irrelevant to thecases, if we want to understand the sinister forces that flow beneath thesurface of public events. No political event exists in a vacuum; no politicianis only a politician. The one-dimensional approach to history has hobbled us forso long that the history books in our schools have become little more thanfleshed-out chronologies. The very idea of “history” itself is suspect, now thatwe understand a little more about time, space, consciousness, psychologicalwarfare, and the quanta. It is my hope that this “deconstruction” of some ofHollywood’s famous (and not so famous) films will lend itself to a new approachto history, one that is as firmly based in culture, science and—what we call forwant of a better word—“religion,” as it is in politics.There were mysteries at the Polanski house, most of which have never beenrevealed publicly, and these mysteries are germane to the wilder of the MauryTerry and Ed Sanders satanic conspiracy theories. Terry Melcher, who had livedin the Polanski residence shortly before the Polanskis moved in, stated thatRoman Polanski had made unusual films there involving sadomasochism,pornography, etc.17 A friend of the Manson Family, Charlene Cafritz, claimed toown motion picture footage of the Manson clan that the police did not have andof which they were not aware.18 At the time of the trial, Cafritz was at St.Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington, D.C., the same hospital from which JamesForrestal plunged to his death, and where poet Ezra Pound was kept after theWar. It was where Dr. Winfred Overholser worked on truth serums for the OSS and,later, the CIA. Ms. Cafritz died soon thereafter, of an overdose of Nembutal,and was buried in the D.C. area without ever having revealed the location of thefamous Manson films.One of the strange twists of fate that link two otherwise unrelated events isthe person of Min S. Yee, a reporter who—with rock star John Phillips of TheMamas and The Papas, a close friend of Sharon Tate—visited a “voodooastrologer,” who told them that the night of August 8-9, 1969 had been a perfecttime for a sacrifice. Also, it seems a “voodoo adept” had threatened the life ofWojciech Frykowski, one of the Tate murder victims.19 This prompted Polanski andPhillips to fly to Jamaica to conduct their own investigation of Caribbeanvoodoo and some other, possibly drug-related, Jamaican links to the murders,apparently without success.This same Min Yee later collaborated with Dr. Thomas N. Layton on a book aboutthe Jonestown massacre and his family’s role in it: In My Father’s House (1981).It was Dennis Hopper who insisted to police after the killings at the Polanskiresidence that a lot of very strange activity took place there, and that some ofthe stranger episodes were actually filmed. Hopper was close to Jane Fonda andher circle: he attended her Las Vegas wedding to Roger Vadim with his wife andPeter and Susan Fonda, and of course co-wrote and co-starred with Peter Fonda inEasy Rider, released the same year as the Tate/La Bianca killings. He attendedthe raucous parties at the Polanski residence on Cielo Drive, and was in aposition to know what went on there. Jane Fonda has not gone into any detail asto what transpired among the Polanskis, and all we surmise about herparticipation in their weird scenes is second-hand.I don’t know how close Susan Brewer was to her stepfather, Noah Dietrich; butthe Tate/La Bianca killings took place in August 1969, and by November 1970Clifford Irving had been approached by the powerful people who wanted him towork on a special project, ostensibly involving Howard Hughes and the fraudulentbiography, a biography that would be based largely on Noah Dietrich’s memoirs.20This undertaking would be fraught with danger, since it involved parties “whowould stop at nothing to achieve their own ends—even murder.” 21Hughes hadofficially “disappeared” that same month, on November 25, 1970, an event thatwas recorded with some fanfare in Hank Greenspun’s Las Vegas Sun on December 2.The Manson trial was still in progress at that time, and would not be over untilJanuary 25, 1971, when the jury returned a verdict of “guilty” for all fourdefendants, returning on March 29, 1971, in the penalty phase of the trial, topronounce “death” for Manson and the convicted members of his Family.BELL, BOOK … AND CANDLE IN THE WINDI have the most wonderful memory for forgetting things.—Marilyn Monroe22Director Luis Bunuel was one of the clique of surrealist film directors aroundsuch leading lights as Jean Cocteau and Salvador Dali. One of his screenwriters(on the acclaimed La Cucaracha) was a young Mexican man of great good looks (ofthe “Latin leading man” type) known as Jose Bolanos. During the McCarthy Era,when so many Hollywood stars, writers, and directors were either beingblacklisted or blacklisting, Mexico became a safe haven for people like Bunueland Bolanos, particularly as both could speak Spanish, of course, and would findthemselves in a congenial environment. Mexico was friendly to socialists andsocialist governments, and the Cuban Government of Fidel Castro had an embassythere, as did the Soviets. Lee Harvey Oswald (or someone pretending to be LeeHarvey Oswald) would visit the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in 1963, just a fewmonths before the assassination of the late Marilyn Monroe’s putative lover,John F. Kennedy.By 1962, though, the year that concerns us in this section, Castro was in firmcontrol of his island nation and had “outed” himself as a Communist. It was badnews for the United States, and especially for those who had supported Castro ingood faith … including everyone from CIA agents to movie stars like Errol Flynn.The Mafia was faced with the sudden loss of their casinos in Havana, and theywere busy plotting revenge against “the Beard.” Khrushchev was beaming,godfather-like, down at this tropical paradise only ninety miles off the coastof his arch-enemy, the United States of America. What a good place to plant afew ICBMs, he thought.At this time, young writer Bolanos found himself in very good company, indeed.After an intense courtship involving flowers presented on a family heirloomsilver plate, numerous mariachi bands, drinking, dancing, and god knows whatelse, Bolanos had managed the dream date: screen legend and would-be socialistMarilyn Monroe.When we talk about politics and Hollywood, we cannot avoid the seeminglysurreal. Weirdness is the order of the day, and truth is always much, muchstranger than fiction. Lee Harvey Oswald was captured in a movie theater, as anexample. It was showing a Van Heflin film, Cry of Battle (1963), aboutinsurrection in the Philippines, which would have been interesting to Oswaldunder kinder circumstances, since he spent some time there as a US Marine.Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in a theater while watching a stage play, OurAmerican Cousin, shot in the back of the head by a famous actor and leading man,John Wilkes Booth. The movies gave us Ronald and Nancy Reagan—both Hollywoodactors—as President and First Lady.Yet, not many people know that Fidel Castro himself was once a film actor inHollywood. In the October 30, 1997 edition of Zenit, Uruguayan film criticAlvara Sanjurjo confirmed persistent rumors that Castro did, indeed, have afledgling start as an actor in two George Sidney productions, Bathing Beauty(1944) and Holiday in Mexico (1946). Sanjurjo is an intimate of Alfredo GuevaraValdes, the head of the Cuban Instituto Cinematografico de Cuba, who himself isa close friend of the Cuban leader, and should know. Even the current owner ofHoliday in Mexico, Turner Classic Movies (TCM), states, on its Web site,TCM.com:Pasternak and Sidney released their third film in Technicolor, the sizzlingHoliday in Mexico (1946). Starring Walter Pidgeon as the U.S. Ambassador,Holiday promised fun in the sun when his daughter (Jane Powell) falls for aLatin lover (Jose Iturbi). In addition to a bossa nova score, Holiday in Mexicofeatured a young Fidel Castro in a bit part—look close for the future dictator!Even such definitive biographies of the great Cuban dictator as that of TadSzulc do not include this bizarre stage in his development, yet the data isavailable. Castro made several trips to the United States before he became aguerrilla leader and eventual El Lider, one of which was for a honeymoon afterhis marriage on October 12, 1948 (yes, Columbus Day and Crowley’s birthday) toMirta Diaz-Balart, and, during another trip a year later, he stayed in a smallapartment at 155 West 82nd Street in New York City for a few months and hauntedMarxist bookstores, like so many other students and would-be revolutionaries ofthe author’s own acquaintance during the 1960s. Although these two trips arewell-documented, the appearance of Castro in two Hollywood films—both made byGeorge Sidney, who also directed Pal Joey (1957) and other Sinatra vehicles(oddly enough, considering that the Rat Pack, and particularly Sinatra, weremajor supporters of the Kennedy presidential campaign in 1960) goes virtuallyunnoted in biographies of Castro and histories of the Cuban conflict. (Sidneywould retire from Hollywood at the age of 49 and become a respectedpaleontologist!) Castro did himself make one sly reference to his earlier careerduring a visit to Princeton University in 1959, shortly after he marched throughHavana at the head of the victorious revolutionaries:In response to an implied accusation that his motives were less than altruistic,Castro reportedly rejoined with the following assertion: “I could be rich … Youknow how? By writing the history of our revolution for Hollywood.”This curious circumstance lends itself to all sorts of semiotic possibilities.Castro as young Hollywood extra in wartime California, between bouts of baitingthe politicos in Havana. Since it is now known for certain that Castro did,indeed, have a bit part in Bathing Beauty, one wonders why he returned toHollywood for Holiday in Mexico. Was he called back? Did he have an agent? Didhe go out of his way to show up for an audition? (Castro at a cattle call!) Didhe briefly toy with being an actor instead of a politician or, as has beensuggested, a professional baseball player?Regardless, Castro came to understand the power of Hollywood, and it should havecome as no surprise when movie stars and directors began showing up in Havana inthe late 1990s for heart-to-heart talks with Fidel.But was screenwriter Jose Bolanos a Fidelista? Or was Bolanos—the last knownlover of Marilyn Monroe—working for another organization altogether?In the months leading up to the death of Marilyn Monroe on August 4-5, 1962, theUnited States was engaged in a serious struggle with the Castro regime in Cuba.The Bay of Pigs invasion had failed disastrously on April 17, 1961; the worldwas only months away from the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. Throughoutthe spring of 1962 the operation that would become known as Mongoose consumedmore and more of the Kennedys’ time: Jack and Robert, the President and theAttorney General. Declassified State Department files show that meetings wereheld weekly and almost daily at the State Department and the CIA on the subjectof destabilizing the Castro regime by using everything from psychologicalwarfare to sabotage and assassination. The largest domestic CIA operation everwas mounted in Florida, with a recruitment of anti-Castro Cubans and fellowtravelers, including mysterious Mafiosi with exploding cigars, courtesy of theCIA’s Technical Services Division and the collaboration of Robert Maheu.Yet, at the same time, documents and published eyewitness interviews willconfirm that Ms. Monroe was seeing both of the Kennedy brothers romantically. Infact, there have been persistent rumors that Christine Keeler of the ProfumoAffair had seen Jack Kennedy in July of 1962 during a visit to the United Stateswith her friend, Mandy Rice-Davies. This would have been less than a monthbefore the death of Monroe, and during the lead-in to the Cuban Missile Crisisthat October. While there is no documentation to support that either Kennedyever actually met—much less romanced—either Ms. Keeler or Ms. Rice-Davies duringthat time, the mere possibility was giving American intelligence nightmares, asKeeler had been sleeping with both British War Minister John Profumo and thelocal Soviet GRU rezident at the time of the October crisis. This was magnifiedby what they did know concerning the Kennedys’ involvement with Marilyn Monroe,who, from about February 1962 on, became involved with a group of Communistsliving in exile in Mexico City.As recounted in several modern biographies of Monroe—notably by Anthony Summers,who also did a comprehensive job on the Kennedy assassination, and Donald E.Wolfe, whose research is based in part on Summers’ interviews—there was a hotbedof Communists, socialists, and assorted left-wingers in Mexico City in the early1960s, some of whom had been in self-imposed exile since the start of the HUACinvestigations, and many of whom had Hollywood connections. During this sameperiod, relations between the United States and Cuba had become dangerouslyheated, with the US secretly (and sometimes not so secretly) aiming raids,sabotage, and agent infiltration at Castro’s island, and attempting toassassinate the leader using a wide variety of toxins developed by the CIA andagents-in-place, all part of “Operation Mongoose.” Mexico City in those days waslike a western hemisphere Vienna: a place of fragile neutrality, teeming withspies, in which agents from the opposing camps—Soviet, Cuban, American—couldwatch each other come and go in the Zona Rosa. One of these was the famous“silver spoon Communist”: Frederick Vanderbilt Field.Coming from a wealthy background as a right-wing American, Field’s politicalfaith wavered, and then finally fell on the side of the left. Around him inMexico City was a gaggle of left-wingers who professed everything from diehardCommunism of the Soviet Communist International or “Comintern” model torevolutionary Castroism—liberal dilettantes who were excited to be this close toreal socialists and Communists and who, anyway, professed humanitarianprinciples ranging from racial integration to a change in American foreignpolicy in Latin America. In the midst of this cocktail circuit could bediscerned such influences as artist (and Communist) Diego Rivera—theaforementioned comrade of Trotsky and Andre Breton—as well as filmmaker LuisBunuel. As always, surrealism found itself in support of radical politicalsolutions, even as it decried “Soviet realism” in art. It was an eclectic groupof people from various backgrounds, and it is in this mélange that we findMarilyn Monroe in February of 1962.Introduced to Field via her psychiatrist, Ralph Greenson, and his homunculus,Eunice Murray, Monroe and Field became fast friends. (At the time of her death,Field was even staying at Monroe’s New York City apartment.) Indeed, Field’sMexican wife had been an artist’s model for Diego Rivera. Field offered instantentrée into leftist artistic circles, something that was noticeably missing (or,at best, underground) in Hollywood. Monroe was impressed by the strong emotionalfeelings she encountered among the exiles: a typical liberal fascination withtheir idealistic fervorinos against American hegemony, racial segregation, andpolitical hypocrisy in high places. Communist propaganda of the time appealed toa paranoid, conspiratorial view of politics, in which the rich oppressed thepoor, the whites oppressed the blacks, and the wealthy American oligarchy didwhat it could to extend that dynamic overseas, by oppressing poorer “thirdworld” nations. Racial segregation was an easy target, and demonstrated to theliberal elite that at least part of what the Communists were saying wasobviously true. Support was especially high in favor of Castro’s Cuba.Of course, the exiles were equally charmed by the presence in their midst ofsuch a famous and glamorous superstar as Marilyn Monroe. It was one thing tohobnob with the likes of Diego Rivera and Luis Bunuel, arch intellectuals andartists bathed in a kind of fashionable cynicism among a fawning expatriatecommunity of many nations; it was quite another to be seen in the company of theworld’s most famous woman, a person who was at the same time relatively naïveabout politics, yet open to new information and new points of view. She was alsoquite vulnerable, having gone through a series of famous (and not so famous)husbands, in an endless, desperate search for true love and emotionalfulfillment. Her ex-husband Arthur Miller, for instance, was known to besympathetic to the Left, and his famous play, The Crucible, is a thinlydisguised attack on the McCarthy hearings … as seen from the point of view ofthe witchcraft trials in Salem. As always, we keep coming back in a smaller andsmaller spiral linking politics, the occult, and culture. It is a volatileformula, and one that very possibly led to Marilyn’s death.She was also surrounded by Communists at home, even between husbands. Thispreponderance of closet Communists around Marilyn Monroe is a fact that deservesmuch more scrutiny than it has been given so far—except by Summers and Wolfe,aforementioned. Even her psychiatrist, Dr. Ralph Greenson, was a Communist, andwas approved by the Party as a politically-reliable shrink, a functionary of anorganization infiltrated to an extent by European émigrés who owed theirallegiance to both Freud and Marx. This organization, known as thePsychoanalytic Institutes, with offices in most major American cities, 23andwhich contained within its ranks members of various political affiliations,served as a secure means for Communist Party members to meet and exchangeinformation. Psychiatry, in general, was a wonderful mechanism for running“cells” in a foreign country. No one would question why a person had to meetsecretly with a psychoanalyst or psychiatrist; in fact, many psychiatrists’offices are designed to permit only one person at a time in the waiting area,and each patient leaves by a separate exit so that no patient need be seen byanother.This situation is perfect for debriefing agents, and for discovering theinner-most secrets of others, and may have been one of the reasons why theWater-gate Plumbers broke into the office of Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist, Dr.Lewis Fielding. As the man who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the press,Ellsberg’s motives seemed highly suspect, and Ellsberg himself was targeted as aCommunist. That suspicion might have extended to his psychiatrist, in a replayof what had been going on in the early 1960s. After all, Lewis Fielding was aclose friend of Marilyn Monroe’s analyst, Dr. Greenson, and the FBI maintained afile on Greenson, a file that is still classified to this day. The story of the“Communist-cell psychiatrists” is one that has not been told, and theimplications of the story are alarming. Much of this history is stillclassified, but what we do know has serious implications for the Marilyn Monroestory.For instance, Dr. Greenson was the leader of the Arts, Sciences, and ProfessionsCommittee (ASPC), which was a front organization for Communist infiltration ofthe media. Within the ASPC were a number of other organizations, including theDoctors Professional Group, and the People’s Educational Center, “which wasestablished and funded by Frederick Vanderbilt Field.”24 The founder of theASPC, Louis Budenz, was “a Communist Party leader and one time managing editorof the Daily Worker” (Wolfe, p. 474). Many of these men were openly Communist inthe immediate pre-War days, but went underground once the Senate and HUAChearings began. As Wolfe relates,One of Greenson’s contacts within the hierarchy of the Comintern was FrederickVanderbilt Field. As the director of the American Russian Institute, Field wasalso associated with Greenson’s mother, Katharine Greenschpoon, who was on theboard of directors, according to the Senate Fact Finding Committee onUn-American Activities in California bulletin of 1948.25And again,Field was closely monitored by the FBI in Mexico City, and … continued his linksto the United States through the Comintern leader in Los Angeles—Dr. RalphGreenson.26Field (and many others) had to flee to Mexico once Louis Budenz defected andbegan giving the Senate the names of other Communists in California as theMcCarthy investigations intensified. Gradually, Marilyn became aware that therewas something sinister about Greenson’s attentions (and those of his spy, EuniceMurray), and by July 1962 she was openly revolting against them. By then, ofcourse it was too late.Just as the CIA was in full throttle on MK-ULTRA, the Soviets were usingtraditional psychiatric and psychoanalytic settings in the United States toserve as Comintern fronts and, perhaps, to condition and control certain selectpatients. When we see the degree to which Monroe depended upon Greenson, andwhen we learn of Greenson’s bizarre “anti-analytic” approach with Monroe indirect violation of his own, published therapeutic principles, we can easilyunderstand how a charge could be made that Monroe was being deliberatelymanipulated by the Comintern.And when we learn that E. Howard Hunt—former CIA agent, formerly stationed inMexico City, one of the Watergate Plumbers himself, and present during thebreak-in at Fielding’s office—was a good friend of the last man to call himselfMarilyn Monroe’s lover, Jose Bolanos, we are forced to take a completelydifferent look at the events of 1962 and 1963.Bonafide Communist Frederick Field was highly suspicious of Bolanos, and warnedMonroe against seeing him. He believed that Bolanos had infiltrated into theleft-wing community in Mexico, an insincere Communist with a hidden agenda,“distrusted by the real left.”27 As revealed in Wolfe’s analysis of the death ofMarilyn Monroe, Bolanos and E. Howard Hunt were friends.28 Hunt traveledfrequently to Mexico City—either in official or unofficial capacity (he wasstill with the CIA at the time, although David Atlee Phillips was CIA stationchief in Mexico City during this period)—and the two would occasionally meet.Hunt, a writer, considered himself a kind of Ian Fleming, but was actually quitea bit more like the Cigarette Smoking Man, the X-Files character based on Hunt.He was also interested in Latin occult practices (as evidenced in his novel TheCoven), so it is possible that his interest in Mexico City and the Zona Rosa wasmore of a literary one, slumming with the glamorous expats.But I don’t think so.I believe that Bolanos was Hunt’s man in the Zona Rosa, and once it became knownthat Marilyn Monroe was hanging out there—at the suggestion, no less, of herCommunist Party-approved psychiatrist, Greenson—alarm bells should have gone offat Langley. Unknown to Monroe, Frederick Field knew her housekeeper, EuniceMurray, quite well, and Murray was the conduit to both Field and Greenson. Herhusband, John Murray, had been a labor organizer in Hollywood in the 1940s and adedicated Communist Party member. When the Murray family underwent a reversal offortune after the War, John Murray sold his home (the site of many Partymeetings) to Dr. Greenson, a man he knew from Communist cell gatherings inHollywood. (It was to this house that Marilyn Monroe would go for herpsychiatric meetings with Dr. Greenson.) It was Dr. Greenson, in fact, whoordered his patient to fire her loyal friend and masseur, Ralph Roberts, andreplace him with the sinister Ms. Eunice Murray, without telling Ms. Monroe thatMurray was a psychiatric nurse, and a Communist at that.29The FBI had surveillance on Peter Lawford as well as Marilyn Monroe—according toits own documents—which in some instances refer to a mysterious confidentialinformant, who (on the basis of internal evidence) can only be Bolanos. At thesame time, the CIA was of course also surveilling Field as a suspected Sovietagent, and CIA Counterintelligence Chief James Angleton confirmed that Marilyn’shome was bugged.30So, as you can see, Marilyn never had a chance.In 1962, Operation Mongoose was in full swing, as the US government ramped up todestabilize Cuba and assassinate Castro. The missiles were starting to arrive inCuba, smaller tactical missiles at first and then the ICBMs. By late 1961,incoming CIA Station Chief in Mexico, David Atlee Phillips, already knew thefirst of the missiles were there. By July 1962 everyone at Langley knew. Huntwas still the CIA liaison with the Cuban exiles, trying to keep up their spiritsafter the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. And here was Marilyn Monroe, drinkingmezcal with the Reds and—who knows?—maybe eating the worm. She was alreadyfriendly with Robert Kennedy, and had been asking him a great many leadingpolitical questions, questions provided to her by a suspiciously helpful Dr.Greenson. She would then report on these meetings, in all innocence, in the ZonaRosa to Comintern member Frederick Field, to E. Howard Hunt intimate JoseBolanos, and from there to …?In addition, Robert Kennedy would be informed sometime in 1962 that the CIAunder General Lansdale (whom we encountered in Book I in his incarnation as apsychological warfare expert) was subcontracting the Castro assassination to theMafia, using the ever-helpful Robert Maheu as cutout. Ms. Monroe’s friendshipwith Mafiosi Johnny Roselli and Sam Giancana—themselves deeply involved in thesesame clandestine arrangements and directly involved with both Richard Nixon andE. Howard Hunt—went back a ways as well, dating from the beginning of herSinatra period, and this just wove the noose around her neck a little tighter.All around her were some of the seminal figures in the history of modernAmerican covert operations and the Cold War. And, it was suspected, she waswriting it all down in her ever-present red-bound diary.Marilyn Monroe had direct access to the President of the United States and theAttorney General of the United States on the one hand, and to the CommunistParty on the other, not to mention the Mafia on still another appendage of whatmurdered investigative journalist Danny Casolaro would call “the Octopus.” Thatmade her the Christine Keeler of America. But while Ms. Keeler’s interests inJohn Profumo and Yevgeny Ivanov were purely materialistic, Ms. Monroe’s interestin the Kennedy brothers, and particularly in Bobby Kennedy, was purely romantic.As far as we can discern from witness interviews at the time, Marilyn Monroe wasdespondent over her relationship with the Attorney General, whom she believedwould leave his wife and children in order to marry her. They had argued about anumber of political issues, however, including nuclear testing and Cuba as itturns out, with Bobby Kennedy eventually accusing her of turning Communist onthe basis of her leftist views.31So, who wanted Marilyn dead? As in the case of the John F. Kennedy assassinationa year later, the list of suspects is a long one. At one time, her home wasbeing bugged and her phones tapped by the FBI as well as by an “independentinvestigator,” whose employer might have been either the Mob or the CIA. She wasunder surveillance by them all. Her association with both the Kennedys and withthe Comintern made her a dangerous woman; had the CIA succeeded in assassinatingCastro, it is entirely possible that Ms. Monroe would have gone public with whatshe knew. She was already feeding information to the Mexico City Communists, aswell as to Jose Bolanos who, we suspect, was working for E. Howard Hunt. She wasa liability to the Kennedys, to the FBI, and to the CIA—specifically, toOperation Mongoose; and, to the extent that she could jeopardize OperationMongoose, she was a liability to the Mafia. The only people who did not wantMarilyn Monroe dead would have been the Communists themselves, since she was soclose to the President, the Attorney General, Sam Giancana, Johnny Roselli,“Operation Mongoose,” etc., etc. It would have been insane to kill the goosethat was laying golden eggs.However, by July of 1962 and only weeks before her death, she had realized thatsomething wasn’t right with Greenson and Murray. She told her ex-husband RobertSlatzer that she was going to fire them all. Was a decision made to silence herbefore she could reveal the existence of this clandestine Communist cell inHollywood and Mexico City?Robert F. Kennedy arrived with his family in Los Angeles on August 3, 1962.There is a great deal of speculation—supported by some fragile circumstantialevidence and the testimony of eyewitnesses—that Kennedy visited Marilyn Monroesometime between August 3 and August 5, the day of her death. The existence ofher diary was well-known, and she had made it understood that she hadpotentially explosive information. Was a decision made to murder Marilyn Monroewhen it was known Bobby Kennedy was in town, as an attempt to embarrass orpossibly ruin the Attorney General, the one man Jimmy Hoffa and otherunion-mafiosi hated the most?Some authors support the Mafia-Killed-Marilyn theory; others theKennedys-killed-Marilyn theory; still others the FBI/CIA-killed-Marilyn theory.That she was murdered and did not commit suicide seems, at this point, a safeinference, based on forensic evidence and crime scene photographs, as well asconflicting witness testimony. Whatever the truth may be, one thing is forcertain: her diary was never found, even though it was the target of a search byJames Jesus Angleton, the CIA’s Chief of Counterintelligence, the manresponsible for hunting the famed Soviet “mole” within American intelligence.Angleton would become enmeshed in another hunt for the diary of a Presidentiallover, this time in 1964 with the death of Mary Pinchot Meyer, as described inBook I.Monroe’s diary, however, was without a doubt political nitroglycerine. Referredto as her “book of secrets,” it contained information on everything from theMafia, Hoffa, and the Bay of Pigs to the CIA assassination plots against Castro,all culled from conversations with Jack and Bobby Kennedy.32 Monroe kept all ofthis written down because, as revealed in her conversations with her ex-husbandRobert Slatzer only weeks before her death, Bobby Kennedy would get mad at herfor not remembering “anything he told me” concerning political issues. 33Duringthis conversation with Slatzer, in which she allowed him to browse through her“book of secrets” and “handwritten notes from Bobby Kennedy—some of them onJustice Department stationery,” 34she spoke of the possibility of holding apress conference in the event that either the President or the Attorney Generalrefused to speak with her. Convinced that her phones were tapped (they were),she met Slatzer outdoors where they could speak in private. 35This was in lateJuly 1962.The weekend of July 28-29 probably holds a key to what transpired only dayslater. Ms. Monroe spent the weekend at the Cal-Neva Lodge in Lake Tahoe, and themystery that surrounds this weekend is impenetrable. That something loathsomedid take place, and that it involved Marilyn Monroe who was only now making animportant comeback, is certain, if only because of the reticence of eyewitnessesto discuss it.Wolfe makes a good case that she was invited to the Cal-Neva Lodge—Sinatra’sunofficial headquarters—in order to be pressured into not going to the presswith what she knew about the Kennedys and that those present on that weekendwere Sinatra, Peter and Pat Lawford, her friend Gloria Romanoff … and SamGiancana. It was Giancana’s presence there that weekend that wound up costingSinatra his gaming license, so we know that much is true. What has been revealedsince then by eyewitnesses who did come forward is almost too much to believe, ahorror that goes beyond anything we might comfortably imagine.Her ex-husband, Joe DiMaggio—icon of American baseball and one of the men whotruly loved Marilyn—arrived unexpectedly at the scene. No one knows how he knewhis ex-wife would be there, but he showed up and was not allowed inside thecomplex of bungalows that had been reserved for Monroe, Sinatra, and Giancana,on orders from Sinatra. Instead, he had to take a room at a nearby motel.Marilyn Monroe herself was not actually registered at the Cal-Neva, a precautionthat now seems much more sinister in retrospect; instead, she was put into thebungalow complex and kept watch over the entire time.When DiMaggio returned from Lake Tahoe, he told his friend Harry Hall that hewas furious with what had happened, that Sinatra had kept Monroe on drugs, andthat they had “sex parties.”36 To clarify what was meant by that, photographerBilly Woodfield was quoted as saying that Sinatra gave him a roll of film fromthat weekend. When Woodfield developed the roll, he evidently found photos ofMarilyn being sexually abused by, or at least in the presence of, Sam Giancanaand Frank Sinatra.37In other words, Marilyn Monroe was likely drugged, raped, and photographed; thephotos would be used as blackmail against her if she decided to come forwardwith what she knew about the Kennedys, the Mafia, and Castro.A drugged Monroe was returned to Los Angeles late the night of July 29-30, inthe company of Peter Lawford. Monroe was returned to her home in a limo, butLawford rode with the flight crew to his beach home. Before arriving home, heasked the crew to stop for a moment so he could make a call from a pay phone(knowing his own home was bugged and his phones tapped). He made a mysteriousphone call that lasted about twenty minutes before finally going home in theearly hours of that morning.That phone call was logged into the White House, a call that went directly tothe President.Marilyn’s last days were a turmoil of political intrigue. It seems the blackmaileffort was not panning out the way everyone thought it would. She wasthreatening to go public with what she knew; she was also on the verge of firingDr. Greenson and Eunice Murray who, she finally realized, was sent to spy on herby Greenson.38 She had made an appointment to see her attorney, Mickey Rudin,the following Monday in order to change her will. Mickey Rudin was Dr.Greenson’s brother-in-law, and Frank Sinatra’s attorney as well, so the circlegrows increasingly smaller … and tighter. She had already “fired” her friendPaula Strasberg, of the Actor’s Studio Strasbergs. Her efforts at learning theMethod had worked well, according to Lee Strasberg, and she was becoming aserious, accomplished actress, and not merely someone to be cast in comedy rolesor fluff pieces. But the influence of the Strasbergs had proved pernicious;while they had managed to avoid the worst of the HUAC excesses, they were stillconsidered “Reds” and the Method was, after all, a psychological conditioningprocess, what A.O. Scott of the New York Times has recently called “a mode ofpsychological melodrama, a means by which the obscure, private noise of the soulis transformed into speech and gesture.”39 Add to this sex, drugs, and politics,and you have a volatile mixture, an initiatory explosion in the making.According to Anthony Summers, Monroe had built up“a considerable library.Marilyn had a lifetime interest in the occult, and she often visited astrologersand psychics.”40This tantalizing bit of information is left there. As in so many biographies ofthe famous, the celebrated, the influential—such as in biographies of Hitler,for instance—a fascination with the occult is mentioned, briefly, and thenglossed over. No one seems willing to offer more than a few words on thesubject, even as they dissect every other aspect of the person’s private,personal life. Her longtime friend and one-time husband, Bob Slatzer, devotes ashort chapter in his biography of Marilyn to her interest in the occult,41 andeven reproduces an astrological chart cast for her by Laetitia “Tish” Leroy.42But between her interest in the occult on one side, and her early involvementwith leftists and others who came afoul of the Senate and Congressionalcommittees on the other, she was already peering behind the veil of Americanpolitics and American reality.Marilyn Monroe had already penetrated the mysteries of the KennedyAdministration: she, herself, had become one of those mysteries. She was beinggroomed and trained—via the Method and via psychiatry—by a cabal of Communistswith a hidden agenda, such as Dr. Greenson, who told her what friends to have,what film roles to take, and who generally abused the oath of a physician bydoing everything contrary to established psychiatric procedure when it came tothe screen goddess. (As if to underscore the connection, her code name whencalling the President was “Miss Green.”43)She was their initiate, sent into the opposing camp; they had made thisvulnerable, talented woman a Discordia, Goddess of Confusion and Disharmony, theunwitting spy of a Soviet cabal. But she was turning on everyone: Mafia,Kennedys, Communists alike, in a desperate attempt to hold herself together, tointegrate her personality and become the strong, even happy, woman she knewherself capable of being.She had become that dangerous entity, the student who has surpassed the need fora master. On August 4, 1962—at the age of only thirty-six—she died. The crimescene was a mess; forensics were a joke. It was the proverbial “locked room”mystery, in which the victim was murdered in a room that was locked from theinside. She was said to have overdosed on sleeping pills … but none were foundin her digestive tract. There was no glass of water in that locked room toenable her to swallow what were estimated to be nearly 50 capsules. And nohypodermic syringe. Her psychiatrist Dr. Greenson and her physician Dr.Engelberg (who were, after all, close friends) waited hours before calling thepolice. It was Engelberg who prescribed the Nembutal that was said to haveresulted in her death. It was Engelberg who gave her mysterious injections theweek she died.Shortly thereafter, other women began dying. Mary Pinchot Meyer was murdered ona street outside her home in 1964. This was the ex-wife of an important CIAofficial, who was also a lover of President Kennedy and the woman who turned himon to drugs, courtesy of Dr. Timothy Leary; she was the woman who called Learyshortly after the assassination, possessed of guilty secrets.On November 8, 1965, columnist and reporter Dorothy Kilgallen died undermysterious circumstances, soon after she had visited Jack Ruby in prison inDallas. She was conducting her own investigation of the Kennedy assassination,and had been in possession—through her lover, Ron Pataki—of some secretinformation concerning Marilyn Monroe, with whom she had also been friendly.44Her notes of the interview with Jack Ruby disappeared after her death. Patakihad seen them, however, but refuses to discuss their contents, so once again weare cheated of knowing the truth about America, the truth about our history, bypeople who arrogate to themselves the title of well-intentioned guardians of ourmemory.But it was not only the women who died.After Marilyn Monroe’s death in August 1962 came the Cuban Missile Crisis inOctober, the Profumo Affair the following year with the suicide of Dr. StephenWard, and the Kennedy assassination in November 1963. Ironically, the JohnFrankenheimer film starring Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury, The ManchurianCandidate, was released in 1962, the year Marilyn was murdered, and pulled fromdistribution after the assassination of the President in 1963.And then Bobby, a man racked with guilt over the death of his brother, if notalso for the murder of Marilyn Monroe, who decides to make a run for thepresidency and try to make America a better place, to end the war in Vietnam, toensure racial integration and equality, is gunned down on the day of hisCalifornia victory in June 1968.Darkly, like the wings of a deeper conspiracy, flickered the faces of RomanPolanski and Sharon Tate at the Frankenheimer dinner table for Bobby Kennedy’sLast Supper that night. The following year, almost on the anniversary of MarilynMonroe’s death and in the same town, Sharon Tate herself would be horriblybutchered, and the man accused of masterminding that crime would be held in thesame jail cell that had been especially designed for Bobby Kennedy’s putativekiller, Sirhan Sirhan.Another man, perhaps satisfied with the death of the screen legend, would go onto greater glory: E. Howard Hunt. The Watergate affair would dredge up all kindsof ugly secrets, prompting Richard Nixon to famously worry about exposing “thewhole Bay of Pigs thing.” Hunt and Jose Bolanos. Hunt and the break-in at Dr.Lewis Fielding’s office: the close friend of Marilyn’s Comintern analyst, Dr.Ralph Greenson. Hunt as “action officer” on the Bay of Pigs invasion. Hunt asCIA icon to the anti-Castro Cubans in Miami. Hunt as mastermind of the Watergatebreak-in. And Bolanos as FBI informant and CIA informant? The middle man betweenMarilyn Monroe and E. Howard Hunt? Bolanos as screenwriter to surrealist Bunuel,hovering around the edges of the Mexican surrealist community that includedBunuel, Dali, Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, meanwhile spying on them for theCompany. La Cucaracha, indeed.It’s possible that the men who killed Marilyn were concerned about nationalsecurity; it’s possible that they were protecting American secrets from leakingto the press, or to the Soviet Union. It’s possible they told themselves, thesegrey-souled men of the CIA, the FBI, the Mob, the anti-Castro Cubans, theSinatras, the Giancanas, the Hunts, that Marilyn Monroe was just a weak-willed,inconvenient woman who was in the way, a dumb broad with a big mouth, a slut whoslept her way to stardom, a woman scorned, a mistress dumped.I submit—after my own, twenty-five-year-long investigation into Americanpolitics and American culture—that all these men taken together, all these Huntsand Sinatras and Giancanas and Bolanos, and Greenson and Murray and all therest, were not worth one Marilyn Monroe, whatever the official or unofficialreason for her execution.I found out something I never knew. I found out that my world was not the realworld.—Robert F. Kennedy, shortly before he was assassinated45ME AND THE DEVIL (BLUES)I do enjoy the Beatles however; their music has a definite beat and in many waystheir music is good music.—Rudolf Hess46Me and the DevilWas walking side by side …—Robert Johnson, “Me and the Devil Blues”Although every form of music has had its satanic influences—and music probablyits origins as drum beats and chants in primeval rituals performed in the samedarkened caves where the first art was painted and the first theater enacted—inthe present era we can trace the fusion of music and madness to the bluescomposer and guitarist, Robert Johnson.Johnson (1911-1938) began playing the juke joints and roadhouses of Mississippiduring the Depression in the early 1930s, after a tragic life in which hissixteen-year-old wife and newborn baby both died in childbirth, an event thatcame in the wake of Johnson’s own illegitimate birth, his childhood at a varietyof homes and under a variety of names, but always to the soulful sound of theMississippi Delta blues. He was murdered—poisoned with strychnine—by a jealoushusband on August 16, 1938 at the age of 27, but not before he had recorded somefamous and influential tracks, like “Terraplane,” “Hellhound on my Trail,” and“Little Queen of Spades.”But it was the dark, and darkly sardonic, anthems that reached the souls ofmodern rockers and opened their eyes to the sinister that is an inextricableelement of all music, but especially of any music that pretends to speakdirectly to the soul. Readers may wonder at my identification of the “sinister”with music, but “sinister” is a word with many meanings and implications. It canrepresent the sense of awe we feel at the approach of a divine mystery as muchas it can mean an unsettling feeling in the presence of the demonic. The word“sinister” refers, after all, to things of the “left hand,” and the left side ofthe body is controlled by the right side of the brain. It is fascinating tolearn that the Italians speak of the paranormal, and conspiracy theories ingeneral, as dietrologia, or the “science of the left hand side.”To Jungian analyst Adolf Guggenbuehl-Craig—author of the aptly-titled From theWrong Side: A Paradoxical Approach to Psychology—the sinister has celestialassociations:The sinister is always the unintelligible, the impressive, the numinous.Wherever something divine appears, we begin to experience fear.47And further:I assume that an encounter with God or with the transcendent, per se, can onlythen occur when we experience the violent side of God, creation and mankind aswell. We meet God and the world just as much in the horrific as in the beautifuland sublime.48Many music critics might agree that the sinister and the sublime meet in theworks of Robert Johnson. Only twenty-nine Johnson titles still exist on vinyl,and they were compiled into Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings on theColumbia label in 1990. These recordings were all made in Texas, some in Dallas,from November 23—27, 1936, and their influence has been enormous.In fact, Eric Clapton—in an essay on Johnson published in the liner notes toJohnson’s complete recordings—states,Up until the time I was 25, if you didn’t know who Robert Johnson was, Iwouldn’t talk to you. It was almost like that. It was as if I had been preparedto receive Robert Johnson, almost like a religious experience … Even then Iwasn’t quite ready. (emphasis in original)In another essay in the liner notes, Keith Richards of the Rolling Stonesrelates how he heard Johnson for the first time at the home of Brian Jones:To me, Robert Johnson’s influence—he was like a comet or a meteor that camealong and, BOOM, suddenly he raised the ante, suddenly you had to aim that muchhigher.And, of course, he did. From “Me and the Devil Blues” by Johnson to “Sympathyfor the Devil” by Jagger and Richards, there is a continuum of fascination withevil, and the use of music to evoke those sinister forces that has so frightenedFundamentalist Christians and the Christian Right in general. Rock ’n’ roll asearly as Elvis Presley was considered satanic, inspired by the Devil himself toinstigate revolution against authority, sexual liberation, and “dirty dancing.”Johnson threw down the gauntlet with his songs about women, violence, anddespair as a master of Delta Blues, and the gauntlet was picked up and passedaround by generations of serious musicians to follow.While we can see the “satanic” influence of Johnson over the Rolling Stones— theStones certainly had their share of occult influences and connections, fromAnger and Cammell to Pallenberg and Faithfull—occultism was never very far fromthe other icons of ’60s rock. While the Beach Boys were hobnobbing with CharlieManson, who himself was reading arcane messages into Beatles lyrics, and JimmyPage of Led Zeppelin was starring in and scoring Anger films and living atCrowley’s Boleskine estate in Scotland, Jim Morrison of The Doors was marrying awitch.The marriage was a pagan version of the same, known as a “handfasting” in Wiccancircles, and thus had no legal standing, which has led to some animosity amongMorrison’s girlfriends and fiancées. To understand where this is going, we haveto rely upon reminiscences by the witch in question, one Patricia Kennealy orPatricia Kennealy-Morrison as she prefers to be known. Writing in herautobiography, Strange Days, she describes a great deal about her paganexperiences and philosophy, and she gave an abridged version of same tointerviewers from a pagan publication, Pagan Muse and World Report, in theirFall 1996 edition and since reprinted on Ms. Kennealy’s own Web site. Thismarriage of rock-icon Morrison to Kennealy was covered briefly in Oliver Stone’sfilm about the group, The Doors, which does emphasize a mystical quality of TheDoors and of Morrison himself.Morrison died tragically in a bathtub in a Paris apartment of a friend in 1971,only a year after he and Kennealy were handfasted in a pagan ceremony. At thetime, Kennealy was a member of a coven of Celtic witches she had joined in 1966(the same year as the formation of the Church of Satan), becoming high priestessin 1969, the same year she met Morrison. She had been working for a rock musicmagazine, which is how she came to meet him. She was “married” to Jim Morrisonon Midsummer’s Day, 1970, before the members of her coven. He would die in Julyof 1971, a little over a year after the handfasting, and under mysteriouscircumstances. The French forensics—as in the case of LAPD’s investigation ofthe death of Marilyn Monroe—were a farce; no one really knows how Morrison diedor who might have been responsible. What is known is that there was a quantityof drugs in the apartment where he died, and that he had snorted heroin andprobably overdosed in the bathtub, according to Pamela Susan Courson who wassnorting heroin with him at the time. Ms. Courson, with whom Morrison wasstaying, had his body wrapped in plastic and packed in dry ice, and she sleptnext to his body for three nights until someone sent over a coffin. Ms. Coursonhad a lover, a French count, whom she shared with Marianne Faithfull, who wasalso in Paris that week. Courson told the count that it was a heroin overdosethat killed Morrison, warning him because they all—Pamela Courson, the count,Morrison, and Faithfull—had scored off the same dealer. The count returned fromCourson’s apartment, told Faithfull what had happened, and the two of them—countand witch—left immediately for Morocco to avoid being interrogated by the Frenchpolice.Morrison was quickly buried in a cheap coffin during a funeral ceremony thatlasted all of eight minutes and with only a handful of mourners. Eventually, hisgravesite would be placed under tight security, replete with motion sensors andCCTV cameras, due to the incidents of attempted grave robbing by hysterical fansand venal ghouls. It is now one of the most famous tourist attractions in Paris.After his death, Ms. Kennealy avoided the coven for several years in her grief,eventually becoming involved with Margot Adler’s Pagan Way celebrations in NewYork City and from there joining a Welsh Traditionalist coven until it fellapart shortly thereafter (in or about 1977). (Dr. Adler is the author of DrawingDown The Moon, a study of modern American paganism, and adescendant of famous psychoanalyst Alfred Adler.) According to Ms. Kennealy, JimMorrison had fully intended to be initiated into witchcraft upon his return fromParis, but fate had other ideas.Morrison took the name of his group from Aldous Huxley’s The Doors ofPerception. More than any other rock band of the era, The Doors were famous formystical lyrics and haunting, dreamlike melodies. There is no doubt thatMorrison was fascinated with alternate forms of spirituality, expressed ineerie, stream-of-consciousness verse and alchemical allusions. Kennealy who,after all, began her career as a rock critic, describes Morrison as a shaman andThe Doors concerts as rituals:The audiences were actually participants in Doors concerts, not just spectators.Those shows were mystical occasions. It sounds like so much hooey now, but youreally had to be there, ’cause they absolutely were.… It was all absolutelythere for you to grab onto. Because Jim made sure it was there for you to grab.Because he put it there. He really did see it like that, and he consciouslytried to make it happen.… He saw it as actively functioning as a living linkbetween people and the creative power … where you represent the people beforethe gods and the gods before the people.49Ms. Kennealy herself later went on to become the successful fantasy and sciencefiction author of a series of books known as the Keltiad, and was knighted inthe Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani (the Sovereign Military Orderof the Temple of Jerusalem) in September 1990 at Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland,sponsored by fantasy authors Katherine Kurtz and Scott MacMillan. Rosslyn Chapelis a mecca for New Agers interested in the Templar tradition, as it has beenmentioned in books supporting the theory that some Templars escaped to Scotlandafter the disbanding of their Order by the Pope and the King of France in thefourteenth century. The Chapel itself is at least as strange in itsarchitectural details as that other infamous and possibly Templar edifice, AbbeSauniere’s strange church at Rennes-le-Chateau in the Pyrenees, also a must-seeon any serious New Age tour. The Order into which she was knighted is arepository of some of these legends and mysteries surrounding the originalTemplars. Ms. Kennealy, through her initiation into a Celtic coven, then a WelshTraditionalist coven, and then a Templar Order, manages to represent for us thepagan, Crowleyan and Masonic strains of modern western occultism. WelshTraditionalist witchcraft is a form of Gardnerian “Wicca” and, as such, is heirto the Crowleyan tradition. The Sovereign Military Order of the Temple ofJerusalem is, by intention, a resurrection of certain Templar ideas andprinciples which predate Crowley, and the OTO to which he belonged, and whichcontributed to the creation and survival of the phenomenon of Freemasonry. Allof this, and a handfasting to Jim Morrison of The Doors.At the time that Ms. Kennealy was working with Margot Adler and a WelshTraditionalist coven in New York City, the Son of Sam murders were in fullswing. The witches of Ms. Kennealy’s acquaintance were customers of thatvenerable institution, the Warlock Shop/Magickal Childe Bookstore in both itsBrooklyn Heights and then West 19th Street, Manhattan incarnations. HermanSlater’s remarkable store was a meeting place for witches of all persuasions, aswell as for Satanists, Thelemites, the odd alchemist, Scientologists, andmembers of the Process. Members of the Son of Sam cult also visited the store onoccasion, and several of the young women mentioned in Maury Terry’s book on theSam case—The Ultimate Evil—were known to frequent the shop. One day, perhaps,its story will be told in detail. While Terry’s book has been ridiculed on paganand occult Web sites (and often for good reason), much of his data is known tobe accurate, even if his conclusions are occasionally off-the-mark oroff-the-wall. We will return to this story in the following chapter, but for nowlet us conclude our study of sinister forces in Hollywood with a look at thebackground of the Son of Sam cult, as seen through the life and times of one ofHollywood’s most famous producers.Along the way we will look at the film that put serial killer Jeffrey Dahmerinto a murderous trance, and discover a director whose work could only be calledinitiatory in the strictest sense of the term.BAD TRANSFORMERSI learned that just beneath the surface there’s another world, and stilldifferent worlds as you dig deeper.—David Lynch50A recurring feature of David Lynch films is the flickering electric light,result—as we are told in the pilot episode of his television series, TwinPeaks—of a “bad transformer.” This flickering electric light will appear againin such Lynch films as Mulholland Drive, to announce the appearance of theCowboy: a bizarre character who speaks in gnomic riddles, like a cross betweenGary Cooper and David Carradine. In Twin Peaks it is the light in the morgueover the place where the body of Laura Palmer had been kept, and which is thenvisited by Mike, the one-armed man, who recites the famous poem:Through the darkness of futures pastThe magician longs to see;One chants out between two worlds“Fire, walk with me.”There, in a strange little verse, we have the key to unlocking the mystery notonly of Twin Peaks but of virtually all of Lynch’s films: the suspension ofnormal laws of time (“futures past”) and the idea that the magician lives“between two worlds.” The suspension of a normal, linear narrative event infavor of a dreamlike, hallucinatory set of images that are taking place all overthe fourth dimension is part of Lynch’s appeal as a director, and part of whatmakes his films so frustrating to the average filmgoer. His realization thatthere are two worlds, and a place to stand between them, is what contributes tohis aura as a modern, twenty-first century initiate of the Mysteries, for thatis what his “mystery” films are: elucidations of the core Mystery behindreality.We all find this book of riddles and it’s just what’s going on. And you canfigure them out. The problem is, you figure them out inside yourself, and evenif you told somebody, they wouldn’t believe you or understand it in the same wayyou do. You’d suddenly realize that the communication wasn’t 100 per cent. Thereare a lot of things like that going on in life, and words just fail you.51And one of the keys to the mysteries—in fact, their raison d’etre—is the veryidea of transformation, and of the sinister implications of a “bad transformer.”In the same pilot episode of Twin Peaks where this throwaway line is used, theconversation is between the one-armed man, Mike (who knows where the serialkiller, Bob, is hiding), and FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper. As we discovertowards the very end of the very last episode of Twin Peaks, it is Cooperhimself who becomes a “bad transformer” and who winds up in the “place betweenthe worlds,” the dreaded Lodge. Transformation is a central theme of Lynch’sfilms, as characters change identities and places in the space-time continuumwith astonishing regularity; and it is closer to an initiated understanding ofhow reality works than a standard linear narrative could ever be. In Lynchfilms, there is no such thing as coincidence. The universe is not that lazy,events not that meaningless. Behind every event there lurks a world ofinformation, of relevance, of mysterious connections that link one seeminglyinnocuous image with another. Telephones, lampshades, ashtrays, coffee cups,dripping water, the wind in the trees … everything becomes fraught withsinister, cosmic significance.One could devote volumes to describing and “decoding” the astrological,alchemical, historical, and political references in Lynch’s work, especially inTwin Peaks, which is the closest thing we have in modern America to the ChymicalWedding of Christian Rosenkreutz. Some professors of religion—such as MirceaEliade’s brilliant Romanian protégé Ioan Culianu—did just that, in Culianu’scase holding weekly student seminars on the subject, until his murder in arestroom of the University of Chicago.It is the idea of transformation that concerns us most at the moment. It was,after all, the principle goal of alchemy to be able to effect transformations,whether of lead into gold or of base humanity into a heightened spiritual state.Jung’s interpretation of alchemy tended towards the psychological, of course,and for him the idea of transformation was emblematic of spiritual andpsychological growth. His famous forward to a translation of a Chinesealchemical text—The Secret of the Golden Flower—is evidence of this, as is thebulk of his considerable writing on the subject of alchemy and on the similarityof alchemical symbols (so beloved of the surrealists) to the drawings ofpatients undergoing psychotherapy.Spiritual possession is also a form, albeit temporary, of transformation. Fromthe days when shamans wore animal skins and turned lycanthrope, to the ecstaticdances of Haitian voudoun or Malaysian kuda kepang, this type of transformationwas temporary in time, but its effects on the psyche of the possessed must be ofa long-term nature, setting them apart from other human beings and allowing themto visit, if only for a moment, the “place between the worlds,” or what Lynchcalls “the Lodge.” This concept received a sudden impetus from the research ofCharles Darwin concerning evolution, and of Madame Blavatsky’s framing ofevolution in spiritual as well as racial terms. All at once, the ancient occultand alchemical dream of transformation became respectable: transformation wasnot only possible, the descent of man through various stages of animal lifeincluding most recently those of the simian variety was evidence that evengreater evolutionary stages were possible. But … evolution, transformation intowhat? Would humanity one day be considered nothing more than a temporary phaseof evolution before an even greater advancement?Fundamentalist Christianity could not accept Darwinian evolution because itdisagreed with the Biblical account of the creation of man; yet, even worse, anacceptance of the possibility of evolution carries with it a greater danger. Ifhumanity is destined for a more perfect modification or more refined mutation inthe future, then the incarnated Christ of two thousand years ago was inhabitingan inferior vessel, one that was not made in the “image and likeness of God,”for that is yet to come. This is another reason why those who believe in theliteral word of the Bible—whatever that is, as one must select from abewildering array of Biblical translations—cannot accept evolution, and whysecret societies embrace it with open arms. They believe it is the soul orspirit that is eternal, that is in the “image and likeness of God,” and that thebody is a material basis for that spirit, only: a machine, a device that enablesthe spirit to function in this hostile world. That the machine was perfectible,or at any rate mutable and subject to transformation, was a given, andirrefutable evidence of the possibility of spiritual attainments.I have declined to quote much Jungian material in this work so far, even thoughthe subject matter practically screams out at times for a Jungian perspective,because it may seem too scholarly or academic an approach to take, and becauseJung—as valuable as his insights may be—is too controversial a source. However,we would be amiss if we did not take into consideration what he has said aboutalchemical transformation, as he was one of the first to realize thepsychological nature of the alchemical texts.In describing one early text, one of the visions of Zosimos, he tells us,concerning transformation,The drama shows how the divine process of change manifests itself to our humanunderstanding and how man experiences it—as punishment, torment, death, andtransfiguration. The dreamer describes how a man would act and what he wouldhave to suffer if he were drawn into the cycle of the death and rebirth of thegods, and what effect the deus absconditus would have if a mortal man shouldsucceed by his “art” in setting free the “guardian of spirits” from his darkdwelling. There are indications in the literature that this is not without itsdangers.52In a footnote to this text, he writes,The element of torture, so conspicuous in Zosimos, is not uncommon in alchemicalliterature.53Indeed. As we have seen, torture—specifically including dismemberment andcannibalism—is a common element in shamanistic initiation traditions, althoughthe experience is usually an internalized affair or, as in the case of theKwakiutl tribe of North America, enacted in ritualized pantomime in memory of atime when it was performed in fact. Transformation comes at a price, a pricethat can be too heavy for many to bear.We discussed Mormonism in Book I of this study; we return to it again forconfirmation of what we are discussing here. Mormonism shares many beliefs incommon with the Gnostics, and many that are diametrically opposed to orthodoxChristianity, especially with regard to the possibilities of transformation andof individual human beings attaining Godhead.As cited in the book Mormon America: The Power and The Promise by Richard N.Ostling and Joan K. Ostling (considered a “definite introduction to the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints” by Library Journal), Mormon apologist B.H. Roberts, in a dialogue with a Jesuit critic, defined three points on whichMormons differ from “traditional” Christians (and, we may assume, traditionalJews and Muslims as well):First, we believe that God is a being with a body in form like man’s; that hepossesses body, parts and passions; that in a word, God is an exalted, perfectedman.Second, we believe in a plurality of Gods.Third, we believe that somewhere and some time in the ages to come,throughdevelopment, through enlargement, through purification, until perfection isattained, man at last may become like God—a God.54There is nothing in the above statement that conflicts with occult beliefs, butmuch that conflicts with the great monotheistic religions. Whether Joseph Smithformulated these ideas before or after his involvement with Freemasonry is moot;he was a practicing magician from early adolescence. In Mormonism, Americanreligion has adopted many occult and hermetic beliefs, including Gnosticism anda belief in transformation. The above statement does not admit to thepossibility that today, in this lifetime, a human being may become God; itpurposely postpones that possibility until “some time in the ages to come,” butat the same time admits that God is “an exalted, perfected man,” implying thatsome of these transformations have—in however isolated a fashion—already takenplace. It is not known whether or not Mormonism, perhaps in its more secretconclaves, ever considers the possibility that techniques exist for attainingthis goal in this lifetime, but the mere fact that they accept this type oftransformation as dogma is intriguing.Serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer was fascinated with the concept of transformation,for he believed that with transformation came spiritual power. His favorite filmwas Exorcist III, as we have seen, and it is a proper sequel to The Exorcist,with some of the original cast and with the original director, William Friedkin.In Exorcist III, we meet the demon who was exorcised in the first film, enteringthe body of a serial killer at the moment it leaves the body of little Regan.The demon has returned as a serial killer, and it was this element ofpossession/transformation that transfixed Dahmer. Every time the demon wouldmake an appearance on the screen, Dahmer would go into a kind of trance … as ifwilling the demon to enter him.What many people already know is that the original book by William Peter Blattyis based on a genuine case of demonic possession. Dahmer would have known thisas well, and his attraction to the theme of The Exorcist is at least partlybased on the idea that demonic possession is genuine and that the events in thefirst film were based on reality. The events of the third film became reality …through Dahmer, serial killer and cannibal, himself. Is it only coincidence,then, that Blatty was a psychological warfare officer for the US military in the1960s before he wrote his bestselling novel? And that another Blatty novel,Twinkle, Twinkle Killer Kane, was about a military mental hospital, with hintsof a mind-control program run amok? Further, that this novel was also made intoa film, The Ninth Configuration (1980), starring Stacey Keach as the newdirector of the hospital (set in a castle) who is if anything even more insanethan his patients; and that the film was directed by William Peter Blattyhimself, and featured Jason Miller: the “Father Damien” of The Exorcist. It isas if Blatty is trying to tell us something.The Exorcist, of course, started all sorts of demonic possession hysteria. Onewriter who contributed to this sense of the sinister all around us was MalachiMartin, a former Catholic priest, whose book on possession and exorcism inAmerica, Hostage to the Devil, was praised by some clergymen even as it wasattacked by others. Martin’s book begins with a vignette of an Irish Catholicpriest in Nanjing at the time of the Japanese invasion. The priest is tryingto exorcise a demon from the body of a Chinese Catholic man, a man who has beenidentified by the Chinese police as … a serial killer.Malachi Martin’s bona fides have been challenged by Robert Blair Kaiser, aformer Time Vatican correspondent, who claims in his autobiography that Martinstole his wife and had him committed to a mental institution in order to get ridof him. It is a nasty attack on the late Martin, and represents what has becomea general whiff of opprobrium where the former priest is concerned. While theCatholic Church has been officially silent on the matter of Malachi Martin, hisbooks have been popular among a certain segment of the Catholic population, whobelieve that there is an evil, Satanic element within the Vatican that hashijacked the Church for its own purposes. Martin was writing about this yearsbefore revelations exploded about the Vatican banking scandals, the Masonic P-2society infiltration of the Vatican as high as cardinal level, and the allegedmurder of Pope John Paul I after only thirty days as Pontiff.Thus, it is entirely possible that there are at least two factions within theChurch, and that one faction supported Martin’s researches and that anotherfirmly opposed them. Martin also alleged that there existed within the Churchsomething he called the “Superforce,” which was the name he gave to the cabal ofevildoers within the Vatican that perpetrated not only political and financialcrimes, but which was also involved in pedophilia and other sexual scandals,some under the guise of a satanic cult of sex abusers. Recent revelationsconcerning the widespread cover up of pedophilia and other forms of sexual abusewithin the Church—a cover up that begins at the highest levels of the Vaticanbureaucracy—seem to support Martin’s contentions, particularly as, in somecases, this abuse was connected with vaguely ritualistic settings andceremonies. Whatever the truth behind the mysterious Malachi Martin—who, at onepoint, had a correspondence with our dear friend Rayelan Russbacher of BarbaraHonegger, October Surprise, wandering bishop, and Les Dances Enchants fame—hismost vocal opponent and the source of the scurrilous rumors about him is RobertBlair Kaiser, in his autobiography Clerical Error.Kaiser’s book has been both praised and attacked by Catholics, largely dependingupon where they stand where the subject of Father Martin is concerned. Havingbegun his career as a candidate for the priesthood, spending eight years at aJesuit seminary, Kaiser abandoned Holy Orders and eventually won a posting withTime magazine in Rome, covering the controversial Second Vatican Council(“Vatican II”) of Pope John XXIII and winning awards for his reporting in theprocess, reporting that was assisted in no small part by Malachi Martin. InClerical Error, Kaiser accuses Martin of abusing their relationship by sleepingwith his wife while he was a houseguest of the Kaisers. The whole sordid storyis there—published, of course, after Martin’s death from a stroke in 1999—and itconfirms the suspicions of many in the New Church that Father Martin was asexual predator of vast proclivities who betrayed Church and friend, alike, withreckless abandon.Yet, defenders of Father Martin point to a paucity of documentation supportingKaiser’s contentions and insist that his period spent in a mentalinstitution—where he was diagnosed as suffering from acute paranoia andschizophrenia—has contributed to a wild tale without foundation, fueled byunresolved psychological issues concerning the Church, the Jesuits, celibacy,and a host of other problems that, perhaps, only lapsed Catholics can fullyunderstand.How strange, then, that we find Mr. Kaiser three years after the close ofVatican II back in Los Angeles working as a stringer when the Robert F. Kennedyassassination occurred, jumping at the chance to become involved in Sirhan’sdefense team and gaining unprecedented access to Sirhan for the ostensiblepurpose of writing a book and some articles as a means of raising money for thedefense lawyers.His book on the case, RFK Must Die!, is an oft-cited source for material on theassassination. In fact, according to such authorities as William Klaber andPhilip H. Melanson (Shadow Play: The Untold Story of the Robert F. KennedyAssassination), Philip H. Melanson (The Robert F. Kennedy Assassination: NewRevelations on the Conspiracy and Cover-up, 1968-1991) and William Turner andJohn Christian (The Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy: The Conspiracy andCoverup) there is a lot of speculation about Kaiser’s true role as part ofSirhan’s defense. Kaiser shifted gears numerous times during the investigationand subsequent trial, going from conviction that there was a conspiracy involvedand that Sirhan was a hypnotically-programmed assassin, to his final verdictthat Sirhan acted alone and fired all the shots that killed the Senator.Reading the Turner and Christian book is an exercise in frustration when itcomes to Kaiser’s role, for he so obviously had virtually unlimited access tothe defendant, the defendant’s family, and to investigative intelligence, yetseems to have shared little of this with anyone else, even after the publicationof his book on the subject. He can’t seem to get to the bottom of Sirhan Sirhan,and admits as much, leaving us to wonder if Kaiser was the right man in theright place at the right time. Courtroom observers have often wondered at thestrategy employed by Sirhan’s defense team, which did not try to work theevidence in their client’s favor, instead working out a plea bargain in advanceand permitting Sirhan to hang himself in court with his own words. Even thetranscripts of Dr. Bernard Diamond’s efforts to hypnotize Sirhan to get at thetruth of the assassination read more like a text on brainwashing than an attemptto penetrate Sirhan’s unconscious and reveal what actually had taken place, andwith the hypnotist leading the subject every step of the way.Assassinations, demonic possession, serial killers, transformation, Hollywood.It gets stranger.According to interviews with Malachi Martin and other sources—some available onreligious Web sites on the Internet, some via Art Bell’s syndicated radio talkshows—self-confessed serial killer David Berkowitz of the Son of Sam killingsasked to speak to Fr. Martin while in jail before his sentencing. Martinobliged, and subsequently refused all offers of a book deal or other financialgain from the fruits of that meeting, and probably for good reason.Fr. Martin, after all, concluded that Berkowitz was possessed by a demon.THE ULTIMATE EVIL…and it is in the humble opinion of this narrator that this is not just“something that happened”; this cannot be “one of those things”; this, please,cannot be that. … this was not just a matter of chance. Huh! These strangethings happen all the time.—“The Narrator,” Magnolia (1999), Paul Thomas AndersonThe essential magical work, apart from any particular operation, is the properformation of the Magical Being or Body of Light.—Chapter XI, “Of Our Lady Babalon and of the Beast Whereon She Rideth. AlsoConcerning Transformations.” Magick in Theory and Practice, Aleister Crowley55It may seem odd that this look at sinister forces at work in Hollywood wouldlead us to the Son of Sam cult, but that is the nature of the Beast. We, ashumans and especially as historians, academics, etc., think in terms of genre,of categories. Life, however, does not itself fit so easily into categories.Neither does our experience of life. The forces at work in assassinationsmanifest just as easily in works of art, for instance. The goal of alchemy issomething called the Great Work, or Magnum Opus. This Great Work is symbolizedby the production of the Philosopher’s Stone, the object which effectstransformation. The Great Work itself is not necessarily a purely alchemicalaccomplishment; it can be attained by other means. It is, from the point of viewof modern western occultists, the perfect uniting in oneself of macrocosm andmicrocosm: mastery over one giving you automatic mastery over the other. Thiscan be accomplished through yoga, for instance, as much as through alchemy, orceremonial magic, or musical composition, painting, literature, architecture, ormany other pursuits. That is why the great accomplishments of the artist arecalled by the same name—Magnum Opus, or Great Work—as the great accomplishmentof the alchemist and magician.Two types of individuals can lay claim to the status of those who have attainedthe Great Work. There are the public figures who, by virtue of their obviousattainments and contributions to society, seem destined to achieve the GreatWork: presidents, generals, movie stars. Their intense personal focus on theWork in their lives leads them through fields of obstacles and to confrontationwith the darker forces at work in the world even as they insist on continuingtheir quest regardless of the dangers. They typify for us what mythologianJoseph Campbell called “the hero with a thousand faces.”There is another type, however, and this individual may remain completelyunknown and unrecognized until that moment in time when something exceedinglybrilliant—or, more often, exceedingly vile—occurs as a result of thepressure-cooker nature of internalizing the psychological process, the intensefocus, to a point of no return. This type of individual is just as focused asthe first type, just as inexorable in his pursuit of the Work, but the result isusually an explosion, a slaughter, a catastrophe.The Great Work is not an end in itself. It is a preliminary to greateraccomplishments, but those which cannot be easily described or categorized. Aperson who has accomplished the Great Work may remain completely anonymous;conversely, he or she may dive deeply into society and work very hard to improvethe lives of others. In any case, the fact that someone has accomplished theGreat Work will not be obvious to those who have not, themselves, done the same.In fact, accomplishing the Great Work does not automatically imply a future ofgood works and good thoughts. There are those who have chosen an evil path,according to the literature, and use their hard-won knowledge and insight tofurther their own, very personal and often very sinister, ends. These are knownas “brothers of the left-hand path” or “black magicians.” It is generallyacknowledged that further spiritual growth is impossible for them; however, theythemselves often do not recognize any possible growth beyond what they havealready accomplished.This is obviously a discussion for initiates … or, at least, people who considerthemselves initiates! For us, it is enough to track the existence of those whohave accomplished the Great Work, who are adept at transformation, and whounderstand the workings of reality to such an extent that they can make use ofwhat appear to the rest of us to be useless information, useless objects,meaningless events. Because to become a master of these sinister forces is tobecome a master of the phenomenon of coincidence, of correspondences, ofsynchronicity.And, as such, of memory.The “art of memory” was investigated in recent times by Dame Frances A. Yates,who understood the intricate “memory palaces” as having links with Renaissancemagic, and how the art of memory itself was accused of being a “black art,”56even as Aristotle professed to find God resident in memory.57 Describing in somedetail the memory systems of Giordano Bruno, Raymond Lull and Robert Fludd—allfamous occult scholars who wielded enormous influence over generations ofhermeticists—she demonstrated how closely related were the ars memorandi andmystical thought. In addition, and clearly pertinent to our study, is herdiscovery of the fact that Robert Fludd’s theater of memory is based on theactual Globe Theater of Shakespearean fame … or, conversely, that the GlobeTheater was, itself, designed along hermetic lines in accord with occultprinciples: another instance of the close relationshipbetween dramaturgy and thaumaturgy.58Thoughts occur to one of the possibility of using Fludd’s revelations, not onlyfor the understanding of the actual staging of Shakespeare’s plays, but also foran interpretation of the relative spiritual significance of scenes played ondifferent levels. Is the Shakespearean stage a Renaissance and Hermetictransformation of the old religious stage?59In regards to this virtually lost art, it can be described simply: one trainedone’s memory by imagining a vast hall or other building filled with niches,columns, and levels into or onto which one put an element of the thing one wastrying to memorize. It could be a line from a speech, or a mathematical formula,or anything at all. For convenience, one would choose an existing building, suchas a cathedral, and memorize its architecture carefully. Then, one would takepieces of the thing to be memorized and associate them in turn with the statues,the columns, the entrances and exits, and other ornamentation, with each statue,etc. calling forth the associated idea in one’s memory. In this way, the theaterof memory would be filled with images corresponding to the target memories. Thetheater of memory served as a template, with the memories assigned to theirrespective positions on the template.In the days before teleprompters, computer disks and PDAs, a powerful memory wasan enormous asset in business, politics and, of course, the theater. Memory alsopermitted one to see associations that others would miss, because recurringpatterns of behavior and natural events would become clear if one rememberedpast incidents and could relate them in some way to present issues. It was ameans of reducing the pernicious effects of chance, much the same waycard-counters win at blackjack.Occultists already had such a system in place, the product of their efforts toreduce all of creation onto, or into, a kind of map. Qabalists had alreadycontributed to this concept by asserting that the Torah contained encodedinformation that could be understood only by converting the Hebrew letters ofthe sacred texts to their numerical equivalents and discovering associationsbetween words that had the same numerical value; from there, they went on tocreate the map of creation known as the Tree of Life upon which all things couldbe found.In medieval Europe, as in India and China, the human body was also a map thatcould be studied for clues to how the universe worked. By associating variousplanets and stars with individual organs and limbs, the ancients could duplicatecelestial events on a very human scale. The Hindu system of chakras is just sucha map, with mystical and astrological associations developed for neurologicalcenters along the spinal column, each with its own colors, letters, mantras,etc. “Raising the serpent Kundalini” along this path was tantamount to walkingto the stars, each step bringing with it greater insights and greater powers.Chakra means “wheel” or “sphere,” and the Qabalists likewise called theirstations along the Tree of Life sephira, the Hebrew for “sphere,” and oftendepicted their Tree of Life overlayed on an image of a man, the “perfect man” or“Adam Kadmon.” The similarities between the Indian and the Qabalistic systemsare very compelling, and they are joined by an almost identical system of theDaoist Chinese, that of the Shangqing school of Daoist alchemy.Lest readers wonder at the relevance of Qabalism and Hindu mythology to thissubject, let us point out one exemplar of modern culture’s appropriation ofthese ancient mystic beliefs. There is probably no person of 1980s and 1990sAmerican popular culture that represents better the conflicting spiritual forceswe are discussing than Madonna. A young woman of Italian-American descent whobecame a huge force in popular music and the MTV age of the music video, Madonnashocked the world with the video accompanying her song “Like A Prayer” as the1980s came to a close. While the lyrics to the song itself are not overtlyreligious or spiritual in nature—they are more like a traditional love song—themusic video was another matter. Shot in a church, with Madonna in her usualdeshabille, it features scenes of a statue of a black saint coming to life andkissing Madonna on the lips while outside the church white thugs attack a youngblack man they mistakenly believe has committed a murder. By combining elementsof race, religion and even sex in one video that takes place in a Catholicchurch, with a choir singing backup, no less, it was a forceful attack on theChurch, and moreover one that used only images and rather inoffensive lyrics tomake its point.Madonna later followed this up with a collection of her “hits” under the titleImmaculate Collection, an obvious allusion to the Catholic doctrine of theImmaculate Conception. And when Irish pop singer Sinead O’Connor tore up aphotograph of the Pope on live television and in front of a stunned audience (onNBC’s Saturday Night Live) with the admonition “Fight the real enemy,” basicallystealing Madonna’s thunder, Madonna herself responded humorously andintelligently the following week by tearing up a photograph of Joey Buttafuocco(of the infamous “Long Island Lolita” attempted-murder case) with the same pithyadmonition.But what makes all of this much more interesting is the fact that a decade laterMadonna began a serious study of the Qabala at a Los Angeles temple. From aCatholic upbringing, to an attack on the organized Church, to a study of theQabala … this is essentially the same route many lapsed Catholics have takensince the Second Vatican Council of the early 1960s, and it smacks of a returnto Gnosticism. The Catholic and the Qabalist mindsets are entirely different:the difference between faith and curiosity, perhaps. It also reveals a sensethat there are underlying forces at work in the universe that traditionalreligious instruction never adequately addresses, and for which it certainlynever provides theory and practice. That Madonna has also studied yoga and otherEastern philosophies is well-known; some of her later music videos depict her inHindu dress, while another has her hands bearing the henna tattoos of the MiddleEast.A common factor underlying these systems in vastly different cultures is theidea that there is another world, another reality, either parallel to ours or attimes (and places) tangential to ours, and that subjecting the human body totightly-focused control by a trained mind can open the gate to this otherreality as the body’s resources—neurological, biochemical—are diverted towardsthis end. The other means of opening the gate is, as we have already shown, the“derangement of the senses” championed by the surrealists and the shamans. Thelack of conscious control in the latter method is considered quite dangerous byadepts, although it is a faster route. For that reason, the “fast approach” isusually undertaken in groups, so that there is the possibility of interventionby a more experienced practitioner should an emergency arise. The first methodcan be undertaken by a solo operator as long as a strict regimen is followed,gradually building up conscious control of what are, after all, unconsciousprocesses. In his excellent forward to the collected works of alchemist ThomasVaughan, Beat hero Kenneth Rexroth describes this process “conscious control ofthe autonomic nervous system”; this it is, of course, but such control is notthe goal but only the tool, the instrument, to the opening of this “gate.”We have shown in the previous chapter many points of similarity between theserial killer and the shaman, even to the extent of demonstrating how—in somecases, at least, for which we have adequate documentation—they share afascination with the idea of transformation. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at theFBI’s training academy at Quantico has been credited with developing thedistinction between the organized and the disorganized serial killer, and withcreating the famous “profiles” which aid local law enforcement personnel intheir hunt for this most difficult of murderers to apprehend. Often, as in anyother science, evidence is sometimes bent to fit a theory, however. It is thecontention of this study that Charles Manson and David Berkowitz were not serialkillers in the classic sense. They represent a different phenomenon entirely,and one that we will examine in this and the chapter to follow.Maury Terry has insisted that there is a connection between Charles Manson andDavid Berkowitz, and he has based this conclusion largely on jailhouseconfessions and some controversial interviews with convicted felons. Hisresearch has been attacked in many cases, especially as it has contributed tothe rise of “satanic cult survivor hysteria” in the 1980s and 1990s in theUnited States. Some of his conclusions have been drawn from an idiosyncraticdecoding of the “Son of Sam” letters to the press and by a loose association ofthe dates of the Sam murders to dates with alleged occult significance. In thisregard, Terry has followed (probably unconsciously) in the footsteps of morevenerable scholars of the occult, people like Dame Frances A. Yates and, morerecently, David Ovason who, in books such as The Zelator and The Secrets ofNostradamus, discusses something he calls the “green language” (afterFulcanelli), and which former AP reporter and right-wing conspiriologist MichaelA. Hoffman II calls “twilight language.”60 These authors find that the enigmaticreferences in everything from the prophecies of Nostradamus and modern politicalpropaganda to the gnomic alchemical and Rosicrucian texts conceal a deepermeaning which is easier to understand once you have the key. Both Terry andHoffman understand—from their radically different perspectives—that languageconceals as much as it reveals, and that occultists have made liberal use ofthis characteristic to disguise more profound, more sinister truths abouteverything from world events to inner, psychological states. The problem, asalways, lies in interpretation.When Charles Manson “deconstructed” the lyrics to the Beatles’ White Album, hewas employing his own version of the “green language,” believing that theBeatles were, in some way, mystical adepts who were communicating with theirfollowers directly in coded messages in their songs. Thus, the song “Revolution9” became, for Manson, “Revelations 9,” a Biblical reference to the Apocalypse.The socio-political agenda of the Manson Family became “Helter Skelter,” areference to the title of another White Album song, etc.Terry is guilty of the same type of deconstruction attempt on the Son of Samletters, and for this he has been criticized by people claiming to beoccultists. A long and detailed attack on Terry’s book by someone named G. M.Kelly and posted on the Internet by something called the “Castle of the SilverStar”, 61is a case in point. We are to understand that Kelly is a Thelemite,a follower of Crowley, as he begins his review of Terry’s book with thesalutation “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,” which is standardamong members of the OTO and other followers of Thelema. Kelly is not, however,a member of the Grady McMurtry faction of the OTO which he terms the “Caliphatepseudo-o.t.o.” and an “enemy of human evolution.” (The insertion of humanevolution into the argument supports my thesis that occult organizations tend tobelieve in the fact or possibility of human evolution, as opposed to moretraditional organized religions that either oppose the idea or are scepticalabout it.) Thus, his perspective is that of one who has been (deliberately orinadvertently) attacked by the conclusions printed in Terry’s book and who isthus defending occultism (and specifically the Crowleyan kind) from Terry’sshotgun approach.Kelly argues, and quite rightly, that Terry goes overboard in his analysis ofthe Son of Sam letters and other details about the Son of Sam killings andrelated matters including—and most importantly—Terry’s understanding of thenature of cults. To Terry, virtually everything that is not a socially acceptedorganized religion in America is a cult. This is a trap into which many havefallen at one time or another, including Attorney General Janet Reno in herdoomed opposition to the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas. How do we define acult in a country that celebrates freedom of religion and which was, itself,founded by members of what was, essentially, a cult? From the Puritans whomanaged the first Thanksgiving to Freemasons such as George Washington, Americawas seeded with cults. To the English government, the fleeing Puritans werecertainly heretics and cultists, as were eventually the Huegenots, the PlymouthBrethren, and—to the Catholic Church—the Lutherans, Presbyterians, etc.Without going into the minutiae of the various murders and other phenomena thatKelly analyzes—putting off until the next chapter a more penetrating look at theSon of Sam case—let us look at what he says concerning the Son of Sam letters.As is well-known, during the crime spree known as the Son of Sam killings,someone sent letters to the newspapers boasting of the crimes, much in the sameway the Jack the Ripper killings were accompanied by letters from the murdererto the police and the newspapers a hundred years earlier. One of the letters,known as the “Borrelli letter” and supposedly writtenby David Berkowitz and dropped at the Suriani-Esau crime scene for the attentionof NYPD Captain Joseph Borrelli, states,I am the “Son of Sam.”And,I am on a different wavelength then everybody else—programmed to kill.And,I am the “monster”— “Beelzebub”—the “Chubby Behemouth.” 62A programmed killer who is also a demoniac. Clearly, the writer was workingwithin a venerable tradition!The NYPD released a psychiatric profile of the Sam killer on May 26, 1977, afteranalyzing the Borrelli letter and coming to the conclusion that the killer was:… neurotic, schizophrenic and paranoid—dime-store definitions resulting fromremote analyses by the psychiatrists. The profile also suggested that the killermight regard himself as a victim of “demonic possession.”63PAGING FATHER MARTINTerry’s book describes a conversation between him and Larry Siegel, a“well-informed researcher and professional writer,” who, at Terry’s suggestion,began to investigate the occult with an eye to unlocking the secrets of the Samletters. They latched immediately onto the references to Beelzebub and“Behemouth” in the Borrelli letter, as they were Biblical demons; but where theconversation turns “green” or “twilight” is in their interpretation of Behemouth(or, actually, Behemoth) as a demon represented as an elephant, and the name ofthe Elephas Disco near where one of the Sam killings took place. As the letterto Borrelli was dropped weeks before the Elephas attack—and elephas being theLatin for “elephant” and hence, by association, to the “Chubby Behemouth”—Terryand Siegel felt they had proof that the killings were planned in advance, notrandom, particularly as the writer of the letter stated that the “wemon ofQueens are z prettyest of all,” even as the letter itself was dropped at a Bronxcrime scene and Elephas was in Queens.64This does seem to strain “coincidence,” but Kelly does not mention this in hislengthy attack on The Ultimate Evil, only pointing out that Beelzebub andBehemoth were more likely references to a Judeo-Christian context than a satanicone … even as he decries satanism as nothing more than an “extreme overreactionto extreme Judeo-Christian religious ethics and restrictions”! Kelly is tryingto have his cake and eat it, too. Satanism and Judeao-Christianity areinextricably linked, the one a reaction to and defiance of the other, so it isnatural to expect Biblical references in satanic literature. Kelly is correct inattempting to distance Thelema and modern, New Age paganism fromJudeo-Christianity, of course; but his case is made more difficult by Crowleyhimself, who incorporated a “Gnostic Mass” into his repertoire of occultceremonies and constantly referred to himself as the Great Beast mentioned inthe Apocalypse and to his consorts as “Scarlet Women.” The fact is that it isextremely difficult to extricate Judeo-Christianity from Thelema, especially inview of Crowley’s own writings on occult themes, which are hardly ever purelypagan or non-Judeo-Christian.Kelly’s problem with Terry’s book is probably less with Terry’s leaps of logicthan with the possible reaction to Terry’s thesis by people who would “use bookslike Maury Terry’s to evoke a new form of the Inquisition.”61 Kelly, as aself-described “serious student of the so-called ‘occult’ now for at least twodecades” can “definitely say that there is nothing whatsoever in the Borrelliletter to indicate any great knowledge of any esoteric or occult subject,”61Yet, the unusual references to “Chubby Behemouth” and the “wemon of Queens” anda subsequent attack at the Elephas Disco in Queens weeks later, implies someonewith a somewhat deeper understanding of occultism than the somewhat airy phrasesof the Borrelli letter initially suggest, regardless of Kelly’s demurral.I believe the problem lies in affiliations.G.M. Kelly firmly defines his identity as a Thelemite and a serious student ofthe occult for decades; normally, this implies a certain tradition that can betraced through the OTO and the Golden Dawn, back to Freemasonry and theRosicrucians and the Knights Templar. It is a specific train of esoteric thoughtand practice, and the various branches share a common language, even as they maybe at loggerheads with each other over minutiae of ritual or interpretation.But there are other organizations that have only the most tenuous of affiliationwith the standard occult secret societies, and which determine their own“tradition” without regard to the standard texts. There is certainly nothing inthe available literature on the hermetic secret societies of the West to showthat human sacrifice was an acceptable part of the ritual, yet to deny thatritual murder ever has taken place in the past is to deny a healthy part ofhuman history. Recently, in fact, we have the Matamoros cult that wasresponsible for a number of ritual murders in Mexico and Texas: a group that wassupposedly practicing a form of Latin shamanism known as palo mayombe, even as“legitimate” practitioners insisted that the Matamoros group had no legalstanding within their religion. The Matamoros cult—which involved trafficking inillegal drugs across the Mexican-Texas border—was only revealed in 1989, twoyears after the publication of Terry’s book insisting there was an occult“culture” surrounding certain elements of the international drug trade. Thus, ifwe posit a secret society—a cult, if you will—that engages in this type ofritual murder, then we must expect that they do not take their ceremonialguidance from the same sources wherein Mr. Kelly finds his spiritual comfort, orthat, if they do, their interpretation of these sources is at wide variance fromthose enjoyed by Kelly and other Thelemites.The “great satanic network” described by Maury Terry has nothing to do with theOTO as it is known today. As I say in Unholy Alliance, the McMurtry version ofthe OTO, at least, could not organize a bake sale much less a calendar ofpremeditated murder. But individuals who had once been members of the OTO couldhave become involved in any kind of criminal activity; and this is where therules of evidence are necessary in order to define what was cult activity andwhat were simply the actions of people who had once been involved with a cult.And, in the case of the Son of Sam cult and its alleged connections with CharlesManson and other murders throughout the United States, we have to accept that wemay be dealing with a stranger phenomenon that simply a gaggle of self-involved,poor-complexioned, wide-eyed, robe-wearing adolescents waving fancy cutlery andhowling at the moon.What captures our attention here, however, is the way Terry has interpreted theSon of Sam letters, looking for occult content to support his idea that anationwide network of satanic killers was involved in the Sam killings. The factthat one of the probable members of this cult, Michael Carr, was born on October12—the same birthday as Aleister Crowley—is taken as relevant, as if Mr. Carrhad been able to choose his birthday with that in mind. Also, as Kelly pointsout, October 12 is Columbus Day in America, the day Columbus first set eyes onthe New World—a mission influenced, as we saw in Book I, by a desire to mountanother Crusade to take Jerusalem away from the Muslims. In any event, beingborn on Crowley’s birthday does not imply satanic tendencies!Another piece of “green interpretation” is Terry’s wild analysis of a phrase inthe “Breslin letter,” a letter from the Sam killer to Daily News columnist JimmyBreslin. The phrase that bothered Terry was a simple one, but set apart from therest of the letter by quotation marks, as were other suggestive phrases:“Keep ’em digging, drive on, think positive, get off your butts, knock oncoffins, etc.” 65Terry “deconstructs” what seems to be a simple and obvious sentence into actualdirections to David Berkowitz’ apartment! He begins by stating that he uses twotechniques, one a kind of “crossword puzzle type of system” 66and what he callsa “common satanist trick: spelling words backwards.”67 The latter he probablyderives from that standard novelistic description of a Black Mass which has itsparticipants reciting the Lord’s Prayer backwards, but … who knows? In anyevent, the method bears bizarre fruit.By spelling “keep ’em” backwards, he gets “peek me”; “digging” he believes is areference to “digs” or home. Thus, he translates this first phrase as “LOOK FORME HOME.”68Again: “drive on” becomes “drive no” the “no” meaning “north,” so that he gets“drive north” or “NORTH AVENUE.”69For “think positive” he eventually derives “HEAD RIGHT.”70For “get off your butts” he translates “butts” as cigarette butts and thereforeas “ash,” obtaining “GET OFF ASH.”71Finally, “knock on coffins” becomes “KNOCK ON PINE,” since a coffin is a “pinebox.”To continue with Terry’s own words:…to reach David Berkowitz’s apartment from any of the major routes out of NewYork City—site of the investigation—one would exit the parkways or thruways,drive across Ashburton Avenue, head right off Ashburton onto North Broadway andproceed to Pine.72Realizing, perhaps, that he was straining credulity with this analysis, he goesstraight to Benoit Mandelbrot, he of the Mandelbrot Set and discoverer offractals, a famous mathematician, who looked over the Sam letter and Terry’saccompanying analysis and concluded,The odds against one phrase being accurate were small; against two being ontarget they increased dramatically; and so forth. Finally, the odds against allfive—in order—leading step by step to the right address were almost impossibleto calculate as a coincidence or an unintentional happening.“So, “ Mandelbrot intoned, “it’s not a coincidence. What you have done iscorrect. If you sent me a letter, what do you think the odds would be that Icould get step-by-step directions to your house out of five successive phrasesif you didn’t intend to word your writing in such a manner?”73There are many more such leaps of logic in Terry’s work, and we won’t go intothem all. However, instances like the several mentioned above demonstrate theactivity of something deeper at work than mere chance or coincidence, popularlyunderstood. Occultists like Kelly ignore this type of evidence, even as itsupports their core contention: that there is an alternate reality parallel ortangential to our own that manifests in symbols, whether of events, dates,places, objects, etc. This reality may be an artificial construct of some groupor “cult”; or it may be a physical, “objective” reality. Or there may be nodifference between the two. But this reality, whatever its theoretical basis,may be manipulated, and so cause change to occur in this world, even as theother world is changed in turn. The evidence points to only two possibleconclusions: that there is at work in the world a relatively sophisticatedconspiracy of occultists involved in ritual murders, or that there is inoperation a force behind events in the world that we don’t understand.It was this blurring of boundaries between David Lynch’s “two worlds” that ledto a murder scandal surrounding Rosemary’s Baby producer Bob Evans, asophisticated drug-running operation, political and police corruption, serialmurder, mysterious cults, and the existence of a “Manson II.” It will even lead,however briefly, straight back to Ashland, Kentucky.Fire, walk with me.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Mircea Eliade, The Myth of the Eternal Return, Bollingen Series XLVI,Princeton University Press, NJ, p. 14-15 2 Henry Miller, The Time of the Assassins: A Study of Rimbaud, New Directions,NY, 1962, p. 33 3 Carl G.

You looked like hedid.” “How did he look?”“Like he’d been painted with a touch of magic.”—Norman Mailer, An American DreamIn the previous chapter we discussed some of the occult influences swirlingaround the Hollywood music and movie scene, focusing on the 1960s and 1970s.Readers may wonder why I bother to mention Hollywood at all, since it seemssomewhat out of place in a book that takes history seriously, and history is thestuff of dictators and armies, kings and presidents, economic boom and bust. AsI hope I have indicated—and supported—adequately thus far, it is as impossibleto extricate the arts from politics as it is religion from politics. Indeed, onemay say that religion occupies the middle pew between art and politics,partaking as it does of the powers and conceits of both. So much more so thephenomenon of the secret society, the mystic cult.If we—in concert with Giordano Bruno and with Professor Culianu as ourguides—understand that the power behind the connections between events andpersons, the fuel of the magic link itself, is eros, then we can come to nogreater comprehension of American history over the past century than to realizethe central position occupied by sex, and how quickly and almost effortlesslysex leads us to art on the one hand, and to murder on the other.Thus, critical to our thesis is the story of the interpenetration of Hollywoodand homicide, for the “scarlet thread of murder” that is woven through thefabric of history is one of those elements that reveals to us the existence ofthe sinister forces of which we speak. Murder makes everything relevant: bloodsamples, blood patterns, body temperature, time of day, day of year, hair,semen, cloth, fur, positioning of body, placement of body in relation to otherobjects, rigor mortis … in short, the entire crime scene—like those medievalwoodcuts of the human body showing signs of the zodiac representing variousorgans—takes on cosmic significance; and the doctrine of correspondences isprobably nowhere as prominent in the thinking of scientists as it is in that ofcriminologists, and no crime scene is as pregnant with meaning—deep, profoundmeaning—as that of the serial killer, whose mental images, whose fantasies, fuelthe act itself and are revealed in its arrangements. For both murder and sex,the human body is at once the image, the representation of either hatred orlust, and the place where the desired act is performed, the object upon which itis perpetrated, the physical link itself. Often, movie stars themselves arehunted, stalked and slain by deranged fans who have no real idea of who the staris, of the star’s actual personality or genuine nature, but only what wasvisible on the screen, the image of the star, so powerful is this new medium, soancient in its origins among the rituals and magic of our ancestors.It is for this reason that we are compelled to look closely at a series ofmurders that took place between 1977 and 1983, and also beyond. These killingsinvolved some of the most powerful, most famous names in the movie business …and some of the least known, least respected as well. The culture of drugs,cults, and death overtook the culture of the screen, and for a brief moment theveil of the dark temple was lifted by a corner, and a whiff of sulphur andsatanism escaped into the disbelieving world. Appropriately enough, the centralcharacter in this episode was the producer of Roman Polanski’s film, Rosemary’sBaby : Robert Evans. Evans would go on to marry Ali MacGraw—the actress whosefather was the mystic of Bedford Village—and Phyllis George, a former MissAmerica who later married a governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, a governorinvolved in the drugs and money scandal surrounding an organization known onlyas “the Company.”Evans was involved in a homicide, one with tentacles reaching from New York toLos Angeles, from Miami to Bogota … and from Charles Manson to a second killerknown as Manson II … and a spate of homicides known to the press as the Son ofSam killings. What we have read so far about occultism and Hollywood finds itsepitome in this single example, as so many of the characters overlap between theRoy Radin homicide case in 1983 and the Manson Family environment in 1969, withthe Son of Sam murders taking place in the interim. As with every facet ofAmerican history we have investigated so far, we will see that the coincidencespile up in remarkable ways and considerable volume, and we have to ask ourselvesagain that question: is all this the result of a conspiracy, as many would haveus believe? Or is it the result of something deeper and more mysterious, but noless threatening?Is it the Manson Secret?A BRONX TALEMaury Terry, the investigative journalist whose The Ultimate Evil started alandslide of satanic cult hysteria in the United States in the late 1980s, as hedelved deeply into the Son of Sam murder mystery, discovered that he hadactually gone to high school with John Carr, one of the suspects in there-opened case who was killed by a shotgun blast to the head at an Air Forcebase in North Dakota. In the spirit of historical accuracy and completedisclosure, therefore, I must make a similar declaration.I am a graduate of Christopher Columbus High School, in the Bronx. Thisinstitution boasts at least two well-known alumni. One is pioneer transsexualChristine Jorgensen. The other is confessed Son of Sam killer David Berkowitz.I cannot claim to have known Berkowitz in high school, since I graduated in 1968and he started at Columbus in 1969, but he would have read my article on alchemyand the transmutation of metals in the school’s “literary-arts magazine,”Horizon, which was published that year. In fact, Berkowitz lived for a while onBarnes Avenue in the Bronx, a few blocks from where I lived on Revere Avenue.And he worked as a security guard at Co-Op City, very close by.And we had friends in common.During my last two years at Columbus, I was friendly with a number of people wholived in and near Pelham Bay Park, which is in the same area of the northeasternBronx as Barnes and Revere Avenues, a few subway station stops north ofWestchester Square and at the end of the Number 6 line (the famous “Pelham1-2-3”). In those years, 1967-1969, there was a lot of mysticism going on in theUnited States, and the Bronx was no exception. These individuals were veryinvolved in ritual practices, as they understood them. (Some were even teachersat the high school.) We held séances together in Pelham Bay, near where Co-OpCity now stands; some of us even tried summoning demons. As a text, we reliedupon A. E. Waite’s Book of Ceremonial Magic (or, in its more ominousincarnation, The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts). Vietnam was in full heat,and there were many of us who would go off to the jungles, never to return. Wewanted to know what was really “out there,” of what strange stuff reality wasreally composed. We knew the Church was not telling us everything; we knew thegovernment was lying to us about so much, starting with Dallas in 1963. Wequestioned all authority, and with reason. Authority had let us down; authoritywas sending us to die in a war no one understood. We knew there were secrets,and we resented that, resented the fact that we could die without knowing theTruth. To that end, we read the works of Marx and Engels, Mao and Angela Davisand Abbie Hoffman, side by side with Aleister Crowley, Eliphas Levi, andMacGregor Mathers.To that end, we scrupulously copied down arcane ceremonies and mispronouncedGreek and Hebrew incantations (although we could be counted upon to get theLatin right, altar boys as some of us had been before the days of Vatican II andthe vernacular Mass). We made our own instruments and tools “of Art”: wands,knives, swords, robes, and censers.We stalked the dead lands of pre-Co-Op City in the middle of the night, litcandles in the dark and chanted to the Moon.We tugged at the veil of the Temple, hoping to rip it from its moorings andreveal the Light once and for all.We gathered strange herbs from the roadsides and the park grounds, burned themin our censers or drank them as sacraments.We stood on a rock at dawn and worshipped the Sun and reached out to touch theface of God.This was the Bronx in 1968.Many of the people mentioned in Maury Terry’s book were either known to us, orknown to friends of ours. This web of relationships would increase once HermanSlater opened his famous store on Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights in 1972, likea crazy little magnet that attracted only those on the very fringe of society.From that year until 1984 I found myself in the center of many of the incidentsrecounted in Terry’s book, at least those that involved the Warlock Shop,Brooklyn Heights, the OTO, and the various other secret societies and cults withtheir tenuous connections to the Scientologists, the Process Church of the FinalJudgement, the Church of Satan, the Ku Klux Klan, the National RenaissanceParty, and all the various witchcraft covens and personalities, from theGardnerians to the Alexandrians and Welsh Traditionalists, from Raymond Bucklandto Leo Martello and Margot Adler, from covens gay and straight and mixed, tocovens clothed and “sky clad.” What was going on was much more blatant, muchmore vigorous, than even Terry suspected. There was a lot going on in thosedays, and much of it was open and covered by a skeptical but eager press, whilethe rest could be discovered with a little patience and good humor.Raymond Buckland had already appeared on television talk shows as early as thelate 1960s, sometimes opposite popular witch and author Sybil Leek. The AmericanSociety for Psychical Research was flourishing under the leadership of Dr.Karlis Osis, and I was a member … even though I was only sixteen years old,attending ASPR meetings at night in Manhattan with my mother, and once takingthe train to Brentwood, Long Island to spy on the home of Raymond Buckland,author, leader of a coven of witches, proprietor of a witchcraft museum … andowner of the hearse parked in his driveway.Samuel Weiser’s in those days was a second-hand bookstore just below UnionSquare, with a basement section, dimly lighted, devoted to the occult andorientalia where you would find herbals, Tarot decks, grimoires, incense sticks,ephemerides, Sanskrit dictionaries, and a very strange clientele. It movedseveral times thereafter, dumping the second-hand stock and specializing in bothselling and publishing occult arcana, each time the premises becoming smallerand smaller, finally reduced to the size of the original occult section in thebasement of the store off Union Square.Zoltan Mason’s store was near Bloomingdales, uptown and second-storey, a quiet,dignified shop that specialized in astrological literature but which alsoboasted a decent alchemy section and some odds and ends on ritual magic. Theyfrowned on walk-in trade, were not really interested in the retail business, butheld classes in astrology. Zoltan Mason himself, noticing my serious demeanorand ambitious book selections—the Turba Philosophorum, the Chymical Wedding ofChristian Rosenkreutz, the Christian Rosenkreutz Anthology in a large,beautifully printed and very expensive hardcover edition—took me inside to theback room (in actuality, his well-appointed office and secret storeroom, anelaborate Zodiac hanging on the wall behind his desk) and asked me whatlanguages I spoke, and if I could help him with some translations from Latin,Russian, Church Slavonic …It was an era of tea rooms and card readings, horoscopes and spells. And, underit all, a seething political revolution in the making.It was the height of the Vietnam War, but also of US government penetration ofthe anti-War movement, as well as of the Black Panthers, the Ku Klux Klan, theWeathermen, and the cults. In 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated inMemphis, Tennessee. Columbus High School held a moment of silence as we sat,stunned, in our seats during home room. A few months later, Bobby Kennedy wasshot in Los Angeles, California. We were reeling from one assassination thenanother, to the backbeat of our neighbors dying in Vietnam. During the funeralservice for Bobby Kennedy at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan, Andy Williamssang The Battle Hymn of the Republic as the mourners began to file out, one byone, into the June sunshine and Leonard Bernstein powered up the HallelujahChorus from The Messiah.Two months later, in Miami, The Battle Hymn of the Republic was played onceagain, this time at the Republican National Convention that nominated RichardNixon as their candidate for the Presidency. The obscenity of that event—if notits implicit symbolism—should have put us all on notice, those of us who neededto be warned.James Earl Ray—the putative assassin of Dr. King—co-authored a book on the Kingassassination with anti-tax activist Frederick Saussy, Tennessee Waltz, with anafterword by Mr. Saussy entitled “The Politics of Witchcraft.”Politics and witchcraft were in the air, not as mutually exclusive themes but astwo ways of looking at the same phenomenon. With this in mind, we can proceedsafely to an analysis of the Son of Sam killings and, by extension, the weirdand highly “coincidental” Roy Radin homicide. As in the case with theassassination of President Kennedy, we will uncover so many corpses along theway, so much “collateral damage,” that we will be forgiven if we come to theconclusion that the reason our criminal justice system is so flawed is that ourscientific method of forensic investigation does not allow for something asethereal as moral responsibility, much less a close definition of whatconstitutes good and evil.OCCULT CALENDARS AND MOVEABLE FEASTSOne of the essential elements used by Terry and others to define whatconstitutes evidence of an occult crime spree is the use of an alleged occultcalendar as a timing device for ritual murders. They point to Halloween as a“sacred day” in the calendar of the occultists or satanists, and a few otherdays as well, and then try to fit the dates of the murders to the so-calledsatanic or pagan calendar. Some of their efforts have been correctly held up toridicule; the pagan holidays are astronomically determined, and there is not alot of temporal leeway for their celebration. However, having witnessed the laxattitude of many self-proclaimed pagans and satanists in the past—and sometimesthe necessity of holding ritual holidays on days when most of the participantswould be free from obligations at the office—I can attest that, to the lessserious among the pagans, these days are somewhat moveable. The question thenarises: would a cult devoted to ritual murder and human sacrifice actuallypostpone a homicide to a convenient weekend or bank holiday? Serial killers likeDahmer did most of their killing on days off; would the same hold true for anorganized cult? The answer: not likely.That said, let us examine the occult holidays in question beginning with thetraditional pagan and occult holidays, and then comparing them with the table inTerry’s book.Traditionally, the most important days on the occult calendar—and this isdemonstrated by cultures as disparate in time and space as the Stonehenge cult,the American Mound Builders, and the ancient Egyptians—are those that mark thesolstices and the equinoces: sacred space aligned with sacred time. Thus, thefirst days of Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter are the most important and arecalled the Quarter Days as they divide the year into fourths. The great stonecalendar of Stonehenge is so oriented, for example.Then, the next four days of occult importance—and considered by some to be moreimportant than the Quarter Days—are the Cross Quarter Days. These are the daysthat divide the previous quarters, appearing (for instance) halfway between thefirst day of Spring and the first day of Summer. These are:> •April 30, called Walpurgisnacht in Germany and Beltane in the Celtic> countries;> > •August 1, called Lammas;> > •October 31, called Halloween or Samhain by the Celts; and> > •January 31, called Candlemas or Oimelc by the Celts.There are other days of importance to various cults, and these should not beignored. They would include—but are not limited to—October 12, which is thebirthday of Aleister Crowley; December 1, which is the day Crowley died; July23, which is the birthday of Crowley’s wife, purportedly the woman indirectlyresponsible for bringing Crowley’s attention to the presence of theextraterrestrial intelligence known as Aiwass during their honeymoon in Cairo in1904 (and, also, the day of the rising of the Dog Star, Sirius: a date sacred tothe ancient Egyptians, source of much modern occult symbolism), and many others,including dates of importance only to Thelemites, or to Anton LaVey’s Church ofSatan, or Michael Aquino’s Temple of Set, etc.It is to be stressed that these are all dates of importance to those using theWestern, Gregorian Calendar. There may be cults in Russia and some of theEastern European and Balkan countries that use the older, Julian calendar.Asians have their own sacred holidays and these are usually moveable with regardto the Western calendar, based as they are on the lunar cycle. So, the type ofcult one is dealing with will predict how it will use the calendar; conversely,if one knows the calendar being used, one can identify the type of cult involvedwith reasonable assurance.It should be pointed out that lunar cycles are also important. The Full and NewMoons especially are trigger dates for the celebration of pagan rituals,especially for the Wiccan cults that are based on a ritual they call “DrawingDown the Moon,” which is quite possibly the relict of an old Thracian ritual,and possibly also an elaboration of Gerald Gardner and Aleister Crowley,although we have to admit that any witchcraft cults that pre-existed theGardnerian versions would have also worshipped the moon.The Quarter Days are normally celebrated at dawn on those days, and are ritualsoriented towards the sun and towards the solar calendar, as evidenced byNeolithic structures such as Stonehenge and the American earthworks of the“mound builders” culture. The Cross Quarter Days, by contrast, are normallycelebrated at night, most appropriately at midnight. Taken together, the Quarterand Cross Quarter Days would be known as “sabbats” to the witch cult and to someof the satanic organizations as well; the lunar rituals based on the Full or NewMoons are considered “esbats” in the literature, a type of lesser sabbat. Thereare normally thirteen lunar months of roughly twenty-eight days each in a solaryear of twelve months, but a solar year can only contain four Quarter Days andfour Cross Quarter Days. As the full and new moons are also of great importanceand significance to Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism and Daoism, we can safely say thata knowledge of the lunar calendar as well as the Quarter and Cross Quarter Dayswould be sufficient to cover most bases.The Son of Sam killings began, officially, with the attack on Donna Lauria andJody Valente on July 29, 1976. Donna Lauria died in the assault. As the paganfestival of Lammas begins officially on the eve of August 1, we may agree thatthis event is quite close to fitting the occult calendar as envisioned by Terryand described above. According to Terry’s research, and Berkowitz’ own admissionin the Epilogue to Terry’s book,1 the attack on Donna Lauria was a deliberateone, and not a random attack as were some of the other killings. Therefore wemust assume that—if a cult were involved—this date would have some specialsignificance. The fact that it happens on a Thursday, rather than on a moreconvenient weekend night like most of the others, should compel our closeattention. Also present at the murder was Michael Carr, according to Berkowitz,although Berkowitz admitted he did the actual shooting. Several other members ofthe cult—which Berkowitz readily identifies as such—were also present asobservers.Terry goes further, however, by insisting that the murderous assault on ArlisPerry in a church at Stanford University—a truly hideous killing thatincorporated many ritualistic elements—was a killing by the same cult as thatresponsible for the Son of Sam killings three years later in New York City.There is greater weight to this conviction for several reasons (as we will seebelow), but the fact that the murder took place on the night of October 12,1974—and thus Crowley’s birthday, a day that is celebrated by some Thelemicgroups—already forces us to consider that the killer or killers were familiarwith this date and chose it deliberately.Of course, some critics of this approach have stated that it is also ColumbusDay, and that it would be equally credible to say that Arlis Perry was murderedby a crazed Genoan, or by someone upset with Columbus’ invasion of the NativeAmerican territories, etc., or even by a Norwegian who wanted to bring thecountry’s attention to the fact that Lief Erikson was the first to discoverAmerica and not Columbus, etc. However, the selection of a church as the murdersite, the insertion of a candle in the victim’s vagina with another between herbreasts, and the strange placement of her bare legs and the blue jeanspositioned over them, forming a kind of diamond pattern (or a six-pointed star),suggested to many investigators that this was a cult crime.The time frame October 12-13 is important for another reason which is largelyignored by writers on cult crime, for it was Friday, October 13, 1307 when theKnights Templar were arrested throughout France in an attempt—orchestrated byPope and King—to destroy the Order. It is possibly the event that gave rise tothe idea that Friday the 13th is unlucky, and which has made Friday the 13thsuch a popular date among occultists and horror movie directors. More than that,it is an important date for Freemasons and modern-day Templars who derive theirheritage from the famous Order.(For those interested in such things, March 18 is also notable as the date onwhich Templar Grand Master Jacques de Molay was burned at the stake in 1314. Itis also the birthday of “sleeping prophet” Edgar Cayce, as well as allegedKennedy assassination conspirator and wandering bishop David Ferrie.)The next Son of Sam attack took place on October 23, 1976, a Saturday. This datehas no particular occult significance, and is not near enough to another date tobe remarkable. It is over a week early for Halloween, for instance. In addition,Terry believes that the targets in this case—Rosemary Keenan and CarlDenaro—were chosen randomly, even though Ms. Keenan was the daughter of an NYPDdetective and Mr. Denaro was a security guard who had just joined the Air Force.According to Berkowitz, the shooter was a woman.2Next, we have the attack on Joanne Lomino and Donna DeMasi on November 27, 1976,also a Saturday. Conceivably, this could have been a date chosen for itsproximity to December 1, the day of Crowley’s demise, as it is the closestweekend night; a weak theory, but possibly one that would obtain. Both werewounded. Both saw their killer before he opened fire, and their description ofhim was as different from that of David Berkowitz as it was possible to be,although virtually identical to that of the Donna Lauria assailant: slim,blonde, with a high-pitched voice. Berkowitz claimed it was John Carr.3Then we have the attack on Christine Freund on January 30, 1977, a Sunday. Thisis identified by Terry—for completely different reasons—as a deliberate Son ofSam target rather than a random shooting. This is also a date comfortably closeto Candlemas and the pagan festival of Oimelc. Thus, the dates match in thiscase as well as they do for Arlis Perry and for Donna Lauria. Christine Freunddied on her way to a Masonic dance with her boyfriend, John Diel, who was unhurtin the attack. It would be the Freund case that would lead some investigatorstowards a possible motive for some of the killings that did not fit a “crazed,lone gunman” scenario. According to Berkowitz, an “out of town” shooter wasbrought in for this one, although there were a total of five cult memberspresent for this attack. The shooter in this case was identified by Berkowitz as“Manson II,” who also claimed responsibility for the Arlis Perry attack.The next Sam attack took place on March 8, 1977, a Tuesday and another anomalyin the calendar. This was the shooting of Virginia Voskerichian. March 8 has noparticular significance in the calendar, so this attack is a mystery.Bulgarian-born Voskerichian died instantly when the slug from the .44 CharterArms Bulldog revolver passed through her skull as she walked down the Queensstreet on her way home from Columbia University. Berkowitz claims a womancommitted this murder.4This is followed by the attack on Alexander Esau and Valentina Suriani on April17, 1977, the Sunday after Easter, taking place along the Hutchinson RiverParkway in the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx, not far from where DavidBerkowitz (and the author) used to live. Again, no occult significance, but bothwere slain and a letter left in the car to the attention of Queens DetectiveCaptain Joseph Borelli, the letter that would state for the first time “I am the‘Son of Sam.’”5 However, there were indications in that letter that the murdershad been planned for Easter, a week earlier, and were supposed to have takenplace in Queens. From internal evidence, it seemed to the police that the letteritself had been written more than a week earlier, designed to be left at aQueens crime scene and not at one in the Bronx … which leaves us with thequestion, who was the intended target for Easter Sunday? Berkowitz admits tohaving committed this crime, although other cult members were, as usual,present.On May 30, 1977, a letter was mailed to Daily News columnist Jimmy Breslin fromthe “Son of Sam.” This letter contained many specific references to people whowould later become identified once Berkowitz was apprehended, including JohnCarr. It was a well-written, creepy letter that ignited the imagination of NewYorkers, and put them on alert that something more than your everyday, crazedkiller was on the loose. The letter contained occult references as well asbuilding upon the vampiric symbolism of the first letter left at theEsau/Suriani crime scene. It was, in fact, an intelligent piece of work and wasthe first communication bearing the Son of Sam “logo,” a grouping ofastrological symbols that had some investigators wondering at a link toCalifornia’s Zodiac killer.June 26, 1977—a Sunday—is the day of the attack on Judy Placido and SalvatoreLupo outside the Elephas Disco in Queens. This date is somewhat problematic. Wasit chosen because it is the closest weekend date after the summer solstice,which would have been on or about June 22? Both survived this attack.(Ironically, Judy Placido had attended Son of Sam victim Valentina Suriani’sfuneral two months earlier.) Michael Carr committed this murder, again accordingto Berkowitz.6But the final confirmed Son of Sam murder was that of Stacy Moskowitz (and theblinding of her date, Robert Violante) in Brooklyn on July 31, 1977—virtuallythe first anniversary of the Sam killings as well as Lammas in the pagancalendar and a Sunday. And a full moon. This attack had a plethora ofeyewitnesses who saw more than one participant in the killing and at least twovehicles: one, a Ford Galaxie, was Berkowitz’ car, the one identified by aparking ticket that night. The other was a Volkswagen Beetle.7 AlthoughBerkowitz was present at this killing, evidence shows he could not havecommitted it and, indeed, once he knew his car had just received a parkingticket, tried to call it off, knowing where that clue would lead. However, thekilling went ahead as planned, committed—according to Berkowitz—by a friend ofJohn Carr’s from North Dakota.8As you can see, not all of the killings were timed to the official pagancalendar. In fact, most of them could not be successfully placed near enough toa cult date to be significant. Yet, is there a pattern we could be missing? Oris the lack of a pattern in some killings an indication that they were committedmerely to confuse the issue, or conversely that they are evidence of a secondkiller or killers?One possible pattern is the astrological one.If we consider the Arlis Perry homicide first, we are relatively secure in thatthis murder took place on Crowley’s birthday, a date of considerablesignificance to his followers. But if we look a little deeper, from the point ofview of a sophisticated cultist with a hidden agenda, we may find something morethan we bargained for.Arlis Perry was killed on or about midnight of October 12-13, 1974. Anastrological chart drawn up for that place and time would reveal that there wasa conjunction of the Sun and Mars in Libra at the Lower Heaven (the point inspace opposite the Midheaven where the Sun is highest at noon). This conjunctionis squared by Saturn in Cancer, and “semi-sextiled” (an angle of thirty degrees)by the waning Moon in Virgo. To reinforce the imagery, there were alsosignificant angles between Pluto, Neptune and Jupiter that night. In fact,virtually all the “angles” that night were squares, conjunctions or oppositions:all considered “hard” aspects in astrological circles. In other words, it was apotent night for a ritual murder and may have been selected with that point ofview in addition to the fact that all of these aspects were taking place onCrowley’s birthday.One does not need to believe in astrology at all to understand that others do.One does not have to believe in the efficacy or value of human sacrifice tounderstand that others do. As pointed out in Unholy Alliance, even BritishIntelligence understood that the Nazis were astrology-crazed, and worked upseveral propaganda and psy-war campaigns to turn that belief against them,realizing that no matter how you view astrology, there is a certain internalconsistency to its methods that can be exploited by a cleverastrologer-turned-intelligence officer.Could an astrological perspective assist us in analyzing the other Son of Samhomicides?For one thing, charts drawn up for all the murders indicate that only one—thatof Virginia Voskerichian on March 8, 1977—did not take place during a waxingmoon. (In fact, the Voskerichian attack was very anomalous in other regards,taking place much earlier in the evening than the others.) The other shootingstook place either on New or Full Moons or when the Moon was somewhere betweenNew and Full. In fact, the attack on Alexander Esau and Valentina Suriani on thestrange date of April 17, 1977 (a date with no known pagan or occultsignificance) took place during the New Moon. The attack on Rosemary Keenan andCarl Denaro on October 23, 1976 (again, a date with no known occultsignificance) not only took place on the night of the New Moon but also whenboth the Sun and the Moon were entering conjunction with Uranus and Mars and theMoon’s North Node (tradition-ally an indicator of an eclipse).The attack on Stacy Moskowitch—the last of the official Son of Sam murders—tookplace not only on Lammas but also on the night of the Full Moon.If one believes in astrology, then one can say that the murders happened onthose dates and times because the “stars were aright.” And if one does notbelieve in astrology, then one can still say that someone else, someone who didbelieve in astrology, chose those dates and times deliberately. It is not aconclusive piece of evidence, but the astrological character of the murdercalendar is suggestive. Berkowitz told Terry that he was not aware of thereasons for the murders, or why some victims were chosen for death; he wassimply told what to do and he did it.Then, however, we have the collateral damage, the deaths of people who wereclose to the suspects or the investigation. These include:September 20, 1977: Andrew Dupay—a mailman who worked the Yonkers route whereBerkowitz and the Carrs lived—goes downstairs to the basement of his home whilehis wife is bathing their two daughters, writes a hasty suicide note, and killshimself with a shotgun. It is the autumnal equinox. No one knows the motive forthe suicide, except that in the days immediately before and after Berkowitz’arrest, co-workers say Dupay began acting fearful, gradually becoming consumedwith panic through the month of August and into September. One informant wroteTerry that Dupay had met someone in Pelham Bay Park the day before his suicide.Pelham Bay Park, of course, is the same area of the Bronx where Berkowitz hadlived a few years earlier. The man he met was not identified.9October 31, 1981: the murders of Ronald Sisman and Elizabeth Plotzman onHalloween. Sisman was a photographer who claimed to have possession ofvideotapes made by the Son of Sam killer(s), notably of the murder of StacyMoskowitz. Sisman was planning on giving this evidence to the authorities, buthe and his girlfriend were executed. It was Sisman who introduced actress(Welcome Back, Kotter) and model (Playboy) Melonie Haller to producer Roy Radin,who was himself murdered by the Son of Sam cult according to Terry. MelonieHaller was savagely beaten at Radin’s Long Island estate and claimed that thebeatings and possible rape were videotaped by Radin and/or his accomplices.Craig Glassman, on October 31, 1991: again, Halloween. Glassman, an importantwitness to the goings-on in and around the Yonkers apartment of David Berkowitz,who had received threatening letters and was the target of an arson attack byBerkowitz, died on the Taconic State Parkway in a bizarre auto accident.There were numerous other murders and violent deaths surrounding the Son of Samcult, much as we saw in the case of the Kennedy assassination, lending credenceto the conspiracy theory proposed by Terry. A further piece of evidence,circumstantial as it may be, is that of the dates of the famous Zodiac killingsin California.The Zodiac killer began his murderous spree on October 30, 1966—again,uncomfortably close to Halloween and very suggestive of cult involvement. (Infact, this date is interesting for another reason, for it is the very same daythat President John F. Kennedy’s brain was discovered missing from the NationalArchives; within two weeks New Orleans DA Jim Garrison would begin his owninvestigation of the assassination and, at the same time, the Mothman sightingswould begin in West Virginia.) The murders continued until May 20, 1981 … aperiod of nearly fifteen years. The Zodiac killer was never apprehended and thecase remains open, although there have been one or two very good suspects. Whatis important for our investigation, however, is the fact that the Zodiackillings stopped from October 16, 1975 until starting up again on February 24,1979, a quiescent period of about three and half years. This period of Zodiacinactivity dovetails with the Son of Sam murders, which took place from July1976 to August 1977, and the murders of alleged Sam accomplices John Carr inFebruary 1978 and Michael Carr in October 1978.In fact, the murder of Arlis Perry in Stanford on October 12, 1974 also fitsneatly into the Zodiac framework, as the killer was operating mostly in andaround the San Francisco area at this time. If the Zodiac murders were theresult of a cult in operation, then it is reasonable to assume that the Son ofSam cult—on the East Coast as opposed to Zodiac’s West Coast sphere ofinfluence—was picking up when Zodiac left off, for whatever reason, and thatZodiac picked up shortly after the last Sam killing in late 1978, thusperpetuating a calendar of murder for reasons at which we can only guess.There are many similarities between the Zodiac case and the Son of Sam case. Thedefinitive study of the Zodiac killings—Zodiac by Robert Graysmith—tells us thatthe killings took place “on weekends when the moon was new or full.” 10Inaddition, Graysmith has linked the killings to the Quarter Days: the summer andwinter solstices and the spring and autumn equinoces.11 Further, Zodiac senttaunting letters to the press, as did the Son of Sam killer(s) as well asprobably the most famous serial killer of all time, Jack the Ripper. Like theRipper, the Zodiac’s identity is unknown.There was a Zodiac murder in 1974, only a few weeks before Arlis Perry’s. Thistook place “six days after the Autumnal Equinox in 1974,” when afourteen-year-old girl was killed. 12The Zodiac used a wide variety of murderweapons, making his identification and apprehension even more difficult. Then,after October 1975 there seems to be little or no more activity from the Zodiacuntil February 1979: virtually the same time frame in which the Son of Sammurders took place, including the violent deaths of John and Michael Carr.In Graysmith’s sequel, Zodiac Unmasked published in April 2002, he identifiesthe Zodiac Killer as one Arthur Leigh Allen, and notes that the period of Zodiacinactivity matches the years when Allen was in prison … specifically theAtascadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, convicted of childmolestation. 13Strange, then, that the Son of Sam cult would begin operationwhen he was incarcerated, and then stop shortly after he was released. If thisis coincidence, then it is evidence of a deeper historical force at work.Maury Terry has linked the Son of Sam killings to the operation of a sataniccult; indeed, David Berkowitz has admitted as much and in some detail in theEpilogue to Terry’s book. The Zodiac used occult symbols, astrological symbols,and ciphers in his letters to the press. Even his nom de guerre, “Zodiac,” is ofcourse astrological.Of course, as always, the alternative explanation is “coincidence.” As we haveseen, coincidence can be evidence of the operation of something deeper behindhistorical events. Although every historical event—and many, smaller, personalevents—can be shown to demonstrate a certain degree of “coincidence” in action,it is when we discuss murder, from presidential assassinations to mass murder toserial murder, that we find the frequency and specificity of coincidenceincreasing dramatically. We see that events have been presaged by webs ofconvenient accidents, bringing specific people into specific places at specifictimes. It is perhaps the inclusion of people into this time-space continuum thathas something to do with the mechanism of coincidence, as people have theability to remember the past, and to predict—with various degrees ofaccuracy—the future.The interface between consciousness and physical space is one that we willexamine in the final section of this work, because it, quite simply, gives thegame away. However, the conclusions to which I am drawn will not make much senseunless you witness for yourself the operation of this mysterious, sinister forcefor yourselves.As an example, and considering dates of pagan significance, the famous TexasTower Sniper case took place on Lammas, that is on August 1, 1966 at Austin(this is a Cross Quarter Day; the next Cross Quarter Day would be October 31,1966 when the Zodiac killings began). Charles Whitman was an ex-Marine whosomehow lost his mind and began shooting at random targets from the top of atower at the University of Texas, hitting forty-five people in ninety-sixminutes and killing fourteen of those. Whitman had had trouble in the Marines,and had been court-martialed in November 1963. He had served in Guantanamo Bay,Cuba beginning in December 1959 when Castro’s revolution was in full swing andthe island nation was transferring its political allegiance to the Soviet Union.In June 1961 he was sent to a college preparatory school in Bainbridge,Maryland, eventually enrolling in the University of Texas in September 1961under a special program designed to enrich the Marine Corps’ scientific andtechnical capabilities by training selected Marines in engineering, mathematicsand science.It was a prestigious assignment, and one that Whitman eventually flunked, intandem with a gradual deterioration of his mental state. He lost hisscholarship, and had to report to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina in February1963. He was court-martialed in November for an assault on another Marine, andhis fiancée showed up for the trial. She thought she had become pregnant thenight of November 23, 1963—according to Whitman’s journal—but it was a falsealarm. It is interesting to note the similarities between Whitman’s career andthe American political experience of the time. Whitman, a Marine, is stationedin Cuba at the time of the Castro revolution; Lee Harvey Oswald, another Marineon active duty the same time as Whitman, is tested in Russian in February of1959, but is released from active duty on September 11, 1959 before Whitmanarrives in Cuba. Oswald (who would eventually campaign for the Fair Play forCuba Committee) will renounce his American citizenship in Moscow on October 31,1959 (Halloween).Oswald, either a very poor Marine or a deep-cover intelligence asset dependingon whom you believe, is accused of assassinating President Kennedy on November22, 1963 from the Texas Schoolbook Depository in Dallas, Texas using a poorlymade sniper’s rifle. The following night, Marine Charles Whitman is having sexwith his fiancée while awaiting a court martial, an act the fiancée laterbelieves to have impregnated her. The following day, Oswald is killed by JackRuby.Three years later, on August 1, 1966, Charles Whitman becomes the secondex-Marine accused of sniping at people from a high place in Texas, after firstmurdering his wife and mother the previous evening. All of this would just beinteresting and perhaps even ironic, were it not for a book that had beenpublished a few years earlier describing the same scenario: Open Square.Like the Maeterlinck play that prefigured the Kennedy assassination in Dallas,this paperback thriller by Ford Clark prefigures the Texas Tower case. It tellsthe story of Ted Weeks, a student and a psychotic, who climbs a tower in aMidwestern university town and begins shooting at random targets below.The definitive story of Charles Whitman, A Sniper In The Tower: The CharlesWhitman Murders, by Gary M. Lavergne, has this to say about the startlingsimilarities between Clark’s novel and the real-life events that unfolded a fewyears later:… the sniper’s nest had food; Weeks had an overly loving mother and aperfectionist for a father; he could not live up to the expectations of hisfather; he was trained to shoot in the military (ROTC); he hauled his suppliesin a suitcase, the contents of which included water, gasoline, and five hundredrounds of ammunition; and he used ventilation slits as portholes to firethrough. Astoundingly, the fictitious sniper Ted Weeks was killed by a policeforce headed by a “Chief Miles.”14In other words, the details of the fictional sniper matched perfectly those ofthe real sniper, even down to the name of the chief of police which, in thereal-life case was Chief Robert Miles.Of course, efforts were made to discover whether or not Whitman had read theClark novel. No copy of the novel was found in his home after the shootings; noone could remember him ever reading it, or mentioning it. He had not taken itout of the library. It was not a well-known book, not a bestseller likely tohave been on everyone’s nightstand. In fact, Whitman is said to have looked atthe tower years earlier—perhaps even earlier than the book’s publication—andremarked that one could “hold off an army” from up there.15 And, anyway, Whitmancould not have arranged for the chief of police to be named Miles.So, it was “just one of those things.”A coincidence, however, is frequently a glimpse of a pattern otherwise hidden.His heart tells him indisputably what his mind resists: This is no random event,but part of the elaborate design in a tapestry, and at the center of the designis he himself, caught and murdered.—Dean Koontz16To return to Terry’s cult calendar analysis, 17it shows that he arrived atsimilar conclusions where dates of cult significance are concerned, but used fartoo much leeway in his calculations, thus opening himself up to criticism fromthose who study occultism seriously.For instance, he mentions the October 23 shooting and links it to Halloween, aconclusion I think is too far-fetched, as Halloween is over a week later. Wecan’t use more than a day or so on either side of a specific date to showrelevance, I believe, otherwise virtually any date you would care to mention isclose enough to a cult “holiday.” November 27 he links to November 30 (St.Andrew’s Eve) and a date that does not seem to have any significance taken thatway, but which does link successfully with December 1, the date of Crowley’sdeath which he does not mention. As November 27 fell on a Saturday, it mayindeed have been used as the closest weekend date to December 1, if our cultistswere constrained to use weekends for hits for the most part due to day jobs orother obligations, or perhaps the convenience of using the weekend as it wouldbe a time when their targets would be out late at night. He also refers, on thesame page, to December 21 as St. Thomas’ Day, a “satanic feast”; I believe hereally wants to point out the significance of the winter solstice rather than asaint’s day. The one that puzzles Terry most of all—as it does me—is theVirginia Voskerichian homicide of March 8, which seems to be the one anomalousshooting of all, even taking into consideration lunar phases; further, it tookplace on a Tuesday rather than a weekend, and much earlier in the evening—7:30P.m.—than the other homicides, which all took place between midnight and 3:00A.m. Terry’s partner in the investigation opines that it might have been thecult leader’s birthday, but that does not account for the early evening shootingunless it was timed specifically to coincide with other data (such as theputative cult leader’s birth time) to which we have no access.A search of my records and a large timeline developed for the purpose oftracking these events has revealed virtually nothing of significance for March 8in any era. However, March 8, 1990 was chosen as the date of the first New YorkCity “Zodiac” murder; the fourth and last New York City “Zodiac” killing was onJune 21 that year: the summer solstice. It is possible that the March 8 date wasselected deliberately to reinforce a link with the Son of Sam attack onVoskerichian, but there is no evidence to support this, either. Thus, the March8 date remains a mystery.There are other resonances to the “occult calendar,” however, and these may beof interest to some readers:Candlemas—1/31/1865: the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution is passed,abolishing slavery in the United States.1/30/1933: Adolf Hitler seizes power in Germany.1/31/1958: America’s first satellite, Explorer I, built and controlled bythe Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovers the Van Allen Belt; the American spaceage begins.1/30/1972: “Bloody Sunday,” the massacre of 13 marchers in Derry, NorthernIreland by British troops during a protest of Unionist rule.1/31/1976: George H.W. Bush becomes Director of the CIA.Vernal Equinox—3/21/1973: The George Stano serial killings begin,in Gainesville, FL (thus giving more support to a cult calendar theory).Beltane—5/1/1960: Francis Gary Powers shot down over the USSR.Summer Solstice—6/21/1972: the date of the famous 18 ½ minute gap on the NixonOval Office tapes, giving rise to the suspicion of “sinister forces.”6/21/1975: Self-proclaimed satanist Michael Aquino is visited by the Egyptiandeity Set during an occult ritual, giving birth to the Temple of Set.6/22/1979: the Susan Reinert “Mainline” murders in Philadelphia, believed tohave been part of a satanic sacrifice.Lammas—8/1/1914: Germany mobilizes against Russia; World War I begins.7/29/1921: The Council on Foreign Relations incorporated in New York.7/29/1958: NASA created.7/31/1980: The children of slain Congressman Leo J. Ryan file suit against theUS government over the Jonestown murders.Crowleymas—10/12/1962: Lee Harvey Oswald gets a job at Jaggers-Chiles-Stovall, acompany whose name has Thelemic resonances.10/12/1964: Mary Pinchot Meyer, confidant of John F. Kennedy and Timothy Leary,is murdered in Washington, DC.10/13/1968: Clida Delaney and Nancy Warren are murdered near Ukiah, California,believed to have been the work of the Manson Family.10/12/1979: Doreen Levesque murdered by Carl Drew in Fall River, MA as part of acult sacrifice10/12/1988: Patricia Ann Cantero murdered by her son, Jonathan, in Tampa, FL aspart of a satanic ritualA note to the first entry, the passing of the anti-slavery amendment to the USConstitution on January 31, 1865: General Lee of the Confederacy surrendered toGeneral Grant at Appomattox on Palm Sunday, 1865, thus ending the Civil War;President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated less than a week later, on GoodFriday, by an actor in a theater. It was as if America was acting out its ownversion of the Passion Play, with Lincoln as Christ. It is no wonder, then, thatso many parallels would be found between Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy, andthat their deaths would be elevated to the status of iconic events in the eyesof many observers. On the other hand, perhaps the driving force of some otherintelligence below the conscious threshold of the American psyche manipulatesthese events, and their ancillary coincidences and correspondences may be theevidence of this arcane activity.As can be seen from the above, very small sampling, a number of occult murdersand serial killings were begun or committed on important dates on the cultcalendar, many more than Maury Terry was aware of when he wrote The UltimateEvil. The dates with political overtones were included only to show how politicsand the occult intermingle and to stimulate further research (if warranted), aswell as to show how easily conspiracy theories can spin out of control.A DIFFERENT WAVE LENGTHMurder is a recent interest of mine.—David Berkowitz18David Richard Berkowitz was born on June 1, 1953 in Brooklyn, New York. He wasconceived in a parked car, the natural child of Betty Broder of Brooklyn andJoseph Klineman of Long Island, a married man who was having an affair with Ms.Broder. Ms. Broder herself had been married before, to a Tony Falco, who lefther. On David Berkowitz’ adoption papers, it is Tony Falco’s name that appearsas the natural father, even though it was Joseph Klineman who was responsible.Betty Broder had a daughter, Roslyn, with Falco: David Berkowitz’ half-sister.Both Joseph Klineman and Betty Broder were Jewish.“Richard David Falco” (to give David Berkowitz his name as it appears in theadoption records) was then adopted by Nathan and Pearl Berkowitz, who lived onStratford Avenue in the Soundview section of the Bronx. Nathan Berkowitz had ahardware store on Melrose Avenue in the Bronx. They renamed the baby DavidRichard Berkowitz and everything seemed to be fine until October 1967, whenPearl Berkowitz died of cancer. David was fourteen years old.Late in 1969, David and his father moved to Co-Op City in the Bronx, a house indevelopment that was just being completed and touted as one of the largest inthe world at the time, with its own shopping center, movie theater, etc. DavidBerkowitz enrolled in Christopher Columbus High School that year. He wassixteen.The following year, he joined the Auxiliary Police force of the New York PoliceDepartment, out of the 45th Precinct in the Bronx. The Auxiliary Police force(to which the author belonged for a while in the summer of 1980) is a civilianpatrol unit, a separate division of NYPD that helps the regular police monitorneighborhood activity, help out in directing traffic at public events, andgenerally make an appearance as the “eyes and ears” of the police department.They dress in standard NYPD uniforms, carry a baton (a nightstick), and adistinctive shield (badge). They carry radios but are not authorized to carryfirearms. They are not peace officers per se, but assist the police inday-to-day activities, usually in the evenings or on weekends, since most of thecivilian police—or APO’s (Auxiliary Police Officers) as they are known—eitherhave day jobs or are, like David, busy at school. David joined the volunteerfire department at Co-Op City, which is ironic (or cynical) considering hispenchant for committing arson.Around this time, his adopted father Nathan married Julia, a woman who hadchildren of her own from a previous marriage. One of these children, David’sstepsister, is a witch of some description, and taught David about the occult.He graduated from Columbus High School in June of 1971, and immediately enlistedin the Army.This was deep into the Vietnam conflict, when many young men were looking forways to avoid service. Berkowitz, however, had spent time in uniform as an APOand as a volunteer fireman. Restless, he is a joiner, seemingly trying tocompensate for an imagined flaw. He will spend the rest of his life in one kindof uniform after another, as he moves from the Army to work as a security guardand finally as a mailman, at which point he is arrested for the Son of Samkillings and begins wearing a prison uniform.In the Army, Berkowitz is stationed not in Vietnam but in Korea, spending a yearthere and taking LSD during his tour. Not much is known about his life in theArmy at this point, only that after his hitch in Korea he is transferred to FortKnox, Kentucky in January 1973.This is where David Berkowitz goes off the rails.Although Berkowitz is Jewish—his adoptive parents are Jewish, his naturalparents are Jewish—David suddenly becomes a Christian upon his return fromKorea. While stationed at Fort Knox—the site of the nation’s heavily-guardedgold repository—he begins attending the Beth Haven Baptist Church in Louisvilleand becomes a fanatic Christian. He tries to convert both civilian and militarypersonnel, even preaching (à la Jim Jones in Indiana) on street corners. Again,there is insufficient data to make any kind of assumption here about whatmotivated Berkowitz to become religious, much less Christian. Did it havesomething to do with his discovery that he was adopted? Did the LSD he took inKorea have anything to do with this sudden spiritual awakening?In June 1974 he is discharged from the Army and moves back to the Bronx, to 2161Barnes Avenue, and enrolls in Bronx Community College. At the same time, he getsa job as a security guard for IBI Security, working in Manhattan.Arlis Perry is murdered in California on October 12, 1974.Early in 1975, his adoptive father, Nathan and Nathan’s wife Julia leave theBronx and move to Boynton Beach, Florida. David’s stepsister—the would-bewitch—decamps for a commune in California. In April 1975, Saigon falls to theCommunists.In May, David Berkowitz takes an important personal step. He joins ALMA, theAdoptees Liberty Movement Association, in an effort to come to terms with hisadopted status, something that has obviously been bothering him. That Mother’sDay, he sends a card to his natural mother, Betty Falco. This leads to anemotional meeting with her, during which he discovers that she has remarried (toa man named Leo). More disturbing to David is the fact that she reveals he wasborn illegitimately and moreover that she has other children she has notabandoned. This must contribute to seeing himself as worthless and unwanted.Thus begins a strange odyssey with so many false starts and red herrings that weare forced to sit back and wonder at what was really going on.In February of 1976, Berkowitz moves to New Rochelle from the Bronx, to anapartment that is much farther away from both his college and his job and whichis more expensive. No one knows why he does this. It makes no sense. Theapartment was only advertised in a local Westchester newspaper, not somethingBerkowitz would have normally seen in the course of his days in the Bronx andManhattan. It is in a private home owned by one Jack Cassara. At that time,Cassara is working at the Neptune Moving Company in New Rochelle. One of hisco-workers is Fred Cowan, a neo-Nazi who would go amok and, during a siege atthe moving company, kill six people before killing himself on Valentine’s Day1977. Later, clippings would be found in Berkowitz’ Yonkers apartment coveringthe Cowan case in detail. Berkowitz would refer to Cowan as “one of the Sons.”19Later, during a court-ordered interrogation in October 1978, Berkowitz wouldreveal that he knew Cowan personally. He obviously knew Cowan’s co-worker, JackCassara.20Then, the following month, he applies for an apartment in Yonkers, on the otherside of New York from New Rochelle, at 35 Pine Street, even though he has aone-year lease with the Cassaras that is only a month old. Again, why?In April 1976, he moves to 35 Pine Street. Again, this move makes no sense forsomeone working and studying in the Bronx. Not only is the time it takes tocommute a factor, but also the additional cost of commuting; plus, the rent isone hundred dollars more a month than the original place he had in the Bronx.One hundred “1976” dollars. This is the apartment where he would eventually bearrested on August 10, 1977.On May 13, 1976, the house of a Yonkers neighbor is firebombed, part of apattern of firebombings in the area.In June 1976, Berkowitz travels to Florida to visit his father, and then driveson to Houston, Texas to visit an Army buddy—Billy Dan Parker—who buys him the.44 Bulldog revolver that was used in at least some of the Son of Sam shootings.Outside of Houston, in the town of Beaumont, lives the ex-wife of John Carr.Beaumont is also believed to be a cult center, one referred to by serial killerHenry Lee Lucas.He returns to the Bronx and gets a job as a cabdriver in Co-Op City, making thelong commute from Yonkers every day.On July 29, 1976 the first Son of Sam shooting takes place.Maury Terry’s thesis is that the Son of Sam killings were committed by more thanone person, and that David Berkowitz was only one of perhaps as many as threedifferent shooters. Based on that theory—and it is a good one, and fits theeyewitness evidence as well as a lot of circumstantial clues—there was aconspiracy to commit these murders. Of what was this conspiracy composed?When Berkowitz was finally arrested for the crimes on August 10, 1977 (for thosefollowing this sort of thing, the anniversary of the La Bianca killings in 1969)he pled guilty, thus avoiding a trial. This had happened before, of course, suchas in the cases of accused Martin Luther King assassin James Earl Ray and JohnLennon assassin Mark David Chapman. I don’t want to elevate David Berkowitz tothe same level as a political assassin, but will only point out that when thepublic is deprived of the right to see the evidence laid out in a trial, thepublic is similarly robbed of a chance to understand the crime and to benefitfrom the investigative resources of a defense team which might uncover a deeper,darker truth. I believe this is something which we should not allow to happenwhen a case is as important as a political assassination, or a serial murderspree that held a major city hostage for more than a year.When the Sam killings were taking place, and the taunting letters received andprinted in the newspapers, many of us New Yorkers were convinced at the timethat more than one shooter was involved. The timing of the murders was verysuggestive of more than one killer, and the various eyewitness descriptions ofthe shooters were so different that it naturally raised a lot of speculationabout multiple killers. But this had not been experienced before in the UnitedStates: a group of murderers carrying out seemingly pointless and randomhomicides. It was easier to believe that one, crazed gunman was responsible. So,when Berkowitz was arrested and pled guilty, the entire case was swept under arug. And there it stayed for quite some time.But an examination of the letters sent by the Son of Sam killer(s) pointed toother connections, and more correspondence both from Berkowitz himself and fromother convicts began to reveal a strange set of correspondences between the Sonof Sam killings and murders taking place as far away as California and as longago as 1969. And when Berkowitz associates wound up dying violently all over theUnited States after Berkowitz was in prison and could not conceivably havecommitted these additional killings himself, alarm bells began to go off. Inaddition, the very bookstore to which Terry refers several times in his book asbeing a central meeting place for members of this murderous cult was the samebookstore around which the author and several of his friends congregated fromtime to time during the Son of Sam killings, a store rapidly becoming notoriousas a kind of occult clearing house for pagans, witches, satanists, magicians,and assorted other fringe religionists.It is possible that Terry jumped to a lot of conclusions in the Son of Sam case,and that some of his theories about a proposed network of satanic killers are alittle thin. It is also more than likely that some of the felons (includingBerkowitz) who confided in him, telling tall tales of cult rituals in themoonlight replete with the sacrifice of dogs and humans, were doing so forulterior motives or just having fun at Terry’s expense. However, a few pieces ofevidence militate against this point of view.In the first place, Berkowitz has absolutely nothing to gain by spreadingstories of a murderous cult to which he claimed to belong, and by admitting thathe committed some of the killings but not all. That he is a self-confessedmurderer is beyond doubt, and he does not try to backpedal from that fact.Berkowitz is in prison for life, and he knows it. There is no possibility ofparole for David Berkowitz. His much-publicized conversion to Christianity (are-conversion, actually, considering his activities in Kentucky a few yearsbefore the murders) does not buy him any time outside his prison walls. He hashis own Web site now, and tries to impart uplifting spiritual messages via thatmedium, tranquilly acknowledging that he was a murderer who will never seefreedom, who is only interested in being an example of redemption for otherfelons like him, as well as for those on the “outside.” He cannot gainfinancially from any of these activities, for it was because of Berkowitz thatwe have the famous “Son of Sam laws” that forbid a convicted felon frombenefiting from his crimes by selling the rights to a book publisher or movieproducer, etc. Thus, he has no ulterior motive that we can see for finallycoming forward and telling Maury Terry that he belonged to a satanic cult thatwas a splinter group of the Process, and that there were links between his groupand the Charles Manson Family.In the second place, the letters Terry received contained much internal evidenceto suggest that his correspondents knew more about various other murderscommitted around the country than could be gleaned from newspaper reports. Thisincludes Berkowitz, but also other inmates and other informants who claimed tohave befriended Berkowitz inside, and who had heard of substantiating evidencethat could be checked by Terry and other investigators.Where Terry is on shakier ground is his analysis of occultism and the activitiesof various cults and secret societies. His background in this field comesstrictly from a handful of very poorly-composed occult books designed forpopular audiences that were themselves written by people with very little directknowledge. This has happened to many investigators, of course, who come uponoccultism for the first time and have their eyes opened wide at this strangedemimonde in their own communities, and thus begin to believe everything theyread on the subject, growing more and more nervous with each purple page ofsensationalist prose, not realizing that the reality behind most of whatcomprises the modern manifestation of occultism is usually a lot less excitingand a lot more tawdry, about one step up from the standard established by StarTrek conventions, but minus the sophistication. Thus, it is possible forTerry—in The Ultimate Evil—to confuse the Golden Dawn with satanism, or the OTOwith the Process, etc. Although we can easily show a “line of succession”leading from the Golden Dawn to Aleister Crowley, and from Crowley to the OTOand from the OTO to Scientology, and from Scientology to the Process Church ofthe Final Judgement, and eventually from there to Charles Manson, the so-called“Solar Lodge of the OTO,” and even cult killers such as Clifford St. Joseph andothers, we certainly don’t have enough to show a deliberate conspiracy on thepart of all these organizations in the Son of Sam case, and certainly not enoughfor calling all of these groups “satanic” or “murderous.” Perhaps, from a verynarrow Fundamentalist Christian point of view, Terry could be forgiven formaking these assumptions, because to a Fundamentalist anything smacking of theoccult is automatically from the Devil and satanic. This includes rock music,homosexuals, prime time television and your daily horoscope. All the evidenceshows, however, that Terry is not a Fundamentalist Christian with an axe togrind against alternative religions, so we have to be a bit more selective andastute when it comes to investigating the occult aspect of the Son of Sam case,and this is what we mean to do, armed with such evidence as is available andbeyond doubt. It will take us back to Charles Manson, and ahead to Manson II anda nexus of drugs, rituals, pornography, prostitution, and politics in lowplaces. It will help reveal the Manson Secret.RETURN OF THE PROCESSYour process is all fucked up!— Brad Pitt to Bruce Willis in The Twelve MonkeysThere are other Sons out there—God help the world.— David Berkowitz21A key element in Terry’s thesis is that the Process Church of the FinalJudgement is alive and well, and involved in nefarious activity stretching fromdrug-running to child prostitution to murder. This was also asserted in EdSanders’ study of the Manson Family, The Family. Sanders was successfully sued(in the United States) and references to both the Process and the OTO—soprevalent in the first edition of his book—were expunged by the time the bookwas republished. (This was not so in the United Kingdom, where the courtsdecided in favor of the publisher and author.) However, Terry recounts in TheUltimate Evil his discussions with Sanders concerning these cults. Terry makesno bones about mentioning both the Process and the OTO in The Ultimate Evil, andhas evidently resisted any legal attempts to get him to change his story.What initially bothered Terry about the Process was the appearance in one oftheir issues (the “Death” issue) of an article written by Charles Manson.Critics of the Terry thesis have scoffed at this, saying that such persons asMarianne Faithfull and Salvador Dali also appeared in the Process magazine; myreaction is simply this, however: what was Charles Manson doing in such augustcompany? Further, Marianne Faithfull (as we have seen) had a long associationwith occultists of the Crowley dispensation through her relationship withKenneth Anger. Dali himself was very involved in occultism, was well-known inseveral occult milieus, and his paintings—true to his reputation as asurrealist—reveal many occult and alchemical themes. There is a certain culturalor spiritual consistency to those who graced the pages of the Process magazine,and to dismiss Manson’s appearance there as of little import is to be quitenaïve. Further, as we have already learned, Manson told prosecutor Bugliosi thathe and Robert Moore (the founder of the Process) were “the same.” In addition,members of the Process on a mysterious mission visited Manson in prison afterhis arrest for the Tate/La Bianca killings, after which he no longer referred tothe Process in any way. It is doubtful that Manson would have been worried abouta lawsuit for slander, so we have to assume that something more was at stake.In addition, we also have the visits by Manson Family member Bruce Davis toEngland on at least two occasions; as discussed in Book I, the British policeagencies identified Davis as visiting the Scientologists and/or the Process oneach visit. In fact, we also have the murders of former Scientologists inEngland at this time, members connected with the Manson Family and, as we willsee, yet another Scientologist was killed, this time in connection with the Sonof Sam case.That there was a connection—however tenuous one believes it to be—between Mansonand the Process is known and documented, even in the Process’ own publication.The neo-gnostic theology of the Process would have appealed to Manson, extollingas it does both Jesus and Satan—Manson thought he was both, anyway.The next step is to find any relation at all between David Berkowitz, the Son ofSam murders, and the Process. If this can be done, then we have left the realmof pure speculation and have entered the world of logical possibility.Let’s begin with the dogs.For some reason, there have been reports of sacrifices of large numbers of dogs,mostly German shepherds, throughout the United States in the past thirty-oddyears, but notably in areas where we discover confirmed cult activity. This wasas true in Berkowitz’ Yonkers neighborhood as it was in Walden, New York, wherea “total of eighty-five skinned German shepherds and Dobermans were found” in asingle year “between October 1976 and October 1977.”22 The day after Berkowitz’arrest in Yonkers, the bodies of three slain German shepherds were found in anaqueduct behind his apartment. Two had been strangled with chains; the third hadbeen shot in the head.Two days before his arrest, someone phoned an animal shelter using his name andaddress, inquiring about adopting a German shepherd that had been advertised ina local paper. A few hours later, someone else called from the same street inYonkers, also inquiring about the dog. This caller said he was “fixing somecars” on Pine Street; an allusion that Terry believes actually refers to theCarr family who figure so prominently in this case.23 As it turned out, two mendid visit the shelter, including one who resembled Berkowitz, but according toBerkowitz himself it was not he, although he acknowledges that someone may havebeen impersonating him on the phone.Why? This was before his arrest and identification in the press as the Son ofSam.Remember that serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer’s first “kill” was the ritualslaughter of a dog behind his home in Ohio, which culminated in his placing thedog’s skull atop a stake hammered into the earth; and, around the time of theSam killings, the author heard convincing rumors of the abuse and slaughter ofdogs in a warehouse near Brooklyn Heights, within walking distance of theWarlock Shop, before Berkowitz was arrested and the connection with dogs wasmade.Terry connects the German shepherd sacrifices with the Process, due to theirfondness for the animals. Members of the Process in those halcyon days of the1960s were to be seen around San Francisco dressed in black and leadingshepherds on the leash. The “Fear” issue of the Process magazine featured aphoto spread of twenty German shepherds in a menacing pose. It doesn’tautomatically follow, however, that the Process would sacrifice the animals.Another symbolic association that should be mentioned is the fact that Hitlerfavored German shepherds above all other animals. That there might be a Nazi orneo-Nazi element to the Son of Sam cult should not be ignored, especially asmass murderer Fred Cowan—one of the “Sons” according to Berkowitz—was aneo-Nazi. Further, the Process symbol was a stylized swastika: what some membersreferred to as “four P’s”; these “four P’s” later contributed to the name of aProcess splinter group called “Four P” after the same symbol. It was this groupthat remained behind in California after most of the regular Process decampedand went to New York City following the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. FourP—and its reputed leader, the Grand Chingon—has been implicated in a number ofvile acts, including animal and human sacrifice, in northern and southernCalifornia. Convicted serial killer and cannibal Stanley Baker claimed to belongto this cult, and Manson Family members were known to refer to Charles Manson asthe Grand Chingon, even though the organization was supposedly so secret thatits very existence was unknown to all but a few.24The Devil does not exist. It is a false name invented by the Black Brothers toimply a Unity in their ignorant muddle of dispersions. A devil who had unitywould be a God.… It is, however, always easy to call up the demons, for they arealways calling you …—Aleister Crowley25I’d say anybody who worships the devil is not a nice person.—David Berkowitz, court-ordered interrogation, October 26, 197826Aside from the famous statement in letters and in person by Berkowitz that healone committed the Son of Sam murders because he was ordered to do so by SamCarr’s dog—who was actually an ancient demonic force, according toBerkowitz—there was much more in the letters and in documentation found inBerkowitz’ apartment after his arrest to suggest that he was part of a largerorganization. In fact, in his letters to the press, he alludes to some of theseparticipants by name, although his references were not understood at the time.The most important from an investigative point of view was the name of “JohnWheaties,” identified in the letter to Jimmy Breslin as a “Rapist and Suffocaterof Young Girls.” 27It was the investigative work of Terry and his associate (andformer police detective) Jim Mitteager that uncovered the identity of thisperson as John Wheat Carr, a son of Sam Carr of the infamous demonic dog. JohnCarr led to his brother Michael Carr, a high-level Scientologist, and to WheatCarr, their sister who worked for the Yonkers Police Department and who wasmarried to a police officer. In a court-ordered interrogation of David Berkowitzin October 1978 at the Marcy Correctional Institute near Utica, New York,Berkowitz revealed that he hated the Carrs. In that same interrogation, hegrudgingly (almost accidentally, due to clever questioning by a Legal Aid lawyerrepresenting Terry’s associate Mitteager) revealed the existence of the cult towhich he, the Carrs, and probably Fred Cowan belonged.28Critics of these revelations point to the fact that Berkowitz appears not toknow very much about occultism or satanism in this lengthy exchange, oftenquoting lines out of context to prove their point. Anyone reading the entireQ&A, however, will recognize that Berkowitz was being cagey and evasive, even attimes arrogant or flippant, in his answers; the fact that he would admit toknowledge and then take back the admission, and flip-flop like this severaltimes during the interview, eventually breaking down in front of theinterrogators, is more than enough to support the point of view that Berkowitzwas afraid for his life. He was also being “handled” quite effectively by theprison doctor, who, it appears, spoke with him during a lunch break and managedto get Berkowitz to retract everything he had said in the morning, and to refuseto answer any more questions. When this did not work—when Berkowitz eventuallyrelented and began talking again—the interrogation was interrupted by both theaforementioned doctor and a representative of the New York Attorney General’soffice, who ordered that the interrogation be stopped immediately.29 Why thisoccurred is open to a great deal of conjecture, of course. It is possible thatthe authorities did not want the Son of Sam case reopened, as it would make alot of detectives and prosecutors look inept or incompetent when so muchadditional evidence pointing to a conspiracy was revealed. It is also possiblethat the cult to which it is alleged Berkowitz and the Carrs belonged exertedpressure behind the scenes to ensure that Berkowitz—and only Berkowitz—took thefall for the Sam killings.This latter theory does not seem so far-fetched when we consider some furtherfacts.John Wheat Carr, a career member of the Air Force who was discharged for drugrelated offences, died violently on February 16, 1978 at the airbase in Minot,North Dakota, the victim of a shotgun wound to the head. OSI—the Air Force’sinternal police agency—initially determined that the death was a probablehomicide, changing that determination to suicide when the investigation took onnational proportions with inquiries from Westchester County and New York Citypolice departments and prosecutors’ offices. He had been in Yonkers, at SamCarr’s home, only a few days before and unexpectedly flew back to Minot onValentine’s Day, after phoning his girlfriend at the base and telling her thatthe police were after him and things were too hot in New York. John Carr was onthe run, but he never made it. Terry is convinced that Carr was murdered, andthe evidence at the scene certainly points in that direction.The murder of John Carr establishes the fact of conspiracy in the Son of Sammurders; John Carr’s death was the conspirators’ attempt to silence someone whomight conceivably talk to the authorities. Carr had been the subject of amanhunt by police all over New York City and Westchester once it had beenrealized that he was the “John Wheaties” of the Son of Sam letters. If someonekilled John Carr—while David Berkowitz was sitting in prison—then theimplication is that there was at least one more conspirator out there: the onedoing the mopping up. To make matters more interesting, John Carr’s descriptionfit perfectly with eyewitness reports of the Son of Sam killer seen at more thanone crime scene, down to the color of his hair, his build, and hisleft-handedness. Evidence gathered since then shows that Carr was in New YorkCity for at least four of the shootings, even though he lived in Minot, NorthDakota at the time. He was also present in Houston, Texas on June 12, 1976: theday Billy Dan Parker bought the .44 Charter Arms Bulldog for Berkowitz in thatcity.John Carr—who was born on October 12, 1946 (Aleister Crowley’s birthday, asTerry points out)—was interested in the occult. Growing up in Yonkers, he was aschoolmate of Maury Terry in high school, as Terry himself reveals in TheUltimate Evil30—an odd parallel to the fact that this author went to the samehigh school as David Berkowitz. Carr traveled the world with the Air Force,spending time in Thailand and Korea, before returning to the Strategic AirCommand base at Minot. But his involvement with drugs led to his downfall withthe Air Force. He was hospitalized several times for drug overdoses, and wastaking Haldol at the time of his death. Haldol is usually prescribed forpsychiatric disorders.Carr was discharged from the Air Force on October 13, 1976, due to hisdrug-related problems, after twelve years in the military. He, of course, doesnot sound like a sophisticated cult hitman, but then we are not watching aHollywood movie version of a satanic cult. If we posit the existence of a daringgroup of Satan-worshipping killers then the position of John Carr in this groupmust have been relatively the same as that of Berkowitz: they were bothexpendable, sent out to kill specific targets on specific days, bothpsychologically damaged in some way and vulnerable to manipulation by moresophisticated—more motivated—leaders who had done all the planning and whoprobably wrote the famous letters to the press, for it would eventually come outthat Berkowitz did not write them himself. With Berkowitz silent in prison, andthe police onto John Carr’s involvement and looking for him everywhere, thesemysterious leaders only needed to tie up loose ends, beginning with John Carrbut not ending there.While John Carr’s familiarity with the occult is documented in Terry’s book(everything from keeping a list of demons with him to burying dog excrement inthe yards of people he was trying to curse), it receives further confirmationfrom Berkowitz himself, who characterized him as a “devil worshipper” during hisinterrogation at Marcy … oddly enough not including himself in that category.Later, police in the Minot, North Dakota area acknowledged that John Carr was amember of a satanic cult that operated there, that John Carr himself was notonly using drugs but dealing (not an uncommon combination), and that he toldpolice detectives that members of the cult had to drink their leader’s urinefrom a chalice, among other unsavory details. (He had been rousted by the policein October 1976 on a street in Minot for being under the influence of drugs.)Even more importantly, the Minot police agencies knew that Carr and Berkowitzwere acquainted and that both belonged to the same cult, based on voluminoustestimony from friends, including a fellow airman and roommate, Jeffrey Sloat,who eventually had John Carr committed to a mental institution for a while dueto the latter’s strange behavior, which included chanting in an unknown tongueand talking to a picture of Abraham Lincoln. The police involved in theinvestigation in North Dakota forwarded this information to their New York Cityand Westchester County counterparts, and never heard back from them. 31Thedetails on the existence of the cult and the participation of more than oneperson in the so-called Son of Sam murders was deep-sixed by the New Yorkauthorities; in essence, allowing the cult to continue its operation unhindered,possibly even to the present day.In the months leading up to his capture, Berkowitz was engaged in a campaign ofterrorism in his neighborhood designed to get him arrested on lesser chargesbefore he was apprehended for the Son of Sam murders, and before he would beexpected to commit more. He was firebombing houses, shooting dogs, and sendinghate mail to all and sundry … with return addresses that would only point backto him. The inability of the Westchester Sheriff ’s Department and the Yonkerspolice to put all of this together—even when Sam Carr himself walked into apolice station with the evidence long before the last two Son of Samattacks—drove Berkowitz crazy. He wanted to be taken off the streets before morepeople were killed; rather than simply walking into a police station and saying,“I’m the Son of Sam,” he preferred to be picked up on lesser charges so thatwhen the next Sam killing took place he would have an alibi, and the attentionwould drift away from him (if, indeed, it would ever focus on him in the firstplace). That was his plan. But it was not working.Shortly before his arrest, he scouted another murder site, this time on LongIsland. Feeling the pressure of another upcoming murder, and knowing it was onlya matter of time before the police analyzed the parking tickets issued at thetime and place of the Stacy Moskowitz killing, he placed a rifle in his car infull view and a Sam letter in the glove compartment. His apartment had beencleaned out a week or so earlier, and most of his furniture and an expensivestereo set purchased in Korea had been left in front of a Salvation Armystorefront. He then proceeded to decorate the walls with weird writing in MagicMarker, making references to “the children” and “the little ones” becomingmurderers. And he sat and waited for the cops to show up.After his arrest, he would eventually be interviewed by Dr. David Abrahamson, todetermine if he was mentally fit to stand trial. Abrahamson wrote a book aboutthe experience, entitled Confessions of Son of Sam and published in 1985. Inthis book, we learn that Berkowitz recognized Abrahamson when they were firstintroduced, as he had read Abrahamson’s The Murdering Mind prior to his arrest!He also read a number of books about murderers such as Richard Speck and NathanLeopold that he took out of the Yonkers Public Library, telling the doctor,“Murder is a recent interest of mine.”32In the same book, we find a poem written by Berkowitz as the killings werebeginning, entitled “Mother of Satan” and dated September 22, 1976: the autumnalequinox and one of the Quarter Days. It reads (with the original spelling):Old Mother HubbardSitting near the cubbardwith a hand grenadeunder the oatmeal. Who will you kill nowDaughter of Satan? In the image of theVirgin Mary—pure and innocentThe Great Impersonator—Is that you? “Yes.”How many have you decieved—lured to slaughter like a fat cow?33 The first stanza is compelling, humorous and well-written, despite themisspelling of “cupboard” unless, of course, the misspelling was intentional andyet another piece of coded information. Also, in the earliest versions of“Mother Hubbard” we find that her dog is her master.But one cannot help wondering if Berkowitz wrote this with a specific person inmind, someone from the cult. Someone, a woman, “in the image of the Virgin Mary”and a “Great Impersonator,” who deceived many and lured them to slaughter “likea fat cow,” is also the “Daughter of Satan.” A woman, rumored to belong to thecult, was present at some of the Sam killings according to eyewitnesses. Wasthis another gofer of the cult, or someone more important?Abrahamson, however, did not address himself to the idea of a cult behind themurders. He was only concerned with Berkowitz’ mental state, as far as thecourts asked for his opinion. Berkowitz was given a battery of tests, includingthe MMPI, and Abrahamson came back with the following diagnosis:Clinical scales indicated pathological elevations regarding the followingscales: schizophrenia; paranoia; psychopathic deviation; depression; hypomania;psychasthenia and social introversion.34Abrahamson also reveals that Berkowitz lay claim to setting numerous fires inthe years 1974–77. We know he firebombed his neighbors’ homes in the monthsleading to his arrest, but that was for a specific purpose: to get himselfarrested. Abrahamson reveals a much longer career as an arsonist, however,beginning on May 13, 1974 with a rubbish fire set in the area of Co-Op City.This is odd, since supposedly Berkowitz was still in the Army at the time,stationed in Kentucky.Then, Abrahamson says that Berkowitz had a detailed list of the fires he set, atotal of 1,411 fires from 1974 until his arrest in 1977; the list includes thedate, time, street, borough, weather, firebox number and Fire Department code.35This incredible assertion is nowhere else mentioned in connection with Berkowitzand the Son of Sam case, and the sheer number of fires beggars belief. 1,411fires in three years? Anyone doing the math will realize that means he setroughly 1.25 fires per day, every day, for that period … and was never caught.Further, Berkowitz states that he committed no arsons in the period December 25,1974 to June 6, 1975 (this was the period when he was searching for his birthmother). So, he had to have committed 1.50 fires per day in the time available.One senses that Berkowitz was having some fun with Dr. Abrahamson; either that,or the 1,411 fires were the total of a group effort and not Berkowitz actingalone.Another startling revelation from Abrahamson’s book is the acknowledgment byBerkowitz that he attacked a young, fourteen-year-old girl on Christmas Eve 1975between 10:30 and 11:00 P.M. on Baychester Avenue in the Co-Op City area of theBronx. This was done with a 3-1/2 inch long hunting knife and, according toBerkowitz, he stabbed her repeatedly but she survived. If true, this would bethe only attack by Berkowitz that did not involve a .44 Charter Arms Bulldogrevolver.The problem I have with this information stems from a telling revelation at thevery beginning of the book: that Berkowitz had read Abrahamson’s text on TheMurdering Mind long before he met the doctor, and that he had also studiedRichard Speck and other murderers. He may have gleaned from these texts theclassic symptoms of the serial killer: beginning with arson, graduating to adisordered attack (the Christmas Eve assault on the young girl) and from thereto a more orderly, more sophisticated pattern of murder.The fact that we have a growing mountain of evidence—including eyewitnesstestimony, circumstantial evidence, and crime scene evidence—that point to aconspiracy in the Son of Sam murders strongly implies that they were not thework of a lone serial killer at all, and that Berkowitz was simply tailoring hisstory to fit what he knew Abrahamson’s assumptions would be. It is interestingthat in his discussions with the doctor he did not abandon his “Son of Sam”story, replete with demon-possessed dog, which since then has been acknowledgedto be a fabrication designed by Berkowitz to insure himself an insanity plea.There were dogs, there was a Sam Carr, and there were devil worshippers,however. It’s just that Berkowitz used the literal interpretation of the Samletters to convince the doctors that he was insane.On July 10, 1979, David Berkowitz was attacked by a fellow inmate, his throatslashed, but he survived.A few weeks later, a friend of his was shot to death in his apartment inFlushing, Queens. Howard Weiss was a fellow member of the police auxiliary unitin Co-Op City to which Berkowitz and another colleague, a former Yonkers policeofficer who is not identified in Terry’s book except for a pseudonym, belonged.These three men had attended a wedding of a friend in Maryland in 1976, beforethe Son of Sam killings began: a wedding that was captured on videotape, showingall three men present. Another link between them was the fact that the Yonkerspolice officer knew the Carrs, and that all three men were known to have owned.44 Charter Arms Bulldog revolvers.36 Sources would confirm that all three men(as well as the Carrs and many others) belonged to the same cult, and were eveninvolved in multiple arson attacks—thus confirming the author’s suspicion thatthe fires Berkowitz claimed he set were, in reality, set by more than oneperson—but these sources are not identified in Terry’s book, and nothing moreabout them is known. Regardless of this nagging problem, the fact thatBerkowitz’ friends begin dying (violently) all over the place is enough to giveone pause. Like all those violent deaths that surround the Kennedy assassinationand its aftermath, it points to the existence of a powerful conspiracy. (Shouldthese deaths be unconnected to each other in any way, however, then we arelooking at a different phenomenon entirely, and one that cannot be explainedaway by pious invocations of “coincidence.”)In the background of all of these killings, Terry and a few of his contacts inlaw enforcement began to search strenuously for links between John Carr andDavid Berkowitz in an effort to understand how these two men would have knowneach other and influenced each other. With Berkowitz in prison and John Carrmurdered in North Dakota, it seemed more urgent than ever to uncover otherfriends and associates common to these two men.When they spoke by phone to Minot, North Dakota law enforcement they wereshocked to learn that Minot knew all along about John Carr’s occult involvementsas well as the existence of a cult in Minot that, among other things, sacrificedGerman shepherds. Terry and another investigator, NYPD detective Harry Cinotti,flew to Minot to discover for themselves what the cult is like, who are itsmembers, and what is its murderous agenda. Cinotti is a strange character;although a police officer he is also a very religious, very Roman Catholic,devotee of a woman of local Queens celebrity, Veronica Leukens, who channels theVirgin Mother every year at a gathering in Flushing Meadows and has a devotedfollowing. Cinotti is the Van Helsing in this case, a man who one suspectstravels with crucifixes, holy water, and a set of wooden stakes packed next tohis service revolver and shield. On an expedition one evening to the strangelybeautiful Untermyer Park in Yonkers where cult activity was known to takeplace—cult activity connected with Berkowitz and the slaughtered Germanshepherds—Cinotti prepared his fellow investigators with spiritual advice on howto protect oneself against the dark forces of Hell, thus both alienating andfreaking out his fellows in equal measure.Once in Minot, a town less than a hundred miles from the Canadian border andabout a hundred miles from Bismark (and fifty miles from the edge of nowhere),Terry and Cinotti met the local law enforcement personnel and learned about JohnCarr’s cult in disturbing detail. Several members of the cult wereidentified—some of whom would die violently before the investigationconcluded—and some were interviewed for background on John Carr and DavidBerkowitz. There were many confirmations of the Carr/Berkowitz relationship, andan equal number of confirmations concerning John Carr’s involvement in theoccult, including a blatant admission from his own sister back in Yonkers.Cult involvement per se is no reason to get excited. Defining what a cult is andisn’t has kept theologians, historians of religion, psychologists and evencriminologists busy for years. In addition, there are many relatively benignalternative religious organizations in the United States and abroad that mayqualify as someone’s idea of a cult, but which do not engage in anythingremotely nefarious. The problem with the putative Son of Sam cult is thatevidence began to mount that it was a cover for drug-running, childprostitution, pornography and murder-for-hire. The circumstantial links to theProcess are what made Terry take special notice that what he was investigatingmight turn out to be a very sophisticated, very well-managed criminal enterprisethat spanned the globe; moreover, one in which devil worship comprised theorganization’s “mission statement.”Why should this be a special problem?Criminal organizations are businesses like any other. They sell a product orservice, and exist for profit. What makes them criminal is the product orservice they offer: drugs, guns, or sex, for instance. Otherwise, though, theyare usually rational groups of like-minded individuals who understand the worldin terms of cause and effect, and moreover who are willing to go to extremes todefend their business from competitors. Extremes like murder. Because they areinvolved in trade in illegal commodities, they are vulnerable to more thanmarket forces. They are also vulnerable to law enforcement agencies, makingtheir business more complicated and more difficult to manage and defend.Therefore, the type of person who becomes involved in criminal enterprises hasalready placed himself outside the social milieu in which the rest of us live,and experiences life in a more desperate, more emotionally-charged way than wedo. Although we may take advantage of the products and services offered by thecriminal organization from time to time—and thereby support the criminals withour own, honestly earned, money—we do not murder our competitors, or steal frombanks and armored cars, or fence stolen property, or deal drugs or guns or rentour bodies for sex. Thus, we can go to church on Sunday feeling suitablyredeemable from our petty sins, sheep who have strayed perhaps, but who arenonetheless members of the flock. Not so the criminal.Criminals have seen life the way police officers do: from the bottom, up. Theysee life the way it really is, behind closed doors. They know the weaknesses oftheir fellow humans, because they cater to them. They know the judge with agambling problem, or the priest who prefers sex with underage boys. They seebeyond the façade of society, and what they discover is no more elevated orspiritual than their own, tawdry, experience has taught them. The criminal feelsthat he or she is a realist, is in fact honest because he or she does notdisguise the fact of belonging to a race of beings that is inherently … evil. Toa criminal, nothing is beautiful, nothing is innocent, nothing is pure. Thepriest at Mass is a pederast, a bigot, a hypocrite. The same hands that touchthe sacred Wafer, transforming bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ,had just last night touched the genitals of an altar boy in the sacristy. “Wherewas Jesus?” the criminal laughs.The criminal, then, is a satanist. The criminal respects only power and the onlypowerful person the criminal respects is the one that demonstrates that power ona regular basis. The Mafia chieftain ordering the death of a subordinate, thepimp beating the reluctant or lazy prostitute, the drug dealer wiping out acompetitor. To a criminal, murder is the ultimate demonstration and exercise ofpower; in a way, then, the criminal worships the one who dispenses death andfear.To the criminal, sex is a commodity and there is no love to redeem it. Thecriminal respects lust. Everything else is a romance novel, suitable forchildren (those he has not already corrupted). Women are inferior beings,dangerous at times, but like children should be seen and not heard.Drugs are for the weak, a product to enslave the masses and take their money.Gradually, we can understand the attraction Satanism would have for a criminal.Not that the criminal himself would be a pious Satanist, spending hard-earnedmoney on building chapels devoted to Hell; but he would understand that devotionto Satan would lead automatically to an acceptance of the criminal’s lifestyleand perspective. The Satanic perspective would allow and encourage drug use, alltypes of sexual acts with all types of partners, willing and unwilling, and theforceful suppression of dissent, the aggressive enslavement of the weak.Satanism is not about worship or devotion; it is about power, and about power asmanifest on both a physical and a spiritual level.That is not to say that the Satanic cult attracts only the powerful. In fact,the opposite is true.The people who worship power are those who do not have it. The vast majority ofpeople who have been attracted to Satanic cults have been—in the author’sexperience as an observer of the occult environment—the weak, the desperate, thedowntrodden, the impoverished … the petty criminal, the drug addict. They becomethe playground for a handful of people at the top, who manipulate their willingservants, exploiting their submission and devotion, and turn them into drugcouriers, pornographers, and murderers. The glue that binds these groupstogether is the ritual held in the dead of night in abandoned parks and ruinedbuildings, the shedding of innocent blood, and the promise of eternal reward ina Hell of their own devising.The Process Church of the Final Judgement made Satanism fashionable to anextent, and if not glamorous, then a bit more intellectually honest. RobertMoore’s neo-Gnosticism was a refinement of Anton LaVey’s blatantly commercialapproach to Satan. While LaVey’s showmanship attracted a certain element thatwas ready to dip their toes into the thrill of actually participating in a BlackMass, Moore’s Process Church strained for a more severe aesthetic. Moore had amission, and a program. Moore believed. LaVey did not. Moore came from aScientology background, in which the possibilities of human programming, of mindcontrol and ritual, were vigorously explored. LaVey’s “do your own thing anddon’t let guilt or shame or other people get in your way” was little more thanwarmed-over Rabelais and a dose of Dale Carnegie. It was not intellectuallyambitious, but an approach designed to appeal to the greatest number of people,and thus based on a few simple ideas. The Church of Satan was a kind ofpsychotherapy clinic dressed up in Gothic robes and black candles. Psychodramafor the counter-culture that was just coming into its own in 1966. It was “thePower of Positive Thinking” meets La-Bas.The Process, on the other hand, was a genuine cult. The early days of theirgroup, flying from London to Mexico en famille with guard dogs and blackjackets, blending Jehovah with Lucifer and then adding a strong dose of Satan asthey germinated in San Francisco a few blocks up the street in the Haight fromwhere Manson was staying, is evidence that what Moore was up to was much morethan LaVey ever had in mind. Moore was undergoing his own shamanistic initiationat the expense of his followers; his magazine, Process, with its issues devotedto “Death” and “Fear,” was riding a wave of disintegration and dismemberment,albeit in an artistic way replete with photos of pop icons like Dali andFaithfull, not to mention epistles from Manson himself.And that is what eventually happened.The Process splintered in the years after 1968. The three main bodies within theProcess—the groups devoted to Jehovah, Lucifer, and Satan—broke apart from eachother and attempted to retain independent status. Moore himself left the Process(or, as some say, was kicked out in a kind of palace coup orchestrated by hiswife) and melted into obscurity; the same might be said for the Jehovah andLucifer contingents, as the Process reinvented itself andtried to hold onto what they could from the old days, amalgamating what theycould of the older membership. The Satan contingent, however, seems to havesurvived.Rumors of a cult calling itself the Four P surfaced in California shortly afterthe Process disappeared from that state. “Four P” was a name taken from theProcess symbol, which resembles four “P’s” in a circle forming a kind ofswastika figure. Then there was the Grand Chingon, said to be the leader of theFour P. Manson Family members used to claim that Charlie was the Grand Chingon,but that was empty boasting. No one seems to know who the Grand Chingon was, oreven what “Chingon” means, except that it may not be a real title but a kind ofepithet. In Mexican Spanish, the verb chingar means “to fuck” and is used as anexpletive, such as in the word chingada for “fucking” or chinga su madre, acommon curse. Thus, the word chingon could mean “the fucker.” As the Luciferianelement of the Process was the one involved most directly in the lasciviousaspects of the cult—the purely sexual component, rather than the more intensepower component of the Satan element—it is possible that the Grand Chingon wasleading a group of dissident Luciferians, except for the fact that the Four Pgroup and the Grand Chingon were implicated in several vicious murders in theCalifornia area in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including the one involvingStanley Baker, the aforementioned cannibal.Remaining behind in California, at a time when the film Rosemary’s Baby had justbeen released, another Kennedy slain, Dr. King assassinated, the Days of Rageraging in Chicago, the infamous Tet Offensive ongoing in Vietnam, etc., cultmembers and those who lived on the fringes of the cults still sought to stayactive and to survive. California to most people is Hollywood, the City ofDreams. The free-wheeling lifestyle of movie stars, directors, producers fitperfectly with the “nothing is true, everything is permitted” school ofborn-again Ismailism which became—at least in California—a kind of neo-gnosticSatanism. After all, in Hollywood one had access to all the things that cultsare today accused of exploiting: drugs, pornography, prostitution, andextravagant dreams of wealth, fame and power. Scientology deliberately targetedmovie stars, and the current membership lists bear out this strategy: JohnTravolta, Kirstie Alley, Tom Cruise, and Nicole Kidman are all Hubbard alumni,as well as many lesser-known dream factory employees. With celebrities,Scientology could buy respectability.But people like Charlie Manson were fishing in the same waters. Charlie, withhis close relationship to Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys and his on-again,off-again partnership with Terry Melcher (son of Doris Day), and his de factoguardianship of DiDi Lansbury, was prowling the fringes of the Hollywoodboondoggle. There are fortunes to be made in Hollywood, and fortunes to be lost.It is a high-risk, high-stress environment that has seen its share of murder andsuicide, long before Charlie Manson and long after. Those who work this industryknow where to score drugs, where to pick up sexual partners for a price, andwhere to hire a hitman.One of the many theories about the Manson killings is that they weremurder-for-hire. This is the field that Maury Terry has plowed so earnestly, forit leads him back to one of the more spectacular Hollywood murders of recentyears, that of Roy Radin and the hired hitman known as Manson II.THE COTTON CLUB MURDERSAnd it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots,and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.—Isaiah 22:7, in a King James Bible opened to this page and found at the RoyRadin crime scene by Maury Terry '37We can’t really talk about this aspect of the case without talking about RobertEvans, for Evans will lead us to Roy Radin and Elaine Jacobs and Manson II. BobEvans is a famous Hollywood movie icon, a producer who was responsible for suchbox office hits as Rosemary’s Baby and The Godfather. In fact, this axis ofdirectors Roman Polanski and Francis Ford Coppola is one that will surface againin his career, as he went on to produce both Chinatown and the doomed CottonClub.Robert Evans has been married to some of Hollywood’s most celebrated leadingladies in his time, including Ali MacGraw and former Miss America PhyllisGeorge. It was Ali MacGraw who served as our guide into the Process-infiltratedarea of upstate New York, where we found Pound Ridge, Salem and Brewster in themidst of satanic skullduggery, including the presence of unapologetic occultistAnita Pallenberg and a dead seventeen-year-old boy in her bed, and a flap oversatanic activity in the area that continues to the present time. Phyllis Georgewill introduce us to her former husband Kentucky Governor John Y. Brown and ascandal surrounding the governor, Colombian drug runners in northeasternKentucky and a bizarre paramilitary drug cult known as “the Company.” Moreimportantly, Evans will meet and—some say—eventually propose to one Elaine“Laney” Jacobs, the wife of several drug runners in her time with a trail thatleads directly back to crazed narcotraficante, worshipper of John Lennon, andneo-Nazi, Carlos Lehder, currently a guest of the US federal prison system. Thenumber of associations that swirl around Robert Evans is astonishing; the factthat he was arrested and convicted once for cocaine possession is only the tipof a very old and very cold iceberg. He was a suspect in a homicide, and it wasthis homicide that brought the Son of Sam cult to the surface.As with most “deep politics,” the connections between these individuals andevents are murky, but definite. These are all people who knew each other, didbusiness together, did drugs together, and in some cases committed murder. It isa matter of the public record. What has not been revealed until now is theextent to which these events are linked below the surface to each other and todarker forces at work in the collective American psyche.There are several books which can introduce the reader to the broader aspects ofthese cases, even though they do not reference each other and seem on thesurface to be unrelated. They are, in addition to Maury Terry’s The UltimateEvil, Ali MacGraw’s Moving Pictures, Sally Denton’s The Bluegrass Conspiracy,and Steve Wick’s Bad Company: Drugs, Hollywood and the Cotton Club Murder. Thelatter is a review of the murder case involving Bob Evans and as such is a bitless self-serving than Evans’ own autobiography, The Kid Stays In The Picture(later made into a lugubrious documentary with a running Bob Evans voice-overwhose only saving grace is the hilarious impression of Evans by Dustin Hoffmanover the closing credits).The following is a précis of the facts of the case as represented in the aboveworks and the public record.Orson Welles may seem like a strange person to introduce this story, but onceagain we are faced with deep resonances and incredible Brunoesque “links.”Welles, one of the pioneers of the motion picture and an incredible artist (asevidenced by his Citizen Kane, which is the focus of many filmmaking courses andbooks of cinema criticism) was also fascinated with the occult and the power ofmass media. His infamous broadcast of H.G. Wells’ The War of the Worlds over theradio on Halloween 1938 is part of American history; the broadcast seemed sogenuine to listeners that it caused a panic as people believed the Earth hadactually been invaded by creatures from Mars. His aborted attempt to make a filmin Brazil about Latin American witchcraft led to his being cursed by a localshaman, something Welles took very seriously.But Welles is important to us at this juncture for another reason entirely. Hewas Roy Radin’s mentor.Roy Alexander Radin was born to impresario Alexander Radin and his wife Renee, aformer stripper, on November 13, 1949. The elder Radin had been a confidant ofWelles, and Welles took over the education of the teenaged boy when Al Radindied. Al Radin had been a fixture on Broadway, a man who knew all the playersfrom the actors and actresses to the producers, directors, agents and otherhangers-on and could make or break a career. His son looked up to him, andconsidered his father “the greatest man in the world.” He inherited some of hisfather’s contacts and clientele, even so far as to include former Rat Packercomedian Joey Bishop as emcee for some of his roadshow extravaganzas. (WithFrank Sinatra and Peter Lawford deeply involved in the Marilyn Monroe/Kennedybrothers affair, that would leave only Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. of allthe Rat Packers relatively unscathed from conspiracy associations … except forthe fact that Sammy Davis, Jr. did join the Knights of Malta, long rumored to bea hotbed of intelligence activity and Illuminati-type machinations.)Overweight, with a pudgy face framed by a short beard, and always well-dressedin public (while preferring a bathrobe at home in his huge Southampton mansion,Ocean Castle), Radin was a show business entrepreneur who managed talent thatothers wouldn’t touch or know what to do with. He represented such acts asGeorge Gobel, Georgie Jessel, Red Buttons, Demond Wilson, and Tiny Tim,sometimes ganging up a few dozen acts and taking the whole geriatric entourageon the road, doing policemen’s clubs and other small venues from New England tothe Midwest and up and down the Eastern seaboard by bus. Magicians,ventriloquists, dancing poodles and has-been actors and comedians from the 1950swere his stock-in-trade and, incredibly, Middle America loved it and made him awealthy man.And with the wealth came the drugs, lots of drugs.When we speak of cults, particularly satanic cults, we have a picture in ourmind of black robes, burning candles, sexual orgies, and strange drugs burningin the censers, sending clouds of potent smoke flowing through the ruinedchapel, further enflaming the strange desires of the participants, urging themonwards towards greater depravities. We remember the command of Rimbaud, to“derange the senses” as prerequisite to insight, to spiritual understanding; itwas a command the surrealists took to heart, and one that became almost acommonplace among the Hollywood crowd of the 1960s and 1970s. Sexual “deviance”was a necessary tool, as necessary as the drugs; and this is not to make a moralobservation or a value judgment on what type of sexuality is “deviant” or“perverse,” but only to acknowledge that sexuality is technology in the hands ofthe mystic as well as of the satanist. The deliberate pursuit of whatever typeof sex is considered deviant by one’s own culture is part of the program ofspiritual seekers as far removed from each other in time and space as TantricHindus, California Satanists, Daoist sorcerers, Siberian shamans, and paunchyEnglish “witches” with their scourges and “sky-clad” rituals in the New Forest.To break tabu is a necessary stage in vama marg tantra ceremonies, for instance,in which dietary and sexual tabus are deliberately broken, one after another. Itis recognized by these technologists of the spirit that deviation fromsocially-acceptable mores is a powerful tool for awakening the sleeping powerswithin us, provided that this deviation takes place within the occult enginesthey have designed.In the Roy Radin case, sex and drugs combined in the usual ways, but with theaddition of cult practices on the one hand, and videotape technology on theother. To show how far we worship the image, merely participating in extremesexual activity was not enough anymore for people of Radin’s circle. It becamenecessary to record the images on tape so that the events could be relivedor—and this is more likely—could be examined and studied from a differentperspective, a different angle than the lenses of our own eyes permit us, likeseeing yourself talk on television for the first time. To watch yourself havingsex with another on tape is to sink a well into your subconscious. It is a pointof view normally reserved for your sexual partner; by breaking that parameteryou have changed the dynamic of the act completely. While you have performed asa sexual being until that time—from the inside, out—you are now a sexual image,from the outside, in. You have reversed polarity. And if this is done withoutthe proper safeguards, you can spin out of control.It is no wonder, then, that all of the high-profile cult scandals of the lastthirty years have involved videotaped sex acts: from the much-rumored sex tapesof Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski to the missing videotapes of the MansonFamily, to the Sisman videotapes of the Son of Sam killings and the Roy Radinvideotapes, sex and murder have become images, have become magical glyphs andsigils in a modern-day grimoire. And, as usual, there is always an organizationin place to take control of these images: a cult, a gang, a government. InRadin’s case, it was all three.Radin had made the shrewd choice to hire as many off-duty police as possible,and always threw benefits for the local police departments, thus ingratiatinghimself with law enforcement, who looked the other way when he was buyingcocaine (even having it delivered to his mansion like take-out pizza) or whowould give him a head’s-up when they knew he was about to be raided. What theydid not know was that his godfather—his literal godfather—was JohnnyStoppelli,38 a soldier in the Genovese crime family who maintained an upscalelifestyle in Manhattan’s Murray Hill section. Radin referred to Stoppelli as his“muscle,” and when Ron Sisman was murdered along with his girlfriend ElizabethPlotsman on a Halloween night it was rumored that Radin (and, possibly,Stoppelli) had something to do with it. That’s because Sisman had been the onewho sent Melonie Haller down to Ocean Castle one night, thus threatening Radin’sreputation and lifestyle when she was found, unconscious, on the Long IslandRailroad.Melonie Haller had posed nude for Playboy magazine after her appearances on thenetwork television sit-com Welcome Back, Kotter in the 1970s. It was Ron Sisman,a photographer with numerous contacts in the entertainment industry in New York,who suggested she visit Radin at his Long Island home. Radin would be able tohelp her career, he explained, and she should bring along her portfolio to showhim.Haller showed up at Ocean Castle on April 11, 1980 with a friend, and had dinnerwith Radin, Radin’s second wife Toni Fillet, and two men who were actuallypolice detectives from Rhode Island. Haller’s friend was telling stories ofcocaine buys he had made, not knowing that his dinner companions were cops. Itmade for an interesting evening. Once the police had left, Haller and her friendstayed behind and—during the course of an alcohol- and drug-filled evening—woundup donning skimpy leather Nazi uniforms and whipping each other for the benefitof their host. According to various eyewitness testimony—supplemented by a lotof rumor and innuendo—Radin had a movie camera set up in his bedroom where muchof this activity took place.When Haller later told this story, she said her rape had been caught on video,and when the police eventually raided Ocean Castle, they seized what turned outto be a blank (erased) tape from the machine in Radin’s bedroom. Whether or notHaller was actually raped or if she did, in fact, willingly participate in sexacts with Radin or other parties is not known for certain. What is known isthat, on the following day, when she tried to interest Radin in her portfolio hewas less than attentive. She became either unstable or simply upset and angry(depending on which version of the story one believes) and Radin ordered her outof the house. Her companion of the previous evening—a management consultant, noless—is said to have beaten and kicked her, and to eventually have her taken toa local train station and put on the LIRR for Manhattan, where she was foundunconscious and heavily bruised.The tabloid press was gleeful, of course, and Haller rewarded their joy byinsisting to the police that she had been drugged, raped and beaten by Radin andhis associates and that everything had been captured on videotape. No such tapewas found, but then Radin had ample advance warning from the local cops andwould have been able to erase any incriminating evidence. As it was, he had thehousehold staff clean the rooms thoroughly and dispose of any drugs, weapons,stains, etc. By the time the police arrived, all they could find was a pistol inRadin’s closet, for which he was eventually indicted on a misdemeanor charge ofpossession of an unregistered weapon.Whether Radin blamed his predicament on photographer Ron Sisman is not known;what is known is that Sisman was murdered shortly thereafter. The talk on thestreet, however, was that Sisman was killed for another, even more sinister,reason: he claimed to have possession of a videotape showing the murder ofStacey Moskowitz, the last Son of Sam victim. Appropriately enough, Sisman andhis girlfriend were executed in their townhouse on Halloween night 1981, and novideotape was found at the scene.After the scandal of the Melonie Haller episode—which was followed extensivelyby the New York tabloid press—Radin had to rebuild his reputation and hisbusiness. He had expensive tastes, and so did his arriviste wife, Toni Fillet,who fancied herself a society matron and whose ultra-thin and boney physiquereflected her maiden name. It would take him two years of turmoil, but in 1982he sold his Southampton estate for eight million dollars (he had paid only$300,000 for it in 1978) and began his run at Hollywood. In his briefcase was abatch of screenplays that had been sent him over the years. One was a musical heliked about a Harlem nightspot, and it was called The Cotton Club.The same year (and in the same state) that Radin was being investigated over theMelonie Haller affair, Hollywood producer Robert Evans was having his ownproblems with law enforcement. He had been arrested and convicted for cocainepossession, a charge Radin himself narrowly avoided by flushing his drugs downthe toilets minutes before the police raid on Ocean Castle. Evans had been theenfant terrible of the Hollywood movie industry in the late 1960s and 1970s,producing a string of box office smashes that included Rosemary’s Baby, LoveStory, and The Godfather. He was wealthy, self-assured, powerful, and attractivein a boyish sort of way. He charmed Ali MacGraw, to whom he was married for awhile, as well as Phyllis George (who would go on to marry Kentucky GovernorJohn Y. Brown) whom he divorced in 1978. He was a regular on the cocktail andcocaine circuit. Evans became dependent on cocaine, and this led to his eventualarrest and conviction for possession of five ounces of the powder in New York,where Radin was having his own problems with the law. This arrest came after aseries of financial and critical failures for Evans at the box office, whichincluded, incidentally, the first film made of a Thomas Harris book, BlackSunday.Evans avoided an actual prison term by plea-bargaining his way out of it,producing instead a television special with an anti-drug message: Get High OnYourself. Like the previous string of Evans releases, this was also a flop.Evans and Radin: both in trouble with the law, both at the lowest ebbs of theirrespective professional careers, reputations in tatters, friends not returningcalls, money dwindling, yet neither having ever met the other. It would take awoman with millions of dollars in cocaine money to bring the two together, toessentially seduce both men, becoming in the process a real-life femme fatale.By the time a year was over, one of the men would be dead, the other would bequestioned by homicide investigators, and Laney Jacobs would be married yetagain.Karen DeLayne Jacobs was born in the third week of June 1947, at the moment UFOswere skimming across the skies of the northwest United States, confusing KennethArnold, and giving rise to the term “flying saucer.” She was born in the stateof Alabama to an auto mechanic and his wife. Her father eventually became anauto salesman and their financial lives improved, but at the expense of theirhomelife. Her parents divorced when “Laney” (as she was known) was only nineyears old, and in spite of careful upbringing by her grandparents in Georgia shebecame a willful and wild child, even though her school records were impressiveand she had joined a number of clubs and was considered popular, that Holy Grailof teenaged girls. After school she held a number of jobs, but her restlessnature was not satisfied with being a legal secretary, and she soon startedhanging out in the Latin demimonde of South Florida.A brittle-looking brunette and at times peroxide blonde with a tight smile and aferret’s features, she was nonetheless as popular around the Cuban and Colombiannarcotraficante circuit as she was in her Georgia high school Pep Club. Known asLa Rubia (“the Blonde”), she began cutting deals behind the backs of herdrug-dealing boyfriends and was soon running coke in quantity from Miami to LosAngeles. Sometimes loud and abrasive, bordering on the vulgar, she was alsosmart and cautious with a bookkeeper’s approach to the drug business, keepingcareful records of all her deals and building a substantial fortune in theprocess. She loved hanging out in Latin discos and clubs, and her stable ofboyfriends was almost exclusively Cuban or Colombian or of other Latin Americanancestry; in addition, what they had in common was a love of the drug trade andthe fabulous wealth it represented to the otherwise unaccomplished, uneducated,and underprivileged of norteamericano society, Latin or gringo.She had gone through a long succession of marriages before her fateful trip toLos Angeles in 1982 (poor Laney, always a bride, never a bridesmaid!) but hermost recent liaison was with a powerful trafficker, one Milan Bellechasses.Bellechasses, a native of Santiago de Cuba, worked for the Medellin drug carteland specifically for Carlos Lehder Rivas, one of the most colorful of the threemen who made up the cartel. Lehder was not only a drug trafficker (who had spenttime in the Bronx as a teenager, dealing marijuana and boosting cars), but healso considered himself a political activist dedicated to the overthrow of NorthAmerican hegemony in Colombia and the rest of Latin America through theexportation of illegal drugs to the States: weapons of mass addiction, perhaps.He was also a worshipper (there is no other word) of former Beatle John Lennon,and erected a statue of him outside a hotel he owned in Colombia. The statueshows Lennon completely nude, except for a Nazi helmet, a guitar, and a holewhere his heart would be. Lehder’s fascination with Nazism perhaps stems fromhis own background: his father had been a German engineer who emigrated(mysteriously) to Colombia around the time of World War II.It would be Lehder who would eventually give evidence against PanamanianPresident Manuel Noriega, after the latter’s abduction from Panama by Americantroops. (Lehder himself had been captured in Colombia and extradited to theUnited States by the Colombian government on US federal drug charges, asituation that caused tremendous dislocation in New York City as rival gangsfought over his territories, leaving scores of people dead in an underground warthat was never reported by the English language press, although it wasextensively covered in Spanish language newspapers for weeks. The remainingcartel members offered to pay off all of Colombia’s national debt—in cash—ifthey would be assured that they would not also be extradited. The Colombiangovernment, to its credit, did not entertain the offer.)This was the milieu in which Laney Jacobs moved and operated. When Miami got alittle too hot for her—and her husband and the father of her unborn child wasarrested in a drug raid—she decided to decamp to Los Angeles, a dream of herssince childhood. She wanted to be in the movie business. She wanted to be aproducer. She could not completely sever the ties that bound her to the drugtrade, however, and she really didn’t want to. The money was too good, andbesides she also had a serious coke habit to support. Then there was MilanBellechasses, always lurking in the background, a man to whom Laney wasinexplicably attracted, and with whom she did millions of dollars of businessover the years.How Laney met Bob Evans was pure serendipity. She had rented a limousine in LAfrom a company in which Evans was a part owner, Ascot Limousine, and thechauffeur heard her talking about investing some of her money in a movieproject. The chauffeur knew that Evans was looking for backers for new projectsof his own, and offered to put Laney Jacobs in touch. He was as good as hisword, and soon Evans was sending flowers to Laney and taking her out on thetown, introducing her to his Hollywood world. The fact that they had cocaine incommon didn’t hurt the relationship, although Evans would always, incredibly,claim that he did not know that Laney Jacobs was a dealer or that the money shewas considering investing in his various projects was drug money. Friends andacquaintances, of course, insist otherwise.Evans was at his wits’ end at the time, trying to jump-start his stalled careerwhen into the midst of his purgatory wandered Jacobs, a brash player in a tightred gown and a bulging purse who single-handedly gave the term “powdering one’snose” a whole new meaning. It was a marriage made in some perverse kind ofheaven, where the angels play maracas instead of harps, and the clouds have astreet value of a hundred bucks a gram.For a brief time, one of his financial backers was Adnan Khashoggi.As revealed in Ronald Kessler’s biography of the international arms dealer, TheRichest Man In The World,39 Evans had been introduced to Khashoggi by a mutualfriend, Melissa Prophet, “a former Miss California who portrayed a tennisgroupie in his 1977 movie Players.” 40Prophet heard that Evans was havingtrouble raising money for The Cotton Club, and contacted Khashoggi who suggestedthat they meet immediately and discuss the deal. Khashoggi agreed to provide$750,000 up front, with another $1,250,000 when Evans managed to sign a few morebackers. It was with this money, according to Kessler, that Evans hired MarioPuzo to write the script. Melissa Prophet got a credit as an associate producer.However, Khashoggi (a failed producer himself, whose movie about the ProphetMuhammad starring Anthony Quinn—The Message—was banned in Muslim countries andactually caused riots) eventually wanted to own more than 50% of the film, andwas prepared to invest an additional ten million dollars for the privilege, butEvans turned him down and eventually bought him out for one million dollarscash. 41Kessler’s book is thin on dates, and unfortunately we don’t know exactlyhow these events tied into those that follow. Khashoggi’s original offer of twomillion dollars is suggestive, as we shall see, as well as Evans’ ability to buyhim out for a cool million when, according to all accounts, he was flat broke atthe time.Laney Jacobs and Roy Radin both arrived in Los Angeles in January of 1983, andit was shortly thereafter that Laney met Evans and then met Radin, who wasinterested in renting or buying her house in Benedict Canyon. Radin and Jacobshit it off immediately, Radin inviting Jacobs to his temporary, servicedapartment, where his assistant prepared a light supper for them.As their relationship blossomed, Jacobs confided to Radin that she wanted to bea movie producer. Since Radin was in Hollywood on the same mission, they couldpool their resources. When Jacobs mentioned her friendship with Robert Evans,however, that took the dialogue to a whole new level. Radin was ecstatic at thepossibility of working with a legend like Evans, and when a meeting was finallyarranged, Radin talked to him about the various scripts he was interested inpromoting.One of the projects in question was The Cotton Club. The story of a Harlemnightclub, Evans had wanted to do a film about the history of the club himself,but more as a drama, while Radin was favoring a musical (true to his Vaudevilleroots). The script would eventually go through several hands including MarioPuzo and Francis Ford Coppola. As the story unfolded, Evans would turn Hollywoodupside down looking for backers, even interesting international arms dealer (andeventual Iran-Contra figure) Adnan Khashoggi. Finally, he garnered the supportof the Doumani brothers, Las Vegas businessmen and casino owners (El Morocco)who were inclined to help finance the project if they had some control over thescript and the casting. It was just as the Doumani deal was in danger of fallingthrough that Laney Jacobs brought Roy Radin to meet Evans; was it synchronicitythat both Evans and Radin were interested in making a film about the CottonClub? That Evans had already started raising funding and doing rewrites of theinitial script when Radin walked in with another Cotton Club treatment under hisarm?Radin was elated; he was finally in the big leagues. Further, Evans was a knowncoke-head and even the Doumani brothers were fed up with his habit. Radin hadexperience with cokeheads and felt he could control Evans to a certain degree.He could coast on Evans’ legendary reputation in the movie business (even thoughthat legend was largely tarnished) and create a new reputation for himself. Andeverything would have been fine, had it not been for Tally Rogers.Rogers was Laney’s drug courier, and the man who had installed the safe in herhouse. After an argument about the amount he was to be paid for a Miami-LosAngeles round trip, he rifled her safe and her stash and made off with a milliondollars’ worth of cocaine and cash, and then promptly disappeared.Radin by this time was back on the East Coast temporarily tending to somebusiness, when he received a hysterical phone call from Laney accusing Radin ofbeing partners with Rogers in the crime. Radin, of course, had nothing to dowith it. He had bigger fish to fry, and was eager to be rid of Laney Jacobs ifat all possible and get down to business with Evans. But Jacobs was having noneof it. She began phoning all over the country in an effort to locate Rogers.The coke business in those days was done largely on credit. The cocaine Jacobshad in her home—and she had stacks of it from floor to ceiling in her closet—hadnot been paid for. It had been extended on credit to Milan Bellechasses from hisColombian suppliers, and from Bellechasses to Jacobs. Jacobs would have to makegood on the coke, in cash. Hence, the hysteria. If she didn’t, the Colombianswere notoriously lacking in a sense of humor, and would deal with her harshly.To compound matters, her small son was living with her and could alsoconceivably become a victim in some hideously operatic act of revenge.Tally Rogers had taken the coke and the cash, angry at the way he had beentreated by Jacobs, and was now driving around the country, moving from place toplace and keeping a low profile, believing it would eventually blow over. RoyRadin shared this point of view, and concentrated on his production careerinstead, ignoring Laney’s screams over the telephone.Jacobs, terrified that either Rogers would come back to steal the rest of herstash or that the Colombians would show up, all firepower and fatal finery, wentto a friend of hers and asked him to help her find a bodyguard. The friendintroduced her to one Bill Mentzer and one Alex Marti, both former bodyguards ofHustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, who had been wounded in an assassinationattempt a few years previously. Laney took them to her house to guard her homeand coke, and eventually began “dating” Mentzer. Marti, an Argentine and reputedformer death squad member was the more violent of the two, and also a Hitlerdevotee who had a portrait of the Fuhrer in his home, a Third Reich library, andwho admired the Nazi method of execution: a single gunshot to the back of thehead.42In the meantime, Radin was going forward with his movie deal with Evans. Jacobsfound out that she was going to be cut out of the deal, less a finder’s fee, andshe was livid. Cocaine makes one paranoid as it is, but is it paranoia wheneveryone really is plotting against you?Jacobs and Radin agreed to a fifty thousand dollar finder’s fee upon signing ofan agreement between Evans and Radin (something which had been going nowheresince both coked-out producers could not manage to write a single declarativesentence that made any sense). Radin did his best to ignore Laney Jacobs, andwas busy investigating a mysterious burglary of his office in Manhattan when,unknown to him, Bob Evans and Laney Jacobs traveled together from California toNew York and from there on to Miami, where Laney was introducing Evans to hercircle of friends.Laney had managed to get Evans to agree to disassociate himself from Radin, atleast on principle. Radin was still insisting he could raise thirty-five milliondollars, and Evans could not afford to ignore that. However, Laney wined anddined and bedded Evans in Miami, showing him that it was possible to raise cashas easily in Miami as it was from Roy Radin. Evans already had Mario Puzo andFrancis Ford Coppola lined up to make the Cotton Club movie, and these werebankable names.During this visit to Miami, Laney Jacobs introduced Robert Evans to MilanBellechasses.At the same time, Radin was actually accomplishing something on his own. He hadmanaged to convince the Puerto Rican government to raise the thirty-five milliondollars through an industrial bond offering. The idea was this: Evans would makethe film in Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican government would build aHollywood-class studio to accommodate him (and many future films), and wouldeven make Evans a professor of film at the University of Puerto Rico. In otherwords, there was serious and reputable money behind the scheme. For his part,Evans had to raise money through the sale of foreign rights, and Radin had tofront another eight million dollars of his own money, which he felt he could dothrough the sale of his Long Island mansion. Radin would own 45 percent of thedeal, Evans another 45 percent, and their Puerto Rican attorney the remainingten percent. It seemed like a done deal.On the New York side, pre-production was already in progress at Astoria Studioson Cotton Club. People were being hired, money was being spent, there was stillno official screenplay, but the show must, as they say, go on. The Doumanibrothers were still in for $1.6 million and had not been paid back, and therewas fighting over the script that seemed to go on forever, but at least themovie was being made.Then, in April of 1983, it all went wrong.Visiting Evans at his home one evening, Radin learned that Laney Jacobs was backin the picture, literally. Evans tried to convince Radin to give Laney half ofhis 45 percent. If he had done that, of course, Radin would have lost anycontrol he had over the project. Evans would keep 45 percent, the lion’s share,and if he formed a bloc with Laney (as it appeared to be the case), then Radinwas reduced to a minor role. This was not what Radin had in mind, especiallysince he had been the one to set up the Puerto Rican deal in the first place.On May 5, 1983, and in the midst of the accusations and recriminations that wereflying around the New York City townhouse of Robert Evans that week, Radinmanaged to bring his “godfather,” Johnny Stoppelli, to one of the meetings,hoping that they could work something out between Radin and Evans. However, theyhad just begun to talk when Laney walked in with her Miami attorney, Frank Diaz,and the fighting began again. Radin was adamant about not letting Jacobs haveany percentage of the deal. He did not want to have to deal with her at all.Even more compelling, however, was Johnny Stoppelli’s reaction: he recognizedJacobs for what she was, and told Radin that he would not do business with drugdealers and warned Radin to forget the whole thing. That, if he did not, he wasasking for trouble.43 Radin felt he could not abandon the project completely,and was still committed to doing something in Hollywood.On May 7, 1983 Roy Radin flew to Hollywood to attend the bar mitzvah of comedianRed Buttons’ son, Adam. He was still anxious about the Cotton Club deal andfelt, understandably, that he had put the whole deal together from financing tostudios and should be allowed to have a greater say in the future of theproject. He felt he did not owe Laney Jacobs anything beyond the finder’s fee,since all she did was introduce him to Evans. He had done the rest.When he was out one afternoon, he received a call at his Los Angeles hotel onhis private line. It was a New York mobster, warning him to keep his mouth shutand to get out of town. The call was taken by Radin’s assistant, JonathanLawson, who was appropriately alarmed and urged Radin to heed the advice. It hadbeen a warning—the last one.Radin called Stoppelli in New York City and asked about the call, but Stoppellihadn’t a clue. He only reiterated what he had told Radin before: get out of LAand forget the movie business. He was involved with drug dealers and it couldonly mean trouble. Radin promised he would return to New York on Friday, afterthe bar mitzvah.Immediately, the issue began to heat up. Evans offered to buy out Radin for twomillion dollars cash, but Radin declined. (Where did Evans get two milliondollars in cash, if not from Laney Jacobs?) Evans called the Puerto Ricanattorney and asked if the deal could still go through without Radin. Theattorney preferred that both Evans and Radin be involved; however, if someonecould come up with the financing that Radin was due to invest—eight milliondollars—then it was possible. A girlfriend of Radin’s—and a close friend ofLaney Jacobs—warned Radin that there was heavy muscle in town around Jacobs andthat Radin should under no circumstances agree to meet with her. Most curiously,Evans had not been able to post the performance bond necessary to get the moviecontract signed with the Puerto Ricans, but somehow had two million dollars cashto give Radin. Evans’ insistence that he did not know Laney Jacobs was involvedin drug-dealing begins to look very weak at this point.But the die had been cast. Laney Jacobs had called and asked for one lastmeeting to try to sort out the Cotton Club mess. Radin, pushed to the wall butstill believing he could salvage the deal, agreed.The date was set for Friday, May 13.That night, Laney Jacobs arrived in a limousine to collect Radin and drive tothe La Scala restaurant in Los Angeles. Radin’s assistant, Lawson, did not trustthe arrangement at all. Instead, he had one of Radin’s long-time friends andfellow coke user, actor Demond Wilson (Sanford and Son, The New Odd Coupletelevision sitcoms), tail the limo to the restaurant. Wilson, according to allaccounts, was armed. Lawson stood in the lobby of their hotel and watched asJacobs and Radin drove off in the limo, driven by one Bob Lowe. Prior to that,Jacobs had tried to get Lawson to drive to her house to pick up some cocaine butLawson, smelling a rat, refused and stayed behind. It was a decision that savedhis life, for Jacobs had two men waiting for him in a pickup truck outside herhouse.Wilson, who had already done at least two lines of cocaine in the car, beganfollowing the limousine but not before another car swung out behind it, a blackCaddy driven—as it was later discovered—by Bill Mentzer, with Alex Marti ridingshotgun, appropriately enough. The two cars lost Wilson in traffic, takingevasive measures and running a red light, so that Wilson wound up drivingdirectly to La Scala to wait for Radin and Jacobs to appear. The plan was thatWilson would take another table and watch the proceedings from a safe distance.They never showed up. After a few hours, Lawson called La Scala to see what wasgoing on and was informed that Radin and Jacobs never arrived. He asked to speakto Wilson, and was dumbfounded to learn that Wilson was just sitting in therestaurant all this time, waiting for the friend he would never see again.Wilson, terrified by now, disappeared that night. It would be two days beforeLawson could locate him, but by that time Radin had already been reportedmissing.Wilson has since left show business and refuses to talk about that night.Instead (like so many others who have been touched by the cults), he became aChristian minister and now preaches the Gospel, trading cocaine for the “opiumof the people.”Lawson, confronting Jacobs, got two different stories, neither of which mademuch sense. Either Radin left the limo before arriving at La Scala after a fightwith Laney, or Jacobs did. No matter, they were both lies. That same week shehad her infant son and her maid fly back out to Miami, and she put her LosAngeles home up for sale, telling everyone she was going to New York to work forRobert Evans. Events had been set in motion behind Radin’s back.The full story would not come out until much later, after several years ofinvestigation, but on June 10, 1983—less than a month after Radin’sdisappearance—a bee-keeper by the name of Glen Fischer wandering in the roughcountry near Gorman, California came across a body that was partially buried ina ravine, the fingers of one hand clawing upward from the ground, its skullalmost completely destroyed, its jawbone several feet away from its head, pumpedwith twenty-eight shots at point blank range, and dressed in an expensivethree-piece suit and a Pierre Cardin tie. Glen Fischer had found Roy Radin.It is at this point in the story that we must rejoin our previous protagonists,who had been searching zealously for evidence of just such a crime before it waseven reported. Maury Terry, acting on the basis of information obtained from aninformer—“Vinny”—who had known David Berkowitz in prison, was looking at RoyRadin as the possible East Coast connection for the Son of Sam cult. Why? Therewas more to Ocean Castle than the Melonie Haller incident. It seems that policehad been called out to the Castle several times in the past, acting oncomplaints of sexual assault. There was a strong rumor that many of the partiesand other activities there had been videotaped; and that photographer RonaldSisman was more deeply involved with Radin and with cult activity than othershad suspected. Vinny had actually named Radin—knowing him only as “Rodan” and“Rodan the Flying Monster”—as well as Sisman and others involved in the case.Radin was said to be involved with “Dale Evans,” another code name, and in thiscase Roy Radin was referred to as “Roy Rogers.”“Dale Evans,” then, was possibly Bob Evans … but some of this information wentback long before Evans and Radin were thought to have met, implying a deeperinvolvement between the two men, something that Evans has always denied. Infact, Evans would only admit that Radin was merely an acquaintance and not abusiness partner, a statement that was patently untrue, as signed copies oftheir movie agreement exist to disprove this allegation beyond any doubt. To besure, “Roy Rogers” could also have been a reference to Tally Rogers who, asLaney Jacobs’ drug courier, was driving between Miami and Los Angeles twice amonth and could conceivably have been more than simply a drug courier, and usedto transport information between the Los Angeles branch of the Sam Cult and theEast Coast. (When the investigators finally caught up with Tally Rogers, he wasserving time in the Louisiana prison system for child molestation, havingsexually abused two young sons of his then-current girlfriend.)Vinny insisted that Radin had close connections to Los Angeles and the Son ofSam cult supposed to be headquartered there. Terry’s information includedreports of satanic activity at Ocean Castle along with all the drugs andpolymorphous sexuality. David Berkowitz himself was known to have visited OceanCastle at least once, which was explosive information as it was … but thenBerkowitz also had been seen in Minot, North Dakota, the other Sam cult site.Terry tried connecting all the dots, but he did not have identities for some ofthe players, and in other cases he was dealing with ongoing policeinvestigations and could not reveal more specific information, or possibly suchinformation was not available to him.Terry has been criticized a great deal by both occultists and others for some ofhis conclusions, as I have mentioned, but a close reading of The Ultimate Eviland collation with other documentation of these cases shows that Terry has beenreliable where names, dates and places are concerned. He has reproduceddocumentation received from his informants and others, including Berkowitz, andthese bear out the basic facts of his theory: that there is (or was) anation-wide network of criminals either using satanic activity as a front, or asatanic cult using criminal activity to finance their operation. In any case,murder is an essential part of their business plan, either “for hire” or forreasons of ritual magic and sacrifice. There is no way some of his informantswould have had the information they had—in advance of any media accounts—unlessthey were “connected” in some way to the events described.Once Radin’s body had been found, Terry was notified and prepared to fly to LosAngeles to examine the crime scene himself, certain he was that Radin had beenpart of the Sam cult he was investigating. That is when he received another notefrom “Vinny,” who told him to look at the scene carefully, for the killers wouldhave left a cultic clue behind. Terry had a lot of clues in his hands, but untilRoy Radin’s body was found he didn’t know what to do with them. As the Radinmurder became news, Terry realized that the scenario fit all the details of thecult organization and activity he had been hearing about. He flew to Los Angelesand drove out to the canyons around Gorman, convinced he would find what Vinnyhad been telling him was there: evidence of cult involvement in the murder ofRoy Radin.And that is when he found the Bible, buried underneath a bush next to whereRadin’s body had been found, opened to the twenty-second chapter of Isaiah.The murder of Roy Radin, while solved, is not wholly explained. There was theangle that Laney Jacobs believed Radin had ripped off her drugs and cash to thetune of one million dollars; killing Radin would not get that money back and, infact, everyone knew who had taken the drugs anyway: Laney’s drug courier TallyRogers. Radin had been buying drugs from Rogers, but giving him checks made outto Laney Jacobs, making it clear that he expected Laney to be paid back for themoney Rogers stole from her. Thus, the drugs-and-cash angle for Radin’s murderdid not make a lot of sense: he was the only one playing straight with her onthat score.Then there was the movie angle. Was Radin murdered so that Laney Jacobs couldenjoy greater participation in the Evans venture? This is possible, of course,although it does give a whole new meaning to the phrase “termination clause.”Why was it necessary to kill Radin? In the first place, if Evans felt stronglyenough about having Jacobs involved in the production (perhaps due to herability to provide huge amounts of drug money to finance his projects) he couldhave simply given her part of his share rather than insisting that it come fromRadin’s end. Of course, that would mean less control for Evans and more forRadin, and that was unacceptable.So, Evans actually had a motive for getting rid of Radin; but he pled the FifthAmendment, answered no questions in court, and was never charged. Other thanJacobs and Evans, who else would have wanted Radin dead?The mystery man behind Laney Jacobs is, of course, Milan Bellechasses. It isreported in Steve Wick’s account of the murder that Bellechasses was quietlyinvolved in the Puerto Rican movie studio project with Radin and Evans, usinghis girlfriend Laney Jacobs as a front. Bellechasses thought that a movie dealwith the Puerto Rican government would enable him to launder drug money easily.Money laundering is an essential part of the drug trade: profits from the saleof illegal narcotics is collected in cash, and even one neighborhood in a busyAmerican city can net millions of dollars in cash profits in a single month.Counting this cash, transporting it and, eventually, banking it is an arduoustask which requires its own specialists and its own network of couriers,accountants and compliant banks in countries with flexible banking systems.According to this theory, Bellechasses would have viewed the Evans-Jacobs-Radinarrangement as tailor-made for his purposes. In order for this to work, he wouldhave to retain—through Laney Jacobs—a percentage of the company; a finder’s fee,such as Radin was offering, just wouldn’t work.Evans had to have known about this, and Wick’s book suggests as much (along witha disclaimer that Evans has denied knowing anything about this, even though hewas identified by Bill Mentzer on the witness stand as the man who gave theorders to kill Radin). Evans has never been convicted of a crime in connectionwith the Cotton Club murder, although he has been a suspect. On the basis of theinformation in Wick’s book and much else uncovered by Terry and others, I thinkit is safe to say of Evans that “the kid stays in the picture.”Wick also mentions that the name “Rodan” was given to Roy Radin by his neo-Nazikiller, Alex Marti, who also called Radin “a big, fat Jew.” Terry’s informant onthe East Coast knew the nickname Rodan before Radin was killed. Since Radin wasknown as “Rodan” to the Son of Sam cult (via Vinny’s information), the onlypossible conclusion to draw is that Marti and his partner Mentzer were eithermembers of that same cabal or had been hired guns of the cabal. All Terry neededto confirm the stories he had heard was proof at the crime scene of cultinvolvement, as the Sam cult usually left a “signature” behind.Terry, wandering around the Radin crime scene on two separate occasions, foundthe Bible on the last day of his visit to Los Angeles, steeling himself to digunder a bush close by the scene that had been overlooked by police. The Biblewas not buried in the sand, but simply sitting at the root of the bush, openedto the page mentioned above. It was straining credulity to believe that thepositioning of the Bible in that place, miles from civilization and in themiddle of the desert, was simply a coincidence. It had to have been planted. Asthe investigation progressed and Bill Mentzer, Alex Marti, Bob Lowe and,finally, Laney Jacobs were identified as the co-conspirators in the murder ofRoy Radin, it only made Terry more convinced that the Son of Sam cult was behindthe murder, and that there might have been other motives for Radin’s messyextermination.That “Vinny”and “Danny”—Terry’s prison informants—would have known details aboutRadin, Evans, Ocean Castle, Sisman, Berkowitz, drugs, videotaped sexual acts,and much else besides, clearly implies (but does not prove) that they were rightin other areas as well, including the satanic cult angle. The author himself canattest that Roy Radin had expressed interest in filming occult rituals beingperformed in Manhattan by the magicians and other self-styled sorcerers hangingout at the Magickal Childe bookstore on 19th Street, identified by Terry(although not by name) as an important locus for the Sam cult. And an addressbook in Berkowitz’ possession did show an entry for Ocean Castle. Sisman didintroduce Melonie Haller to Roy Radin, and Sisman and his girlfriend weremurdered on Halloween; police—aware of the relationship between the twomen—questioned Radin about the murder, but he claimed ignorance. Sisman was alsorumored to have in his possession the all-important Stacey Moscowitz murdervideotape ... if, indeed, such ever existed.RETURN OF THE FAMILYFor reasons why this murder neatly fits a theory of a nationwide satanic cult,we only have to look at Terry’s evidence concerning Bill Mentzer and his earlyyears in California, including his relationship to the Manson Family. Mentzer isa link that ties together not only Charles Manson and the Roy Radin murder, butalso those separate cases and the Son of Sam murders in New York City, as wellas other murders across the country. While the author does not wish to re-ignitethe “satanic cult hysteria” of the 1980s, it is important to look at thisevidence soberly, for the murders in question are not the key reasons why anunderstanding of the Manson/Sam cult is critical; rather, the murders—while vileenough in and of themselves—are only one aspect of the group’s activities.Bill Mentzer—Terry’s pick as “Manson II,” a much-rumored hitman with cultcredentials—has the necessary pedigree. According to Terry’s informants withinthe Los Angeles police, federal agencies, and the criminal subculture (very fewof whom are named, making independent corroboration or confirmation difficult ifnot at times impossible), Mentzer had been a friend of both Charles Manson and,most importantly, Abigail Folger in the late 1960s. Although much has been madeof the Sharon Tate murders, which were ghastly, the focus has been primarily onSharon Tate herself, her filmmaker husband Roman Polanski (who was in Europe atthe time of the killings), and Wojciech Frykowski, who was a known drug dealerand a friend of Polanski’s from their early days in Poland. There has not been alot of light shed on Abigail Folger, even though she was arguably the wealthiestperson among the victims, and had bankrolled numerous New Age-type projects inCalifornia in the 1960s.Heir to the Folger Coffee fortune, Abigail had made a practice of financingworthy causes, and these included the Himalayan Society (to which it is saidManson himself belonged) and the Straight Theater in San Francisco, which wasthe scene of the famous Magick Powerhouse of Oz performance that broughttogether Kenneth Anger and Bobby Beausoleil, as well as other Manson Familymembers. An informant who had penetrated the anti-war movement in America onbehalf of the federal government told Terry that he had been present at a mealthat included Abigail Folger and Bill Mentzer. Mentzer obviously had a soft spotfor the counter-culture, for he wound up working for Hustler publisher LarryFlynt later on in the ’70s.While Mentzer had a criminal record and had been involved in questionable andillegal activity for a while, what does not ring true about Mentzer being themuch-vaunted “Manson II” is that, for a hitman, he evidently has a rather weakstomach. On each occasion where we know Mentzer was present at or committed amurder he had to drink himself into the role. That is, he had to be pretty drunkbefore he could carry out the killings, whereas his associates—men likeArgentine assassin Alex Marti—carried out these missions with glee, and neededno “Dutch courage” to get them in the mood. In the case of Roy Radin, it isagreed that Mentzer did not fire the shot that killed the producer. It was Martiwho fired some twenty-seven rounds into Radin’s skull; Mentzer only deliveredthe twenty-eighth and final shot, a kind of coup de grace, and that only afterhe had been drinking. While he may have been a willing hitman—at leasttheoretically—it would take him some time to work up the nerve. This does notsound like a “Manson II,” but it is possible I am reading too much into thesobriquet for, after all, Manson himself was never convicted of actuallycommitting a murder, but only of having ordered them to be carried out. If theManson killings were murder-for-hire, Manson acting on instructions from anothersource, then the Mentzer killings were certainly hired hits. The murder of RoyRadin was carried out on Laney Jacobs’ instructions. Another murder, that of atransvestite in Los Angeles who was allegedly blackmailing a wealthy family, wasalso murder-for-hire, a contract fulfilled by Mentzer.Thus, we have to look a little deeper into the Manson and Mentzer killings tounderstand that they were not the result of crazed dope fiends going on a murderspree, but possibly contracted killings, paid for or at least ordered by personor persons unknown. In the case of Roy Radin and the Los Angeles transvestite,the contracts are clear. They were murders for specific motives. In the case ofthe Manson Family, we do not know who contracted the Tate/La Bianca killings (ifindeed they were contracted), but, on the basis of much evidence and assortedtestimony by those close to the case, we are safe in making the generalassumption that Manson was carrying out assassinations at the behest of others.That Manson and Mentzer knew each other in California in the 1960s is nowvirtually a certainty. That they were both involved in cult activity is alsosomething for which Terry makes a very good case. We have already lookedcarefully at Manson’s career and his cult involvements, which are beyonddispute. In addition, Terry has Mentzer not only friendly with both CharlesManson and Abigail Folger, but in the days after the Manson killings he placesMentzer at cult sites in California, Texas, and on the East Coast.If we understand that the Son of Sam killings also included some specific hits,possibly ordered by an organized crime lord (as intimated by David Berkowitzhimself, who has never avoided responsibility for his participation in thesemurders), and if we understand that Manson, Mentzer and Berkowitz are linkedquite specifically via their respective cults, we have to come to theinescapable conclusion that a cult exists whose members are available forcontract killings, and that this cult has existed since at least the late 1960sthrough the late 1970s, and likely beyond. We have also to understand that someof the Son of Sam killings were cult sacrifices, chosen to take place on daysselected in advance according to an occult calendar or to some other, moreesoteric, method. These killings were probably arranged to “blood” the newrecruits: to acquaint them with the act of murder and to win their loyaltythrough fear of exposure to the authorities. This implies a well-organized anddisciplined operation with, indeed, national coverage, as murders connected tothis cult have taken place all over the United States.As we mentioned, however, murder is only one aspect of this cult’s activities.Drug-running is another, and probably provides much of the operating income forthe group. Prostitution—both male and female, adult and child—is also a functionof the group, as well as pornography and particularly child pornography.While we have looked at both the Manson-Mentzer-Berkowitz connections and theRobert Evans-Laney Jacobs-Mentzer connections, what the reader may findstartling are connections to still yet another group of organized killers anddrug runners, the infamous “Company.”When Laney Jacobs was asked about her sources of income, she would usually tellpeople that she had made investments in the Suzy Creamcheese line of women’sfashions and was a part-owner of the franchise which was famous in Las Vegas andamong Hollywood celebrities. We don’t know if Jacobs did indeed own a piece ofthe Suzy Creamcheese action, but she is known to have taken friends to visit LasVegas and stay at Suzy Creamcheese owner Leslie DeKeyser’s house, and to buythem clothes at the boutique. Jacobs spent a lot of time traveling to Vegas fromboth Florida and California, and we remember that Bob Evans was trying to raisemoney from casino owners there, the Doumani brothers.Suzy Creamcheese had another illustrious client, and this will lead us back toAshland, Kentucky and—strangely enough—back to Bob Evans, drugs, and murder.This time the main character is a bizarre figure who was part-commando,part-mystic, and total criminal, a man who leaped to his death on September 11,1985, when his parachute didn’t open because the $75-million worth of cocaine hehad strapped to his body proved too heavy: Andrew Carter “Drew” Thornton II.THE BLUEGRASS CONSPIRACYSuzy Creamcheese was the brainchild of one Leslie DeKeyser, a flamboyant manwith outrageous taste in fashion who created outfits that even a Vegas showgirlmight have been embarrassed to wear. (The name came from a famous Frank Zappasong, whose most memorable lyric “Suzy Creamcheese, what’s got into you?” becamea rallying cry for a certain type of hippie-chick/rock groupie of the 1960s.)Although he boasted such … luminaries as Charo and Cher among his satisfiedcustomers, his most devoted client was one Anita Madden, nee Myers, a woman whowas raised in Ashland, Kentucky on the wrong side of the tracks, but who clawedher way to the top by marrying the heir to the Madden horse-raising fortune.Sharing a great deal in common with Laney Jacobs, another poor white Southerngirl who made it a habit to marry wealthy men, Anita Madden’s parties becamescandalous affairs in the late 1960s (and through to 1998, the year of the lastMadden Kentucky Derby-Eve bash), with Ms. Madden decked out in the latest SuzyCreamcheese outrage, all leathers and feathers, and surrounding herself withshow business and sports personalities, in a determined effort to invade andhold hostage the society columns of the Kentucky newspapers, struggling againstthose other blue-blooded clans, the Whitneys, the Vanderbilts, and theBarnstables who looked down their noses at the noisy bottle-blonde with thetrashy, Frederick’s of Hollywood couture. Ms. Creamcheese “herself ” would showup at these galas—particularly the pre-Derby extravaganzas that are a mainstayof Kentucky society—resplendent in whips and chains, while nude mermaids andmuscular men in sadomasochistic gear wandered the grounds of Madden’s estate,Hamburg Place, making sure all the guests were properly lubricated.All of this is recounted in greater and fascinating detail in investigativejournalist Sally Denton’s The Bluegrass Conspiracy, and it makes for compellingreading, especially as we begin to come across familiar names and suggestivetime frames.For instance, we don’t know if Laney Jacobs and Anita Madden ever met; we doknow that one of Anita Madden’s closest friends married one of Laney Jacobs’husbands, however. Although Laney Jacobs herself is not mentioned in Denton’swork, even though her story dovetails neatly with that book’sdrugs-murder-conspiracy saga, and neither is her lover and putative fiancé BobEvans, Phyllis George makes an important appearance, she who was once married tothe Hollywood producer. The Laney Jacobs-Suzy Creamcheese-Anita Madden nexuscatapults us to the Laney Jacobs-Robert Evans-Phyllis George nexus and theCotton Club murder, with Kentucky Fried Chicken along the way.Confused?Like her compatriot, Charles Manson, Anita Madden grew from a poor whitebackground in Ashland to become figurative head of a social demimonde thatrejoiced in free love, drugs, and dangerous alliances. While Charlie’s girlswere putting out in hot, dirt-floor shacks in the desert for Charlie’sunhygienic guests—usually the Hell’s Angels or some other motorcycle gangrunning LSD and pot through the American landscape like Wells Fargo on angeldust—Anita Madden’s parties were a bit more upscale, the guests generallybathed, and the Dom was always properly chilled. But beneath the social registerveneer lay the same sinister forces that suppurated so openly among the Family.While Charlie courted Terry Melcher and the Beach Boys on the West Coast, AnitaMadden was hosting Sissy Spacek, Ann-Margaret, Connie Stevens and Larry Flynt(employer of convicted Radin assassins Bill Mentzer and Alex Marti) in Kentucky;but for both there was violence and bloodshed just below the surface. At theend, there would be many dead—both the innocent and the guilty—including thefirst assassination of a federal judge in a hundred years. And we willincredibly find ourselves back at Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963, with a wispof smoke rising from the Grassy Knoll.The complex mystery begins with a bizarre paramilitary operation known as the“Company” a nickname not to be confused with that of the CIA … maybe. As itturns out, the Company was involved in more than what was originally suspectedby Kentucky law enforcement, which was drug-running, pure and simple. SallyDenton’s book is virtually the only text anywhere that exposes this operation,and Ms. Denton found herself being squeezed out of mainstream journalism largelydue to her insistence (and evidence) that Kentucky politics was dirty with drugand arms deals. Ms. Denton again went against the establishment with heroft-cited piece “The Crimes of Mena” (co-authored with Roger Morris), an articleon a covert government drugs- and arms-smuggling operation, an exposé that wasspiked by the Washington Post at the last minute, and wound up instead in thepages of Penthouse. The Mena article is an account of an Iran-Contra operationin the tiny town of Mena, Arkansas during the Reagan-Bush years, while BillClinton was governor of the state. Denton would go on to investigate both thecriminal history of Las Vegas (also co-authored with Roger Morris) as well asthe Mormon Mountain Meadows Massacre of September 11, 1857, thus illustratingonce again that independent investigation into America’s history keeps pullingone back to the same topics.Kentucky has a tradition of smuggling that goes back more than a century, makingit the Paraguay of the South. With the Ohio River on one side and the Big Sandyon the other, and a stretch of the Mississippi on the western border, Kentuckyhas seen more than its share of strange water traffic, with contraband runningas far south as the Gulf of Mexico. Running slaves, then liquor, and finallydrugs and guns, Kentucky’s history as a smuggler’s state is almost genteel,serving as an unofficial frontier between the Northeast, the South and theWestern parts of the United States.The police investigation of the Company revealed a state whose politics— fromthe Governor’s Mansion on down through the various local and state policedepartments—was corrupt to the extent that its reputation is only surpassed bythat of Louisiana and Rhode Island. There were so many former and current lawenforcement officers as part of the Company that for a while many investigatorswere under the assumption that it was a covert federal operation, perhapssomething linked to arms deals with the Contras. Indeed, Iran-Contra figureAdnan Khashoggi makes an appearance in this story, too, as a frequent visitor toKentucky whose own company’s name—the Triad Corporation—was echoed in the nameof the farm that served as the Company’s headquarters: Triad. The logo of theTriad Farm was a pitchfork, and locals insisted to police and federalinvestigators that it was used not only for paramilitary training but was alsothe headquarters of a satanic cult.44 In fact, it was during the search for amissing friend of Company members, Melanie Flynn (sister of baseball player DougFlynn of the Mets and later the Cincinnati Reds), that a psychic was eventuallycalled in, and without prompting led police to the site where they privatelybelieved Flynn had been killed; the same psychic told the investigators that shebelieved a cult was behind the murder. She identified Drew Thornton as one ofthe persons responsible for Flynn’s murder, and the heavy occult “vibes” shereceived chilled her to the bone.There is a strong tradition linking Kentucky and the casinos of Las Vegas.Kentuckians are inveterate gamblers; after all, their state boasts theprestigious Kentucky Derby, and many fortunes are won and lost on a single race.Several important Vegas casinos were run by Kentuckians, and they favored peoplefrom their home state as dealers in their employ. There is also a link betweenKentucky and Florida, and that is the drug trade.In the 1970s, Kentucky became infamous for activity of the Company, a network ofillegal trade in drugs, arms and prostitution. The Company was largely composedof former law enforcement officers, and had intelligence resources high up inseveral federal agencies, notably the Drug EnforcementAgency, or DEA. It was widely rumored that the Company had CIA connections, andthat they were part of the infrastructure that eventually began supplying theContras in the 1980s. With planeloads of weapons and high-technology gear suchas night-vision scopes and other James Bond paraphernalia (either stolen from USmilitary bases such as China Lake, or actually supplied by the government, thetruth is a little hard to find), the materiel wound up supporting Latin Americanmilitary regimes, and the planes would fly back into the United States withshipments of marijuana and, later, cocaine. Shipments worth millions of dollarsa flight.One of the central figures of this organization—believed by federal agents tohave been the most dangerous, most highly-organized and tightly-controlledillegal operation in the country—was Drew Thornton, a former Lexington, Kentuckypolice officer and martial arts specialist. Thornton’s parents were Northerners;his father was from New Jersey and his mother from Connecticut, but theyassimilated quickly into Kentucky society by the expedient of raising racehorseson a small ranch near the town of Paris. Thornton joined the Army at the time ofthe Vietnam conflict, and then rotated back to the States and became a policeofficer, eventually working Narcotics as well as Intelligence. He formedalliances at this time with an entire brotherhood of police officers who had noproblem with selling the dope they confiscated, usually long before it made itsway to the evidence locker.The Lexington police department became notorious for dirty cops during thisperiod, and evidence began to accumulate showing that they were actually beingprotected by the local DEA chief, giving rise to speculation that the “dirtycops” were working on a larger, more covert, operation on behalf of the DEA and,possibly, the CIA; conversely, other speculation was simpler and more direct:the DEA chief in Kentucky was corrupt. The reality is probably a combination ofboth.At various times in her book, Denton mentions the fact that Drew Thorntonbelieved himself possessed of supernatural powers, but she does not delve anydeeper into this except to imply that it was a mélange of Asian mysticism andmartial arts philosophy, and that Thornton had become a kind of David Carradine(of television series Kung Fu fame) at least in his own mind. (His first wifealso professed to be psychic, able to predict future events.) This mysticism waswedded to his paramilitary exploits, and his Triad Farm became a venue for bothoccult practices of some description and commando training. It was also a centerfor the trade in illegal narcotics, and more than one eyewitness reported seeingaircraft flying low over Triad and dropping bundles that were believed to bedrugs. In other cases, federal agencies reported suspicions that arms, includingtanks, were being smuggled into and out of Triad Farm. When State Policeinvestigator Ralph Ross attempted to learn more, he was warned off the case byLexington police officers … even though they had no jurisdiction over theterritory. Ross was eventually set up by his own men in a desperate effort tosilence him, and thus remove the threat of an investigation which was lappinggently around the doorway to the Governor’s Mansion.The investigation into the clandestine affairs of the Company eventually went ashigh as the governor of the state, who at the time was John Y. Brown, asuccessful Democratic businessman who had parlayed the Kentucky Fried Chickenfranchise into a hugely successful operation (and would later become involvedwith Kenny Rogers Roasters and the Roadhouse Grill franchises). Harlan Sanders,who had created Kentucky Fried Chicken and become an honorary “Colonel” in theprocess, harbored ill feelings towards the deal, believing that he had beencheated out of money that was rightfully his. “Colonel” Sanders had developedthe business from a mom-and-pop operation to over six hundred outlets by 1963.In 1964, John Y. Brown arranged a buyout of Sanders, a deal in which the“Colonel” felt manipulated into selling, and said as much to the newspapers.45The deal, however, made Brown a multimillionaire once he brought the companypublic, and he gave jobs in KFC to friends of his who would later becomenotorious in the Company investigation, including Dan Chandler and JimmyLambert. Chandler would become an “unindicted co-conspirator,” and Lambert wouldface a criminal indictment over the affair. They were all part of the AnitaMadden social circuit, including Governor Brown himself.There were (and are) other “social circuits” in Kentucky society, of course, andMadden was viewed as something of an interloper at first, her personal pedigreenot being up to the local standards of old money and Southern antebellumaristocracy. But Anita was a force to be reckoned with, as she trucked in thebodybuilders and the strippers and the rock bands and the outrageous costumesand “theme” parties. It was to this particular circuit that we trace all themovers and shakers of the Company and its ancillary characters and operations,however, and not to the Vanderbilts, Whitneys or Barnstables. There is a certaincachet that comes from having worked your way up from the bottom, a certainpragmatic if not pugnacious view of life and how best to meet its challenges,that attracts the adventurer, the politician, and the criminal. Also, thebusiness of the Madden dynasty was the raising of thoroughbred horses, not anindustry defined by the mint julep and the shy Southern belle, but by hardchoices and fierce competition. Thus, it was to Anita Madden and her HamburgPlace estate (and what they represented) that men like Brown, Chandler, Lambert,Barry Bryant and Drew Thornton would gravitate.Brown was married to former Miss America Phyllis George (after her divorce fromproducer Robert Evans), united by their mutual love of sports. Brown would go onto become owner of various ball teams, and Ms. George would go on to be atelevision announcer. They would eventually divorce after some twenty years ofmarriage, and Brown would go on to marry (anddivorce) another beauty pageant queen in the late 1990s.The story of the Company is much too long and complex to be discussed here inits entirety, and readers are urged to find a copy of The Bluegrass Conspiracyand prepare to be stunned at the breadth and depth of political corruption thatreaches from the bottom-feeder nickle-bag street dealers to the cops who bustthem and on up to Colombian drug lords, crooked DEA chiefs, and gun-runningmercenaries and suspect spooks. The time frame of The Bluegrass Conspiracyparallels that of the Son of Sam killings and the Roy Radin murder, however, andstretches across the same real estate: South Florida cocaine circles, theMedellin cartel, Las Vegas money-laundering, the use of prostitutes to blackmailpolitical leaders, and the rise of Los Angeles as cocaine-central after Miami.We have David Berkowitz in Kentucky preaching on street corners at the same timeDrew Thornton is busting radicals and dope dealers there, in an eerie replay ofthe Jim Jones and Dan Mitrione “relationship” in Indiana; we have Laney Jacobsstaying with Suzy Creamcheese founder Leslie DeKeyser at the latter’s home inLas Vegas, at the same time that she is plotting the Roy Radin murder and isinvolved with Robert Evans46; Leslie DeKeyser is also an intimate of AnitaMadden and a regular at her parties; Laney will later marry Larry Greenberger, afamous South Florida cocaine dealer and lieutenant of Medellin cartelnarcotraficante Carlos Lehder Rivas; Greenberger himself is later murderedeither by his wife, Laney, or by one of her lovers, before she herself isarrested and convicted for her role in the Radin homicide. We have Larry Flynt,the man who employed Radin assassins Bill Mentzer and Alex Marti, attendingAnita Madden’s pre-Derby parties at Hamburg Place … and we have theassassination of federal judge John Wood at the orders of drug kingpin JimmyChagra, an assassination carried out by hitman Charles Harrelson, father ofactor Woody Harrelson (“Woody” on the television sit-com Cheers, who laterportrayed a serial killer in Oliver Stone’s Natural Born Killers and … LarryFlynt, in The People vs. Larry Flynt). When arrested, Charles Harrelson willconfess to having been the man on the grassy knoll in Dallas on November 22,1963; he will confess to having assassinated President John F. Kennedy. He willquickly retract that confession on the advice of his attorney, and he has neverspoken about it again.The assassination of US District Judge “Maximum” John Wood took place on May 29,1979 in San Antonio, Texas, on the day that Jimmy Chagra was due to appear inhis courtroom for the beginning of his trial on charges of drug trafficking.Jimmy Chagra was an American of Lebanese ancestry whose brother, Lee Chagra, hadbeen a famous defense attorney for drug dealers, until a drug bust in 1973attracted the attention of the DEA. Jimmy Chagra eventually began running hisbrother’s operation—which included masterminding a drug operation that extendedfrom Lebanon to South America, an operation that used Caesars Palace in LasVegas as its unofficial headquarters.At the time, Caesars was being managed by Dan Chandler, the friend of KentuckyGovernor John Brown, to whom he owed the position. Chandler would introduce theChagra brothers to Barry Bryant and Drew Thornton, the two partners running theCompany. The Chagras were tied to the more prosaic organized-crime families ofthe Patriarcas in New England and Spilotros of Chicago,47 so the meeting andeventual partnership between the Chagras and the Company signaled a crime empirethat would literally span the globe and extend the reach of both organizationsconsiderably, with old-time Vegas-style Mafia wheeling and dealing on the onehand, and “New Age” paramilitary and covert ops on the other. In addition,federal officials believed that the Chagras also had ties to Middle Easternterrorist organizations, ties that probably involved the trade in heroin fromMideast markets such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Levant.48By 1978, it was virtually impossible to tell the two operations apart. JimmyChagra was experiencing a lot of heat from federal attention, leaving theCompany to take advantage of his organized-crime connections and growexponentially. They developed important links with the intelligence community,as they crossed paths in the underground world of arms dealing and moneylaundering, and of course the international trade in narcotics.Then, on December 23, 1978, Lee Chagra was murdered, the victim of a .22 calibrebullet fired at close range in his law office.A few months later, and his brother Jimmy would be arrested on four counts ofdrug trafficking from Colombia, his bail set at one million dollars.Then, on the day he was due to go to trial, his mortal enemy—Judge John Wood—wasassassinated, killed by a single shot from a sniper’s rifle. According to FBIDirector William Webster, it was “the crime of the century” (which probablyshows their bias when it comes to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, RobertF. Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, Medgar Evers, Malcolm X … etc., etc. ).As the investigation into the judge’s assassination progressed from Chagra,Bryant and others involved with the Company, a suspect was eventually identifiedand arrested, a man who confessed to the killing: Charles Voyde Harrelson.When Harrelson was arrested, he also confessed to the assassination of JFK, and,indeed, photographs of the famous “three hoboes” arrested that day in Dallas doseem to show a somewhat younger Harrelson in the lineup, and forensic expertsfrom the Houston Police Department evidently agree. A book written about theassassination and focusing on one of the other co-conspirators—Charles Rogers—byJohn R. Craig and Philip A. Rogers tells the story in some detail. 49Although itlacks documentation and source material, and for that reason cannot be taken as“gospel,” it does name names and gives dates and places for many of the eventsdescribed, particularly those leading up to Dallas in November 1963.Harrelson’s life as a professional hitman is not in question. He had beenarrested for various crimes involving firearms all his life, and was anacknowledged killer in several unrelated cases. He is presently in prison forthe rest of his life, due to the Judge Wood assassination. He has refused todiscuss anything more about the Kennedy assassination after that one day inwhich he admitted he was on the grassy knoll with another assassin, suspectedmurderer Charles Rogers.Rogers came to the attention of researchers because of the murder of his parentson Father’s Day, June 20, 1965 in Houston. They had been murdered anddismembered, some body parts flushed down the drains and the rest stuffed in therefrigerator, wrapped in plastic, à la Jeffrey Dahmer. Rogers, who lived withhis parents, was nowhere to be found and would never be found again. Accordingto the authors, his parents had been killed because they suspected their son’sinvolvement in the assassination. This was due to—again, according to theauthors—both Charles Harrelson and Lee Harvey Oswald turning up one day inSeptember 1963 at the parents’ church a few blocks away, asking to wait therefor a mysterious “Carlos” who would turn up later: a “Carlos” who knew theminister and his wife very well.The day after the Kennedy assassination, the minister and his wife recognizedthe photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald as the “Lee” who had visited them a fewmonths earlier. They already knew who “Carlos” was, as they spotted him outsidethe church talking with Oswald and Harrelson. It was their congregants’ son,Charles Rogers.The authors make many connections between Charles Rogers and David Ferrie, LeeHarvey Oswald, Charles Harrelson, the Civil Air Patrol, the CIA, etc., evengoing so far as to tie Rogers in with the man who executed Che Guevara inBolivia. Some of the data is verifiable, such as Rogers enlistment in the Navy,his work for ONI (the Office of Naval Intelligence), and his academic career, aswell as his brief employment with Shell Oil before his ostensible recruitment bythe CIA. Although Rogers was obviously a suspect in the murder of his parents,he was never sought by authorities and the case remains open and unsolved tothis day. Not so the John Wood assassination, however, for which CharlesHarrelson is doing life without parole in Marion.Years later, Sally Denton would return to the drugs and arms conspiracies of theSouth with her fabled article in Penthouse, co-authored with Dr. Roger Morris, aHarvard professor who had worked in the National Security Council during boththe Johnson and the Nixon administrations. Ms. Denton herself was head of UPI’sinvestigative unit and had written for the Washington Post and other mainstreammedia before the guns-for-drugs conspiracy among Kentucky’s law enforcementelite grabbed her attention, and lost her the support of the system. “The Crimesof Mena” tells the story of Barry Seal, an admitted drug smuggler who—as allevidence now shows beyond any shadow of a doubt—worked for the federalgovernment, specifically for the CIA and the DEA and possibly other agencies aswell, at the same time he was running drugs from South America. Later, he wouldbe murdered by the Medellin cartel in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he wasgiving evidence against the drug lords. Seal was part of an operation that wasset in motion by forces within the White House that wanted to support theContras in Nicaragua by any means necessary, an operation that became known tothe world at large when another smuggler, Eugene Hasenfus, was shot down overNicaraguan airspace in a plane that was once owned and flown by Barry Seal. Thetrail of drugs and arms smuggling led from that Hasenfus crash along a moralfault line that terminated at Oliver North and the Iran-Contra scandal.The Denton/Morris article never mentions Kentucky and the famous “Company” ofDrew Thornton detailed in Denton’s earlier book on the Bluegrass Conspiracy, butthe conclusion is inescapable. All of the theories being tossed around at thetime of the Company investigation by federal investigators included the sameguns-for-drugs scenario that eventually defined the Barry Seal case and, indeed,both operations were running concurrently … if they were, in fact, differentoperations and not part of a single, overall clandestine project to finance andsupply the anti-Sandinista forces in Nicaragua using funds provided by the saleof cocaine in the United States.Nothing more has been heard of Mena. The right-wing cartel in the United Stateshas tried to pin the blame on Bill Clinton, of course, claiming that since hewas Governor of Arkansas at the time that Barry Seal was using the small town ofMena as the headquarters for his vast criminal empire he should have donesomething about it. The blame backfired, however, when it was realized that thiswas a program begun under the Reagan and Bush administrations and could notproperly be laid at the Governor’s door. (In fact, readers may remember thestory of Larry Nichols, the man fired by then-Governor Clinton because he wasusing the state’s telephones to raise money for the Contras, and who laterparlayed his termination into the “Clinton Chronicles,” financed by RichardMellon Scaife.) Those who insisted that Clinton should have done something aboutMena when he was governor miss the essential element in all of this: the BarrySeal operation had the blessing of the White House. As Denton and Morris makevery clear, nothing connected to Seal could be investigated: not by the FBI, notby the IRS, not by US Customs, not by the DEA … by no one. Had Clinton forcedthe issue and brought it to the attention of the media, he would have beenpilloried by the very same people who now blame him for not doing so, the peoplewho believe that Oliver North is a hero, that ignoring Congressional regulationssuch as the Boland Amendment was admirable, and that Iran-Contra was justified.And so it goes.David Berkowitz.

Andbehind it all, a vast criminal enterprise that had its roots in the White Houseand its branches in nearly every state in the Union, and in so many LatinAmerican countries that it was a virtual NAFTA agreement, so much so that the“loud, sucking sound” so beloved of independent candidate H. Ross Perot’saborted 1992 presidential campaign may have been nothing more than lines of cokebeing hoovered up the collective American nose.These are the trivia, the minutiae that give conspiracy theorists anxietyattacks, and for which there is no satisfying explanation other than theubiquitous “coincidence,” a word that is meaningless because it is supposed tobe meaningless: a word intended to represent a pointless concurrence of twoevents, which presupposes that events can occur at the same time or the sameplace or to the same people, or some combination of these, and yet have nopossible relation to each other. It is a way of avoiding a question and, byextension, the uncomfortable answer to that question. Yet, they are “links” inthe Brunoesque sense of the word, in Coulianu’s sense of the word. They may bethought of as synchronistic, in Jung’s sense of the word. Something at the edgeof quantum physics, perhaps, or something peculiar to depth psychology or socialanthropology.Or they may be evidence of genuine political and criminal conspiracy.Or something darker, more dangerous: a sinister force that has festeredwithin the soul of America for many, many years.Sometimes I think there’s a buried maniac who runs the mind of this city.

But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led tobelieve the unknown flying objects are nonsense.—Rear Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, former Director of the CIA, in a memorandumto Congress dated August 22, 1960The UFOs reported by competent observers are devices under intelligent control.…These UFOs are interplanetary devices systematically observing the earth, eithermanned or under remote control, or both.—Colonel Joseph J. Bryan III, Chief and Founder of the CIA’sPsychological Warfare Staff, former Special Assistant to the Secretary of theAir Force, in a 1960 letter to Major Donald KeyhoeWe deal now not with things of this world alone. We deal now with the ultimateconflict between a unified human race and the sinister forces of some otherplanetary galaxy.—General Douglas MacArthur, 1962We can study files for decades, but every so often we are tempted to throw upour hands and declare that history is merely another literary genre: the past isautobiographical fiction pretending to be a parliamentary report.—Julian Barnes1…given that in the course of history many have acted on beliefs in which manyothers did not believe, we must perforce admit that for each, to a differentdegree, history has been largely the theater of an illusion.—Umberto Eco2For not all true things are to be said to all men.—Bishop Clement of Alexandria (c. A.d. 150-215)At the very heart of the UFO controversy is the question of Truth. Like thefictional FBI Agent of X-Files, Fox Mulder, we are inclined to believe that “theTruth is out there,” but even Mulder eventually lost the faith. That is the cruxof the problem, isn’t it? Faith?Many Christians do not realize that the parameters of their faith wereestablished by the Council of Nicea in 325 A.d., a Council controlled by EmperorConstantine through his emissary Bishop Eusebius. In other words, a politicalleader would decide core issues of what would become a world religion. ThisCouncil decided the question of Jesus’ divinity once and for all, and it was themen who composed this Council who decided which texts would comprise both theOld and the New Testaments. The decision—which resulted in the modern HolyBible—was both a religious and a political issue. To summarize, doctrines heldby groups believed not to be “team players” were denounced as heretical, and therelevant texts omitted from the final Scripture. Especially dangerous to thedevelopment of a “state church”—which is what Constantine was creating, eventhough he would not actually become baptized until his death bed—was thephenomenon of Gnosticism. Gnostics embraced the Christian message, but in a wayinimical to authority. They believed that everyone should approach God directly.As Biblical scholar Elaine Pagels writes,… when we examine its practical effect on the Christian movement, we can see,paradoxically, that the doctrine of bodily resurrection also serves an essentialpolitical function: it legitimizes the authority of certain men who claim toexercise exclusive leadership over the churches as the successors of the apostlePeter. From the second century, the doctrine has served to validate theapostolic succession of bishops, the basis of papal authority to this day.(emphasis in original)3She goes on to clarify:… orthodox teaching … legitimized a hierarchy of persons through whose authorityall others must approach God. Gnostic teaching … was potentially subversive ofthis order: it claimed to offer to every initiate direct access to God of whichthe priests and bishops themselves might be ignorant.4And:… when gnostic and orthodox Christians discussed the nature of God, they were atthe same time debating the issue of spiritual authority. (emphasis in original)5Thus, matters as diverse as the Nicene Creed, which emphasizes the physicalreality of Jesus’ resurrection, and the actual books included in the Bible, werethe result of political issues being decided at the time: an attempt to create astate religion with an identifiable hierarchy that was amenable to control.Obviously, a religion in which every member had direct access to God was athreat not only to the concept of an ecclesiastical hierarchy, but was alsosubversive of the State itself. How could any person with direct access to Godalso pay the appropriate homage to a temporal leader, to an Emperor? Thus,matters of faith and matters of truth became tools to be used in order tomanipulate the citizenry.Bishop Clement of Alexandria, quoted above, a powerful figure in second centuryChristianity, wrote pragmatically on the question of truth and faith. Like anancient precursor to Machiavelli, Clement understood that truth was dangerousand not to be entrusted to just anybody. Clement’s fears about the specialvolatility of truth may be evidence of some deeper, darker secret at the heartof Christianity, a secret to which he was privy. As we uncover more scrolls anddecipher more arcane texts from Biblical times, often against enormousopposition from the Church (as described in Baigent and Leigh’s The Dead SeaScroll Deception),6 we are gradually getting used to the idea that the last twothousand years of Western history may have been based on a magician’s trick, abit of misdirection and legerdemain, concealing a closely-guarded secret ofwhich underground societies and some high-level clerics have long been aware.What does this have to do with UFOs?No, I am not about to insist that Jesus was an astronaut or some kind of spacealien. What I am going to suggest is that we in the West have become accustomedto accepting a great deal at face value, on “faith.” After all, we are heirs toeasily the most bizarre set of beliefs among all the world’s major religions:that a man—or someone who seemed very much like a man—was executed inRoman-occupied Palestine two thousands years ago, and then rose from the dead,disappearing after a short time into the heavens. Christians are required tobelieve this; it is central to their faith and is represented in the NiceneCreed, and in the celebration of the Mass (or Divine Liturgy) in which believingChristians partake of the body and blood of Jesus, substances that have beentransformed from bread and wine through some occult agency, thus adding a formof cannibalism to the already heady mix of crucifixion and resurrection. When itcomes to Jesus, Muslims are ready to accept him as a prophet; when it comes tohis resurrection, they demur. The same with the Jews. But there are over abillion people in the world who believe—or who belong to religious sects whichinsist they believe—that Jesus was born of woman, lived to the age of 33, thenwas crucified, experienced death, was buried, and rose from his tomb “on thethird day,” or actually about 39 hours after he was taken down from the cross.The Swiss psychoanalyst and philosopher C.G. Jung once commented thatChristianity had, in effect, turned the Western world schizoid. Forced to acceptan impossibility as the truth, and forced in turn to repress natural instinctsin the service of this impossibility. Western civilization since the time ofConstantine has been struggling with itself. To complicate matters, the doctrineof Original Sin—that all humans are born with a blemish of sin on their soul dueto the original defection of Adam and Eve—means that we are all guilty, frombirth; indeed, we are also guilty to some extent of the sufferings and death ofJesus, who “died for our sins.” Christians, and especially Roman Catholics, areawash in guilt, and conflicted over their true desires and the extent to whichthose desires are at odds with Christian doctrines of personal behavior and sin.Yet, to deny the Risen Christ (or to refute any of these individual doctrines)was to invite personal disaster in the form of Inquisition and the stake. Thus,many otherwise decent and intelligent people learned to dissemble from a veryearly age. They learned to lie, either to themselves or to others, in order tosurvive.But … miracles do happen. Strange things do occur. And to deny the Risen Christmay be to throw out the Baby with the baptismal water. If we insist thatresurrection from the dead is an impossibility in this world, do we entertainthe idea—even for a moment—that it might be a reality in another world? Do weinsist that the “real world” we see around us is the one, sole, objective truthand there is no other even though we know—intellectually—that what we experiencewith our senses is largely a creation of our nervous systems? When we say thatresurrection is impossible, upon what do we base that assumption?Upon science. Upon scientific evidence. Thus the war between science andreligion, a war that reached its climax in the Renaissance, when the occult, themystical, made one last brave attempt to redeem civilization for the dreamers,the artists, the believers.Belief is love. The very English word “belief ” is related to the German verblieben (“to love”). To believe something is to hold dear that idea, to prefer itto others, to feel emotional about it, maybe even passionate. That is why “truebelievers” scare us so much: they seem to have abandoned rational thought and tohave fallen in love with a fantasy.Bishop Clement was very clear about this, in his own way:For even if they should say something true, one who loves the Truth should not,even so, agree with them. For not all true things are the Truth; nor should thattruth which seems true according to human opinions be preferred to the trueTruth—that according to the faith.7We can see the seeds of the Baltimore Catechism being sown even then! The “trueTruth”—according to the good bishop—is that “according to the faith.”This is why we have such a difficult time resolving the UFO issue. EugeneHasenfus was shot down over Nicaragua during his mission to supply theanti-Sandinista Contras. He was part of a wide-ranging network of self-anointedpatriots and right-wing zealots who were championed by General Singlaub and thevarious Republican Party ethnic outreach groups. (Incidentally, Clintonantagonist Larry Nichols was a self-admitted member of one of these groups).Hasenfus is the sort of man typified by “Jack D. Ripper,” the commander incharge of an Air Force Base in the Peter Sellers comedy Dr. Strangelove, whobelieves fluoridation of water to be a Communist plot to deprive Americans oftheir “precious bodily fluids,” and thus instigates World War III. In Hasenfus’possession were documents linking him to Area 51 in Nevada.Area 51 is the scene of a great deal of controversy among the UFO enthusiasts,as they believe that captured alien spacecraft are taken there to be“re-engineered” by American engineers and scientists. Another engineer, one BobLazar, has insisted that he himself witnessed this procedure in operation atArea 51.Area 51—known as Groom Lake, and Dreamland, and a host of other appellations—iswithout a doubt a top-secret US Air Force facility where, it is said, “stealth”bombers and other military aircraft are designed and tested. The facility is sosecret that for years the government would not even admit it existed, eventhough its presence there was announced by the barbed wire fencing and thewarning signs advising that anyone breaching security would be shot.Why a member of the Contra supply network would have connections of any kind toArea 51 is a question that has not yet been answered. Hasenfus was a pilot and amercenary; he was not an aerospace scientist with a top-secret classification.We are in the uncomfortable position of having two mysteries wrapped around eachother, and neither giving us much room for deduction: first, we don’t reallyknow what is going on at Area 51, so we can’t imagine what Hasenfus would bedoing flying over Nicaragua for the Contras and having Area 51 phone numbers inhis possession; in the second place, we don’t know much about the background ofEugene Hasenfus himself, and details about the day-to-day operation of theContra effort are shrouded in similar mysteries. If we knew more about Hasenfus,we might piece together some important information about Area 51; if we knewmore about Area 51, we might understand why Hasenfus was linked to it. As itstands, we know virtually nothing about both pieces of this puzzle, for—as it iswritten—“not all things are to be said to all men.”CONTACTIs this the devil? What the hell is this?—Whitley Strieber, under hypnosis to recall details of his abduction8Whitley Strieber was born a Roman Catholic. Although, as we see from hiswritings both in print and on his Web site, he and his wife were involved withthe Gurdjieff Foundation for a while (and he also admits that he has attendedwitchcraft ceremonies, of the “New Age” pagan variety9), he nonetheless retainsa great deal from his Catholic upbringing. A gifted storyteller, several of hisnovels have been made into movies (including The Wolfen and The Hunger) and,indeed, he worked as a screenwriter for a while (The Owl and the Pussycat). ButStrieber came to international prominence largely on the strength of one book, anon-fiction bestseller in which he claimed to have been abducted by an alienforce.Communion: A True Story was not only a bestseller, but it became a feature filmstarring Christopher Walken as Strieber, a film that was unsettling and eerie tomany audiences and made even more so by the filmmakers’ insistence that it wasbased on actual events. That the title, Communion, has special resonance forCatholics should be obvious: it is the name for the ritual involving consumptionof the body and blood of Jesus. It is one of the seven sacraments in theCatholic Church, and signifies full membership in the Church.Yet “communion” also means “communication,” albeit on a deeper level, and thisis the emphasis of the film and especially of the book, as well as of all theothers from Whitley Strieber that have followed Communion, and which deal withthe same phenomena. In fact, one of the sequels to Communion is Confirmation, aword that describes another Catholic sacrament, this time the ritual in which ayoung boy or girl reaffirms the vows made by their godparents at their baptism;i.e., confirms that they renounce Satan and believe in Jesus. The titles of theother sequels are not so openly sacerdotal, however, being Breakthrough,Transformation, and The Secret School. (One does suspect that it would bedifficult to use Extreme Unction as a title, although Penance, Baptism and evenMatrimony have possibilities, not to mention the potentially sinister HolyOrders.)Briefly, the story is this:On the night of December 26, 1985 Whitley Strieber—on holiday at his cabin inthe woods in Ulster County, upstate New York—was awakened by a strange noise inthe living room. It would later be recorded that a UFO had been sighted in thearea that night, but at the time Whitley had no knowledge of this and did notassociate his experience with UFOs and alien visitors until months later. 10Hesat up in bed, startled, but then lay back down to return to sleep. He says thatthis type of strange behavior would be “repeated many times,”11 a kind ofnervous reaction to events so out of the ordinary that there does not seem to bean appropriate response based on the usual fight or flight instincts of ourlower brains.Then he is visited by several creatures who surround his bed, and who seem tocarry him aloft and out of the cabin.It should be noted that both his wife and his young son are with him in thecabin, but they do not seem to have been awakened by the strange noise or by thevisitors at this time.He then winds up in a “messy round room,”12 and then observes many tiny peoplerushing about and finds that he is in a state of abject terror. Other events aretaking place, but he cannot recall what they are, ascribing this lack of detailto a form of amnesia brought about either by sheer terror or, somewhat moreprosaically, by drugs. While neither Whitley Strieber nor his wife, Anne, aredrug takers, he implies that he may have been deliberately drugged with someexotic narcotic by the creatures who abducted him and took him to the “messyroom.”He describes having his cranium penetrated by a long, thin needle, and then theinsult of the infamous “rectal probe.” Soon thereafter, his memories end, and hewakes up to a winter morning in the New York woods with a vague recollection ofsomething having happened during the night, but unsure what it was.During the following weeks, he feels a general mental and physical deteriorationas he struggles with the fallout of that night, still unaware of what reallyhappened and equally unaware of an “extraterrestrial” element to the experience.It merely seems to him that he is going insane.Back in New York City on February 6, 1986, he came across the name of UFOresearcher Budd Hopkins in a book about UFOs he had received as a Christmaspresent but which he had been too afraid to read before, for reasons thenunknown to him. Discovering that Hopkins lived in New York City, not far fromhis own Greenwich Village apartment, he decided to call him although he wasn’tquite sure what to say. The images he recalled from the “event” of that nightwere so abnormal that he did not know if they fit the now-familiar pattern of aclose encounter.Hopkins invited him over and the two spent a few hours discussing the event, andthen Hopkins asked whether Strieber had had any similar experiences in the past,and that is when he suddenly remembered an event in October of 1985, an eventthat was experienced by other witnesses.It took place in the same cabin in the woods, but this time he had house-guestsas well as his wife and son: two authors—one a Romanian immigrant and the authorof an account of his experience in a Romanian work camp, and the other anAmerican-born intellectual. His houseguests were aware of a strange light—anunearthly glow—all around the cabin the night of October 4, a light so brightthat it woke them up. Whitley thought the cabin was actually on fire, but ofcourse there was no damage. They discussed it—as well as a loud bang the samenight, a sound of unknown origin—the following morning, but then thought nothingmore about it.Prompted by Budd Hopkins, Whitley asked his family what they remembered of thatnight. Whitley’s son Andrew said it was the night of the bang, when his fatherthrew his shoe at a fly. When asked who told him about throwing a shoe, Andrewremarked that it was “Just a bunch of people. People who were around.”13 Whenpressed for more details, specifically about any strange dreams from thatperiod, Andrew readily replied that he had a dream about “little doctors” whoput him on a cot and told him not to worry.14 As one might imagine, this wasunwelcome news to Whitley Strieber! What he was dealing with, if it was ahallucination, was a hallucination shared by his family. Either they were allgoing insane, or there was some external force prompting these strangerecollections.Asking his friends about what they remembered about that October night, theyverified the existence of a bright light in the woods and a loud explosion, andWhitley’s telling them it was all right: “The light is gone. Go back tosleep.”15Eventually, Strieber would seek a hypnotist to enable him to recall more detailsof the two experiences and transcripts of the sessions are given verbatim inCommunion. The experience was obviously terrifying, with visions of the worldbeing destroyed and his son being killed, all suggested by the strange beingswho had abducted him and forced him to see these images and to react violentlytoward them. There was also a vision of his father, on a train, surrounded bysoldiers in uniform. Whitley later states that this had to be a memory of 1957,returning on a train from a vacation in Madison, Wisconsin back to Texas, whereWhitley was born and where the family lived. (This link between Whitley’sabduction experiences and a sudden vision of his father in a way that seems outof context will turn out to be quite important, and what eventually led WhitleyStrieber to contact this author some years later, as we shall see.)While Strieber’s story in Communion refers to events that took place while hewas an adult and spending holidays at his cabin in the woods of upstate New Yorkwith his family and friends, it becomes clear through his writings that he linksthat experience with older, more unsettling ones from his childhood. WhitleyStrieber has never insisted that he was abducted by what the popular imaginationterms “space aliens.” He is not convinced that the UFO phenomenon is, strictlyspeaking, the visitation of the earth by beings from another planet, or that he(and others like him) have been periodically kidnapped by these beings and usedin gruesome medical experiments. He keeps an open mind, and as far as I candiscern is sincerely seeking to understand what his experience really was, whatit represents. While he has interpreted it in spiritual terms, and more so asthe years have gone by, he seems nonetheless perfectly willing to accept thebeings as space aliens if it could be proved; he is just as willing to accept averdict of angels or spirits or extra-dimensional creatures of some sort, oreven subconscious material surfacing in a unique and powerful way. The importantaspect to the case is how the interaction between human beings and these“aliens” is handled, and what changes it can cause in the human psyche. Does“contact” enable a person to become more centered and at the same time moreaware? Does it ennoble a person? Does it cause significant psychological changeor growth?Or does it represent something else, something more dangerous?Harvard professor and psychiatrist John E. Mack, M.D. concludes that those whohave experienced “alien abduction” are genuinely suffering from post-traumaticstress disorder (PTSD).16 That is, they have had an experience which has causedall the psychological and organic reactions typical of soldiers who have been inbattle, or people who have witnessed a particularly upsetting event, such asviolent death. We may remember that it was just this illness that gave rise tothe creation of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual by the US Army; and thatSurrealist author Andre Breton used automatic writing to treat soldierssuffering from this disorder. We remember that brainwashing expert WilliamSargant cut his medical eye teeth on the same disorder. It is—whether one givesit the clinical name “post-traumatic stress disorder” or the more colorful“shell shock” or “battle fatigue”—a virtual mother-lode of inspiration forartists and G-men alike. Mack, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his psycho-biographyof Lawrence of Arabia (A Prince of Our Disorder), was roundly criticized by hispeers for accepting the testimony of abductees at face value; but all he wasreally doing was explaining to the world at large that these people hadapparently suffered from some appalling treatment, since they were exhibitingall the same symptoms as people suffering from shell shock or battle fatigue.Yet, there was nothing in their backgrounds that could account for theexperiences. Thus, Mack was inclined to believe that the abductees hadexperienced something so unusual, and so stressful, that to call it “alienabduction” was not far from the truth.Malachi Martin also makes a brief appearance in this story, in an encounter hehad with a former Newsweek journalist, Bruce Lee, who one day was inspectingracks of Communion in a bookstore shortly after its release and saw whatappeared to Lee to be … well, aliens: short beings dressed oddly, as if indisguise, and laughing at details in the book, complaining of what Whitley “gotwrong.”17 The experience unnerved Lee, who later was visited by Fr. Martin, whowas one of his authors. (Lee by this time was an editor at publishing houseWilliam Morrow.) He told Martin about this strange encounter, at which pointMartin—suddenly quite nervous—asked Lee, “Does this experience disturb you?” towhich Lee responded, “No.” Martin then told him that “they exist.”18 It shouldbe pointed out that Father Martin disturbed Lee more than the aliens; afterworking with Martin on his book about demonic possession, Hostage To The Devil,Lee had to resort to an exorcist himself, because the experience, he said, lefthim feeling “unclean.”This association of aliens with demons has occupied many writers and thinkersover the past fifty years since the days of Kenneth Arnold, Fred Crisman, andRoswell. (Conceivably, an encounter with either one—I mean aliens and demons,not Arnold or Crisman—would be sufficient cause for a case of post-traumaticstress disorder.)Eventually, as Whitley Strieber’s memories became clearer, he remembered somesalient points from his own childhood that could have important bearing on thiscase, and could explain some of what Mack’s patients were experiencing.At this point, and in the spirit of full disclosure, I have to say for therecord that Mr. Strieber contacted me via email a few years ago, after readingmy first book, Unholy Alliance. His question to me was quite specific: aninquiry concerning Operation Paperclip and the identity of some German officerswho had been stationed at Randolph AFB in the 1950s. Since I had spent yearsresearching Nazi Germany and particularly those who escaped justice and wound upin the Americas, it was natural enough that he would contact me for thisinformation.But as we communicated further, and at length, concerning this period ofAmerican history, it became clear that Strieber believed that he may have been avictim of some sort of medical treatment or experiment at the hands of thesemen. He further believed that some sort of connection existed between theRandolph AFB group and a school in Mexico, and this is where the story cameunnervingly close to actual events which are only now coming to light.For this, we must go back to Whitley’s own childhood and the state of the world,and particularly of the United States, in the early 1950s.We must go back to the Secret School.THE SECRET SCHOOlSi la bomba no ha destruido al mundo, ha destruido a nuestra idea del mundo. ...Redescubrimos un sentimiento que acompano siempre a los aztecas, a los hindues ya los cristianos del ano mil. La tecnica comienza por ser una negacion de laimagen del mundo y termina por ser una imagen de la destruccion del mundo.—Octavio Paz19... Sade was still haunted by the fear of what he called “the black men” who layin wait to put him away.—Michel Foucault20Whitley Strieber was born on June 13, 1945 in San Antonio, Texas. The war inEurope was over, but the war in the Pacific was still two months away from itscomplete and dramatic conclusion, with the dropping of the atomic bombs onHiroshima and Nagasaki. His father, Karl Strieber, was a well-known andrespected attorney who specialized in the petroleum industry, a common-enoughoccupation in Texas. His mother, Mary, was the daughter of a wealthybusinessman. All in all, his home life could be described as “comfortable.”San Antonio—one of the most agreeable of Texas cities—is surrounded by militarybases, from the US Army’s Fort Sam Houston to several Air Force bases, such asRandolph Air Force Base, which served as the headquarters for the “aviationmedicine” effort of the US Army Air Corps (which became the US Air Force). Thisprogram was largely staffed by Nazi scientists brought over after the War’s end,as recounted in Book I. The most prominent among them, of course, was Dr.Hubertus Strughold, a man who should have been sentenced at Nuremberg, but whowas rescued by American military scientists eager to make use of his expertisein the relatively new field of “aviation medicine” … a field whose guinea pigshad been chosen from the death camps of the Third Reich. Strughold paid itforward, and rescued in turn a number of his own colleagues, falsifyingdocuments and curricula vitae so that the cream of the crop could accompany himto relative security and luxury in the United States. The end result was thatRandolph AFB became a kind of sanctuary for scientists who were used toexperimenting on living human subjects.This type of experimentation was not limited to testing the limits of physicalendurance at zero-g, but also included psychological and neurological testing.Hallucinations are a natural part of the isolation of a high-altitude pilot, dueto the sensory deprivation and lack of oxygen that occurs from long periods ofsolitude in the air, and experiments were conducted to determine how long anindividual pilot can remain sensory deprived before hitting the panic button.Incredibly, many test subjects reported the same hallucination: little yellowmen in black hats. This gave rise to speculation that the visions are triggeredby some sort of neurological factor, thus far unknown and unidentified.In Whitley Strieber’s communications with me, he expressed a suspicion thatperhaps he himself had been a test subject at Randolph. He mentioned Dr.Strughold by name, and also a mysterious Dr. Antonio Krause, whom I have so farbeen unable to identify, but who figures strongly in Strieber’s memories asrelated to me and on his own Web site. To understand why he would have come tothat conclusion—and why it could be seriously entertained—we must understandwhat the climate was like in the United States at that time: the immediatePostwar period.America had gone from the universally-acknowledged victor of World War II to thefirst atomic superpower in the same year, 1945. America had done theunimaginable: it had developed a weapon of mass destruction, a bomb so powerfulthat one dropped from a plane could level an entire city, killing hundreds ofthousands of people in the process and guaranteeing generations of hereditaryillnesses from exposure to high doses of radiation. Then, almost immediately,America found itself facing its greatest enemy to date: the threat of Communism.It was General Patton who is famously quoted as saying that America had foughtthe wrong enemy in the war; that the true evil was that represented by theSoviet Union and, later, Red China. In 1950, the Korean War began, as NorthKorean troops—supplied and supported by Mao’s China—began an assault on Seoul,with the aim of creating a Communist Korea. United Nations troops—largelycomposed of American soldiers, but including combatants from many nations—foughta desperate and harrowing struggle to help South Korea repel the invaders, and afew years later the war came to an uneasy truce with a country still divided.At the same time that the Korean War was coming to a close, Vietnam had becomeanother flashpoint, with the defeat of the French military forces at Dien BienPhu and the eventual splitting of the country into a Communist North Vietnam anda democratic Republic of Vietnam in the South.The war against Communism was an ideological conflict; the Communists wereatheists who persecuted religion, and this was generally enough to turn mostAmericans into rabid anti-Communists. The American government did not shy awayfrom using whatever tools came to hand in this life-and-death struggle for theplanet. As we have seen, these tools included Nazi scientists, spies,mercenaries, and medical men; but these tools also extended to Americanchildren.As a child growing up in America in the 1950s, the author experienced some ofthis first-hand. We were taught to expect an aerial attack at any time, and weretrained in how to protect ourselves from a bombardment: the old “stick your headbetween your knees and kiss your ass goodbye” position. We rehearsed this everyweek, as air raid sirens went off in the city like something out of a World WarII propaganda film. Of course, this could be construed as a kind ofpsychological warfare, conducted by the government on its own citizens, since itis doubtful that in the 1950s the Soviet Union possessed the military capabilitynecessary to invade the United States or bomb Chicago (where I lived for a whileas a child and learned to “duck and cover.”). They had been devastated in thewar, lost more than twenty million of their people to fighting and starvation,and had their hands full in Eastern Europe. No matter; as a child I was taken tovisit Nike missile bases and given lectures on the Communist threat. We weretold to be aware, and to report suspicious activity. In some cases, childrenwere encouraged to spy on their neighbors, or even on members of their ownfamilies; certainly, they were keeping an eye on their teachers.We grew up with the Bomb. It was always there, in the background, ready todestroy the world’s civilizations at only a few moments’ notice. We were toldwhat it would be like: the intense flash of light, the hurricane-force winds,the disintegration at ground zero, the blowing out of windows and destruction ofbuildings miles from the center of the blast. We were shown how people inHiroshima had been reduced to photo images: shadowy shapes on walls and bridgesmade by the brilliant blast, all that was left of the people who, a momentearlier, had been standing in those spots. We grew up with Armageddon a suddenplausibility ... and the end of the millennium was less than fifty years away.The end of the world seemed like something one reasonably should plan for.We grew up with air raid shelters. There were those in our city neighborhoods:basements of churches and schools with the familiar yellow-and-black signs andthe stockpile of medicines and canned food. Outside the cities, people beganbuilding their own shelters: in their backyards or below their homes, concretebunkers with candles, flashlights, bottled water, and transistor radios (a newinvention). America was preparing for a pre-emptive first strike, nuclearwinter, and possible invasion.With all of this threat and perceived threat in the air, a daily experience formost of us, it was natural that red-blooded American citizens should be preparedto make the necessary sacrifices to defeat the Communist enemy wherever it couldbe found. Communism was sneaky; it wasn’t quite the same as the German-AmericanBund of the 1930s, holding marches in the Yorkville section of New York City tosupport the Nazi Party in Germany. Communism was more covert; people spoke of“Communist infiltration” and “fellow travelers.” People spoke of something—anewspaper article, a book, a movie—as being “Communist inspired.” When someAmericans came to their senses and started calling the Army–McCarthy hearings a“witch hunt,” they were more right than they knew. Arthur Miller saw it, andwrote The Crucible, a play ostensibly about the Salem witchcraft trials butseen—more correctly—as a parable about the anti-Communist hysteria grippingAmerica at that time. We saw how this theme influenced Miller’s wife, theactress Marilyn Monroe, who became more sympathetic towards Communism as theyears went on.It was understood that the Soviet Union—and those countries identified as“satellites” of the Soviet Union, i.e., Eastern European countries such asPoland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany—brainwashed its children andtaught them to spy on their own parents. Whether this was true or not, it was apowerful image when seen in the United States, which had just come fromconfronting brainwashing first hand in Korea. The CIA went to great pains tofind a way to counteract this threat, focusing on the soldier in the field atfirst; but it has always been whispered that the intelligence agencies—eitherthe CIA or the military intelligence organs, or both—experimented in some way orform on children in the United States in the 1950s.Only scraps of evidence have ever come to light. As mentioned in Chapter Sixteenthere is published documentation proving that children were used in drugexperiments in the United States, drugs that included LSD. In Montreal in the1950s, we know that children in orphanages were used experimentally,particularly in those orphanages run by the Catholic Church, once they had beendiagnosed as “retarded” or categorized with some other mental illness as a rusefor the institution to earn additional government funds. We also know thatMontreal in the 1950s was the scene for some of the CIA’s most imaginative andchilling psychological experiments, those of Dr. Ewen Cameron at his Mount Royal“Ravenscroft” clinic. This precedent—that of the CIA using medical institutionsin foreign countries as contractors for their psychological experiments—isworthwhile studying, for it may reveal a pattern.While the hideous example of Dr. Cameron’s psychic driving and other programs inCanada is by now well-known to those who study this field, there is virtually noinformation about similar programs undertaken south of the border, in Mexico.But there is the Finders case.As we saw earlier, when US government officials were called in on February 5,1987, due to the arrest of two men in Florida in connection with the suspectedtrafficking of children to Mexico, with the subsequent discovery that a groupcalled “Finders” was involved in everything from ritual sacrifice tointernational travel to proscribed destinations (like North Korea and NorthVietnam), and had ties with Chinese embassy officials in Hong Kong, among otherthings, the lid was clamped down tight and the American public was not allowedto know anything more about this group that had ties to the CIA. Since then, theentire case has been stonewalled and whitewashed; we have been presented with apicture of Finders that is innocuous and bland, and the arrests just a bigmisunderstanding. But there is no misunderstanding what Washington, D.C. areapolice discovered at the Finders headquarters, or the fact that several smallchildren were in the charge of two well-dressed men who were taking them to a“special school” in Mexico, a school for very bright children. This report ofthe school in Mexico has never been followed up; that part of the story diedwhen the police were told—by the CIA—to keep away from it. Strangely, the newsmedia also dropped the story.No one knows what happened to the children who were picked up in Florida:filthy, in tattered clothing, ignorant about things like television andcomputers but nonetheless quite intelligent, they disappeared from view assurely as the story disappeared from the newspapers. To put together a scenarioof what might have happened all we have is the inventory list of what policefound at Finders headquarters, and that included photographs of childrenparticipating in animal sacrifice; copies of communications between Chinesenationals and Finders on the subject of trafficking in human beings and“obtaining children for unspecified purposes”; instructions on money laundering;and more.Since then, some (but not all) of this has been explained away by the Findersleader, Marion Pettie, who has put a benign and eccentric spin on the facts.Context is everything, and Pettie paints his organization in a kind of loopy,New Age light that has nothing to do with espionage, psychological warfare,brainwashing, or any of that Cold War impedimenta. Yes, he and his family haveCIA connections going back to the 1950s. Yes, they killed a goat, and childrenwere present. But this is all being taken out of context, he insists. Thereality is really quite boring.Yet, he has never answered any questions concerning the travel to Communistcountries in the 1950s through 1970s, or the telex traffic with the Chineseembassy in Hong Kong concerning the purchase of two children, or the fact thatFinders had files on their activities and the activities of their members allover the globe. As a matter of national security, we are not allowed to askthese questions or to reopen the case. The matter is closed, and the US Customsand Metropolitan Police Department files are locked away in a file markedSECRET.What happened to the children? Where were they going?As Maury Terry continued his investigation of the Son of Sam cult, aninvestigation that became more linked with the Process or one of its offshoots—through statements made by former Process members—he kept hearing the cultcalled by a peculiar name, “The Children.” David Berkowitz knew the cult by thisname, and it was stated by Terry that a wealthy émigré from Postwar Germany wholived in the Yonkers area was an important leader. This man has since died.Terry, who knows the man’s name, did not divulge it in his book, but he didattend the wake and saw the proliferation of black flowers around the man’scoffin.The Children.A noted psychotherapist and expert on hypnosis, D. Corydon Hammond, has alsoinsisted that a satanic cult exists in America that was begun by Nazi émigrésafter the war, and that this cult abuses and even sacrifices children as part ofits ritual.21 If we put this together with Terry’s discovery, we begin to see apattern emerging … particularly as the Nazis could not have come to America andbegun developing their network without at least preliminary support by Americanintelligence officials. It is possible that the tales of a nationwideNazi–Satanic cult that sacrifices children is only the smoke from a muchsmaller, but potentially more dangerous, fire.The facts that we have to hand may be of help:We know, for instance, that Nazi scientists and medical professionals wereallowed to emigrate to the United States after the war as part of OperationPaperclip and succeeding efforts to rescue as many Nazi professionals aspossible in the effort to contain Communism. We also know that Americanintelligence hired an entire network of Nazi spies to assist them in combatingthe Soviet Union, a network known as the Gehlen Organization. We also knowthat many Eastern European Waffen-SS and other Nazi troops, includinghigh-ranking officers, were allowed to emigrate to America after the War, and insome cases (such as that of Valerian Trifa of the Romanian Orthodox Church andthe Iron Guard) became prominent in Eastern Orthodox churches in the UnitedStates, either as clergymen or as financial supporters, and wound up holdingpositions of prominence in American political organizations. We also know thatCIA Director Allen Dulles had a critical role to play in covering up details ofhis involvement with Nazi officials. All of this has been covered in detail, andfully documented, in Books I and II.Knowing all of this, is it so far-fetched an idea that some of these Nazis wereallowed—or encouraged—to continue their medical and psychological programs inAmerica? Or, where it was considerably safer, in Canada or Mexico under CIA ormilitary intelligence auspices?What Whitley Strieber describes—the involvement of Nazi scientist HubertusStrughold in the experimentation program—is not beyond the realm of possibility.That Randolph AFB would have been chosen as the site of this activity islogical, as it was the center for aviation medicine research, a broad categorythat included virtually anything having to do with neurological, biological, andpsychological testing. It was also close to the Strieber home in San Antonio,Texas.However, how can we accept that the young son of a prominent San Antonioattorney would have been selected for psychological experimentation by the USArmy?The answer lies in the context of the times.In the immediate Postwar years, as the Soviet Union gradually assumed the mantleof our cosmic enemy, Americans were called as never before to do what they couldto contain and eventually destroy this threat. It seemed as if Communism waserupting all over the world, from Asia to Europe to Latin America. Educators,scientists, journalists, and businessmen were called to the service of the CIA,enlisted in the global fight against the Red Menace and the Yellow Peril. It ishard for those who did not grow up in those times to realize just how much thissentiment insinuated itself into the lives of those who did. The orgy ofred-baiting, loyalty oaths, and purges of government agencies, and theentertainment and other industries, was a constant backbeat to the news reportsof new Communist successes, of falling dominoes around the world. All Americanswere expected to do what they could to help in this Manichaean struggle betweenWest and East, between Capitalism and Communism, between Democracy andDictatorship.Many children in those days were tested for intelligence, and some were selectedfor further tests. We only have bits and pieces of information about theseprograms available to us now, some only on the basis of personal testimony. Thememories recorded by Whitley Strieber of his childhood encounters with the“visitors” at the secret school hidden within San Antonio’s Olmos Basin may be,he admits, screen memories of actual psychological testing that was done onbehalf of American intelligence and conducted by the Nazi doctors of RandolphAFB, tests that could have included hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD andpsilocybin. We know that such testing was done on children, for instance atCreedmore in the 1960s. We do not know how much drug testing was done by themilitary at this time, although we do know that such men as Andrija Puharichwere conducting all sorts of psychological and chemical tests on behalf of theUS Army in the 1950s. We also know that, at that same time, the CIA was notabove dosing its own employees and contractors with LSD and other substanceswithout their knowledge, as the Frank Olson tragedy clearly demonstrates.Without going into a discussion of whether or not Whitley Strieber’s experienceswith the visitors were actually memories of medical experimentation by the Nazidoctors of Randolph, or were genuine experiences of alien abduction and mentalprogramming, we can accept—at least theoretically—that there is a basis forbelieving that young Whitley (or others like him) were subjected to some form ofpsychological experimentation during the 1950s, and that this experimentationmay have included the use of psychotropic substances. We can accept this,because there is enough documentation to prove that programs like this werealready in existence, and that the American government agencies and privatemedical teams involved were not above employing these tests on unwitting humansubjects, including children. San Antonio, Texas was a military town. Many ofthe local people owed their jobs to either the military or to the petroleumindustry. There were Army bases and Air Force bases, and the mysterious RandolphAFB with its coterie of unrepentant Nazis. Patriotic American parents might havebeen willing (or even proud) to have their children placed in experimentalprograms, assured by their own government that the testing would be passive,non-invasive and benign, especially if their children had shown a high IQ orother abilities on standard tests administered by the school system.In that context, and in the 1950s, anything was possible.Nuclear physicist Jack Sarfatti (intimate of Saul Paul Sirag, Andrija Puharich,Uri Geller, Ira Einhorn, Philip K. Dick, Carlos Castaneda, Barbara Honegger, andmany others) has written about a similar experience he had as a primary schoolstudent around the same time, in 1952, an experience in which he places a lot ofstock and which was obviously a seminal event in his life. He had beenidentified as boy with a genius IQ, and preparations would soon be made to sendhim to Cornell University on a full scholarship at the age of 17. In themeantime, however, he received a strange phone call at his home in the Flatbushsection of Brooklyn.According to Sarfatti’s own account in The Destiny Matrix (1995), and alsoavailable on the Internet,The telephone rings. I pick it up. I hear curious clanking mechanical soundslike relays clicking. A distant cold metallic voice speaking numbers getslouder.“Who are you?” I ask.“I am a conscious computer on board a spacecraft … We have identified you as oneof four hundred young bright receptive minds … You must give us your decisionnow. If you say yes, you will begin to link up with the others in twenty years.”After a few seconds, young Sarfatti agrees, and the voice replies,“Good, go toyour firescape [sic]. We will send a ship to pick you up in ten minutes.Nothing happened.Sarfatti then goes on to explain how he later became a member of a group ofgifted children, an after-school coterie led by one Walter Breen (1928-1993), “agraduate student at Columbia and well known Numismatist associated withpsychologist William Shelden.”22 Walter Breen is a fascinating person in his ownright. His Complete Encyclopedia of US and Colonial Coins is the definitivevolume on this subject, and retails today for $135. But he was also veryfamiliar to the science fiction circles of the 1960s, and was a co-founder ofthe Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA). He also wrote, under the pseudonymJ.Z. Eglinton, Greek Love, a text that has been referenced by the North AmericanMan Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) as supportive of their philosophy concerningsexual relationships between men and boys. Breen had been arrested before forchild molestation, and would be again at the end of his life.But the gifted children group to which Sarfatti belonged was somehow linked withthe Sandia Corporation, now part of Lockheed Martin, a charter member of theDefense–Energy establishment. In an email posted on a Web site(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ItalianPhysicsCenter/message/79) and dated July16, 2001, Sarfatti writes, “Breen was talking about extra dimensions, telepathy,remote viewing, UFOs, mutant humans, contact with aliens … Sandia was trying todevelop us as super-kids to have paranormal powers and to deal withextra-dimensional intelligence.” Sandia is still involved with gifted childrento this day, in cooperation with a “super kids” program that selects very brightstudents to work with its supercomputer.As for Walter Breen, he eventually married Marion Zimmer Bradley (1930-1999),the science-fiction author of The Mists of Avalon (and author of much lesbianfiction besides, who was very active in gay counseling as well as a contributorto The Mattachine Review) who would bear two children (in addition to a child byher first marriage) while they were married and before their separation in 1979.Even more fascinating is the fact that, in 1980, both Marion Zimmer Bradley andWalter Breen would be ordained as priests in the Eastern Orthodox Church byBishop Michael Itkin, making their line of apostolic succession (via Bishop, andnow “Saint,” Carl Stanley) the same as David Ferrie’s! (As you can see, it isvirtually impossible to extricate the material of this book from the moist-palmgrasp of the ubiquitous wandering bishops.)The data in Sarfatti’s article/book-in-progress reads like a history andwho’s-who of American (and foreign) alternative culture in the 1970s. Twentyyears after his strange phone call (and, as we discover later, there were morethan one) he was indeed linked with some of the brightest and most creativeminds on the planet. He has considered whether or not the phone call was somekind of hoax, but he is reluctant to accept that explanation. Others have hadsimilar phone calls, he tells us, and—of course—the spaceship-computer scenariowas playing out even then with Andrija Puharich and his circle in theirevocation of The Nine (albeit unknown to young Sarfatti—or anyone else—at thetime). Incidentally, and congruent with our overall thesis, Sarfatti was alsoheavily influenced by the surrealist film Orphee by Jean Cocteau.He became involved with the Stanford Research Institute at about this time(1973), and with Hal Puthoff and Russel Targ, scientists who were involved inSRI’s “remote viewing” and other paranormal experiments. Until this association,Sarfatti considers himself to have been“anti-mystical” (Sarfatti Web site), butduring his time with SRI he begins to realize the importance of those mysteriousphone calls made twenty years earlier. He also discovers that artist and remoteviewer Ingo Swann “channeled” a “cold, metallic voice from a saucer 100 yearsinto future” at Stanford Research Institute (SRI), along with our friend BarbaraHonegger (she of the “October Surprise” episode). SRI, of course, was also theplace where Israeli psychic Uri Geller was tested in 1973.23 In 1975, in aseparate series of tests of Uri Geller’s psychic abilities by a team at LawrenceLivermore Laboratories (where much of America’s nuclear weapons research takesplace; the scientists were worried that someone with Geller’s abilities would beable to trigger a nuclear device or scramble a computer system using only hismind), scientists recorded another “distinctive, metallic-sounding voice,unheard during the actual experiment but now clearly audible.”24 Among the fewwords that could be made out, however, was “the code name of a very closely heldgovernment project. The project had nothing to do with psychic research, andneither it nor its code name was known to … Livermore.”25 More about theLawrence Livermore incident in the following chapter, but in line with theexperience of Sarfatti, one of the Livermore scientists actually received aphone call from the “strange metallic voice,” which told him and the team tocease the experiments with Uri Geller. They did, and were left alone afterthat.26(In a side note, Sarfatti also reveals that he had been a member of the CivilAir Patrol (CAP) in New York at the age of fourteen. In attempting to puttogether his timeline, it occurred to me that he was in the CAP at the same timeas David Ferrie and Lee Harvey Oswald, but of course a thousand miles away fromthe New Orleans operation. At that same time, my parents were also members ofthe CAP, but in the Cook County, Illinois area. Considering that my father hadright-wing sentiments and a history as a segregationist … well, you can seewhere I’m going with this!)Thus begins a personal odyssey, during which Sarfatti discovers he is descendedfrom a Knight Templar, hangs out with science-fiction authors Philip K. Dick andRobert Anton Wilson, meets Carlo Suares (The Cipher of Genesis), is told by someTheosophists that he is the reincarnation of their Bishop Leadbetter (the gayand “wandering” bishop who on a beach in India discovered the young boy whowould become future spiritual guru Krishnamurti), and on and on.Sarfatti is a scientist, and if you read some of the email exchanges posted onthe Internet between him and other physicists and physicist-wannabes, you willbecome very quickly bogged down in a quagmire of calculus and contempt. Theinternecine wars between physicists are as unseemly as those between Kennedyassassination theorists or battling UFO apologists; but in the end the fact thatSarfatti is a scientist is what stands out. And while his childhood experiencesdo not match, chapter and verse, those of Whitley Strieber, there are verystrong and suggestive parallels between the two. Both are contacted by alienintelligences; both are linked to spacecraft; both are “identified” by theseintelligences while they are quite young: Whitley was nine years old, andSarfatti was about twelve. Both had their experiences in roughly the sametimeframe: the early 1950s. Sarfatti was “contacted” in 1952/53; Strieber in1954. Both were members of a “secret school” that had associations withparanormal abilities and UFOs.Sarfatti mentions in another email exchange, from June 2002, that he had been“studied” by the US Army in the late 1940s, and goes on to describe theafter-school group led by Walter Breen as the “McDermott-Sheldon-Breen‘Columbia-Sandia eugenics’ connection of 1953-56.”27 Again, this is a verysuggestive timeframe in which to be placing events so similar as those relatedby Sarfatti and Strieber.In yet another place Sarfatti goes into more detail about this observation bythe Army.28 He claims it occurred at “US Army Quarter Masters in Lower Manhattanin the late 1940s soon after the alleged Roswell incident,” and mentions thathis mentor Walter Breen told him that he (i.e., Breen) had been in a plane crashin 1947 and had complete amnesia of the event, only coming to later in an Armyhospital. 1947, of course, was the year of the Roswell incident. Sarfattiwonders if there was a connection between Breen and Roswell. (Breen would latergo on to become a charter member of the American MENSA organization.)It is not only Sarfatti who has a single degree of separation between himselfand the UFOs, however. One of Whitley Strieber’s neighbors was the Colonel incharge of the air base from which Captain Mantell went on his fateful chase of aUFO, and became the first ever military casualty of a UFO in American history.(More about this in a bit.) Young Whitley used to play in the Colonel’s swimmingpool with the Colonel’s own son.29(And, in the spirit once again of full disclosure, the author must acknowledgethat he was approached in 1961-62 after an intelligence test of some kindadministered by his school in the sixth grade. I was never told the results ofthis test, but a parade of teachers and other, unidentifiable, persons cominginto my classroom to stare at me made me aware there was something odd going on.Later that same school year, after a science fair in which I made an exhibit outof CAP navigational materials such as maps, plotters, etc., men representingCornell University came to visit my teacher and to speak with my parents aboutmy attending a special class there. I never knew the outcome of those visits,but suspect that—due to my father’s FBI records—I was rejected as potentiallysubversive!)Whatever opinion one may hold of Whitley Strieber—fraud, psychotic, contactee,abductee, mystic, trickster, or honestly concerned about inexplicable events inhis own life and the life of the world—one is hard put to categorize Sarfattithe same way. Yet they both share an experience of alien contact while children,an experience that neither yet fully understands: Was it a hoax? Was it “real”?Were the perpetrators aliens? US government officials? Something else?Sarfatti’s involvement with the Columbia–Sandia “superkids” program is nomystery, and neither is the existence of Walter Breen. Strieber’s difficultylies in the fact that there is very little corroboration of his experience,aside from some other children (now adults) in the neighborhood in those yearswho used to disappear for hours at a time in the Olmos Basin, and aside fromWhitley’s discovery of the buildings used by the “secret school” during a tapingfor a television series, Contact, right where he had always claimed they wouldbe.30What seems a certainty is that both men had something done to them as childrenduring the Cold War, something that may have been government-sanctioned. And ifwe find that theory far-fetched, we only have to remember how the CIA covered upthe Finders revelations in the name of national security. Whatever happened toSarfatti—and what seems to have happenedto Strieber—it bore fruit. Sarfatti has become well-known as both a scientistand as a popularizer of quantum physics through his books and collaborativeefforts with other scientists, writers, and thinkers. He has pursued the idea ofalien intelligence relentlessly, searching for the physics that would makestellar travel possible and stretching the limits of quantum mechanics to breakEinstein’s “wall of light,” i.e., to find a way to travel faster than the speedof light and thus master the space-time continuum.Strieber has heroically recorded his experiences with “the visitors,” knowingfull well that he was subjecting himself to near-universal ridicule andhumiliation. He was (and is) a successful novelist whose books become movies;like Philip Corso, he had no need to jump into this particular fray and take astand one way or another. Yet, while Sarfatti pursues the science behind thealien experience, name-dropping like mad (and why not?) and trading good-naturedinsults with some of the world’s most intelligent human beings, Strieber isstruggling to find a meaning to all of this that transcends science, a spiritualor perhaps existential paradigm lurking behind the flashing lights, the speedingsaucers, the bug-eyed monsters of our nightmares.Both men were touched by something supernatural in their childhoods during theCold War that led each on his own path, paths that converge—perhaps—duringrecess at the secret school.A COLD, METALLIC VOICEA clean mind is one that has been brainwashed.—Walter BreenSarfatti is obviously convinced that the “cold, metallic voice” he heard overthe phone was some type of paranormal communication, either of alien beingsactually hovering overhead in a spacecraft of some kind or something that hasyet to be fully identified and described. He admits it may have been part of anultra-secret government program, a kind of brainwashing or mind controlexperiment, but he insists that it was not a hoax or a prank. In this, he isrunning parallel in his thinking to that of Whitley Strieber, who also heard a“machine-like voice” during his contacts with the Visitors.31What many UFOlogists and “fellow travelers” may not realize, however, is thatthis “cold, metallic voice” has an impressive pedigree in the United States,even before computers, radios, and other modern communications media existed togive us an idea of what that kind of voice would sound like.In M.V. Ingram’s ambitiously entitled An Authenticated History of the FamousBell Witch. The Wonder of the 19th Century, and Unexplained Phenomenon of theChristian Era. The Mysterious Talking Goblin That Terrorized the West End ofRobertson County, Tennessee, Tormenting John Bell to His Death. The Story ofBesty Bell, Her Lover and the Haunting Sphinx, published in Clarksville,Tennessee in 1894, we read of an encounter between General Andrew Jackson andthe famous Bell Witch. One section is worth quoting here, and takes place whenGeneral Jackson is on the move through Robertson County, Tennessee in thevicinity of the Bell Witch. His wagon freezes on a level road, and no amount ofcoaxing the horses or pulling by his troops will enable the wagon to move aninch. The wheels are removed, the axles inspected, and there is no indication ofa problem with either the wagon or with the road. It is a bizarre situation inand of itself, but then:All stood off looking at the wagon in serious meditation, for they were “stuck.”Gen. Jackson after a few moments thought, realizing that they were in a fix,threw up his hands exclaiming, “By the eternal, boys, it is the witch.” Thencame the sound of a sharp metallic voice from the bushes, saying, “All rightGeneral, let the wagon move on, I will see you tonight.” The men in bewilderedastonishment looked in every direction to see if they could discover from whencecame the strange voice, but could find no explanation to the mystery. Gen.Jackson exclaimed again, “By the eternal, boys, this is worse than fighting theBritish.” The horses then started unexpectedly of their own accord, and thewagon rolled along as light and smoothly as ever.Jackson’s entourage arrived later that night at Mr. Bell’s home, where they satup waiting for the witch to keep her promise. They had with them aself-described “witch layer,” or exorcist, who kept a pistol loaded with asilver bullet, ready to destroy the phantom.Presently perfect quiet reigned, and then was heard a noise like daintyfootsteps prancing over the floor, and quickly following, the same metallicvoice heard in the bushes rang out from one corner of the room, exclaiming, “Allright, General, I am on hand ready for business.”32The “witch layer” then tried to shoot in the direction of the voice, but hispistol would not fire. Eventually the Bell Witch grabbed the man by his nose andthrew him out of the house, much to the consternation as well as the amusementof General Jackson and his men, who could nonetheless not actually see what wascausing the witch layer so much discomfort. The Witch then assured Jackson thatit would return the following night, but Jackson could not convince his men tohang around much longer and they left with daybreak.This account is that of one Colonel Thomas L. Yancey, a lawyer in Clarksville,who compiled this story from surviving eyewitnesses, and then sent the report toM.V. Ingram for inclusion in his book in 1894. What is interesting is thestatement—made twice—that the Bell Witch spoke in a “metallic voice.” Onewonders what that meant to people living in 1894? Was that the phrase used byhis eyewitnesses, who would have heard that voice during Jackson’s lifetime(1767-1845), more specifically in the early decades of the nineteenth century?The Witch evidently possessed paranormal abilities, was invisible, but spokeEnglish tolerably well despite the strange sound of her voice. This would seemto fit neatly with the characteristics noted by Sarfatti.To be sure, the UFO phenomenon itself is not new. Strange lights in the sky havebedeviled humanity for centuries, if not millennia, and so have the strangecreatures who either pilot the craft or are just along for the ride.French scientist Jacques Vallee has seriously studied this phenomenon for manyyears ,and discusses his findings in a series of books, most notably among themMessengers of Deception and Passport to Magonia. He admits that it is foolish todiscount the thousands of UFO reports as nothing more than mistaken sightings ofthe planet Venus, or swamp gas, or the other frankly unbelievable “scientific”explanations of the events. Researcher John Keel, whose book The MothmanProphecies was eventually made into a film starring Richard Gere, is even moreforward when he claims that our planet is “haunted.” He sees—as does Vallee andmany others—the UFO experience as analogous (if not identical) to the experienceof demons, fairies, and other monsters from other times. The fact that we nowdescribe these events in terms that make it sound as if the “visitors” are spacetravelers may be more a reflection of how our culture is oriented in theaftershock of nuclear explosions and lunar missions than of any kind of“objective” reality. It may be the same experience as seeing demons, or fairies,only filtered through a modern consciousness and more “scientific” sensitivity.Keel reports many instances of strange phone calls connected to UFO activity andUFO “contactees.” He himself was the recipient of many such strange calls, andat one time the number of strange calls to members of UFO groups around thecountry reached such a crescendo that it contributed to the eventual breakup ofmany of these groups. The calls would range from electronic beeps and clankingnoises—such as Sarfatti first experienced with the “spaceship” call—to threats,to persons imitating the voices of friends, to static … and in some cases thecaller would play back taped conversations the recipient had moments or days agowith other parties, as if to demonstrate that the phone lines were tapped. Thisindicates either that the government was behind this elaborate campaign ofintimidation and disinformation, or that some other force with unlimitedresources was the culprit. No private organization or company—no Minutemen orMichigan Militia, Ku Klux Klan or Black Panthers, Weathermen or ConservativeCoalition—has the ability to mount such an aggressive campaign against the UFOgroups, and more importantly no motivation to do so. If we accept the data givenin Keel’s book—and in so many other reports published over the last thirty tofifty years—then we are forced to assume that the American government wasresponsible for the phone calls, the mysterious “men in black,” and otherrelated phenomena associated with the UFO experiencers. If the Americangovernment was not responsible, then we have a potentially more serious problemon our hands.It is not the intention of this author to weigh in on one side or the other inthe UFO controversy. I have never seen a UFO, have never been abducted by aliensor had any analogous experiences. I have seen the fabled “men in black,”however, when an old black Cadillac drove up in front of my home one afternoonand the driver aimed a camera with a telephoto lens at me. When I tried toconfront them, the vehicle drove away quickly and was replaced by another, thistime containing two rather short women instead of two men, who drove into mydriveway—blocking my car and preventing me from chasing the Cadillac—left theirvehicle, and stood before me asking me sweetly if I knew where a “Mr. Devilbis”lived. Startled, I responded in the negative although the name was familiar tome: it was that of a manufacturing company somewhere in the Midwest to which, afew weeks earlier, I had been referred by a former co-worker as a possibleclient for some electronic work. There was no Devilbis anywhere in the immediatevicinity of the town where I lived, however, and none for almost fifty miles inany direction. It wasn’t until years later that a “deconstruction” of that eventled me to the amusing revelation that “Devilbis” was actually two words: “devil”and Latin “bis,” meaning “the second devil” or “the devil, again.”Why this visitation should have taken place is beyond me. As I said, I am not aUFO contactee and have never belonged to any of the UFO groups or really hadanything at all to do with UFOs. My specialty has always been history andculture, specifically the history of religions and mystical movements. But thiswas the winter before the Gulf War began, and it is possible that my 1960sexperiences with a variety of anti-war groups and other radical associationswould have flagged me in some kind of government computer. At least, that iswhat I told myself in those days even though, on reflection, it doesn’t make anysense. It is quite costly to maintain a surveillance operation using two carsand four agents for a single individual who has had nothing to do with politicsin over twenty years. Of course, my business took me all over the world, andespecially to China, but that still does not rate me two cars, four agents, atelephoto lens and “Devilbis.” I have never been able to determine the cause ofthe event, or the identities of the individuals involved or the organization, ifany, to which they belonged. I did have another similar run-in years later,however, at Changi Airport in Singapore, when a young woman appeared from out ofnowhere, dressed like a 1950s spy in a trenchcoat—totally inappropriate forSingapore weather!—and who smiled at me and tapped me on the shoulder, gave me alittle wave, and disappeared again.And so it goes.THE STARGATE CONSPIRACY… NASA is the disturbed child of two dysfunctional parents—paranoia and war.—Graham Hancock33In 1999, the authorial team of Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince published TheStargate Conspiracy,34 an exposé of what appeared to be a US governmentconspiracy to control access to the type of information that people like JackSarfatti, Hal Puthoff and others were accumulating on their own. Picknett andPrince connected this conspiracy to activities surrounding the Pyramids and theSphinx in Egypt, but focused as well on the circle of mystics around AndrijaPuharich and the alien intelligences known as “The Nine.” Missing the mostcrucial connection of all, however—that of Arthur Young, Ruth Paine and LeeHarvey Oswald—they ended their book with the breathless expectation thatsomething of awesome global importance would occur at or near the millennium atthe site of the Pyramids at Gizeh. Nothing of that nature transpired … at least,not that we know of, anyway!But their research is valuable in other ways. Picknett and Prince have beenrummaging through the Catholic closet for a while, coming up with new spins onthe Shroud of Turin (Turin Shroud—In Whose Image?) and the Knights Templar (TheTemplar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ), going tothe same well as the team of Baigent, Lincoln and Leigh before them (Holy Blood,Holy Grail ). What makes The Stargate Conspiracy unique is the level of researchinto lesser known realms, less well-trod paths of arcane knowledge and secretsocieties with political connections. For many readers, it might have been thefirst time they came across the names that were once household words among theNew Age crowd of the 1970s: Uri Geller, Andrija Puharich and the rest. The factthat the event of momentous import at the millennium apparently did not occurwhen they said it would is no reason to ignore this book, which is full ofdetail concerning some of the most colorful individuals of our time, and some ofthe most sinister associations. It is also useful for its introduction into theworld of Egyptology, and the political machinations that take place both withinand without the Cairo Museum.The reason for this is a belief—held by some individuals and groups, including(the authors insist) elements of the US Government—that the Egyptian gods wereextra-terrestrial beings. Aliens. And that the Pyramids of Gizeh and the Sphinxsomehow conceal evidence of this, either in their construction or in whatevermay be buried beneath them, or both. Indeed, “The Nine” itself is a reference tothe council of Nine Gods—the Ennead—in Egyptian religion, and thus reinforcesthe links between ancient Egypt, alien civilizations, and the séances with TheNine conducted (on behalf of the military?) by Andrija Puharich and his grouptotaling nine members.The field of paleo-astronomy is esoteric in itself; when you mix it up witheccentric ideas about history and archaeology you are only asking for trouble.Academia will either ignore you (at best), or ridicule you. You will be lumpedin with the cranks and the crackpots, the un-credentialed and un-accredited“amateur historians,” who have no business kicking sand at the tenured bullieswho occupy their privileged positions in sunny safety from the deep water ofrushing currents of controversy and treacherous whirlpools of contradictory andanomalous evidence, rather like beached whales. Yet, as the decades have goneby, it has become more and more obvious that many of our ancientstructures—Stonehenge, the Pyramids, the Adena and Hopewell mounds—wereastronomically oriented. Academia will grudgingly accept that some of theseedifices were built in such a way that the rising of the sun on the summer orwinter solstice was accommodated in their design, so that rays of the sun wouldfall through a specific aperture in the stone or wood or earthen construction(as is obvious to anyone who has been there at the time). The ultimate purposefor this, of course, is a matter of some debate. Those academics who wish tosupport this theory will go so far as to state that theseastronomically-oriented creations were used as a kind of calendar, tellingprimitive man when to sow and when to reap. The problem with this uneasyconcession is that the constructions are often much more elaborate than that,and consumed a great deal of primitive society’s time and resources to build.In the case of the Pyramids, a serious attempt has been made to associate theirdesign and orientation with the constellation Orion.35 In the case of the Gothiccathedrals of France, Louis Charpentier (Les Mysteres du Chartres) has putforward the theory that they were built in imitation of the zodiacal sign Virgo(for “virgin,” since each of these cathedrals were known as a “Notre Dame” or“Our Lady”). This approach to archaeology and “sacred architecture” wasanticipated in that classic of the scientific interpretation of myth, Hamlet’sMill, 36in which the authors deconstruct many famous world myths to demonstratethat they had astronomical significance and were referencing events that hadtaken place in the heavens.A full discussion of these ideas is outside the scope of this book, and theinterested reader is encouraged to seek out Hamlet’s Mill in particular for anengrossing and illuminating exposition of these themes, before going on to themore popular The Orion Mystery and some of the other titles fighting for shelfspace in either the New Age section, the Ancient History section, or somewherein between. One would be amiss not to mention R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz’ works inthis context as well, such as The Temple In Man and Sacred Science. Of course,the works by former OSS officer Peter Tompkins are also valuable, such as hisThe Secrets of the Great Pyramid.It is enough to say for now that these theories of the inter-relationshipbetween ancient buildings and monuments and the stars—and the even more esotericcorrespondences between both buildings and stars and the human body and itsprocesses and systems—were taken seriously by agencies of the US (and other)governments, if not by academia itself. The design of these edifices and theirorientation to the compass points were thought to either symbolize a kind ofdivine geometry, inherent mathematical formulae embedded deep within nature, orto actually cause the building in question to function as a kind of machine. Weknow that the ancient Egyptians placed great store in the idea of resurrection;whether of the physical body or of some spiritual analogue is still open tofurious debate. We also see, from a careful and “astronomical” reading of theCoffin Texts and other elements of what is sometimes called the Egyptian Book ofthe Dead, that the Egyptians were very conscious of the stars, and had developedan entire liturgical culture around the stars and the transportation of the soulof the dead pharaoh to a place in the celestial firmament. Thus, the idea ofspace travel is at least as old as ancient Egypt, if not much, much older.The Germans had come closest to the dream of space travel during World War II.The rocket factories were cranking out missiles like the V-1 and V-2, butdesigns on the boards covered everything from jet aircraft to “flying saucer”prototypes. In the immediate postwar years, various Germans approached Americanintelligence (CIC) officers in Germany professing to have details of the saucereffort, including the Horten brothers who were part of Operation Paperclip,37and the bizarre case of Guido Bernardy. On August 5, 1947, Bernardy approachedthe US Army in Frankfurt in an attempt to see General Lucius Clay to warn himabout Nazi secret weapons, the development of flying saucers by Hitler’sscientists, Hitler’s survival in a submarine sailing in the Southern Hemisphereand about to launch these weapons against theUS and Europe, and the appearance of “two gentlemen, with no special talent intheir lives, [who] discovered they did have extraordinary powers andcapabilities which made it possible for them to communicate and contact thespirit world.”38 The agent who interviewed him, one Albert Goldstein, added,“Subject seemed entirely sincere, and the strong possibility that he is merely acrackpot is not apparent.”39 A few months later, the Horten brothers became anissue once again, as the Roswell case and the multiple sightings of “flyingsaucers” in the United States caused the Deputy Director of Intelligence,European Command to send a memorandum—dated 21 October 1947—to the AmericanChief of Staff about information received from Wright Field “concerning theflying saucers recently sighted over the UNITED STATES.“For your information, the Air Materiel Command at WRIGHT FIELD is making astudy of this subject and is constructing models to be tested in a wind tunnel.…The Air Materiel Command is of the opinion that some sort of object, such as theflying saucer, did exist” (Document declassified 5 July 1994). It would seemfrom the context of the accompanying documentation that the Horten brothers wereassisting the US government in this assessment. It is known that the OperationPaperclip scientists had been sent to Wright Field (which would becomeWright-Patterson AFB) in July 1947 at the time of the Roswell incident. AlthoughRoswell is not mentioned in the declassified documents, it is nonethelessremarkable that the engineers and scientists of Wright Field were testing modelsof flying saucers in a wind tunnel there a few months after the incident (whichthe military had ridiculed as being the mistaken identification of a weatherballoon, and which later researchers identified as artifacts of Project Mogul)and that this testing involved de-Nazified scientists under Paperclip, and thattheir preliminary conclusion was that a flying saucer “did exist.”Hitler kept waiting to the very end for the coveted “secret weapon” that woulddecide the war, and he would remain disappointed, but Wehrner von Braun andWalter Dornberger fled to the United States with the designs in their files andin their heads, and eventually with hundreds of their fellow scientists in towmanaged to fill in the gaps and create the American space program, a militaryendeavor which later became NASA.One of the amateur, popular and revisionist historians and archaeologists todraw the attention and suspicion (perhaps unfairly) of the Picknett and Princeteam is Graham Hancock, who caused a worldwide sensation with the publication in1992 of The Sign and the Seal, a book in which Hancock claimed to havediscovered the resting place of the Ark of the Covenant. Hancock is a respectedjournalist and expert on East Africa, who worked for The Economist and TheTraveler. He also won honorable mention in the 1990 H.L. Mencken journalismaward for his book Lords of Poverty. Thus, Hancock is not an amateur journalistor armchair anthropologist, but a credible field observer of the cultures onwhich he reports. Yet, like Howard Blum, Jim Marrs and the other members of the“brotherhood buried alive,” he has drifted from purely political reportage tothe arcane. Since The Sign and the Seal, he has authored many hefty tomes on thesubject of alien influence on ancient civilizations, such as The Mars Mystery(1994) and Fingerprints of the Gods: A Quest for the Beginning and the End(1995). In the former, he writes,NASA was formed in 1958 at the height of the Cold War when all advances in spacescience were spin-offs from the development of more efficient killing machines.The exploration of space itself was directly linked to defense policy.40This is something which many Americans forget, just as they forget thateverything from their superb interstate highway system to the Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders was the result of defense policies.Military policies. War.NASA was created around the dark genius of a coven of Nazi scientists who firsttested their designs and discoveries on the civilian population of London duringthe Blitz. While many may feel that Hancock’s characterization of NASA as a“disturbed child” is overstating the case, the preponderance of men who shouldhave been standing trial for war crimes instead working for NASA in thosedays—men who had used slave labor to build bigger and better rockets—certainlygoes some way to justify a verdict for moral imbecility, and the network thatexisted in the 1950s between the rocket scientists on the one hand and the“psychic scientists” like Andrija Puharich on the other—including the presenceof the Nazi doctors at Randolph AFB—is clearly evidence of a hidden agenda. WhenPuharich went to Brazil to investigate Arigo, the “psychic surgeon,” it was incollaboration with his friend John Laurence, an engineer specializing insatellites and telecommunications and one of the founding members of NASA.Clearly, whoever was working with or for NASA in the 1950s and 1960s had to beable to accept the presence—let alone the dominance—of the many Nazis on theirteam and, as we have seen in previous volumes, those Nazis would not have beenable to emigrate safely to the United States much less serve in positions oftremendous prestige and authority if it were not for the unwavering support andmaterial assistance of men like Allen Dulles and Richard Nixon. As unpalatableas this idea seems, and as outrageous as it will appear to many, the facts speakfor themselves and are incontrovertible. The same men who went after spiritedanti-Nazis like Helen Gahagan Douglas in political campaigns, using Red-baitingand anti-Semitism as their weapons, also did their best to defend the activeinvolvement of committed Nazis in the most sensitive, most secret caverns ofAmerican military technology, aviation medicine, and intelligence.When Jack Sarfatti and Whitley Strieber were getting their marching orders aschildren from “the visitors” or perhaps “The Nine,” NASA had not yet beencreated. All American space research before October 1, 1958—the date theNational Aeronautics and Space Act was signed, creating the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration, or NASA—was in the hands of the military, or undermilitary contract at places like the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which wouldbecome part of NASA very quickly. All investigation of the UFO phenomenon was inthe hands of the FBI, the CIA, or the military. And the military departmentsresponsible for space research were dominated by the Nazis they had brought overafter 1945, Nazis who would eventually become an integral part of NASA, anagency that was created in response to the launching of the first earth-orbitsatellite by the Soviet Union in 1957, Sputnik. Who can extricate their memoriesof America’s early space programs from the image of affable Wehrner von Braun, aman who once wore the uniform of the Third Reich? Indeed, who among us who werealive at the time can forget Tom Lehrer’s 1965 song “Wehrner von Braun,” which,while a humorous satire on the former German officer, was nonetheless asking animportant question: is it ethical to have former Nazis running our spaceprogram?While the military and intelligence organs dominated UFO research—and keptsightings investigations, recovered evidence, and eyewitness testimony(particularly with regard to radar observations and encounters with military andcommercial pilots, etc.) under wraps, thus robbing civilian groups of the chanceto evaluate much UFO evidence—these military and intelligence organs alsodominated psychic research and mind-control programs. Thus, on the one hand youhad the Pentagon and the CIA monitoring UFO reports and massaging data, and onthe other hand you had the same agencies racing to dominate inner space, aswell. If the UFO phenomenon partakes of both the scientific (space flight,faster-than-light travel, alien visitations) and the psychological(hallucinations, visions, spiritual encounters and illumination), then the USgovernment had all the bases covered. About all civilians could do was point tothe sky and say they saw a UFO, or point to some burned grass on their lawn, orrecount a tale of alien visitation; the civilians would have no access to thegovernment’s files on their experience, would have no opportunity to evaluatetheir experience in terms of ongoing military or intelligence operations, or inthe context of data on similar experiences already in the government database,etc. The civilian would have had one of the most profound experiences of his orher life, and be unable to put it into any kind of context. Worse, individualswould be subject to ridicule if they opened their mouths. Further, thisexperience was either “real,” i.e. had a scientific basis in objective reality,or was “spiritual” and had a more psychological dimension; the civilian wouldhave no knowledge of how to interpret the event, and would thus be left in thedark having received no input from either the government or the scientists … orthe church.In the early Postwar period, as we can see from the quotations that open thischapter, some of America’s most powerful individuals were convinced of thereality of the UFO phenomenon, not as some kind of mass delusion among thecredulous elements of the population, but as a scientific fact: even more, as aproblem that had to be evaluated from a military perspective. Generals,admirals, high-ranking CIA officials all believed in the potential threat posedby the phenomenon and then, abruptly, they grew silent; but not before thechildhood experiences of Jack Sarfatti and Whitley Strieber, and not before thecreation of NASA. In fact, one could reasonably say that the statements bycredible, trained military and intelligence observers supporting the view thatUFOs represented an alien civilization, a “sinister force” to use the words ofGeneral MacArthur, came to a halt after the Kennedy assassination in 1963. Odd,then, that we would find Fred Crisman and Guy Bannister in at the very beginningof the twentieth century’s UFO flap—two stalwarts of the assassinationconspiracy as viewed by Jim Garrison, and both former intelligence officers(Crisman for OSS and eventually the CIA, Bannister for the FBI and, at onepoint, as the boss of FBI Special Agent Robert Maheu, who would go on toorganize the Mafia–CIA assassination attempts against Castro).Odd, then, that we would find many of Lee Harvey Oswald’s co-workers at theReily Coffee Company in New Orleans leaving that firm after the assassinationand getting jobs with NASA and its subcontractors.Coffee company employees. NASA.Odd, then, that the Oswalds’ Texas benefactors—the Paines—would have strong tiesto the aerospace industry, and that Michael Paine would work for General WalterDornberger at Bell Aerospace.NASA was only one side of the story. Operation BLUEBIRD and, eventually,MK-ULTRA were the other. During 1954 alone, the year that Whitley Strieberrecalls as being the first year he was brought to the “secret school,” a totalof seventeen MK-ULTRA contracts were signed, including everything from hypnosis(Projects 25, 29) to stage magic (John Mulholland’s projects, including Projects15 and 19) to drugs (Projects 26, 27, 28, 37, 38). These projects includedtesting of hallucinogens and narcotics on human subjects, as well as JohnMulholland’s specialty, which was training agents in how to dose unwittingsubjects in the field. The following year saw the start of the Ionia StateHospital program of massive dosing of prisoners with LSD as well as the use ofhypnosis in interrogations (Project 39) and, in 1956, Louis Jolyon West’sexperiments in “dissociated states” under the auspices of the University ofOklahoma (Project 43). Unfortunately, we have very little information onanalogous military research taking place at the same time. We know that the AirForce contracted with the CIA in 1959 to conduct studies of “the Nature and Usesof Hypnosis as a Control Technique” (contract AF 49(638)-72B), and that the Navyhad similar interests in 1964 (contract Nonr-4731(00)), and that the Air Forceagain commissioned the CIA to investigate the relation between sleep andhypnosis (contract AF-AFOSR-707-67) from 1964-1971. The only reason we knowabout any of this was because four boxes of MK-ULTRA files were found to haveescaped the shredding frenzy of Richard Helms and Sidney Gottlieb. We did notlearn of this from the Armed Forces directly, which is generally under nopressure to open its research files to the public. Not on mind-control programs.Not on UFO sightings. Elements of both fall under the heading “nationalsecurity.”Thus, the American government had a stranglehold on research exploring thenature of consciousness, of memory, of deception, of manipulation—using drugs,hypnosis, and occult techniques—at the same time as they were performing damagecontrol on the UFO flap. If these efforts were not coordinated at some level—ifthe research products of both were not being sent to the same, anonymous officein Arlington or Langley or Washington for analysis—then a tremendous opportunitywas lost: an opportunity to learn, once and for all, what the UFO sightings (andespecially the abductions and other “close encounters”) represented. At the sametime, if these efforts were coordinated, then the American people were beingwell and truly “controlled,” and important information, central to ourunderstanding of who we are and the place we have in the world, was beingwithheld.The comedy Men In Black, a film starring Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith asgovernment agents keeping a lid on alien “immigration” to the United States,features a device which erases a contactee’s memory: of both the alienexperience as well as of the MIBs themselves. One imagines there are governmentagents who would have given their right arms for a device of that nature. Onehas no need to wonder if time and money was spent in pursuing that technology,since we have shown in Books I and II that the government was committed toachieving just that sort of power over the minds of its citizens, and over theminds of selected foreign citizens and populations as well.At some point, the exploration of outer space extends into an exploration ofinner space. This was perhaps the message of the experiences shared by Strieberand Sarfatti, a message both are still trying to communicate and to understandto this day. In Strieber’s case, it comes with a warning: the entities wediscover on our journeys may not always be altogether benign.THE NINE, THE PROCESS, AND THE VISITORSDespite what they had done to me, I did not hate the visitors. Because I knewtheir strength but not their motives, they frightened me.… That they representeda real, living force seemed hard to dispute. But that this force might beessentially human in origin remained a definite possibility.—Whitley Strieber41It may seem incongruous to try to contact aliens aboard their spaceships throughthe means of a séance. After all, the séance is the proper environment of theghost and the disembodied spirit. The assumption one makes about aliens is thatthey are, at least, alive. (Although, considering that, is it not possible thatperhaps dead aliens who have visited this planet would have left behind asimilar effluvium, some alien ectoplasm, a Martian ghost haunting our planet,moaning unintelligibly in alien dialects, and able to be contacted with Ouijaboard and medium? Is Roswell thus haunted?) Nevertheless, the séances conductedby Andrija Puharich and his blue-blooded colleagues from December 31, 1952through June 27, 1953 with the mysterious Dr. Vinod, Arthur Young, Ruth ForbesPaine Young, and Alice Astor were just such instances, and they were takingplace during the same period that Sarfatti and Strieber were each, in their ownway, making contact. (Although Strieber places great emphasis on 1954 as theyear he was admitted to the “secret school,” his memories of childhoodencounters stretches from 1951 to 1957.) As we have seen earlier, these séancesgave rise to the concept of The Nine, and these forces—speaking through Dr.Vinod—established themselves as living entities, as alien visitors aboard aspacecraft that was hovering over the earth. Indeed, Whitley Strieber himselfspeaks of hearing “nine knocks” associated with visits by his alien stalkers,and Sarfatti is likewise aware of The Nine, although at times in his lengthyemail exchanges one sees them referred to as the “Alien Raj.” Uri Geller alsoclaimed to have been contacted by The Nine, as we see from AndrijaPuharich’s book on the Israeli psychic, Uri.These are the associations that give Picknett and Prince some anxiety, for theyunderstand The Nine to be a hostile agency (no matter whether it be an alienmenace or a clandestine psy-war campaign) and the covert cooperation with TheNine—or with what they interpret as the hidden agenda of The Nine—by governmentand science as a betrayal of humanity. If we are to believe Robert Temple, forexample (and there is no reason why we should not), then the US government wasextremely interested in his research into the African Dogon tribe—the primitivetribe that knew of the existence of both Sirius A and Sirius B, including havingmuch detailed information about the physical and chemical composition of both,as well as an accurate calendar of the double star’s movements—and attempted tokeep Temple from publishing his results in The Sirius Mystery, an attempt thatobviously failed. Whether or not the attempt was a genuine, albeit half-hearted,effort on the behalf of the CIA to stop Temple from publishing, or was itselfpart of a disinformation campaign or some other psy-war experiment, is notknown. What is known is that the CIA knew in detail of Temple’s research longbefore he had gone to press. If we trace Temple’s research in a “chain ofcustody,” we find that it leads to the artist and occultist Harry Smith (sobeloved of the OTO) and directly from Smith back to … Arthur Young, Smith’smentor and benefactor. Temple himself studied with Arthur Young. And when wedeal with Arthur Young, we are dealing with The Nine.The “nine knocks” of Whitley Strieber’s experience is related both inTransformation and in his later book, Breakthrough. They took place on theevening of August 27, 1986 while he was at his upstate New York cabin. There wasa definite series of three distinct sets of three knocks, for a total of nineknocks, coming from a corner of the ceiling. Strieber seemed to understand thisas an invitation to go outside and meet “the visitors” … an invitation hedeclined, from fear. His cats also reacted in terror, staring at the spot theknocks came from.Then, as he relates in Breakthrough, exactly eighteen months to the day from hisexperience of nine knocks, an entire town—Glenrock, Wyoming—was awakened at 2:45A.m. on February 27, 1988 by the same phenomenon: nine knocks in three groups ofthree on the sides of their houses, their cars, their doors. This was related inthe local newspaper, but no one ever discovered the cause of this bizarre event.And when Strieber wrote The Secret School in 1997, it contained nine “lessons”divided into three “triads.”One would tend to dismiss these strange matters as having nothing reallyessential to do with The Nine, other than the mere fact of number, except forthe peculiar association that three groups of three knocks would have forsomeone who had studied Western occultism.First, magician Aleister Crowley, in his amusing and informative Magick InTheory and Practice, states,The general object of a knock or a knell is to mark a stage in the ceremony.…The sudden and sharp impact of the sound throws the mind into an alert activitywhich enables it to break loose from the obsession of its previous mood. It isaroused to apply itself aggressively to the ideas which had oppressed it. Thereis therefore a perfectly rational interpretation of the psychological power ofthe knock.42Crowley belonged to the Golden Dawn, the British secret society that gave himthe theoretical framework for much of his occult knowledge. Recourse to therituals of the Golden Dawn—as published in Crowley secretary Israel Regardie’sThe Golden Dawn—will show us one way three groups of three knocks may beemployed.The ritual in question is that of the Neophyte Grade, the very first initiationin the Golden Dawn scheme. The temple is arranged, according to Regardie, inEgyptian fashion, and the whole rite recalls the weighing of the soul of therecently departed against the feather of the Goddess Maat. The Neophyte wears ablack hooded robe. The other officers of the temple are dressed according totheir rank, but again the regalement includes Egyptian motifs.To one side is a representation of the Evil Triad of the Egyptians: gods who areprepared to devour the entrails of the Neophyte should he be found wanting.Surrounding the Neophyte are four benevolent gods, who will protect him from thesavage hunger of the Evil Triad.At one point in the ceremony, the three main initiators perform a “battery” ofnine knocks, three knocks each, while uttering the formula “Khabs Am Pekht. KonxOm Pax; Light In Extension,” one knock for each word. The initial phrase isCoptic, thus reinforcing the Egyptian character of the ritual, while the secondphrase is in a “corrupt Greek” form. As for the meaning behind this, Regardiestates,This affirms the establishment of the White Triangle and therefore theCompletion of the Opening Ceremony. The Mystic Words “Khabs Am Pekht” whichaccompany the knocks seal the image of the Light.43The Egyptian tenor of this rite is immediately suggestive to those who have readthe Picknett and Prince book, because Egypt is at the heart of this mystery ofThe Nine.However, the way in which the knocks are sounded is quite important; theinterval between each knock is as essential as the knock and number of knocksitself. In the case of the Strieber/Glenrock events, the nine knocks are givenin three groups of three, thus: 3—3—3. The number 333 has enormous significancefor Qabalists (such as Madonna and Demi Moore!) as well as for ceremonialmagicians in general, for it represents Choronzon, the Beast of the Abyss.We have all heard of the significance of the number 666 as the number of theBeast of the Apocalypse. Some of us have wondered at the significance of 555which, as I mention in Unholy Alliance, is the number of Hitler’s originalmembership in the Nazi Party, as well as the height (in feet) of the WashingtonMonument, the altitude of Ashland, Kentucky above sea level, and the number ofthe Greek word Necronomicon.In the case of 333, we are dealing with a suspiciously empty section of theQabalistic Tree of Life. The Tree consists of ten sephiroth or spheres, eachrepresenting some facet of creation. Dividing the top three spheres from thelower seven is what occultists refer to as Daath, or the Abyss. It representsfor some the “dark night of the soul,” a necessary purging of the soul’s sins,its karma, its dross before it can continue to the three “supernals” andcomplete its journey to Nirvana (to mix theologies for a moment). Just as thereis an “Evil Triad” waiting for the Neophyte at the very first grade ofinitiation—demonic forms that wish to devour the unworthy aspirant—there is aBeast waiting in the Abyss itself, as if for a second and more brutalinitiation. The number of Choronzon (derived from Qabalistic numerology) is thenumber of that particular Beast: 333.Yet, as Masonic and other lore will remind us, these fierce creatures onlyappear fierce to the unclean. To those who have been purged of self-interest,self-consciousness, and the ego in general, these hideous monsters appear asangelic beings: the fierceness was one’s own gross nature reflected on the facesof the guardians.It is to this sector of the Tree of Life that Crowley successor Kenneth Granthas applied so much of his learning and exegesis. Grant believes that what theQabalists consider the Abyss is actually a Gate, a way out to the zone of thestars, and a way in for the alien intelligences that have been summoned bymagicians. While he devotes nearly an entire book to this thesis (Nightside ofEden), he covers the theme in many of his other works as well. In Outside theCircles of Time, he states that Choronzon “creates the event-act known as TheBeast, viz: the creative vortex in the Aether that gives rise to themanifestation of phenomena via the mechanics of atavistic resurgence.”44 InHecate’s Fountain, he writes, “To enter into consciousness of this mystery is tobecome ashes to one world, but living and eternal fire to the next …” 45Inreference to studies by fellow occultist Michel Bertiaux, he writes (in Cults ofthe Shadow), “Choronzon, as the guardian of the gate between the known universeand the unknown universe—A and B—equates with ideas shared by all cults of theShadow …,” linking Choronzon and the Abyss to Haitian voodoo, for instance.46Finally, Grant defines the Abyss as “the Gulf between the unreal and the real,i.e., between phenomena and noumenon. Crossing the Abyss is the most criticalevent on the Spiritual Path.… Only the total abolition of the ego, or limitedindividual consciousness, makes a successful crossing possible.”47As mentioned in an earlier chapter, Grant also makes note of the fact that thedrawing of one of Crowley’s alien intelligences, Lam, is virtually identical tothe famous portrait of one of the Visitors that adorns Whitley Strieber’sCommunion. If we posit, for a moment, the idea that all of the theories ofKenneth Grant and Aleister Crowley refer to specific phenomena—however theyinterpret them—then we have a sudden resurgence of those phenomena in the eventsexperienced by Whitley Strieber, as well as by others before and since.Ed Conroy, the reporter who researched Whitley Strieber’s claims for abook entitled Report On Communion: An Independent Investigation of andCommentary on Whitley Strieber’s Communion, also noted the correlations betweenStrieber’s experiences and western occultism in general, taking particular careto cite Kenneth Grant, and Grant’s views on the UFO phenomenon as an occultevent of great importance, and then spends pages discussing Aleister Crowley’sinvocation of Choronzon … without being aware at this time of Whitley’sexperience of the nine knocks.48For me, the nine knocks were personal confirmation.—Whitley Strieber49Indeed.To an occultist, the “nine knocks” may appear sinister, heavy with foreboding,for it serves in its grouping of three triads as an invocation of Choronzon; oris it perhaps a signal from the Abyss that the “Portal” is open. The Portal isthe gateway to the Inner Temple, the Holy of Holies, and of this Israel Regardiewrites,We are told in the Portal that the nine months’ wait which must intervene beforethe Portal is again opened for the Aspirant has a correspondence to the ninemonths of gestation before birth.50(It was eighteen months to the day between Strieber’s “nine knocks” and the“nine knocks” of Glenrock, Wyoming: two times nine months. One wonders how thePortal was opened nine months after Strieber’s experience and nine months beforeGlenrock’s? And what did Glenrock do to deserve this in the first place?)For years I have told of being present at the University of Texas when CharlesWhitman went on his shooting spree from the tower in 1966. But I wasn’tthere. Then where was I?—Whitley Strieber51Strieber’s experiences are certainly bizarre enough by themselves, but whenrelated to other events occurring at the same time they take on larger, morecosmic overtones. Strieber’s books vacillate between “Gee, I have no idea whatis happening to me,” and “Gee, this must be an event of momentous importance!”as well they should. We are in no mood for prophets these days, unless they cangive us the winning lottery number, so those who have been touched bysupernatural forces are generally encouraged to keep silent andpass the butter.For instance, as quoted above, he firmly believed for years that he had been atthe University of Texas when Charles Whitman began sniping at innocent civiliansfrom the Tower. Yet, as he discovered later to his chagrin, he was never there.He did attend UT, but a year or more after the event in question, and he doesn’tknow why he believed he was there, with such vivid memories of what went on.In other cases, he has no memories of entire weeks of his life, weeks that havedisappeared and for which he has only scraps of information, none of which seemto make sense when strung together (as he himself admits). The year 1968 is acase in point, and one with extreme relevance to our story.In January of 1968, Strieber left Texas to go to London. He had been accepted atthe London School of Film Technique, and the twenty-two-year-old was lookingforward to spending time in England. But after about six months, he findshimself taking a train to Italy from London and meeting on the train a younglady. The couple decide to travel together and somehow they wind up in Rome, butafter a stop of a few days? six weeks? in Florence. Once in Rome, they break up(for whatever reason, Strieber does not remember) and Whitley takes anothertrain, this time bound for Strasbourg. From Strasbourg he goes by rail acrossFrance, winding up at the Spanish border at Port Bou, where he takes yet anothertrain and winds up in Barcelona, booking a small room on the Ramblas. All thistime he is in a state of fear, but we never learn the object of that fear, onlythat it may, somehow, have to do with the Visitors. He eventually returns toLondon, but has been gone for much longer than he thought: about six weeks isthe best guess.52 Further, he also has memories of attending some kind of“ancient university” at this time, and of seeing adobe huts which made him thinkof North Africa (an easy trip from Spain).What are we to make of this?During Whitley Strieber’s radio interview of this author about Unholy Alliance,he mentioned in passing that he had visited the headquarters of the Processwhile he was in London that year, and that of course made my ears prick up evenas the revelation caught me off guard. 1968 was a particularly volatile time forthe Process, and it was during this year that Manson Family member Bruce Daviswas known to have paid a visit or two to Process head-quarters in London.Further, Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski were wed in London in January of thatyear, the same month Strieber flew to London from Texas. (In the spring of 1968,both Sirhan Sirhan and Naomi Judd would, at different times, visit TheosophicalSociety headquarters in Los Angeles.) Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. wasassassinated that April, and his putative assassin, James Earl Ray, escaped toLondon in May, visiting first Portugal and then returning to London to buytickets for Belgium. He was arrested in June of that year in London andextradited back to the United States. Bobby Kennedy was assassinated a day ortwo earlier, and the Process went underground almost immediately in Los Angeles.On July 29, when Whitley was presumably on the Continent, scientist Dr. JamesMcDonald—a former US Navy intelligence officer during World War II—testifiedbefore Congress on the reality of the UFO phenomenon. (He would commit suicidesome time later.) And, in November of 1968, Bruce Davis visited the Process inLondon. Whitley Strieber was still in London, and did not return to the UnitedStates until December of that year.53 There is, of course, no evidence at allthat Strieber ever met Davis, or that the two men were ever in Processheadquarters at the same time. That is not the point I am trying to make,however.Whitley Strieber, who for a long time inexplicably believed (erroneously) thathe had been at the University of Texas on the day that Charles Whitman beganshooting people at random, was in London when James Earl Ray was there after theMartin Luther King assassination; he was in London, visiting the Process, thesame year that Manson Family member Bruce Davis was in London visiting theProcess; he was in London when Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski were marriedthere.We would not consider all of this as evidence of anything at all, except thatWhitley’s behavior during 1968 was bizarre by his own admission, and that he hadalso visited the Process—for whatever reason—that same year. The author believesthat Whitley’s odyssey probably had nothing at all to do with the Process perse; that his visiting their headquarters in London might have been motivatedmore by simple curiosity than anything else. Yet, placing the young—by now,twenty-three-year-old—Whitley Strieber at the Process headquarters in London atthe same time that they were forging some kind of link with the Manson Family issuggestive of some deeper influence, for the Process would later leaveCalifornia for New York City, which is where Whitley wound up after leavingLondon and at the same time. They also had operations in Texas, principallyHouston, where Maury Terry opines they were working with the Son of Sam cult—if,indeed, the two groups could safely be considered separate by that time, the1970s.No, Whitley Strieber is not some crazed Process/Son of Sam hitman; rather he wasa contactee, vibrating like a tuning fork with all of the resonant associationstaking place around him. One would have probably thought nothing at all of thesecoincidental links except for that one, salient piece of data: that he hadvisited the Process in London in 1968. For someone who had been at the mercy ofthe “secret school” since the age of six, and particularly since the age ofnine, dealing with God-knows-what (military mind-control experiment or alienabduction), it comes as something of a shock—like a significant plot twist in acinematic drama—to find him wandering into Process headquarters only a fewmonths before Bruce Davis makes one of several known appearances there. Afterthat episode, however, things quieted down for Whitley.At least for a while.In 1970, Whitley and Anne Strieber were married and lived in New York, on West55th Street in Manhattan. Strieber cannot recall much of significance untilApril of 1977, when more strange occurrences began to take place. This time,both he and Anne heard a voice coming out of their stereo. This in itself is nota strange occurrence in New York City, where police and taxi radios frequentlycome in over stereo receivers in the home, but in this case the voice had aconversation with the young couple, something which is certainly not possibleunder ordinary circumstances.After a series of moves back and forth to Connecticut they eventually settledfor a time in New York City, and maintained the famous cabin upstate where themost dramatic of the “visitations” took place. At some point during these earlyyears of his marriage, however, Whitley Strieber and his wife Anne becameinvolved with the Gurdjieff Foundation.The Gurdjieff Foundation can hardly be considered a cult. During the same timethat Whitley was a member, this author was in contact with a few other membersin New York, who held the organization in high esteem and virtually spoke of itonly in whispers. It operates relatively secretly, and is devoted to theteachings of both the Georgian mystic G.I. Gurdjieff and his most famousdisciple, P. D. Ouspensky. Interested readers are encouraged to read theirworks, as there is no time or space here to go into much discussion of theirphilosophy.Suffice it to say that it is hermetic, and metaphysical. There are physicalexercises, chants (in particular the Gurdjieffian “double tone” chant) andmeditations, as well as teachings on a wide variety of subjects pertaining to anilluminated understanding of nature and consciousness, including Gurdjieff ’sfamous insistence that most people are “asleep,” and need to “wake up.” It is amethod to integrate the dissociated parts of one’s personality, much likeJungian depth psychology but in a more active way (the passive Jungian systemhaving a great deal in common with Freudian psychoanalysis). By all accounts,Gurdjieff himself was a powerful occultist, and had been trained at variousplaces in Asia Minor and the Caucasus. He was also a trickster, and used paradoxand practical jokes in the way Jesus used parables and miracles. In the end,those of his followers who adhere strictly to his teachings are generallyconsidered to be forces for good in the world, and only the most doctrinaire ofChristian theologian would go so far as to condemn them as “cultists.”One knows that Strieber gained very much through his fifteen-year associationwith them; unintentionally perhaps, they gave him tools for understanding hisalien experiences, and methods for safeguarding himself and his family from thefallout of the traumatic processes to which he was subjected.54 At one point, inhis mid-thirties, he also found himself “working with young people” at theFoundation, and that must have struck a subconscious chord with his repressedmemories of the “secret school.”Around the time he parted ways with the Gurdjieff Foundation, he had theterrifying series of experiences in the New York cabin that he relates inCommunion. Since that time, he has created a virtual cottage industry incontactee experiences and has developed that theme into something more baldlyspiritual and metaphysical, in books such as The Key and The Path which hemarkets on his own Web site, www.unknowncountry.com. Although he has alwaysstressed the spiritual side of the Visitor experience—even from the early daysof Communion—the importance of the esoteric as it relates to the Visitors hasbecome more pronounced in his writings in the past few years. That said, he hasnot abandoned the traditional areas of UFOlogy, such as saucer sightings andcattle mutilations, even as he has expanded into new realms, including someconspiracy literature and secret society lore. The interrelationship of all ofthese fields is something of which Strieber is keenly aware, and he links it toapocalyptic presentiments of global destruction and the possibility of a majorappearance by the Visitors in the near future.The Swiss psychiatrist C.G. Jung wrote a book devoted to the UFO phenomenon,entitled Flying Saucers and published in 1958 in German, and in English thefollowing year. Jung is also the source for the concept of synchronicity, and wewill address this more fully in the following chapter. What he has to say aboutthose who have witnessed UFO contacts or sightings is actually quite apt in thiscase, and bears quoting:The empirical man extends beyond his conscious boundaries, his life and fatehave far more than a personal meaning. He attracts the interest of “anotherworld”; achievements are expected of him which go beyond the empirical realm andits narrow limits.… This numinous transformation is not the result of consciousintention or intellectual conviction, but is brought about by the impact ofoverwhelming archetypal impressions.55And:An experience of this kind is not without its dangers, because it often has aninflating effect on the individual. His ego fancies itself increased andexalted, whereas in reality it is thrust into the background.… It is not the egothat is exalted; rather, something greater than it makes its appearance: theself, a symbol that expressed the whole man.56This could go a long way toward explaining Whitley Strieber’s development from awriter of horror fiction to the promoter of a kind of New Age mysticism based onhis memories of the Visitors and the integration of them into his personalspirituality. Strieber himself writes of the phrase he heard during hisabduction in the New York forest: “You are the chosen one,” a phrase heimmediately rejected as a little too hokey, but one that would have been in linewith Jung’s evaluation. Jung, of course, was inclined to reject the UFOphenomenon as simply a psychological matter for interpretation, until he had toadmit that there was sufficient evidence to show that these sightings were notthe result of mere hallucination, but had been tracked on radar and witnessed bymilitary observers who were (in 1958) taking it seriously.57Behind all of this is the lurking suspicion that some of these experiences maynot be the result of benign forces looking to improve the lot of mankind, or thenatural process of Jungian individuation. Again, it may beuseless—psychologically speaking—to draw a sharp line of distinction between anactual alien visitation and the inner, spiritual experience it initiates. Butcan we be sure that the initiatory process (when put in motion by an experienceof the Visitors) is “benign”? After all, just because a civilization is moreadvanced than we are technologically does not mean it has our best interests atheart. If nothing else, the history of colonialism would tell us that. That analien race may be neither benign nor hostile, but simply self-interested, is anidea not normally entertained by the UFOlogists. Indeed, the world could be inthe position of the Native American population of Manhattan Island, who soldtheir birthright for a string of beads. (The experience of aboriginalpopulations when it comes to the advent of colonial powers is worthwhilerevisiting for the lessons it can teach us: powerful invading forces thatsweetly smile on the natives and assure them that they mean no harm, and thenproceed to rape the country, exploit its natural resources, and enslave orslaughter the residents as they go along. How could the aboriginals understandthe mentality of the colonial powers, when they had no social context in whichto place such an “otherworldly” event? How could they defend themselves, or evenunderstand that they had to do so?) Even more troublesome, genuine contacteeexperiences may be mixed up with nefarious government disinformation programs,thus corrupting the entire contactee “database.”A SECRET BRUISEIf mine was not an uncommon experience, it might be that we live in a societythat bears a secret bruise from it.—Whitley Strieber58It’s not as if there were no evidence that the planet has been visited bysomething. The number of sightings that have taken place that have never beensatisfactorily explained as due to atmospheric anomalies, swamp gas, the planetVenus, etc. is quite large. The number of sightings that have been tracked bythe military on radar is also large enough to warrant some seriousinvestigation. The number of sightings by commercial airline pilots is alsoworth consideration. And that is not counting sightings by citizens, people thegovernment and the scientists do not deem “credible” because they have notraining in celestial observations. In other words, the UFO phenomenon has beenhijacked by the very establishments we have reason to believe may be responsiblefor at least some of the disinformation and misinformation that has gone on forso long in connection with the “flying saucers.” There is no question thateyewitnesses make mistakes; there have been many studies in the psychologicaland criminological literature proving just that. However, what those studies donot prove is that while eyewitnesses may differ on the size and shape of acriminal, the clothing he was wearing or the color of his eyes, they normallyagree on the fact that a crime has been committed: a gun did go off, a car wasstolen, a man was beaten, a woman was raped. As Dr. James McDonald relayed inhis Congressional testimony: “Those eyewitnesses don’t come in from, say, astreet corner accident and claim they saw a giraffe killed by a tiger.… There islegally confusing difference of timing and distance, and so on; but all are inagreement that it was an auto accident.”59In the case of the UFO phenomenon, eyewitnesses may differ as to the number ofcolored lights, or the sound or lack of sound, or the shape of the craft; theyagree, however, that something strange was in the sky that night. The weaknessof eyewitness testimony is something that conservative scientists and scientificobservers and skeptics—like the late Carl Sagan, for instance—rely upon tobolster their a priori judgment that the craft seen was not a craft at allbecause the witnesses cannot agree on specific details. They have become, ineffect, defense attorneys poking holes in the testimony of witnesses in order toprotect their client, in this case the scientific (or military) establishment.To be sure, as Sagan said “extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof ”;but who decides what is ordinary and extraordinary proof? And, really, what isan extraordinary claim? Since the time of the Renaissance, science has usurpedthe role of religion and has relegated to itself the right to decide uponmatters that were once the province of faith: specifically, the nature ofreality, of creation itself. When science demands physical evidence of aliencontact—evidence beyond the scorched circles in the farmyards, the blips on theradar screens, the affidavits by eyewitnesses, the photographs of celestialanomalies taken during nighttime and daylight—it has slyly changed the rules ofthe game. Evidence good enough for a court of law is no longer evidence, which,of course, calls into question the truth of other verdicts handed down by thosesame courts.Science, quite rightly, places itself above and beyond such political decisions.Like Supreme Court justices, scientists reserve the right to tell the truth nomatter what the effect will be on popular ideas of what is real and what is not,what is fact and what is fiction. Yet, in actual practice, the reality issomewhat different. The history of science is the history of the relationshipbetween scientists and politicians, between men of science and men ofrealpolitik who hold the purse strings on the government grants so desperatelyneeded for research. The history of science is the history of scientists: menand women so fiercely competitive that they will falsify data and steal theresearch of others to further their own agendas, their own careers. In otherwords, scientists are people prone to the same vanities and cardinal sins as therest of us, and this humanity colors their perceptions, particularly of theunanswerable questions which—since they are unanswerable—serve no pragmaticpurpose for a scientist who must earn a living doing useful work. Let’s look forour keys under the streetlamp because there’s more light there, even though welost them across the street.This blindered view of scientists toward the UFO phenomenon has workedextraordinarily well for the government and the military, for it means they havethe ability to study the problem at their leisure, without having to explainanything to the populace at large. They can simply refer the curious to thescientists, who will tell them that there is nothing to worry about.There have been exceptions of course.It is unfortunate that Dr. McDonald couldn’t understand or adjust to thepolitical-military situation, and chose instead to act only according to strictscientific dictates.—Dr. J. Allen Hynek60On July 29, 1968, Dr. James E. McDonald—Professor in the Department ofMeteorology at the University of Arizona and a Senior Physicist at the Instituteof Atmospheric Physics, former US Naval intelligence officer during World WarII, member of various scientific associations, husband, and father of sixchildren—testified before the Committee on Science and Aeronautics of the U.S.House of Representatives during their Symposium on Unidentified Flying Objects.In a very thoughtful, reasoned way—both in his oral testimony and in theprepared statement that was inserted into the Record—Dr. McDonald came out insupport of the extraterrestrial origin of some of the UFOs seen over America andthe rest of the world. As a meteorologist, he was well-equipped to dismiss someof the “atmospheric” explanations of the phenomenon, such as ball lightning orswamp gas. After describing several convincing cases of UFO sightings andactivity, and attacking positions taken by other scientists who were notmeteorologists and therefore who made mistakes in their evaluations of theevidence, he addressed a famous UFO debunker, Philip Klass of Aviation Week, whospecialized in ridiculing UFO reports, saying that Klass’ explanations of UFOsightings as “atmospheric-electrical plasmas” just “do not make good sense.”61Then, rather than beat around the bush with the type of vague statements wetoo often expect from our professional class, he was quite straightforward inhis estimate of the situation:To conclude, then, my position is that UFO’s are entirely real and we do notknow what they are, because we have laughed them out of court. The possibilitythat these are extraterrestrial devices, that we are dealing with surveillancefrom some advanced technology, is a possibility I take very seriously.62He then answered a number of questions put to him by the assembledRepresentatives.Representative Bell asked, “What leads you to believe that whatever thesephenomena are, they are extraterrestrial?“What facts do you have?”To which Dr. McDonald replied:May I say that I wouldn’t use the word “believe.” I would say the “hypothesis”that these are extraterrestrial surveillance, is the hypothesis Ipresently regard as most likely.He then clarified his statement by referring to the evidence he had examinedover the previous two years of intense study:It is this very large body of impressive witnesses’ testimony, radar-trackingdata on ultra-high-speed objects sometimes moving at over 5,000 miles an hour,UFO’s, combined radar-visual sightings, and just too much other consistentevidence that suggests we are dealing with machine-like devices from somewhereelse.63McDonald’s testimony was valuable, and his verbal statement before the Committeeplus the appended report makes an interesting contribution to the rationaldiscussion of the UFO phenomenon. Unfortunately, Dr. McDonald was ridiculed fortaking an unabashed “pro-UFO” stand. His testimony before Congress on otherissues—such as the danger to the ozone layer posed by the supersonic transport,or SST—was greeted with derision by some Congressional committee members, whodescribed him as “the man who believed in little green men.” Philip Klass, whosomehow saw McDonald as a kind of nemesis, is known to have planted falseinformation with investigative journalist Jack Anderson, claiming that Dr.McDonald used US Navy funds illegally to study UFOs. Although this claim waslater disproved by Navy auditors, the pressure of public humiliation andridicule became too much.On June 13, 1971 his body was found in the Arizona desert, an apparent suicide.There was a revolver next to his body, and a note. Dr. McDonald had beensilenced forever. But he was not the first.Morris K. Jessup was another scientist whose support of continued UFO researchvery probably cost him his life. An astrophysicist with degrees in astronomy andmathematics, who had served with the US Army during World War I, Jessup was ageneration older than James McDonald. He spent time in the Union of South Africain the 1920s, and then in Brazil during the Depression, and later with anarchaeological expedition in Central America studying Maya ruins, a junketfunded by the Carnegie Foundation. The ancient ruins fascinated the youngastronomer, and he would make a return visit there in the 1950s to determine howthe huge monuments were built without the aid of machines. At the time, the UFOphenomenon had reached epidemic proportions, with massive sightings throughoutthe world, but particularly in France and the United States. Jessup studied theavailable evidence, and eventually—in 1955—published The Case for the UFO. Inaddition, Jessup felt that some of the geological anomalies he had discoveredduring his visits to the Mexican and Central American jungles and ruins wereconsistent with some types of lunar cratering, and that they could only havebeen made by an intelligent, albeit alien, race.Jessup would have joined the ranks of the other scientists who took UFOsseriously and been laughed out of existence had it not been for the so-called“Allende letters,” and the insistence of a strange, probably crank,correspondent that the US Navy had conducted an experiment in “electroniccamouflage” during World War II at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, with disastrousresults. According to the correspondent, who identified himself as “CarlosMiguel Allende” (an identification which is in some dispute, as the samecorrespondent also signed his name on other letters to Jessup as “Carl M.Allen”), the experiment had taken place sometime in 1943, when Allende was aseaman, and had caused the U.S.S. Eldridge, a destroyer escort, to disappear,then to reappear in Norfolk, Virginia, only to disappear and reappear back atthe Philadelphia Navy Yard. This incident, referred to as “the PhiladelphiaExperiment,” allegedly was witnessed by Albert Einstein, whose work on theUnified Field Theory started the whole program in the first place. Supposedly,the crew of the Eldridge (those that survived, not all did) were discharged asbeing mentally unfit, and the entire experiment classified.The Philadelphia Experiment is a favorite story among the credulous, and wasmade into a science fiction film a few years ago. (Notice the odd near-homonymat work between Eldridge and that word so favored by H.P. Lovecraft:“eldritch.”) We would not even be addressing it here at all were it not forofficial US government interest in Jessup’s correspondence with “CarlosAllende,” and the mystery of the “annotated book.”While many—too many—of the supposed witnesses and participants to this“experiment” are off the record and unidentified in the book by William L. Mooreand Charles Berlitz, The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility,64 itnevertheless gives an otherwise detailed look at this controversy, and isvirtually the only text available in print on the subject. Berlitz, of course,is the author of The Bermuda Triangle, the book that popularized that subject,and is of course that Berlitz, of the language schools. William L. Moore isidentified as a schoolteacher from Minnesota who has been pursuing the subjectof the Philadelphia Experiment relentlessly since hearing of it from people whoclaimed to have been there. While Moore is credited with authoring the book, itwas done so “in consultation with Charles Berlitz,” and bears the latter’sIntroduction.Central to this story is the idea that, running parallel to the ManhattanProject which was, of course, the development of the atomic bomb, the USmilitary was involved in other secret weapons research. Albert Einstein is knownto have worked as a consultant to the US Navy in 1943 for unspecified research,as well, which adds more fuel to the fire. In addition, many of the variousofficers and ships mentioned in the rambling, near-hysterical Allende Letterswere later proven to have existed and, indeed, Allende/Allen could only haveknown about these details if he had, in fact, been a seaman in the same theaterat the time of the alleged incident, which was later shown to be the case, whena copy of his US Department of Commerce certificate was published in Moore’sbook. In fact, the Allende Letters evidence a knowledge of the details of theNavy yards where the “Experiment” was said to have taken place on the one hand,and of the involvement in secret projects by both Albert Einstein and BertrandRussell, however murky or ambiguous this involvement was.The rest of the Letters, however, are strictly Fantasyland. Ships disappearingat sea, sailors “frozen” half in and half out of this dimension, etc. Yet theletters were convincing enough that Dr. Jessup asked for further proof.Allende/Allen obliged by giving more names, dates and places and even offered togo under hypnosis and “truth serum” sessions in order to retrieve phone numbers,addresses, etc. He also brought up the idea that the Navy had used some of thisscience as a means of developing a propulsion system … for the UFOs. At the sametime, his letters were virtually written in crayon: different colored inks,inappropriate capitalizations, underlinings … in short, the typical sort ofcommunication one receives from people suffering from a mental disorder. Then,again, that also goes to evidence: according to the Letters, many of the sailorsinvolved in the Philadelphia Experiment wound up being discharged as “mentallyunfit.”Then, in the summer of 1955, a copy of Morris Jessup’s book, The Case for theUFO, was sent to the Navy’s Office of Naval Research. It was heavily annotatedby the anonymous correspondent, and the nature of the remarks startled the navalofficers who received it; so much so, that they contacted Jessup and asked tosee him.When Jessup arrived in Washington, he was shown the copy of his book with theplentiful notations and remarks, and the experience seems to have beenunsettling. He recognized the handwriting as that of his crazed correspondent,Allende, and told the officers that he had two letters from the same man in hisfiles. The officers insisted that they needed to see them as soon as possible.In return, they would give Jessup a copy of the annotated book in order to gethis input.What were the annotations like? They discussed everything from the UFOs, theirpropulsion systems, “magnetic fields, gravity fields, sheets of diamond, cosmicrays, force cutters, inlay work …” etc., etc.65 The annotator knew of a greatmany details that were known only to Jessup or to a handful of specialists inthe field of UFOs, and “many other matters usually of concern mainly topsychics, cultists and mystics. That these were true or not was not the point.The fact that they should be so precisely known to an unknown was.”66 Thisbothered the scientist more than anything else, this and the fact that the Navywas actually taking the ravings of this mysterious individual seriously. And, ofcourse, the Philadelphia Experiment was also mentioned in the notes.Demonstrating the extent to which the Navy took this matter to heart is themethod by which they made copies of the book. There was no photocopy machine in1955, so the book had to be retyped by hand on mimeograph stencils! This editionis referred to as the Varo edition, because the work of typing and mimeographingthe entire work (in two colors, black for the original text and red for theannotations) was evidently undertaken by a temporary secretary hired by thatcompany for that purpose. 67Jessup was presented with three copies of his own,and he took to reading and re-reading the notes and eventually annotating theannotations.This development contributed to a gradual deterioration of Jessup’s mental andfinancial state. Various projects he had proposed for a return to the CentralAmerican jungles to research ancient civilizations had come to nought, and thisbrilliant scientist was reduced to writing for astrological journals andresearching psychic phenomena … “reduced” may be too strong a word, for hissudden conversion to the purely paranormal may have been the result of hisintense study of the annotated book and the realization that for some reason theNavy was taking it seriously. Like many who have come across the same or similarconstellation of factors, he found the psychological stresses to beenormous—particularly for a man of science—and in 1958, at the end of his rope,he visited an old friend in New York. This was the naturalist Ivan T. Sandersonand it was, appropriately enough, “on or about Halloween evening.” Jessup gavehis friend his copy of the annotated book—this time containing his ownannotations as well—and told him to hold it for safekeeping in case anythinghappened to him.Sanderson later stated,At this our last meeting he was extremely distraught and admitted that due to anoriginally pure intellectual interest in natural phenomena, he found that he hadbeen completely swept into a weird and insane world of unreality. He expressedoutright terror at the endless stream of “coincidences” that had occurred in hiswork and in his private life …68Again, the “coincidence stream” rears its head; it is a familiar phenomenon toartists, writers and especially researchers into the paranormal, the study ofwhich seems to increase the number and frequency of coincidences to an almostalarming rate.Jessup left New York shortly thereafter, and it was believed he was returning tohis home in Indiana. However, he never made it there. Instead, he drove to ahouse he owned, unknown to anyone, in Coral Gables, Florida. His friends andpublishers were frantically trying to locate him when they discovered he hadbeen hurt in some type of automobile accident in December of 1958, but hadrecovered and was still in Florida, exhausted, struggling to revive his writingcareer and being rejected by his publishers.Then, on April 20, 1959 Morris Jessup was found, barely alive, in his car in apark near his home. He had run a hose from his exhaust pipe into his vehicle. Hewas rushed to a hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival.Was it a suicide? Naturally, there are those who contest this verdict. Mooreclaims that he obtained access to medical examiner files on the Jessup suicide69showing that Jessup was quite drunk when he ran the hose into his car. Theunsettling thing about this piece of evidence is that Jessup was known to be atthat time on medication which, in combination with alcohol, would have eitherkilled him immediately or at the very least rendered him incapable of driving acar and running the hose from his exhaust pipe in such a calculated manner. Thismeans he would have had to start drinking after he arrived in the park and ranthe hose. Was a bottle found in Jessup’s car? Was Jessup still taking medicationto save his life when he knew he wanted to end it? Unfortunately, we don’t knowany of this from Moore’s book.As mentioned, most of the more sensational claims in Moore’s book come fromunnamed informants, so it is virtually impossible to come to any conclusionabout the Philadelphia Experiment. The facts that can be verified are those thatrelate to Morris Jessup himself, his work, his support of an aggressive researchprogram on UFOs and on alternative forms of energy and propulsion, the“annotated book” episode and the Allende Letters, and his tragic end.Two scientists, both fervent supporters of a more open and aggressive study ofthe UFO phenomenon, drive to secluded areas away from their homes and commitsuicide. More recently, another scientist met a similar end: a UN weaponsinspector, Dr. David Kelly, who went to an isolated location in the Englishcountryside in July 2003 with a bottle of pain killers and a revolver. Dr. Kellyhad leaked information to the British press that intelligence estimates ofIraq’s weapons capability had been exaggerated, presumably in order to supportPrime Minister Tony Blair’s decision to join with the United States in theinvasion of Iraq earlier that year. It led to a firestorm of controversy overthe legitimacy of Blair’s decision, with ramifications for President George W.Bush as well, similar claims having been leveled against his administration.(Clearly, terrorists have replaced UFOs as potential threats to nationalsecurity.) We want our scientists to be priests of the truth, of scientificfacts which we believe are the psalms of reality; but we don’t want them todeviate from the line set down by our politicians and military leaders. We don’twant them to tell too much truth. “For not all true things are to be said to allmen.”The infamous Condon Report, published in 1968, is a case in point. Highly toutedas an independent investigation to determine once and for all the reality behindthe UFO phenomenon, it became obvious—through the “Low memorandum” that wasleaked to the press—that the Condon committee had no intention of proving ordisproving UFOs based on evidence, but was determined to put the controversy torest no matter the damage to the cause of truth. The committee was formed in1966 at the request of the United States Air Force, and was based at theUniversity of Colorado under the stewardship of nuclear physicist Dr. EdwardCondon, a scientist who had worked on the atomic bomb and on space technology.His attitude towards UFOs was biased from the beginning, and his introduction tothe Report was grossly at odds with the actual report itself, which containeddata on many unsolved cases that merited further study. What destroyed thecredibility of the Condon Report—or The Scientific Study of Unidentified FlyingObjects to give it its formal title—was the publication of the August 1966 LowMemorandum, written by Condon’s second-in-command, Robert Low, which containedthe following, damning paragraph:The trick would be, I think, to describe the project so that, to the public, itwould appear a totally objective study but, to the scientific community, wouldpresent the image of a group of non-believers trying their best to be objective,but having an almost zero expectation of finding a saucer.The Report was criticized long and loudly by many who had hoped for an unbiasedapproach to the problem (including its most vocal critic, Dr. James McDonald, aswell as Dr. J. Allen Hynek who, in disgust with the Report, began his ownorganization to study UFOs), especially as the Air Force was about to canceltheir own long-standing UFO program, Project Blue Book. Even Dr. Condon himselfwould eventually admit to the press that the Report was a waste of taxpayers’money, in this case $500,000 to cover two-years’ worth of foot-dragging andobstructionism. In the end, even the files themselves (public property, afterall, paid for with public funds) were never made public, and were eventuallyburned. It was said that Condon himself had been the victim of US governmentpressure to present a report that debunked UFOs, that he had been blackmailedconcerning security investigations of his background that had taken place duringthe McCarthy era.70This theory was documented rather convincingly in Major Donald E. Keyhoe’sAliens From Space: The Real Story of Unidentified Flying Objects,71 which,despite its sensationalistic title, is one of the more sober and more revealingof the UFO books by insiders. Keyhoe—a retired US Marine Corps officer and acentral figure in the UFO debates of the 1960s and 1970s—reveals the politicalmachinations that went on behind the scenes of the Condon Report, and shows howthe Air Force was desperate to use the Condon Report to discredit UFO sightingsin general. The 1960s saw a huge increase in the number of UFO sightings aroundthe world, and the Air Force was unable to respond to the problem in any way. Itdid not have the technology to engage the UFOs in either communication orcombat, and the sightings by credible witnesses—including high-ranking militarypersonnel—were rendering the swamp gas and weather balloon explanationslaughable. Condon himself had been a target of the House Un-American ActivitiesCommittee investigation in the 1950s, and this presented the Air Force withanother problem. The report was due out in the fall of 1968, around the time ofthe US presidential elections. Depending on who won the election, the CondonReport could be buried … or it could become a national (and international) causecélèbre. It was important to release the Report as the official word ofscientists that there was nothing to the UFO reports, and that they were all theresult of mistakes by untrained and non-credible witnesses, especially in viewof the outcome of the presidential election of November 1968; for the man whowon that election was the same man who had sat across from Dr. Condon during theHUAC investigation, a man who developed an intense dislike for the scientist:Richard M. Nixon.Nixon would have been only too happy to attack Condon over the Report if theReport acknowledged the existence of extraterrestrial flying objects, if only todisgrace and humiliate Condon. The problem with this scenario is that it wouldput the Report front and center before the press and the public, and the Reportwas full of cases where the UFO sightings could not be explained away by theusual swamp gas and weather balloon scenarios. It was better if no one lookedtoo closely at the Report. Hence, the public pronouncements by Condon, and hisfabled introduction in which he claims that none of the cases studied by theCondon Committee were of otherworldly spacecraft, but could all be explainedaway.In other words, the government once again told the scientists what to say to theworld about the world, and about science itself.In a related development, Rear Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, first Director ofthe CIA and decorated war hero, quit his job at NICAP (National InvestigativeCommittee of Aerial Phenomena, the most prestigious of all the UFO investigativegroups) within days of a CIA investigation of his proposed role in opening theUFO investigation at the Congressional level with the support of Senators likeGoldwater and Kefauver and many others. Although an ardent supporter of effortsto investigate UFOs and a harsh critic of US Air Force attempts to cover up andwhitewash what were turning out to be hundreds of verified sightings (if notthousands), he inexplicably disappeared from the UFO scene in 1962 due, Keyhoebelieves, to pressure from “a very high level” to block the proposed CapitolHill investigation.72Noting the presence of CIA officials at every level of this investigation (asreported by Keyhoe), and noting that this occurred only months after the firingof Allen Dulles as Director of the CIA over the Bay of Pigs affair and theensuing hatred and distrust of President Kennedy by some of the remaining CIAhands, and noting that February of that year saw the first earth orbit by anAmerican astronaut, we are left with an embarrassment of paranoid riches onceagain. The Capitol Hill investigation of the UFO phenomenon did not take place,Hillenkoetter retired from NICAP, John Glenn orbited the earth, and the worldsettled down to other matters: the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Kennedyassassination, a massive wave of UFO sightings in 1965 … the assassinations ofRobert Kennedy and Martin Luther King in 1968, the election of Richard Nixon aspresident that same year, the Condon Report of January 1969 … the suicide of Dr.James E. McDonald.It is a scene of awful beauty. A strange object is seen in the skies overKentucky on January 7, 1948. It is a large, round metallic machine, and it isdescending in the vicinity of Godman AFB, heading south towards Tennessee andwitnessed by thousands of people including the base commander, Colonel Guy Hix,who authorizes a squadron of three P-51s to intercept the craft. All but onepeel off and head back to base as it becomes obvious that the strange object hasbegun to climb at an alarming rate for a man-made device, and the World WarII-era planes are not equipped with oxygen. But one pilot stays with the chase,oblivious to the danger to his life. A World War II veteran transport pilot,Captain Mantell climbs.The object reaches an altitude of 20,000 feet and Mantell stays with it; man andmachine, locked in ecstatic embrace, the light from the glowing object reflectedin his eyes, his Mustang screaming with the effort of climbing to 30,000 feet,higher than ever a Mustang has climbed before.His voice can be heard over the radio at Godman AFB.“I’ve sighted the thing.… It looks metallic and it’s tremendous in size.… Nowit’s starting to climb.…I’m trying to close in for a better look.”His wingmen have given up the chase. Mantell is alone.What happens next is the subject of tremendous controversy. Mantell, evidentlydue to lack of oxygen at the high altitude, has blacked out. His plane begins todescend in a sickening spiral, a power dive. There is a flash of brilliant whitelight, like an explosion, and then the Mustang belly-flops into a field. Mantellis dead. The Mustang, oddly enough, even though its wings and tail section haveseparated from the fuselage, shows no other signs that it has crash-landed.There is no damage to the fuselage. No scratching or any other indication thatthe plane had skidded or dived into the earth. No damage to surrounding trees orvegetation. The plane simply flopped down. Mantell is still strapped into hisseat, having made no effort to eject, due to his unconscious or semi-consciousstate by the time he reached 25,000 feet.73Although initial reports in the newspapers claim that Mantell died chasing aUFO, the Air Force quickly acts to suppress that bit of information. Their storyis that Mantell died chasing the planet Venus, which he had mistaken for a UFO.(This is the same story that would be given to future president Jimmy Carterwhen he reported a UFO sighting while he was still governor of Georgia.) Theproblem with this scenario is that the chase had occurred in broad daylight, atthree o’clock in the afternoon, when Venus is hardly visible. The second problemis that the altitude of Venus at that time—even if visible—was close to thehorizon and not straight up. The third problem is that Captain Mantell was anexperienced combat pilot who would not have mistaken a planet for a bogie. Thefourth problem is that thousands of other people saw the craft, includingMantell’s base commander, who watched it through his binoculars. The story wasthen changed to a Navy “Skyhook” balloon, but that account was challenged by themilitary’s own records: there were no Skyhook balloons anywhere near Kentucky atthat time. Further, such a balloon would have had to have been at an extremelyhigh altitude to account for all the eyewitnesses who reported it: more than 25miles high, and closer to 50.Also, the “balloon” seemed to take evasive action when pursued byCaptain Mantell.Only six months after Roswell and the Kenneth Arnold sighting, Captain Mantellgave chase to a UFO, determined once and for all to get to the bottom of themystery since he alone had been given the opportunity. Suffused with the joy offlight, the excitement of the chase, and knowing that he was pushing himself andhis plane (and, possibly, his government) to its limits, he locked on to histarget and gave it everything he had, secure in the knowledge that whateverhappened, his efforts would contribute to sure knowledge of the nature of theflying machines, the saucers, that were suddenly streaking across Americanskies. Was it a rictus of pain or a grin of boyish, joyful satisfaction onMantell’s face as he neared the 30,000 feet mark on his altimeter, the shiningobject tantalizingly out of reach, his fuselage rattling with the effort, hisprop blades a blur … and then, blackness.The debris of an aircraft that has plummeted to earth from 20,000 or 30,000 feetshould spread over a wide area, not be found as relatively intact as Mantell’sMustang. The source of the flash of light as he neared the ground has never beenidentified. Eyewitnesses say it came just before the plane left its dive ofmortal descent and “pancaked” to the ground … as if God had interceded at thislast moment and decided to place the aircraft reverently on the ground ratherthan allow it to plunge into the earth, nose first. Whatever the case, GodmanBase commander Colonel Hix transferred to San Antonio, Texas, where one day hisson would play in the swimming pool with young Whitley Strieber.A month after Mantell’s death, the Air Force Director of Intelligence issued aTop Secret memo—dated February 12, 1948—requesting that all air bases have atleast one plane equipped with camera equipment ready at all times to give chaseto UFOs. The request was denied, due to the enormous cost it would entail in menand machines.The Director of Intelligence was Charles P. Cabell, the man who would laterbecome deputy director of the CIA under Allen Dulles, before they were bothfired by President Kennedy over the Bay of Pigs—the man whose brother was mayorof Dallas, Texas the day Kennedy was assassinated in that city.Reality is what has been defined by our political leaders and not by our priestsor our scientists. The precedent established by our treatment of the UFOphenomenon—the manipulation of truth, the creation of reality through propagandaand psychological warfare and disinformation, the use of journalists andscientists and other men and women presumed to be dedicated to the truth—hasworked its way into the Cold War, Vietnam, Chile, Watergate, Iran-Contra, andnow the present situation in the Middle East. And people die: martyrs to amanufactured truth, to a cleverly-designed reality matrix, an invisible whiterabbit pulled from a grinning black magician’s black hat: a pookah.“Harvey”… with guns.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Julian Barnes, Flaubert’s Parrot, McGraw Hill, NY 1985, p. 93-94 2 Umberto Eco, “The Force of Falsity,” Serendipities, Orion, London, 1998, p. 3 3 Elaine Pagels, The Gnostic Gospels, Vintage Books, NY, 1981, p. 7 4 Ibid., p. 32 5 Ibid., p. 40 6 Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, The Dead Sea Scroll Deception, Corgi,London, 1991 7 Cited in The Secret Gospel by Morton Smith and in Bloodline of the Holy Grailby Laurence Gardner,Element, Shaftesbury, Dorset, 1999, p. 92 8 Whitley Strieber, Communion, Avon, New York, 1988, p. 57 9 Ed Conroy, Report On Communion, William Morrow, NY, 1989, p. 113 10 Strieber, op. cit., p. 11 11 Ibid. 12 Ibid., p. 16 13 Ibid., p. 37 14 Ibid., p. 38 15 Ibid., p. 38-40 16 John E.

The universe is mysterious.Reality itself is mysterious. No human has any true idea whether life has anytranscendent purpose or not, whether there is life after death, whether thereare such entities as absolute good and absolute evil.—Graham Hancock1Mystery is an occult force or efficacy that does not obey us, and we never knowhow or when it will manifest itself.—Octavio Paz2Human force cannot be other than spiritual; surely earth does not need man’sfeeble stirrings.—Kenneth Patchen3He expressed outright terror at the endless stream of “coincidences” that hadoccurred in his work and in his private life …—William L. Moore4I knew by now that when a group of individuals gravitated toward one another forno apparent reason, or a group of individuals inexplicably headed in the samedirection as if drawn by a magnetic field, or coincidence piled on coincidencetoo many times, as often as not the shadowy outlines of a covert intelligenceoperation were somehow becoming visible.— Jim Garrison5The complex theory of ‘synchronism’, partly based on the observation of suchcoincidences as these, might perhaps lead to an entirely new conception ofhistory.—Pauwels and Bergier6The French team of Jacques Pauwels and Louis Bergier published one of the mostexplosive books of its decade, The Morning of the Magicians (Le matin desmagiciens ) in 1960. According to the accepted mythology, Pauwels and Bergierhad served in the Resistance during World War II and since the end of the warhad become interested in the paranormal, both from their reading of literatureand history and what they observed among the Nazi elite, who were, in somecases, deeply involved in the subject. There are very few footnotes in TheMorning of the Magicians, and very little in the way of primary source material,making confirmation of some their claims nearly impossible; yet, recourse to theNational Archives in Washington, D.C. and the Library of Congress—as well as theformer Berlin Documentation Center—has made it possible to verify some of theirassertions, and to come up with quite a number more. These were covered in somedetail in this author’s Unholy Alliance, which has been cited before in thisstudy, and we won’t go into more detail here except to say that the basicpremise of Unholy Alliance is that the Nazi Party was not a political party aswe commonly understand it, but a cult. For confirmation of this, we only need tolook at the modern manifestations of the Nazi Party to see how thoroughly theyhave become combined with cultic principles.The Silver Shirts—an American pro-Nazi political party started by William DudleyPelley in the 1930s—is a prime example of this. Pelley’s organization wassuffused with mystical concepts (including a great deal of UFO lore after theWar), and Pelley himself was interned by the American government during WorldWar II as a subversive and possible enemy agent. The National Renaissance Partyof the 1950s through 1980s, run by James Madole, is another example of apro-Nazi “cult” that quoted extensively from Madame Blavatsky and Alice Bailey’sworks as justification for anti-Semitism and genocide. Today, the pro-MansonUniversal Order founded by neo-Nazi James Mason is another case in point, and weonly have to see the swastika Charles Manson etched into his own forehead tounderstand how deeply elements of American society idolize the Nazis and theforce it represents…and how dangerous these beliefs are to the rest of us. Fromthe occult side, the enthusiasm shown by Michael Aquino and the Temple of Setfor the SS castle at Wewelsburg is another indication that there is somethingmore going on with the Nazi Party and its followers—even today—than whatAmericans read about in their newspapers in the 1930s and 1940s.It is perhaps not going overboard to say that the Third Reich caused a massiveshift of consciousness in the planet, a “paradigm shift” one might call it.Although occultism and politics had long been bedfellows, since the days ofJoseph interpreting dreams for Pharaoh, or King Saul consulting the Witch ofEndor, or even earlier in the astral temples at Nineveh and Babylon, the worldcame very close to enduring a massive and industrialized “cult-ocracy” in theform of the Third Reich and the proposed division of Europe into states run bythe fanatically esoteric SS of Heinrich Himmler. That millions of innocentpeople died because of this twisted dream is one of the tragedies of thetwentieth century that has been visited upon the twenty-first, in the form ofthe Middle Eastern conflicts, the wars in the Baltic states, and so much else.Forces are at war in the world, causing immeasurable horror and suffering, andwe do not know what they are. We do not understand how we could have become sothoroughly manipulated by these forces that we can no longer call a halt to theslaughter but have to watch, impotently, from the sidelines as the blood and thesmoke of a thousand separate Holocausts drifts closer and closer to our ownshores.In Morning of the Magicians, the authors identified these forces in paranormalterms, but always linking them back to the fascist fantasies of Hitler, Himmler,Rosenberg, Darre, and Hess: blatantly occult fantasies that became governmentpolicy and which led to the Holocaust and World War II. But the authors insistedthat there was something there, below the surface, of the Third Reich: asinister force that had been successfully, for a time, evoked by the Nazimagicians of the SS. The phenomenon of “coincidence,” or what Jung called“synchronicity” and Pauwels and Bergier call “synchronism,” was the most obviousevidence of the operation of this force and one which the authors suggestedcould be the basis for a whole “new conception of history.”Indeed, this author himself has pointed out from time to time how oftencoincidence appears in the telling of everything from assassination conspiraciesto UFO research; and he has suggested that either we agree with Jim Garrisonthat such coincidences are evidence of an intelligence operation (and, byextension, that some of our conspiracy theories may, after all, be correct), orthat the coincidences represent something else: an “acausal connectingprinciple” perhaps (to use the phrase invented by Jung) that neverthelessdemonstrates important linkages or “correspondences” between events in theworld. To understand how this might be possible, we will have to examine thefield of quantum physics for a short time, as we come across some amazingcorrespondence between Carl Jung and Wolfang Pauli, the former the father of the“archetype” and depth analysis, and the latter a Nobel Prize-winning physicist.While the primary sources for much of this information are quite dense, thebasic outlines of the science will be presented in as intelligible a fashion aspossible. As always, source material is noted in the text for those who wish tounderstand what is happening in the world of the physics of consciousness today,and why it is vitally important that we, as citizens of a shrinking world,remain current with these new discoveries.DARKNESS AT NOONGoebbels: You wanted to see me, Dr. Jung.Jung: No, you wanted to see me.Goebbels: No, you wanted to see me.Jung turned around and left Goebbels’ office—and vomited …—Account of a visit by Carl Jung to Berlin during May 1933 upon being invited toa meeting by Nazi Propaganda Minister Josef Goebbels7By all accounts, Wolfgang Pauli should have been the most satisfied manin Europe. In 1932, he was already world-famous as a physicist, a scientist ofbrilliance and possessed of an uncanny, creative insight. He was doing the workhe loved, and recognized by his peers for his accomplishments. He was on the wayto winning the Nobel Prize in physics in 1945.Yet, his emotional life was in utter turmoil.His mother, discovering that his father had been having an affair, committedsuicide by poisoning herself. Pauli then became involved in a disastrousmarriage with a cabaret singer which lasted less than a year. He turned todrink, got involved in bar brawls, fought constantly with his colleagues, andsank into a morbid state of what they used to call “melancholia.” Wolfgang Pauliwas on the verge of a nervous breakdown.He also complained of very strange, very disturbing dreams, and it was possiblythis problem among all others that led him to consult one of the world’s mostfamous psychoanalysts, the St. Paul to Freud’s Jesus, Swiss psychiatrist CarlGustav Jung. At first, Jung gave him over to the care of a newly-trainedassistant, a woman, as Jung felt Pauli’s problems stemmed from relationshipswith women (his mother’s suicide, his failed marriage), but as thesessions brought forth a mine of greater and greater symbolic material, Jungtook over from Erna Rossenbaum and began to analyze Pauli personally.In a state of profound personal misery, Pauli began his sessions with Jung everyMonday at noon.What resulted from this relationship, which lasted some twenty-six years(1932-1958), is a fascinating collection of letters the two men exchangeddiscussing Pauli’s dreams and his scientific approach to Jung’s deep and heavilysymbolic psychoanalytic system. Although the actual psychoanalysis only lastedtwo years, Pauli continued to send reports of his dreams to Jung, and theydiscussed both the dream imagery as well as Pauli’s concepts of physics and“symmetry,” concepts that eventually won Pauli the Nobel Prize for his discoveryof the “exclusion principle,” which also bears his name as the “Pauliprinciple.” The relationship between Jung and Pauli was probably the first realinterface between modern physics and psychoanalysis, and paved the way for thedevelopment of what is now known as the field of quantum consciousness, acontroversial and extreme form of physics in which it sometimes seems as if theslide rule has been applied to the soul.The search for the basic “building blocks” of life, of reality, of the mind, hasbeen going on for thousands of years. In the West, during the golden era of theGreek philosophers, all of reality was believed to be reducible to fourelements: earth, air, fire and water. In the East, a similar impulse led to theidentification of five elements: wind, water, fire, metal, earth. The intentionwas the same: to find common denominators for the bewildering profligacy ofcreation, a creation that included the palm tree and the platypus, the horse andthe canyon, gold and lead, coal and diamonds. It was believed by both Westernand Eastern philosophers that the elements—whether four or five—worked with eachother in combination to produce all that the senses perceived. Thisunderstanding led to everything from the Periodic Table of the Elements to thenature of the DNA molecule, as science looked deeper and deeper behind what wasvisible to the naked eye to what was invisible: atoms, chromosomes, quarks. Thiseffort was matched by the work of the scientists of the mind, the psychologistswho sought to discover what hidden, invisible forces were at work behind thecrazy-quilt veneer of consciousness.Carl G. Jung (1875-1961) was of Protestant German Swiss parentage, and was for atime an important disciple of Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). It was Jung whounderstood the relationship that exists between mythology and unconsciouspsychological states, and the relevance of myths, fairy tales, and religious andmystical imagery to psychoanalysis and the interpretation of dreams, as well asthe interpretation of cultural events and icons through an analysis of theirsymbolism. He also popularized the theory of the “archetype”: images buried deepwithin our “collective unconscious” (another Jungian concept) that are carriersof a constellation of associations, and which are universal in nature, such asthe Great Mother or the Wise Old Man or the Serpent. His analysis of alchemicalliterature is, itself, literature, much in the same way that Freud’s writingsare more than scientific articles and closer to philosophical essays, which, tosome of his followers, are virtual scripture.To Jung and his followers, there is a deep substratum of consciousness that liesbeneath the layers of mechanical instincts and the measurable phenomena ofclinical psychology, even below Freud’s layer where the “pleasure principle”resides. This layer—called by Jung the “collective unconscious”—is a well ofimages and associations, myths and icons that all humans share. These imagesbecome visible under certain circumstances, such as in political rallies orreligious rituals or on the movie screen or in advertising and propaganda, andwe take them for granted without realizing the power they represent or theextent to which they may be manipulating our consciousness. One of Jung’s mostaccessible and popular works—Man and His Symbols—usually appears as a large,coffee-table book replete with these images and explanations of what theyrepresent, and why we react to them the way that we do.Traffic with the collective unconscious is not all one-way, however. Like aliving being, it can be influenced by consciousness and modified. Thousands ofyears of human civilization have modified the symbol stream and the structure ofthe collective unconscious, and there are regional differences in how thesesymbols manifest from culture to culture, although the basic elements of thecollective unconscious—the archetypes—are the same for everyone. This is whatJung’s patient and occasional collaborator, Wolfgang Pauli, found sofascinating, and what led the two of them to equate this process with those ofquantum mechanics.Jung’s fascination with mystical and occult texts and themes—although not withoccult practices per se—led him to write admiringly of the phenomenon ofNational Socialism in Germany, interpreting the Nazi pagan mythos in his Wotan.It was this, as well as his anti-Semitism, which has led many in recent years toquestion Jung’s personality and motives, although it is clear from his laterwritings that he did not idolize the Nazis or defend their hideous excesses.That Jung was an anti-Semite is something that not even his own followers try todeny, as evidenced by the “Lingering Shadows” conference held at the C. G. JungFoundation in New York City in 1989.8 At the same time, Jung’s anti-Semitism isvirtually indistinguishable from that of, say, Aleister Crowley. Both men heldcontemporary views of Jews that were common for their time and place, and yetboth men also studied Judaism and Jewish mysticism. While we expect more fromboth—since Jung was widely regarded as a deep and serious thinker, a man whosegenius made an enormous contribution to psychology and philosophy, and in thecase of Crowley we have a man who declared himself to be a god (!)—we are leftwith the realization that these idols have clay feet, as do all idols in everyera. One tends to think that Jung’s early fascination with Nazism had more incommon with many a scientific observer at an atomic bomb test: in one’s heart,one realizes that this is a horrible development, but at the same time one isawed by the sound and the light, amazed that the human race is capable of suchelaborate and dramatic destruction.(Of course, the focus on Jung as an anti-Semite is something of a smoke-screenas well. One cannot compare Jung’s admitted anti-Semitism with that of HenryFord’s rabid anti-Semitic tract, The International Jew, for instance, or theactions of a generation of American politicians and businessmen such as HerbertWalker, Prescott Bush or the Dulles brothers, who actively supported Nazismbefore and after the war.)As the years went by, Jung became something of an ethnologist, and traveled toAfrica in search of primitive cultures. He wrote extensively on alchemy bothEuropean and Asian, and studied the UFO phenomenon. He analyzed Christianity inlight of his discoveries in psychology and mythology, and gave us terms we usetoday without realizing Jung’s contribution: anima, collective unconscious,archetype, individuation. The goal of Jung’s approach to psychoanalysis was theintegration of the various elements of the personality to form a seamless whole,the process he called “individuation.” The emblem of the successful conclusionof this process was the mandala, the famous Eastern symbol of the sum ofcreation, a symbol in which opposites are balanced with each other: north withsouth, east with west; fire with water, air with earth; male with female. Jungdid not simply borrow the idea of the mandala from Hindu or Buddhisticonography; he believed the mandala was used by the Eastern mystics to mean thesame thing, to represent the same process, as that described in his own work. ToJung, the world was full of symbols: from advertising logos and slogans topolitical speeches to arcane occult texts. In this, he was walking in thefootsteps of Giordano Bruno, and, close behind them both was Ioan Coulianu.Jung’s collected works are available through the Bollingen imprint of PrincetonUniversity, and they are a tremendous resource not only as a guide to Jungianthought but also as a veritable Baedecker through religious and mystical thoughtand textual and iconographic references from around the world. The works ofWolfgang Pauli—those that are accessible to a non-scientific audience—areequally valuable, such as “The Influence of Archetypal Ideas on the ScientificTheories of Kepler” which was included in The Interpretation of Nature and thePsyche by Jung and Pauli. In this essay, Pauli analyzed Kepler’s theories ofastrology in the light of both physics and Jungian psychology.But it is perhaps in the area of “synchronicity” that we will find the views ofJung and Pauli most valuable here, for it gives us a context for understandingthe action (and, perhaps, the nature) of the sinister forces of which we speak.… it is impossible, with our present resources, to explain ESP, or the fact ofmeaningful coincidence, as a phenomenon of energy. This makes an end of thecausal explanation as well, for “effect” cannot be understood as anything excepta phenomenon of energy. Therefore it cannot be a question of cause and effect,but of a falling together in time, a kind of simultaneity. Because of thisquality of simultaneity, I have picked on the term “synchronicity” to designatea hypothetical factor equal in rank to causality as a principle of explanation.9Jung’s idea of an “acausal connecting principle” actually goes to the heart ofphysics; it is an attack on the most sacred of scientific sacred cows: cause andeffect, something which Isaac Newton had enshrined in his work. In thetraditional view, every effect has a cause, much like those swinging ball setsone sees on executive desks, where one ball knocks into another, which knocksinto another, etc., in a straight line down from the first “knock.” To this typeof scientist, every effect can be traced back to an “ultimate cause,” all theway back to the Big Bang that started the universe on its ancient path. Butisn’t that the problem?An endlessly receding, linear chain of cause-and-effect eventually leads us backto a First Cause, and that implies a beginning without cause. Some have calledit God. There is no room in traditional science for God, because the existenceof a God would (presumably) render scientific theory relative to God, an unknownand undefined principle. Science has generally avoided facing this issue in anysort of intelligible way. The universe may simply be eternal, outside normaldefinitions of time since it contains all time (and all space); but then whatdoes that do to cause-and-effect, which is conceived of as linear as opposed to… what, circular?Arthur Young (one of the original “Nine”) proposed the existence of the “quantumof action,” what he identified as “first cause,” and called it the “missingparameter of science.” In his view, it would go a long way to accommodating theparadoxes one encounters in quantum physics, such as Heisenberg’s “UncertaintyPrinciple.” According to Heisenberg (a friend and classmate of Wolfgang Pauli atthe University of Munich), one cannot precisely predict the position of anelectron at any given time; its position will always remain “uncertain.” This isbecause an electron has an inherent motion that is not the result of it beingacted upon by other forces, and thus its motion seems to lie outside the realmof cause-and-effect. A molecule, on the other hand, is a static sort of thing:composed of atoms in a particular alignment and creating, for instance, water(two atoms of hydrogen, one of oxygen); it is a blunt fact and Newtonian lawswork on water and on the rest of the molecules at that level of reality.Electrons, though, operate in a world where Newtonian physics no longer applies.To go one step further, a photon—a particle of light—operates in a still morerarefied world. One of the mysteries of light, and that which prompted thediscovery of the quantum by Max Planck around the year 1900, is that it does notlose energy in its travels through space. A light particle having left a distantstar arrives on earth with the same energy it had when it left. This did notseem to be playing by the Newtonian rules. Heisenberg realized that in order tostudy a photon one of necessity has to “disturb” it; i.e., a relationshipdevelops between the particle studied and the one doing the studying whichchanges the state of the particle (and, of course, of the observer). Thus, thereis no such thing as a truly uninvolved, outside observer. The observer is aparticipant. The observer changes the object being observed by the very fact ofobservation, and this is not merely a semantic game: it is the reality ofquantum physics and the laboratory observation of sub-atomic particles.At the sub-atomic level, where light can be either a particle or a wave but notboth (whimsically referred to as a “wavicle”), one can only study it as one orthe other, thus making a judgment before one even begins. In a sense, then, theobserver and the object observed are connected in some mysterious, acausal way;and if the observer and observed are connected, then the universe is a place ofinterconnectedness that transcends mechanistic Newtonian causality. And if thisis true—and quantum physicists insist that it is—then the UFO phenomenon (as anexample) is a function of that universe, and it is quite possible that if thereare actual “aliens” piloting the craft, they may have been aware of thisprinciple for a long time, which would account for their actions in ways that weare not prepared to accept. They would be aware, for instance, that theirobservation of us changes them in some profound way, and that our experience ofthem changes us; which could account for their strange appearance, such as thevarious beings experienced by Whitley Strieber in his published accounts:possibly an attempt to modulate our experience of them in ways that will notcause some kind of existential blowback.In Newton’s world of linear cause-and-effect, the possibility of free will isdiscounted. In the world of Arthur Young and the “quantum of action,” free willis reinstated as a function of “action” and thus is given essentially its ownexistence as a separate quantum. How does this quantum unite and modulate theother quanta?Meaning is the bridge between consciousness and matter.—Physicist David Bohm, Omni magazine, January 1987What Jung proposed was that another principle, a connecting principle, exists inthe universe outside of cause and effect, linking “unrelated” elements at thelevel of eaning, creating what are called “meaningful coincidences.” Since weare accustomed to interpreting events as cause-and-effect related, theappearance of coincidence has been variously understood as either “magic” or assomething totally without meaning, a kind of accident that has no place inscientific discourse (as if any event could be considered to be “outsidescience”). Once again, we have drawn a line between an event observed and theobserver, ignoring the importance of the coincidence as a carrier ofinformation. Yet, as physics has progressed to the point where the old standbyof an “outside observer” to an experiment is no longer to be taken for granted,but that “observer” has now become a “participant,” it has become harder andharder to define a pure science that is not the result of human intervention andparticipation … with all that implies. (What is perhaps comforting to some tocontemplate is that if creation itself is a kind of experiment, then, accordingto Heisenberg, God is not only an observer but is also a participant.)Jung noted that the basis of modern science is statistical in nature: that is,scientific laws are really statements about probability. That is why it is thusfar impossible, for instance, to predict the weather with any degree ofaccuracy, or the outcome of a sporting event in advance, or to give anabsolutely certain medical prognosis; that is why it is impossible to predictwhere a given sub-atomic particle will be at any given time. We can makestatements about probable results, but still cannot be one hundred percentcertain about predicting specific events. When events occur which defy the lawsof probability, science generally lumps them into a separate category, the oneor two (or ten or twenty) percent not accounted for in their statisticalcalculations. Likewise, religion generally lumps them into a separate category,and calls them “miracles”: spontaneous remission of a cancer, for instance, orthe patient pronounced dead who comes back to life on the operating table. Or ashower of frogs. For the mystically-inclined, the occurrence of these“non-statistically predictable results” indicates the presence of God. For thescientifically-inclined, they may be thought of as accidents, or the result ofinadequate data or a defective instrument, or as mere coincidences.Sometimes, however, there are just too many coincidences, and their sheer numberor frequency suggests the operation of another factor in the universe.Jung posited that there are relationships among events that are not part of thecause-and-effect nexus, and that these relationships come to our attention whena large number of coincidences take place. While he had been aware of thisphenomenon for quite some time and witnessed it in his own life and in the livesof his patients, development of a formal theory awaited his relationship withthe Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli. It was Pauli who actually “proved”Heisenberg correct, and made a substantial contribution to quantum mechanics byhis own “exclusion principle” or what is known as the “Pauli principle.” Themath behind this principle is daunting, as is any attempt to describe it withoutrecourse to advanced physics, but suffice it to say that it involves principlesof symmetry and asymmetry and explains the wonderful diversity of nature as akind of cosmic “dance.”Theoretical physicist Dr. F. David Peat, who worked with renegade physicistDavid Bohm and who once interviewed Werner Heisenberg, Pauli’s friend andclassmate, has expressed the Pauli Principle this way:Electrons, protons, neutrons, and neutrinos, along with other particles, formone group (and engage in an antisymmetric dance) while the other group includesmesons and photons of light (and forms a symmetric dance). It turns out that, inthe former case, the nature of this abstract movement or dance has the effect ofkeeping particles with the same energy always apart from each other. However,this exclusion of particles from each other’s energy space is not the result ofany force which operates between them nor indeed is an act of causality in thenormal sense, rather it arises out of the antisymmetry of abstract movement ofthe particles as a whole. Hence the underlying pattern of the whole dance has aprofound effect on the behavior of each individual particle. (emphasis inoriginal)10Thus we are talking about a pattern or matrix underlying the observed universe,a kind of grid of connections linking events according to a system we can onlybarely perceive, a pattern that is in motion if we take Pauli’s symmetric andasymmetric dances literally. It is this pattern that differentiates one elementfrom another, and which contributes to everything from, as Peat explains, “theintense coherent light of the laser as well as superfluids and superconduction”on the one hand to “the collapse of a star through the white dwarf, neutronstar, and black hole stages” on the other.11 In other words, all of physicalcreation. Peat sees this as a basis for a coherent theory of synchronicity, asthe relation between the particles in Pauli’s exclusion principle “is not theresult of any force which operates between them nor indeed is an act ofcausality.” Thus, we have links between particles that defy normalcause-and-effect calculations. And these are the particles that make up theuniverse as we know it, and everything in it.Physicists normally do not appreciate it when non-physicists make statementsabout their science irresponsibly and make theoretical leaps not supported bymathematical proofs (and why should they?), so it is incumbent upon me to add afurther caveat of clarification:Modern theories of quantum physics do not invalidate traditional Newtonianphysics when it comes to the tangible world we live in. What goes up must stillcome down; and for every action there is still an equal and opposite reaction.None of that has changed. The laws of physics that we learned in school areuseful ways of interpreting the world we live in and its phenomena. The laws donot exist outside our perceptions, however. They are laws that man has made, notlaws that exist in nature; they are ways of understanding and measuring natureand its processes. As such, however, they do not provide a definitive cosmology;they do not explain everything that we experience.If we look at “reality” (what a concept!) as having layers, much like Jung’sconcept of consciousness, then the Newtonian world is the “top” layer, the layerwe deal with every day. It is the layer of molecular structures, of mass andenergy and dimension. It is our conscious level, if you will.If we go a level down, we enter the atomic world which has a slightly different“reality” and set of laws that govern its processes.Still further down, we have the world of nuclear particles, like the “uncertain”electrons. And, further down still, we have the world that light lives in: amysterious realm of photons that defies Newtonian concepts of time and space.Arthur Young described this as an “arc,” illustrating the descent of lightthrough the nuclear particles to atoms to molecules, and then up from molecularstructures to plants, animals, and eventually man, in a glyph that is strangelyreminiscent of ancient Gnostic and Manichean theories of the descent of spiritinto matter, 12and for a reason: these lower levels of reality are thosefrequented by the magician and the mystic, the psy-war expert and theadvertising man. These are the levels upon which it is possible to exert someinfluence (all those spinning electrons, all those packets of light, thatdizzying dance of symmetry and asymmetry in the dark and dirty basement beneaththe nice clean house of consensus reality, the subtle connectivities like theinvisible wiring in the walls, pipes of hot and cold running fractals, all FastFourier and fragile beauty) and thereby—according to the Lesser Key of Solomon,a medieval sorcerer’s workbook that looks like notes on an advanced form ofcalculus by a demented or visionary Pauli or Heisenberg—“anticipate an effect,the which to the vulgar shall seem to be a miracle.”13While the system of levels posited by both Jung and Young (!) are intellectuallysatisfying to some degree—it seems to be “orderly” and capable of representingprocesses that are quantum mechanical as well as Newtonian depending on thelevel or layer of reality under discussion—there are other phenomena in theworld of quantum physics that are counter-intuitive. For instance, time.As Oxford mathematics Professor Sir Roger Penrose puts it,All the successful equations of physics are symmetrical in time. They can beused equally well in one direction in time as in the other. The future and thepast seem physically to be on a completely equal footing. Newton’s laws,Hamilton’s equations, Maxwell’s equations, Einstein’s general relativity,Dirac’s equation, the Schroedinger equation—all remain effectively unaltered ifwe reverse the direction of time.14This means that, to use Penrose’s example later on in the same book that a glassfull of water falling off a table and breaking on the floor could—according tothe above-mentioned laws of physics—just as easily assemble itself from thebroken pieces of glass and spilled water and jump up onto the table: the entireepisode but in “reverse” order.15 Since that is not the way we perceive theuniverse to operate, there must be another factor—a factor in consciousness—thatexperiences the passage of time in a single direction: past-present-future. Thefuture, then, is dependent on actions and processes that have taken place“before” it in time, which seems to indicate a degree of choice—of decisionsmade, directions taken—otherwise the future would be absolutely predictable inevery aspect.Penrose has attacked the contemporary discipline of Artificial Intelligence asbeing basically unscientific in its approach to consciousness and physics. Hedoes not believe that the brain is nothing more than a glorified computer, orthat eventually computers will develop to the point that they attainconsciousness, as consciousness is obviously much more than mere computation.Penrose is part of a new movement in science and consciousness which hasattracted a number of maverick thinkers with a variety of heavy credentials. F.David Peat—mentioned above—studied with Penrose at Oxford, as well as with DavidBohm, and his integration of Jungian psychology with quantum physics isrepresentative of the direction in which the movement as a whole is going.Penrose has worked with microbiologists to come up with a novel and, if correct,profound theory of quantum consciousness, which is based on the examination ofmicrotubules in the brain. As noted earlier, science has been occupied withdiscovering the smallest, most irreducible elements of matter and energy inorder to understand how the universe is put together; as atoms were broken downinto sub-atomic particles and quarks, fermions, bosons, mesons and a host ofother strange and tricky entities made their appearance (either virtually,through mathematical calculation and prediction, or in the particleaccelerator), so too did the biologists break down the human body into itsconstituent “particles”: the genetic code, and its holy grail, the human genome.Still, none of these discoveries answered the basic questions of the humancondition, such as the mystery of consciousness: of a mind that could conceiveof realities that were not “real,” of time that could flow backwards, of beingin two places at the same “time,” of life after death and reincarnation and theevil eye. Or, more prosaically, of communicating over vast distances andtraveling in the air and watching images move before your eyes and hearingvoices come out of a machine. All of these ideas were once thought to be thepowers of sorcerers and magicians and fakirs, and are represented in thegrimoires and other spellbooks of the occultist; they are now within the reachof everyone on the planet, no matter how spiritually undeveloped, howilliterate, how rational or irrational. They were the inventions of consciousminds working in ways that could not be explained by instinct or some othermechanical description of the brain and its nervous system. They were theinventions of men and women who dreamed the impossible, and who were haunted bythe chants of the shamans lodged deep within their “collective unconscious,” theprayers of human beings who longed to fly.Is there a physical basis for consciousness? Or are body and mind functions ofeach other?What Penrose and his colleagues have discovered is that—on what could be calledthe “sub-atomic” level of the human brain and nervous system—there exists aninterface between mind and matter that has important implications for our study.THE ROOTS OF COINCIDENCEThe … dilemma confronts us as we turn to a type of phenomenon which has puzzledman since the dawn of mythology: the disruption of the humdrum chains of causalevents by coincidences of an improbable nature, which are not causally relatedyet appear highly significant. Any theory which attempts to take such phenomenaseriously must necessarily involve an even more radical break with ourtraditional categories of thought than the pronunciamentos of Heisenberg, Diracor Feynman.—Arthur Koestler, The Roots of Coincidence16Zombies are a useful philosophical concept.—Stuart Hameroff in “A Sonoran Afternoon”In 1996, Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff—in a paper entitled OrchestratedReduction of Quantum Coherence in Brain Microtubules: A Model forConsciousness”17 resented a theory of consciousness that stemmed from Penrose’sconcept of “objective reduction” or “OR,” first promulgated in 1994’s Shadows ofthe Mind. Objective reduction is, as the paper defines, “a newly proposedphysical phenomenon of quantum wave function” which is “essential forconsciousness, and occurs in cytoskeletal microtubules and other structureswithin each of the brain’s neurons.” 18In other words, a professor of themathematics of physics (Penrose) and a professor of anaesthesiology andpsychology (Hameroff ) teamed up to unlock the mysteries of quantum andconsciousness and apparently found them hiding discretely within the very neuralpathways of the human brain.The exposition is very tough going for the non-initiate, especially as two verydistinct disciplines are involved: quantum mechanics and neurobiology. Anattempt will be made to “objectively reduce” the main thrust of the argument.Penrose and Hameroff begin by describing some basic elements of quantum physics.At the base of quantum theory is the wave/particle duality of atoms and theircomponents. As long as a quantum system such as an atom or sub-atomic particleremains isolated from its environment, it behaves as a “wave of possibilities”and exists in coherent “superposition” (with complex number coefficients) ofmany possible states.19How, then, does the phenomenon move from this ambiguous “wave of possibilities”to become an actual particle or wave? What causes its “collapse”? Severaltheories are advanced, but Penrose prefers a “self-collapsing” model “growingand persisting to reach a critical mass/time/energy threshold related to quantumgravity.”20 This self-collapsing model is referred to as OR or “objectivereduction,” as opposed to the SR or “subjective reduction” model wherein thecollapse is attributed to measurement or conscious observation.The authors go on to describe another fact of quantum physics, one that seemsextremely bizarre to those brought up on a healthy diet of Newtonian physics:Another feature of quantum systems is quantum inseparability, or non-locality,which implies that all quantum objects that have once interacted are in somesense still connected! When two quantum systems have interacted, their wavefunctions become “phase entangled” so that when one system’s wave function iscollapsed, the other system’s wave function, no matter how far away, instantlycollapses as well. The non-local connection (“quantum entanglement”) isinstantaneous, independent of distance and implies that the quantum entities, bysharing a wave function, are indivisible.21Non-locality is one of the more attractive characteristics of quantum physicsfor the romantically-inclined, as it implies that a kind of communication ispossible across vast distances, and that once two “wave functions” meet, theyare always in instant communication and are, in fact, “indivisible.” While thisin itself is not a validation for extrasensory perception or telepathiccommunication, etc., it does present scientists with an uncomfortable premise.If such a phenomenon is possible—even at the sub-atomic level—then somehow itmight be possible at a more macro level, the level of waking consciousness.Penrose and Hameroff then go on to describe the research of various otherscientists who have identified “apparently random quantum effects acting onneurotransmitter release at the pre-synaptic grid within each neural axon,” andthat one researcher, H.P. Stapp, “has suggested that (SR) wave function collapsein neurons is closely related to consciousness in the brain.” The quest ofPenrose and Hameroff for a physical structure wherein these effects take placebrought them to the microtubule.Microtubules are components of the neuron or, more specifically, of thecytoskeleton structure within the neuron which “establishes neuronal form,maintains synaptic connections, and performs other essential tasks.” Themicrotubules themselves are “hollow cylindrical polymers of individual proteinsknown as tubulin” which are “interconnected by linking proteins(microtubule-associated proteins: MAPs) to other microtubules” which then formthe “lattice networks” of the cytoskeletons. In the view of the authors, theMAPs are responsible for—“orchestrate”—the collapse of wave functions in theneurons; thus, “Orch OR.” The wave function collapse is non-reversible in time,and it is the successive collapse of wave functions at the microtubule levelthat gives rise, in effect, to the passage of time (its seeming unidirectionalnature: past-present-future) and thus to consciousness itself. (This would solvethe conundrum posed by Penrose earlier (1994) and mentioned above: that the lawsof physics are the same whether time “flows” forward or backward, and that thesensation of time going in one direction only is therefore a function ofconsciousness, since there are no physical laws to account for it.)The reader will forgive me if I skip the proofs and formulae that are offered insupport of this theory, and those interested are encouraged to seek out thisinformation for themselves on the Internet or in an up-to-date science library.There are, however, some slightly more accessible accounts of this fascinatingand ultimately quite revealing theory, and Penrose’s partner Stuart Hameroff isresponsible for a few of them.In Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Hameroff ’s article “‘Funda-Mentality’ Is theConscious Mind Subtly Linked to a Basic Level of the Universe?” sets out theparameters of the discussion in a style that is a bit easier to understand forthose who do not have the math.22Hameroff begins by discussing various attempts to come to a physics ofconsciousness, all of which are lacking in either scientific rigor or fall aparton close inspection. The main target of the Penrose-Hameroff approach is the“mind as computer” theory. The “physicalists”—those who believe that a purelyphysical solution will one day appear to explain consciousness as a kind ofsuper-computability, a more sophisticated version of the desktop PC—seeconsciousness as the inevitable result of more complex neural circuitry,circuitry which could one day be duplicated in the laboratory and the testbench. Penrose and Hameroff, however, believe that consciousness is not purelyphysical in the traditional sense. It is certainly not a function of“computability”:Regarding transition from pre-conscious or implicit processing to consciousnessitself, the physicalist view is that consciousness emerges at a critical levelof complexity. But no threshold is apparent, nor is there a reasonablesuggestion why such an emergent property should have conscious experience. Asphysicalism is based on deterministic computation, it is also unable to accountfor free will or Penrose’s proposed non-computability. But the major problemremains experience, for which physicalism offers no testable predictions.Something is missing.23Hameroff then asks the question that is central to an understanding of how thesub-atomic phenomena—equally wave or particle, obeying the exclusion principleand the uncertainty principle, exhibiting features of non-locality—so bizarre interms of Newtonian physics and the “real world,” ever manage to organizethemselves into the tangible, touchable, breakable, objects around us:The problem is the transition: why and how do microscopic quantum superposedstates become classical and definite in the macro-world? This problem is calledquantum state reduction, or collapse of the wave function, and it may be the keyto both consciousness and reality.24This, of course, is where “Orch OR” comes into the discussion and the magicalmicrotubules make their appearance. The idea, basically, is this:At the most microscopic level of “reality,” the sub-atomic particles behavestrangely, as if they are not really part of classical reality. Yet, they makeup everything that we see, everything that our senses perceive. This means that,at some point, these sub-atomic particles (and waves) become organized in afashion that permits physical reality as we know it. There is a thresholdsomewhere, a level of complexity is reached and—due to some type of combinationof particles, waves, mass and energy that we do not yet understand—the wavefunction, the quantum state of the particles, collapses, becomes “reduced” toperceived and perceivable reality (OR or “objective reduction”). The ambiguousnature of an individual particle is “reduced” to one state only: either particleor wave. What Penrose and Hameroff are saying is that this process can takeplace not only within the external world of physics, but also within the brain,at the microscopic level of the microtubules which are components of thecystoskeleton of the neuron, and that this process is taking place constantly:OR in the brain would likely be linked to neural processes occurring over timescales in the range of tens to hundreds of milliseconds, for example 25millisecond intervals in coherent 40 Hz.25Naturally, then, the brain contains not only neurons and synapses and the entirewet machinery of cognition, but is also acting on—and being acted upon by—thequanta. Consciousness itself, according to this theory, is the result of thistype of objective reduction, indeed a self-orchestrating objective reduction.The brain is plugged into the quantum world in a very dynamic way, andconsciousness is the result.The authors do not discount the possibility of consciousness in beings otherthan human. According to their model, as long as sufficient numbers ofmicrotubules are present in the brain or nervous system of the creature underconsideration, this phenomenon will obtain. The degree of sophistication ispossibly a result of the complexity of the brain and nervous system itself: thesheer number of collapsing wave forms at any given “time” (and theirrelationship to each other across a complex matrix of neurons) indicating acorresponding degree of consciousness.Hameroff, in another article in the same issue of the journal explains morefully:Regarding free will, the problem is that our actions seem neither totallydeterministic nor random (probabilistic). The only other apparent choice isPenrose’s non-computability. In the Orch OR model microtubule quantumsuperpositions compute and evolve linearly … during pre-conscious processing,but are influenced at the instant of OR collapse by hidden (Platonic)non-computable logic inherent in spacetime geometry. The precise outcome—ourfree will actions—result from effects of the hidden logic on the quantum systempoised at the edge of objective reduction.26Elsewhere in the same article, Hameroff describes this hidden logic as “someinfluence which is neither random nor completely deterministic, but due tohidden propensities embedded in fundamental spacetime.” It’s these “hiddenpropensities” and “hidden (Platonic) non-computable logic inherent in spacetimegeometry” that are the catch. While the Orch OR model may explain the mechanicsof consciousness—and it is still early days on that due to the amount of fundingit would require to test the theory—there is still the mystery of consciousnessitself. What Penrose and Hameroff have done is state the problem in terms thatare clear and compelling, if not always convincing to their peers. The idea thatconsciousness is not merely the result of a kind of super-computation capacityof the brain, but of actions that take place on a sub-microscopic level withinthat brain that are identical to processes familiar to quantum physicists issignificant, if only because it helps to answer another question, that ofsynchronicity and coincidence.In case the reader is thinking that perhaps all this theorizing is quiteabstract and is not useful in any pragmatic sense of the term, it should benoted that Penrose and Hameroff were invited to lead a group meeting at the RANDCorporation on October 22, 1998—one of a series of meetings that were sponsoredby the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a US government agencythat is the godchild of the Pentagon, and target of much speculation byconspiracy theorists. The series “focused on social and political governancequestions arising from the impacts of the information and biologicalrevolutions.” Thus, the findings of Penrose and Hameroff were being examined forthe possible application of their research in the “social and politicalgovernance” sphere by the military.Before we leap from Orch OR to synchronicity, it is perhaps useful to look atwhat Penrose and Hameroff had to say during that study group concerningdifferent mental states and their relationship to the collapse of quantum wavefunction. By the time of this meeting in October of 1998 the theory seems tohave advanced somewhat and become even more compelling.A chart that was included as part of the report on the RAND meeting is entitled“Quantum Superposition Entanglement in Microtubules for Five States Related toConsciousness.” The first state is the normal waking state. The second shows themental state during anaesthesia. The third is called “heightened experience.”The fourth is called “altered state,” and this one is the most interesting. Thelegend appended to this diagram states,D. Altered State: even greater rate of emergence of quantum superposition due tosensory input and other factors promoting quantum state (e.g. meditation,psychedelic drug). Predisposition to quantum state results in baseline shift andcollapse so that conscious experience merges with normally subconsciouscomputing mode.In other words, the altered mental state brought about by meditation,psychedelics, or—we may assume—other mystical and occult practices, is actuallypromoting the quantum state posited by Penrose and Hameroff. These practicescause profound changes not only in the neural firing of the brain but also atthe deepest level of matter and energy, at the level of waves and particles. Itis not only a chemical change we are witnessing but changes at the sub-atomiclevel, the level where “uncertainty” and “non-locality” and “symmetry” … dance.And if this is causing a change in consciousness, it is also fair to say thatconsciousness is capable of causing a change in the operations of not only theneurons on the level of neurophysiology, but also on the sub-atomic processesrepresented by the microtubules on the level of the quanta. It is a consciousdecision to perform meditation or the other “mind altering” (literally!)exercises—including taking psychedelic drugs—and this decision then causeschanges to occur in one’s own brain, altering its state and to some degree itsstructure. What kind of changes take place? What purpose do these changes serve?And more importantly, are we competent enough to take responsibility forcreating these changes?If we look at the legend for “Heightened Experience” on the same chart, we read:C. Heightened Experience: increased sensory experience input increases rate ofemergence of quantum superposition. Orch OR threshold is reached faster and OrchOR frequency increases.Only the next state in the chart, “Altered State,” demonstrates a faster rate ofquantum superposition with its proportional increase in Orch OR frequency. It isnot stated exactly what a “heightened experience” might be, other than theresult of “increased sensory input.” One wonders. Could this include sex?Watching a film or television show? Listening to music? Could this state beachieved on a wide scale through clever use of the media? Through publicperformance of religious ritual? Propaganda?This level of discussion is generally and noticeably absent from Penrose’spublic appearances before mathematicians and physicists, during which he usuallyfocuses on the general outlines of his OR theory and presents evidence fornon-computability as an important characteristic of consciousness; Hameroff—asan anesthesiologist and psychologist—is apt to concentrate on various aspects ofconsciousness, but the chart in the RAND discussion is much more to the point.It identifies those areas of the Orch OR model that would be of most interest tothose responsible for military and political matters and, in light of ourprevious discussions of Puharich, MK-ULTRA, psychological warfare, etc., it’srather like a “blast from the past”: can science be used in any way to modifythe consciousness of individual human beings, of groups (or nations) of humanbeings, and can the consciousness of individuals or groups be used to modify ormanipulate “reality”? When the most powerful weapon of a terrorist is thewillingness to commit suicide in order to bring down an airplane, a bus, or abuilding full of people, or an entire city itself, suddenly consciousnessbecomes a central issue of national defense. We are a long way from using thescience revealed by quantum mechanics to effect changes in consciousness, butthe scientific theories presented by the quantum consciousness crowd permit thepossibility of thinking about these strategies, and allows an environment inwhich the discussion goes up a level, from that of the crank and theschizophrenic with an aluminum foil hat to protect against “rays,” to the levelof scientific advisors to military theorists.Is quantum mechanics a way of introducing into scientific discourse suchconcepts as ESP, or psychokinetics, or remote viewing? Will the research byPenrose, Hameroff, et al. lead to the development of devices that could be usedto increase the abilities of the brain to encompass mental powers that used tobe the stuff of either science fiction … or the oral traditions of shamanism andthe encoded texts of alchemists and magicians?We are perhaps a level “too deep” when we use quantum mechanics as a means ofhaving this discussion, and the rules that apply in quantum physics do not applyin the world of classical, Newtonian physics in which we run our machines, driveour cars, watch television, and play baseball. But that’s just the point. Thepowers and abilities of the shamans—and, now, of the remote viewers and thepsychological warfare experts and the advertising men—are not demonstrable byNewtonian physics. They lie outside the realm of the classical scientificsystems and are much more comfortable in the quantum world. And the interfacebetween quantum physics and classical physics is our own nervous system; ourbrain is a site where quantum events are taking place, with all that implies,from “uncertainty” to “non-locality,” albeit at a very sub-atomic level. Thepossibility that human beings may be able to consciously use this interface todefy normal, Newtonian physics by being in two places at once, or by leapingforward or backward in time, is something that has been tested under laboratoryconditions in the United States under military and intelligence contracts. Itwas not only tested. It was used. And was successful.Although contemporary science may scoff at the concept of “remote viewing,” itbecame part of the American arsenal during the Cold War. In addition, theabilities of the remote viewers clearly demonstrate the mind’s ability toduplicate—on a macro level—what quantum states do on a micro level, particularlyin the area of “non locality.” If the rules of quantum mechanics only apply on adeep, sub-microscopic level and the laws of classical Newtonian physics apply onour day-to-day level of reality, then there is another level of human experienceentirely, in which it would appear that both worlds—quantum physical andclassically physical—operate as one, in which a human being (a complex Newtonianstructure if ever there was one) is able, through consciousness, to see into thefuture or the past, or to travel long distances and witness events taking placethousands of miles away, or even affect physical objects at that distance, usingnothing more than the brain. In other words, to behave like a photon.In 1982, the famous experiments of French physicist Alain Aspect demonstratedthe reality of non-locality and, even more so, opened the door to this idea ofconsciousness affecting quantum states. Prior to these experiments, otherwisevisionary scientists and mathematicians such as Albert Einstein, Boris Podolskyand Nathan Rosen considered non-locality as “spooky” or “ghostly”—appropriatelyenough—and Einstein in particular resisted this concept all his life. However,Aspect was able to arrange an experiment that vindicated (at least for some) theidea that two particles somehow “communicated” over vast distancesinstantaneously, thus violating Einstein’s law that nothing could travel fasterthan the speed of light.Basically, the experiment involved two photons whose “spins”—the direction andmomentum of the particle’s spin around its axis—were “entangled,” or “mixed.” Inother words, they shared the same physical characteristics or properties. Thesephotons were emitted at the same moment, and were thus “related.” (I amsimplifying this concept, of course, and the mathematicians and physicists inthe audience may forgive me for taking shortcuts through the math in order topresent the experiment in an intelligible manner.)Once these photons were emitted, one was sent through a set of filters, let’scall them filter A and filter B: the “external agents.” A switch was employed tomove the photon through either A or B, randomly. Through filter A, the photonwould spin in one direction; through filter B, a different direction. Whattranspired, however, was earth-shaking in its implications, for whenthe first was affected by its “external agent”—passing through either filter Aor filter B, and altering its spin respectively—its unfiltered twin respondedimmediately assumed the identical state, no matter how far away it was or inwhat direction it was traveling. There was no observable means of communicationbetween the two particles, and the information was, necessarily, transmittedfaster than the speed of light.Further experimentation showed that the particles would remain in constant,immediate contact no matter how far apart they were, even if they were billionsof miles distant. This implied that there is another fabric or web ofinterconnectedness underlying the physical universe that does not obey the lawsof either Newtonian or Einsteinian physics. It also suggested that the humanmind, by controlling the action of a particle in one place, could also controlthe action of a particle at a distance. It’s a little like the notion thatsticking a pin into a voodoo doll in Detroit could cause a pain inDar-es-Salaam, with the caveat that the voodoo doll in Detroit must be made withthe “particles” of the target in Dar-es-Salaam (the hair, fingernail clippings,etc.).THE SHADOW OUT OF TIMERecent experiments in remote viewing and other studies in parapsychology suggestthat there is an ‘interconnectedness’ of the human mind with other minds andwith matter…—Survey of Science and Technology Issues, Committee on Science and Technology,US House of Representatives, 97th Congress, June 1981My conception of time—my ability to distinguish between consecutiveness andsimultaneousness—seemed subtly disordered, so that I formed chimerical notionsabout living in one age and casting one’s mind all over eternity for knowledgeof past and future ages.— H.P. Lovecraft, “The Shadow Out Of Time”27One of the strangest—and, at the same time, most documented and revealing ofmilitary and government appreciation of the paranormal—was the series of “remoteviewing” experiments that were variously part of the Pentagon’s own programs aswell as sub-contracted by the military and the intelligence community to privatecontractors. As mentioned briefly in Book I, this program was known under avariety of rubrics, but the most dramatic and best known of these was STAR GATE,but it also included GRILL FLAME, CENTER LANE and SUN STREAK. Oddly enough, themost celebrated participants of the remote viewing endeavor were Scientologists.Once again, and as so many times previously in our story, we find the influenceof Aleister Crowley and Jack Parsons spreading through the political, militaryand cultic elements of American culture. Although this particular developmentwas not as overt as the Manson Family, the Process, the Son of Sam, etc., it wasas much a part of the establishment wing of the Crowley phenomenon as the formergroups were part of the counter-culture or “anti-establishment” wing. We cancredit Jack Parsons’ contribution to the American war effort during World War IIas well as to the American space program in general; when it comes to HalPuthoff, Pat Price and Ingo Swann, however, we can credit Parsons’ partner, L.Ron Hubbard, and his indirect contribution to the Cold War and anti-terrorismefforts, since Puthoff, Price and Swann were members of Scientology at the timethey formed the nucleus of the remote viewing project in 1972 at the StanfordResearch Institute in Menlo Park, California, an important scientific think-tankon the level of the RAND Corporation.This sounds like the stuff of fantasy fiction, but it has been documented quitethoroughly by science writer Jim Schnabel in Remote Viewers: The Secret Historyof America’s Psychic Spies,28 and has also been ably presented on a number ofWeb sites, one of which has published a remote viewing manual compiled by the USArmy. Schnabel’s account brings us back to some of our old friends from BookI—Andrija Puharich, Uri Geller, “Spectra,” and “Hoova”—and also introduces us tosome new ones, including officers and enlisted men of the US Army, former NSAemployees, the CIA, the National Security Council, and a coven of US senatorsbent on protecting the psi-war program from federal budget cuts. In addition,two of the participants of that program—Russell Targ and remote viewer KeithHarary, both of SRI—have written their own book, The Mind Race: Understandingand Using Psychic Powers, 29as has another participant, David Morehouse: PsychicWarrior: Inside the CIA’s Stargate Program.30 Thus, we have no lack ofdocumentation provided by actual members of the remote viewing program as wellas by Schnabel, who interviewed many of the program’s participants.The discussion of the modern technique of “remote viewing”—which was ascientific-sounding name invented by the SRI team to distance their practicesfrom those of spiritualist mediums and Gypsy fortune-tellers—begins, accordingto Schnabel, in February of 1960 with the publication (in a French periodical,Science et Vie) of an article claiming that the US Navy had been able tocommunicate with the nuclear submarine Nautilus while it was submerged under theArctic ice, using only telepathy. The article named names, but a volcano ofcontroversy erupted, and everyone mentioned by name in the article condemned itas nonsense. But the damage had been done. The Soviets were worried that the UShad found a way to harness psychic powers for military purposes, and the US wasconvinced that the Soviets were doing the same.In fact, there was a great deal of similarity between the piece in Science etVie and the Fred Crisman flying saucer affair in Ray Palmer’s Amazing Storiesmagazine. These may have been two examples of disinformation specialists atwork, stirring the pot for reasons known only to their case officers; for FredCrisman was an intelligence officer specializing in disinformation, and on theFrench side, the consulting editor of Science et Vie who had planted theNautilus story with a hapless staff writer was none other than Jacques Bergier,one of the co-authors of Morning of the Magicians, and a former intelligenceofficer himself with strong connections in the French intelligence community.The Nautilus story appeared in the French papers the same year that Pauwels andBergier’s Morning of the Magicians was publishedWe could take issue with Schnabel’s timeline, though, since we have alreadylearned that Andrija Puharich was performing telepathy experiments for the USmilitary as early as 1955. That there was an American military interest inpsychic abilities long before the Nautilus episode is documented, so it is notreally very far-fetched to assume that some kind of psychic experiment mighthave been underway with the nuclear submarine. After all, there was no other wayto contact the submarine once it had disappeared under the ice. A submarine in1960 had to rise to periscope depth to send or receive radio transmissions.Thus, psychic communication—which is not, as demonstrated by the SRI team,dependent upon the same physical restrictions as radio waves—would have been anideal medium, if it worked. Alas, in the case of the Nautilus we may never know;but in many other cases, however, the facts are quite clear andincontrovertible: the American military and intelligence organizations did usepsychics for a variety of tasks, many of which were highly classified.The year 1972 saw some amazing political developments, some of which were secretat the time and not revealed until much later, and some of which became obviousalmost overnight. Howard Hughes declared the Clifford Irving book to be a hoaxin January; the Zodiac killings were by then in full swing in California; J.Edgar Hoover died in May, and George Wallace almost died a few weeks later,victim of an assassination attempt by Arthur Bremer. In late May to mid-June theWatergate break-ins were taking place, to be discovered by a security guard onJune 17, 1972, and subsequently broken as a national news story by theinvestigative team of Woodward and Bernstein of the Washington Post in thefollowing months.Quietly, however, another development was taking place. This time, the venue wasa scientific laboratory in Menlo Park, California. On June 6, 1972, the artistand sometime astrologer Ingo Swann used his mental powers to disturb theoperation of a magnetometer buried in a concrete well at the Stanford ResearchInstitute.Four months later, the CIA would fund SRI to the tune of fifty thousand dollarsto continue that research, after intermediate testing had demonstrated theuncanny abilities of Swann and other psychics to penetrate top-secret militaryinstallations using only their minds.If this information had appeared between the covers of Amazing Stories therewould have been no need to consider it as anything more than either a hoax or afantasy. Schnabel is a respected science writer, however, and the informationrevealed in Schnabel’s book is reinforced by documentation readily availablefrom a variety of sources. Even the no-nonsense Journal of Defense & Diplomacy,in their September 1985 issue, contained an article entitled “The Science ofPsychic Warfare” by their science editor, Charles Wallace, which mentions theSRI research among other items of interest, such as the “Emotic Theory” ofpsychic phenomena that identifies the “five pairs of cranial sinus cavities asthe sensors—mastoid, ethmoid, sphenoid, maxillary and frontal—of which the lasttwo become the most important” as instruments of psychic abilities. This,between pages showing ads for submarines, small arms, and Harrier aircraft.Wallace goes on to mention a case that is discussed in more detail in Schnabel’swork, and that is the successful use of psychics to locate a downed Sovietbomber in Africa, a story that was carried by Jack Anderson in his syndicatednewspaper column.Before we approach the Soviet bomber story, however, let’s look at the SRIremote viewing program, since it stands out as the best-documented case thus farof the American government’s interest in, and support of, psychic abilities asmilitary weapons. Regardless of what scientists may have to say about the“reality” of psychic phenomena or the quantum consciousness debate, the evidenceis conclusive that individual human beings are able to infiltrate securelocations at a distance using only their minds. The welter of evidence inSchnabel’s book alone should be enough to cause scientists to re-evaluate theirstand on ESP, telepathy, and other rejected paranormal abilities regardless oftheir “non-computability,” if only because the world has become a much moredangerous place than ever before, and abilities of this nature are necessary toaugment a national defense policy that relies overmuch on machinery,electronics, the suspension of civil liberties, and duct tape against enemieswhose only resources are those of their own fanatic convictions.The scientific approach to extrasensory perception (ESP) began with thestatistical method of J.B. Rhine at Duke University in 1927, an approachcharacterized by thousands of tests of subjects using a special deck of cardsconsisting of twenty-five cards divided into five sets of five symbols: star,square, circle, cross, and wavy lines. People being tested are asked to guess atthe sequence of symbols in a freshly-shuffled deck, or to predict the sequencebefore the deck is shuffled, etc., in a variety of experiments designed toevaluate different forms of ESP. Chance will account for a certain percentage ofright answers. Any percentage above the chance calculation would suggest thepresence of a psychic power of some description. Collating the results in astatistical format, Rhine hoped to prove the existence of psychic abilities byemphasizing those results that were statistically higher than chance would havepredicted.Rhine’s experiments were never fully embraced by the scientific community, andin many cases the results were mediocre at best, and certainly not enough toencourage a full-scale investigation of the paranormal. However, the Rhineapproach of using statistical methods to evaluate something as tenuous aspsychic abilities did encourage others interested in researching the phenomena,by handing them a scientific precedent. Rhine’s sterile laboratory environmentfor testing ESP, or “psi” as the phenomenon was eventually known, was a far cryfrom the séance table and the shaman’s hut, and won some respectability for thepursuit.In the 1950s, of course, paranormal abilities were the target of several USgovernment projects, including those of Andrija Puharich for the military aswell as the CIA’s own efforts along the same lines. The Korean War had broughttales of brainwashing and mind control to the American public in the form ofarticles, books and movies (such as The Manchurian Candidate), and warned thepopulation that it was possible for an enemy to exert control over a person’sconsciousness.In the 1960s came the famous Nautilus incident—or non-incident—and the periodalso saw a heightened interest in UFOs and mystical and occult phenomena. Wherethe mysterious East was considered the source of brainwashing techniques in the1950s, it became the source for spiritual enlightenment in the 1960s.Brainwashing is about conversion—as William Sargant and others have pointedout—so it could come as no surprise that many Americans and other westernerswere joining Asian religions and cults, such as the Hare Krishnas, the JapaneseNichiren Shoshu sect, the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s Transcendental Meditation, andvarious Tantric and other Eastern spiritual methodologies. Tales of theparanormal powers of Hindu yogis and fakirs as well as of Chinese magicians andsorcerers were commonplace in the literature (such as the excellent books onAsian mysticism by John Blofeld, and the more metaphysical approach of AlanWatts) as well as in the rumor mills surrounding the various disciplines.California, of course, was the scene of much of this activity. As politicalcounter-culturalism (the Hippies, the Yippies, the Weathermen) eventually gaveway to spiritual counter-culturalism, California retained its position as thenerve center for American alternative religions.But California was also the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Stanford University,Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, and so much else associated with rocket scienceand nuclear weaponry. In the midst of this high-technology atmosphere one foundthe Stanford Research Institute or SRI, a think-tank that was connected withStanford University, but which in actuality derived much of its income fromgovernment and military grants and contracts.Professor Hal Puthoff was as much the product of his generation as anyone else.Although he had a stint with the National Security Agency (NSA), he wasprimarily a laser physicist and contributed heavily to the development of lasertechnology. His associate, Russell Targ, was another laser physicist, and thetwo formed an unforgettable partnership at SRI during this period. Lasertechnology owes a great deal to quantum mechanics, of which Puthoff was ofcourse quite aware. It was perhaps this background in the strange science oflasers and the quanta that led Puthoff to examine alternative religions andmystical groups and individuals, and to his becoming a Scientologist. Heeventually wrote a grant proposal, asking that he be allowed to conduct somepreliminary tests of psychic abilities.Somehow, the proposal came to the attention of Ingo Swann, who was himself aScientologist and being tested for psychic abilities in New York City, where helived. He contacted Puthoff, and it was agreed that he fly out to California inJune 1972 to undertake some informal testing. Puthoff was interested to seewhether or not Swann had the ability to move physical objects from a distance,using only his mind (an ability known as “psychokinesis,” or simply “PK”). Swannmanaged to cause the needle in a buried magnetometer to move. This was aheavily-shielded device, buried in concrete, which was eventually used to provethe existence of the sub-atomic entities known as “quarks.” Puthoff wrote areport of this experiment, and sent it on to various organizations in an effortto secure financing for the project. It was on the basis of that experiment thatthe CIA decided to start funding Puthoff ’s team at SRI, in an effort develop ameans of using psychic abilities to supplement the American defense andintelligence effort, sending in CIA official Ken Kress with $50,000 for SRI.31Testing began in earnest later that year (1972). It was a bit rocky at first,until Ingo Swann came up with a remarkable idea. He suggested that geographiccoordinates be used by the tester as a target location. Telling the psychic nomore than the coordinates, the psychic would have to mentally travel to thatprecise spot and report back on what he “saw” there. This method became known as“scanate” for “scanning coordinates,” and the project informally known asProject Scanate.This method was successful beyond expectations, and in worrisome ways. The CIAbegan to collaborate on the testing, giving the geographic coordinates ofvarious locations to SRI, and Swann—and eventually a newcomer to the project,Pat Price—would mentally “go” to those coordinates and write down what they saw.This testing was done mostly through the CIA’s Technical Services division, andinvolved CIA officers Ken Kress and the pseudonymous “Richard Kennett” and manyothers. In one case, in June of 1973, a CIA officer with a skeptical attitudetowards the project gave a set of coordinates to his mountain cabin in WestVirginia. Both Swann and Price came back with detailed information concerningwhat appeared to be a military base, replete with file drawers marked withoperational code names. The CIA official scoffed, telling his associates thatthere was nothing to this SRI program after all.A while later, one of the other CIA officials involved with the SRI programdecided to take a look himself. After all, how could both of the psychics bewrong in exactly the same way, with the same details? Driving around near themountain cabin, he stumbled upon a top-secret Pentagon installation.Putting the details of the experiment in his report, and making mention of thelocation of the Army’s facility, he inadvertently raised a hornet’s nest ofconcern in intelligence circles. The details of the facility, and in particularthe code names of secret projects, were known only to a few. How, Pentagonsecurity officials wanted to know, had agents penetrated the facility? Whenapprised of the supernatural means used by SRI to do just that, the stern-facedmen were not amused. They went to Menlo Park and interrogated all concerneduntil they were satisfied that there was no actual security leak and no enemypenetration of their facility.The psychic prowess of the SRI “scanate” team was proven, unequivocally.As more and more testing took place, Puthoff and Targ used different methods toshield their targets so thoroughly that even they did not know in advance whatthey would be. For instance, they used random number generators to come up withgeographic coordinates to ensure that they were not somehow inadvertently andunconsciously signaling the coordinates to the psychics. They would try an“outbound” scanning experiment, in which a subject would drive to a location andsit there at a specific time while the psychic would try to “see” where thesubject was located, essentially looking at the surroundings through thesubject’s eyes. These tests were also enormously successful, and in ways no oneexpected. In one case, involving psychic (and Scientologist) Pat Price, therandom number generator gave a certain set of coordinates for a marina not farfrom the SRI facility. (The envelopes containing the coordinates were numbered,and the random number generator would produce a number corresponding to one ofthe envelopes, thus removing any human agency from the selection process.) Asuspicious and skeptical SRI staffer, however, decided to change the location atthe last minute without regard to the coordinates printed on a paper inside theenvelope given to him before he set out. Instead, he drove around aimlessly fora while and then picked a completely different location.Price not only identified the exact location where the wandering subject woundup, but gave the answer five minutes before the subject arrived on-site, thuspredicting the future.32As the testing programs continued, Pat Price wound up moving for a while to WestVirginia, where he used his talents to locate veins of coal for a miningcompany; at the same time (and unknown to SRI), he was working directly for theCIA.The CIA at this time was concerned with penetrating a number of Chinese andSoviet embassies abroad. This Price was able to do, with relative ease, usingonly his mind. He accurately described a number of Chinese embassies and indetail. (The only occasional hiccup occurred when he described a building theway it had looked in the past.) He was even able to look at a photograph of abuilding and tell the CIA where the building was located—with incredibleprecision—and in one case remind the CIA handler of exactly where the photographhad been developed!Price had been a heavy drinker and smoker, and was fond of food as well.Therefore it came as no surprise when he developed symptoms of angina. Althoughhis friends did what they could to try to convince him to cut down, he generallyignored this advice and continued his energetic lifestyle.Then, one evening in Washington in mid-July of 1975, he had dinner with friends.The next day in Las Vegas, not feeling very well at dinner, Price mentioned tohis friends that someone had slipped something into his coffee the night before.This did not sound like paranoia on his part; he seemed certain of it. Laterthat night he went to his room. His friends found him afterward in a state ofcardiac arrest. He was pronounced dead in the hospital.Perhaps no one would have thought much of Price’s insistence that he had beenpoisoned or drugged the previous evening, but when CIA official “RichardKennett” tried to find out more, he was told that no autopsy had been performed.This was indeed unusual, as the death had occurred to a non-resident outside thehospital and would have ordinarily required an autopsy. Further, the hospitalstaff reported that a man had arrived at the hospital within hours of his deathwith a briefcase full of Price’s medical records and managed to convince thestaff not to perform an autopsy based on this evidence of Price’s poor physicalcondition. This gentleman has never been identified, not even by the CIA. Theassumption among some of Price’s associates was that he had been deliberatelypoisoned by the KGB or possibly the Chinese. There was never any evidence ofthis, of course, and Price’s lifestyle certainly could have contributed to aheart attack; the anomaly in this affair is the lack of an autopsy and themysterious man with the briefcase.33Price was the SRI psychic who was the most stunningly successful and consistent.If news of his exploits percolated outside the small circle of SRI and the CIA’sTechnical Services Staff, he could have become a target of hostile forces. Thesame month as Price’s death, Andrija Puharich was hosting a visit by Ira Einhornand Holly Maddux at his “Turkey Farm” in Ossining, New York, where theywitnessed a fourteen-year-old child in a remote viewing session “visit” thePentagon, the White House, and the Kremlin. It is perhaps not outside the realmof feasibility to imagine that the Soviets were aware of this “psychic spying”and simply decided to remove the most powerful psychics from America’s arsenal.Puharich’s role was well-known by this time. He had been the man to introduceUri Geller to the world, to bring him to SRI to be tested and thus come to theattention of American intelligence (which was, after all, funding the psychicresearch at SRI), and to place Geller within a very special context. In 1973,Puharich was still promoting the idea of The Nine, fully twenty years after thefirst session with the Indian medium Dr. Vinod. He brought Geller to a meetingwith Arthur Young on February 27, 1973 at Young’s home; again this is twentyyears after the first communication with The Nine that involved both Puharichand Young.Under hypnosis by Puharich, Geller admitted being the recipient of powers fromThe Nine (a claim he has denied in later years). Puharich’s book Uri: A Journalof the Mystery of Uri Geller, is a good source for names, dates and places inthe Geller timeline. It also contains the text of the film SRI made of Geller,and the text of the original statement by The Nine. Much of what was going on atSRI in the 1970s is covered by Puharich from his own perspective, which isalmost completely related to Uri Geller.And, according to Geller, Puharich was his CIA handler. This doesn’t seem toooutlandish a claim to make under the circumstances. After all, Puharich did haveextensive ties to the military and intelligence communities dating back to theKorean War. And Puharich did bring Geller to SRI, a place that was testingpsychic abilities under contract to the CIA. Whether or not Puharich wasactually on contract to the CIA himself is moot under the circumstances; hismentorship of the young Israeli psychic brought them both into contact withofficials from the CIA, the Pentagon, and the American government on an almostcontinual basis. For all practical intents and purposes, Geller was beingobserved by the CIA, and Puharich was the point of contact. The UriGeller–Andrija Puharich relationship has already been covered in Books I and II.What is important to focus on now is the “extended family” around the SRI remoteviewing program, including the quantum physicists and the military andintelligence operations that continued the psychic espionage project, bringingus into strange realms indeed.At the time that SRI was experimenting with psychic abilities in a relativelybenign fashion, the Soviet Union was engaged in its own psychic research. Therewere theoretical problems with psychic research in the Communist state, however;as long as ESP and other paranormal abilities were linked with superstition,magic and religion, no one in the Communist Party could become involved. Marxand Engels were quite clear about the position of religion in a Communistsociety. Religion, after all, was “the opiate of the people,” and psychicphenomena were relegated to the fringe of religion. But with the publication ofthe presumably fictitious Nautilus story in 1960, it seemed necessary for theSoviets to counter the presumed Allied threat in mental telepathy and otherpowers, in the name of “national security.”There were several famous Soviet psychics, and some of this research was coveredin Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain, a 1970 bestseller by SheilaOstrander and Lynn Schroeder, published two years before the experiments at SRIwould begin. According to Schnabel, who bases his information on intelligencedocuments and sources, the Soviets “scoured the mystical eastern vastnesses ofthe Soviet Union in order to find the toughest Siberian shamans, thebest-trained Tibetan priests, the most powerful Mongolian chi gong masters.”34This effort yielded some fruit, for “a group of Tibetans succeeded in breaking ahuman skull a few yards away, just by concentrating on it.”35 All of this wasundertaken by the Institute for the Problems of Information Transmission (knownby its Russian acronym IPPI) in Moscow. This same Institute was responsible fora state-sponsored experiment in the blackest of black arts: the cursing ofsouvenirs by shamans so that the (foreign) recipients of these gifts would“suffer neuralgia, depression, and even nervous breakdown.” 36What isastonishing about these experiments is that they were undertaken by a state thatconsidered itself the only truly scientific government on earth: one purged ofreligion, fantasy, and superstition and devoted to the liberation of the mindsof humanity from the shackles of false religious sentimentality.In Nexus magazine, an Australian journal that reports on psychic phenomena,UFOs, etc., former scientist and now the head of something called ParanormalManagement Systems in the UK, Turan Rifat, makes an observation about Sovietparapsychological research which echoes that made by Kenneth Grant with regardto Jack Parsons and the Babalon Working, i.e., that Soviet “research in thebiophysical domain became so advanced that they opened doorways to othercontinuums and themselves fell prey to malevolent forces.”37 While this soundsfar-fetched and the kind of thing one would expect of a popular magazine dealingwith paranormal conspiracy theories, one must admit that if this were possible,then it is, of course, equally possible with regard to American military andintelligence mind-control and psychological warfare operations. The Sovietswould have been using the very people who specialize in developing paranormalabilities through the “derangement of the senses” and the other techniquesalready described herein. These are individuals who would have attained somedegree of spiritual enlightenment and psychological integration. Would they havewillingly or enthusiastically supported their government’s plan to utilize theseabilities in the service of the state, for the assassination and control offoreign citizens? If one believes in the existence of “malevolent forces,” thenthe Siberian and Mongolian shamans and Tibetan priests would be the likelycontacts for these forces, as they had devoted their entire lives to the pursuitof otherworldly experience in the form of gods, demons, and disembodied souls.With the virtual destruction of the Russian Orthodox Church and the suppressionof all religious organizations, the shamans would have been the only ones leftin the Soviet Union still practicing spiritual techniques. Romanian émigréphilosopher Mircea Eliade had written extensively concerning shamanism in the1960s, and his insights into shamanism as a form of psychological conditioningcould not have failed to come to the attention of the Soviets.Back in the United States, the CIA and other government organizations weretaking a good, hard look at the success ratio of the SRI program. A temporaryblocking of federal funds for psi research took place in the mid-1970s, due tounfavorable publicity generated by reports of the CIA’s own prior MK-ULTRAmind-control programs (the psi research of SRI and the CIA seeming a little tooalike for comfort, as both involved experimentation on human subjects, and manyin government were opposed to this type of research anyway as smacking too muchof witchcraft or just plain nonsense), but the coffers slowly opened againduring the Carter administration, and this time the military was taking a morecentral role.The Pentagon’s remote viewing programs eventually (in early 1979) came under theauthority of the Defence Intelligence Agency, or DIA. The DIA set up its ownremote viewing operation at an abandoned building at Fort Meade, code-namedGRILL FLAME, but their remote viewers were generally still being trained at SRIin California, by the team of Puthoff, Swann and others. Swann helped to codifythe remote viewing protocols, making it an easily-defined system, and it isSwann’s contribution that comes through most clearly in the Internet-publishedDIA manual on CRV or “Coordinate Remote Viewing.”GRILL FLAME was under the authority of one Jack Vorona, a nuclear physicist whowas a DIA officer, and who controlled other “alternative” projects, such as onethat was designed to study mind-control using microwave technology.38 Thistechnique was thought to be a focus of Soviet research at the time, but therehas also been a lot of research in the United States on not only the use ofmicrowaves but also low-frequency radio waves, and on all sorts of electronicand mechanical approaches to mind control.These days, the Internet is full of information (much of it suspect) on thistype of technology, but a strange book published in 1998 and authored by RichardSauder includes over one hundred pages of U.S. patent information for a varietyof electronic devices for mind-control applications, including US Patent3,951,139: Apparatus and Method for remotely Monitoring and Altering Brain Wavesand US Patent 5,213,562: Method of Inducing Mental, Emotional and PhysicalStates of Consciousness, Including Specific Mental Activity, In Human Beings.The inventor of the latter was Robert A. Monroe, and thereby hangs a tale.Robert Monroe, a radio producer, began suffering from insomnia in 1958. It was asevere case that doctors could not do anything about, believing Monroe to besuffering from a nervous breakdown, especially when he began reporting that hewas leaving his body at night. Of course, most mental health professionals whenfaced with a statement like that would diagnose some form of schizophrenia;depending on other presenting symptoms one could also be looking atdissociation. Monroe, however, was fascinated by his own “disorder,” and beganbuilding a room where these episodes—known to psychic researchers as OOBEs or“out of body experiences”—could be monitored more closely. Eventually, thishobby turned into a full-scale methodology for initiating the OOBE usingsound-waves which, when broadcast through a set of headphones, would mimicbrain-waves of the same frequencies that he was targeting.Soon, the Monroe Institute was established for the study of this (and related)phenomena and became a part of the overall US government’s psychic warfareprogram. Located in Virginia, it was convenient to the Fort Meade contingent,and the devices that Monroe developed at his Institute appear to have been quitesuccessful and popular among the remote viewers. Monroe authored several bookson the out-of-body-experience (such as Journeys Out Of The Body, Doubleday, NY,1971), and Richard Sauder became interested, and visited the Monroe Institute togo through the training. He would later claim that since then he had been insporadic telepathic communication with Monroe himself. 39As bizarre as that sounds, the reactions of SRI and GRILL FLAME staffers whenfaced with the Monroe techniques were just as startling. Army Captain SkipAtwater was the intelligence officer who, in 1977, founded the Army’s version ofthe SRI team at Fort Meade and ran it until 1987. Atwater visited the MonroeInstitute in 1977 and tried out the equipment, which consisted of a set ofheadphones that broadcast a pre-recorded tape with Monroe’s voice and specialeffects. According to Schnabel’s account, Atwater experienced a sense oflevitation on the very first attempt! 40 Astonished by this result, Atwaterbecame a fixture at the Monroe Institute, and eventually became director ofresearch there after retiring from the Army.Other military remote viewers at the Monroe Institute experienced everythingfrom spirit possession to a sense that they were being remotely-viewed by theSoviet opposition; but by far the strangest and most compelling case for thedangers of meddling in the paranormal for those who have not undergone rigorousspiritual training beforehand is the Lawrence Livermore episode.This is recounted in very few places. Uri Geller mentions being at LawrenceLivermore in passing in The Geller Effect—co-authored with Guy Lyon Playfair(the AID worker from Brazil who became very involved in occultism and theparanormal)—but it is not mentioned at all in Puharich’s Uri or in the bookco-authored by SRI scientist Russell Targ and SRI remote viewer Keith Harary,The Mind Race. It appears in various places on the Internet, and in some detailin Schnabel’s work on remote viewers and in Mind Reach by Puthoff and Targ. Itis worth repeating here in brief, as the individuals concerned were allscientists at Lawrence Livermore, and not psychics or mediums or anyonetraditionally connected with the occult.Uri Geller had been invited to SRI for some informal tests of his abilities in1972. By 1974, word of his prowess had leaked out around the world, and thenuclear weapons specialists at Lawrence Livermore were concerned that someonewith psychic abilities—particularly psychokinesis, an ability Gellerdemonstrated by bending metal spoons, rings, and other objects with hismind—could detonate a nuclear weapon using only mental energy or could scramblethe nation’s military computer systems, thus disabling the country’s missiledefences. Therefore, in late 1974 and 1975 a select group of scientists andsecurity officers began testing Geller at an off-site location.The tests showed that Geller could only affect metal objects, computer systems,and computer disks if he was in physical contact with them. Therefore, it was areasonable assumption that PK was not a threat to the nation’s missile systems.However, other developments took place that caused not only concern but hysteriaamong the Lawrence Livermore staffWhile technicians were listening to the audiotapes routinely made during theGeller PK sessions, they noticed a voice on the tape that had not been thereduring the tests. It was a “metallic voice” and was largely unintelligible,although the few words that were understood turned out to be top-secretcodenames for intelligence operations, names that were unknown to the scientistsat Lawrence Livermore. In addition, an infrared camera that had been used duringthe sessions showed patches of radiation on the laboratory walls where no suchradiation should have been present.These were more than merely scientific anomalies. They were captured on tape andfilm under controlled circumstances. However, this would have been worth a fewparagraphs in a report and not much more, were it not for the fact thatpersonnel involved in the Geller experiments began to experience exceedinglystrange phenomena. One of the recurring motifs was the appearance of a flyingsaucer in the laboratory: a hovering, hologram-like image that would floataround and then disappear. And this “saucer” appearance was not restricted tothe laboratory. Some of the scientists witnessed the phenomenon when they wereat home with their families. There was no conceivable explanation for this, noway such a hologram could have been projected inside the secure laboratoryenvironment without a lot of equipment and expensive electronics that could haveeasily been discovered. Since Geller was known to put out the story that he wasin communication with extraterrestrial agencies aboard a spacecraft that hoveredover the earth, the connection was obvious, but the reason or motivation behindthe apparitions was not.In addition to the saucer, there were reports of appearances of strange andfantastic animals to the Lawrence Livermore personnel and their families,including very large black birds, ravens, that would appear from nowhere andwander across their lawns … or suddenly appear in the morning standing overtheir beds. This association of birds with Geller was something that thelaboratory staff may have not recognized, for Geller’s supernatural experiencesincluded that of a bird of prey, usually a hawk (symbol for the Egyptian god,Horus). The appearance of fantastic animals is common in the literature ofshamanism, and their purpose is usually totemic in nature; but what washappening to the scientists?As the personnel began to break down and exhibit signs of intense mentaldistress, the security officer in charge of the group broke down and contacted“Richard Kennett” of the CIA. As Kennett not only had security clearances butwas also aware of the psychic research programs and had a doctorate inneurophysiology, he was the logical choice.Kennett listened to the men—some of whom broke down and wept in hispresence—describe their symptoms. He was not convinced that this was simply atextbook case of hysteria. These men were scientists with no occult leanings;furthermore, they had all been psychologically vetted, as they were involvedwith classified government and military projects. It didn’t make sense.And then he listened to the audiotapes, and heard the secret codewords mentionedthat none of the Lawrence Livermore staff could have known.This was not the end of the story, however. One of the scientists received aphone call and heard the “metallic voice” that so often pursues researchers inthis field, man and boy, and this time the voice told him to drop the Gellerexperimentation completely. The team was only too happy to do so, and the“hauntings” gradually stopped.(I hesitate to mention another incident among these many strange occurrences atAmerica’s most important nuclear weapons research facility after that at LosAlamos. Although the incident has been documented, I feel I am so strainingcredulity as it is, with these stories of paranormal powers, governmentagencies, military remote viewing and the rest, that to bring up the denouementof the Lawrence Livermore episode might be to lose my audience completely afterwe have come so far. I have made it a core element of my approach thateverything I claim in this book is thoroughly documented and with as muchreliance on primary sources as is practicable, considering the subject matter. Ihave, indeed, omitted many anecdotes and other material that I considered tooquestionable, or for which evidence was not sufficient to overwhelm anyreasonable objections. So … )Apparently, one of the Livermore scientists was at home one evening speakingwith his wife when another of the apparitions occurred in their living room.This time it was of a man’s arm, clad in a grey suit jacket, that hovered andtwisted in the air between them. The end of the arm consisted not of a hand, butof a hook. It appeared, and then just as mysteriously disappeared.When this account was related to “Richard Kennett,” he must have wonderedwhether or not Puthoff and Targ had been playing games with lasers andholograms. When he met with them, he repeated what he had heard from theLivermore scientists, ending with the story about the arm. At that precisemoment, there came a loud, insistent pounding on the door of their motel room.The door was opened to reveal a man dressed in a grey suit. He walked into thecenter of the room and said in an odd voice, “I guess I must be in the wrongroom,” and turned and left. They had enough time to see that he had one sleevepinned to his shoulder. The man in the grey suit was missing an arm.Schnabel, in whose book this account also occurs, gives it the benefit of adoubt.41 Some of the Lawrence Livermore staff refused to go into details aboutthese experiences with him; one of them was writing his own book about theGeller affair and wanted to keep the details to himself, understandably. Otherswere not directly involved in the day-to-day proceedings and could not offermuch corroboration. Schnabel has wondered if the “man in the grey suit” episodewas invented as a fictional device by Puthoff and Targ, if not the firstapparition then perhaps the melodramatic, Weird Tales ending. There is noparticular reason to believe that Puthoff and Targ would have invented such anending, however, considering all the problems they have had in gettingscientists to take their paranormal research seriously. To invent such aHollywood ending would be to jeopardize whatever ground they had won, painfullyand at great cost. At this time, we simply have to take the story at face value.It is certainly no stranger than other episodes in the literature, and findsresonance with mysterious and “synchronistic” events recounted by Strieber,Sarfatti, and so many others. Even more incredible, all of this was taking placein the heart of the American defense industry, in the core of the“military-industrial complex” President Eisenhower warned us all about in 1960.During the Carter Administration, remote viewers were involved in everythingfrom looking for the Iranian hostages to locating a downed Soviet spyplane. InMay of 1978, Hal Puthoff received an urgent fax from the Army tasking his remoteviewer team to locate a Tu-22 bomber that had disappeared somewhere over theAfrican nation of Zaire. The man who gave Puthoff this mission was General EdThompson of the Pentagon’s intelligence agency, responsible for the Army’sremote viewing projects among other duties. Thompson was a strong supporter ofremote viewing, as was General Albert Stubblebine of the Pentagon’s INSCOM(Intelligence and Security Command) division, under whose wing GRILL FLAME,CENTER LANE, and the other codenames for the remote viewing operations wouldfind themselves in the 1980s. (INSCOM would also develop a close workingrelationship with the Monroe Institute.)The Soviets and the American CIA were hot in pursuit of the downed bomber. Ifthe CIA could get there first, they would uncover a treasure trove of Sovietsecrets, since the Tu-22 had been on an intelligence-gathering mission overAfrica. The CIA had its own ideas about where to find the plane, but the SRIremote viewer came through with flying colors. He was corroborated by anotherremote viewer, this time working out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Betweenthe two of them—and unknown to each other—they developed a detailed map anddescription of where the plane would be found, tail-up in a jungle river. TheCIA recovery team—on their way to the site where they estimated the plane wouldbe—came across the site identified by the remote viewers first: there was theplane.This story eventually made Jack Anderson’s syndicated newspaper column andbecame a world-wide sensation. Other spectacular results would follow from timeto time, involving terrorists, hostages, nuclear weapons testing, and otherareas of intense concern to military and intelligence chiefs. And theexperiments continued as Puthoff and others sought ways to fine-tune the resultsof their most talented remote viewers as well as to develop methods by whichvirtually anyone can be trained in the process.There was considerable opposition to these programs both within and outside themilitary, however. Some among the general staff could not understand the valueof having “tea leaf readers” work for the Pentagon; others felt that themystique of the remote viewers detracted from the real work of intelligencegathering, which involved either satellites in the sky or assets on the ground.Many were dismayed by the cozy relationship that developed between INSCOM andthe Monroe Institute. Also, remote viewing reached a kind of crescendo duringthe Democratic Carter administration, and after the Republican Ronald Reagan waselected President in 1980 there was a mad dash to distance the newadministration from the perceived weaknesses of the old. The CIA’s Robert Gatesas well as Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci both opposed the remote viewingprograms, which is amusing considering that their president was a man whoconsulted astrologers, and had been doing so since at least the time he wasGovernor of California.Although Gates and Carlucci did their best to destroy the remote viewingprogram, the psychics had champions in the persons of Senator Robert Byrd (D) ofWest Virginia, Senator Daniel Inouye (D) of Hawaii, Senator and former astronautJohn Glenn (D) of Ohio, and two Republican senators, William Cohen of Maine andTed Stevens of Alaska. (It should also be mentioned that one of the most vocalsupporters of the SRI and military psi-war programs was former astronaut EdgarMitchell, who had been on hand to welcome Uri Geller to SRI back in 1972.Mitchell—a member of the Masonic society—has been intimately involved withparanormal research since his retirement from NASA. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin,another Mason, brought a Masonic flag with him on his Apollo 11 flight to theMoon on July 20, 1969, an event he commemorated in a letter to the Masonic GrandCommander on NASA stationery, dated September 19, 1969. That quite a number ofastronauts have been Masons, and that the Grand Secretary General of the Societyat the time of the lunar landing in 1969 was the brother of an important NASAofficial is noted in Richard Sauder’s book.)42The senators managed to protect the remote viewing program for quite a while,but the psychics still wound up as moving targets, working now for INSCOM, nowfor the DIA, fighting for funding all over Capitol Hill. Puthoff managed to wina ten-year contract from an unidentified government agency that saved the SRIprogram, but he had tired of the politics—both internal and external—at SRI andretired from the Institute in 1985. Major General Stubblebine was forced toretire from the Army—and thus as protector of the remote viewing apparatus—in1984. Oddly enough, Stubblebine would wind up in New York, having divorced hisfirst wife, living with a psychiatrist who specialized in alien abduction cases.Many of the remote viewers and support personnel became UFO “believers”—if thatis the correct term—including Ingo Swann, who eventually returned to New YorkCity after dealing with numerous internal political squabbles himself, mostnotably with Russell Targ. Swann has written and self-published a book about hisUFO beliefs, Penetration: The Question of Extraterrestrial and Human Telepathy,which does not add much to our knowledge of the SRI remote viewing program, butwhich does expand considerably on the theme that remote viewers wereoccasionally tasked with UFO research—including attempting to learn the truthbehind the flying saucer phenomenon—as well as viewing other planets.Stubblebine himself became a UFO enthusiast and is on the record as stating thatthere are “structures underneath the surface of Mars” as well as machinery, andthat all of this information was obtained through remote viewing.43In light of the fact that that so many military men, from enlisted personnel togenerals like MacArthur and Stubblebine, have gone on the record as supportingthe idea that UFOs are extraterrestrial craft visiting the earth, the constantridiculing of this hypothesis from all corners of both the military and thescientific communities seems highly suspect. We are constantly being told thatthe eyewitnesses to UFO sightings are not credible, not trained observers, andhave mistaken natural objects for spacecraft; then we have a wide cross-sectionof military and scientific personnel who insist that the phenomenon is genuineand not the result of swamp gas or the planet Venus. What is the citizenry tomake of this apparent dichotomy? We may accept—reluctantly— that a farmer inIowa who has lived there all his life has mistaken a common natural event for aflying saucer landing; we find it difficult to accept that a major general wouldhave made a similar mistake.Indeed, the reactions of men like Stubblebine and MacArthur are based onmilitary records rather than personal, eyewitness accounts or—likeStubblebine—are the result of paranormal “scrying” (a method which was, ofcourse, supported by the military and proved useful in a number of occasions,such as locating SCUD missiles during the Gulf War with Iraq); but then, are wenot to trust the analyses of this data by generals and other officers,especially those—like Stubblebine—who were in charge of intelligence andsecurity? If not, if we can’t trust the observations and conclusions of the menwho are effectively in charge of our national security, and who have been forthe past fifty years at least, then certainly that security is in seriousdisrepair!One of SRI’s remote viewers—Keith Harary—co-authored a popular book on remoteviewing and psychic phenomena in general with Russell Targ, entitled The MindRace. Harary joined SRI in 1980, and has since become a psychologist, but in1979 he found himself counseling former members of the Peoples Temple andworking closely with Al and Jeannie Mills, the Temple whistle-blowers who wouldsoon be murdered in their home. Targ and Harary teamed up after leaving SRI inthe early 1980s, and traveled frequently to Eastern bloc countries, which was aconcern to the American intelligence establishment, particularly the DIA. Targclaimed they were working with their Russian counterparts in a “pure science”and non-military environment, but it is not certain that statement satisfied theDIA.Eventually, the two men began playing the silver-futures market using Harary’spsychic abilities and Targ’s analysis of the results, and making considerableprogress, attracting an investor. After a few misses, however, the men beganblaming each other for the losses—and in public, during a lecture at Esalen—andthe lawsuits started to fly. The men are still at loggerheads.The remote viewing program lasted well into the 1990s, due to the $10 millioncontract won by Hal Puthoff in the last days of his administration at SRI, butas early as 1988 the Pentagon Inspector General had recommended that the FortMeade operation be shut down. The days of the remote viewers were numbered. By1995 and at the end of the SRI contract, word of the “psychic spies” had leakedonce again to the press, and CIA directors and military men and former remoteviewers were appearing on television and in the print media, answering questionsand trying to put a better appearance on the revelations than the image of a spywith crystal balls. Ingo Swann went on the record to state that the originalpurpose behind SRI’s remote viewing program was to discover what the Soviets hadaccomplished in the field, in order that American military and intelligencepersonnel could be kept informed.Much of the methodology of the SRI remote viewing teams leaked out, includingSwann’s elegant (and often criticized) terminology. One of these was the“Matrix”: a description of the underlying interconnectivity of the universe thata remote viewer would enter in a trance state. Without putting too fine a pointon it, what Swann proposed was that psychics could enter what was essentially akind of quantum state; within the Matrix, a remote viewer could theoretically goanywhere and see anything, regardless of normal limitations of space and time.That a popular film series would be made based on this very premise within a fewyears of the press revelations about GRILL FLAME, STAR GATE and Ingo Swann’s“Matrix” should, perhaps, no longer surprise us.The films’ treatment of normal human consciousness as the creation of anenormous computer-like grid run by alien forces is probably as close as we willget to seeing the theories and doctrines of The Nine, Spectra, Hoova and all therest portrayed cinematically, albeit from a very negative standpoint. It shouldalso be mentioned that central to the screenplay of the the Matrix films are the“Men in Black”; this time they are assassins bent on stopping charactersMorpheus, Neo and their cohorts from taking back the planet and waking up theworld.How could people respond to these images if images didn’t secretly enjoy thesame status as real things? Not that images were so powerful, but that the worldwas so weak.—Jonathan Franzen44The remote viewing programs of the military and intelligence communities— underthe general rubric of GRILL FLAME and the other, later, modifications of thesame—were extremely cheap by Pentagon standards. Hal Puthoff had secured a tenmillion dollar, ten year contract to support that research. By comparison, someof the Pentagon’s frivolous spending on toilet seats and screwdrivers seemsinsane. It was not remote viewing in and of itself that threatened the Americanmilitary establishment, however; it was the fact that the very nature of theprogram threatened its comfortable, Newtonian worldview. Officers were nervousabout the “giggle factor”—when talk of the psychic spies and their exploitswould elicit giggles and outright guffaws from their peers—and probably thismore than anything else caused the remote viewing programs to be sidelined andeventually cancelled altogether. This is a pity, for several reasons.In the first place, SRI and Hal Puthoff and the others were unable to publishmuch of their research due to security restrictions and the highly classifiednature of some of their taskings. That means that an area of science in which wedesperately need to know more has been effectively shut off from peer review,with the result that few individuals and organizations in the scientificestablishment take the program—and all it implies for science—seriously.In the second place, America (and the West in general) is now engaged in aserious struggle for survival against forces that are not technologically oreconomically superior. These forces succeed on the basis of power derived fromthe very mental states studied by the mind-control experts of the past fiftyyears: conversion, dissociation, and the whole eros-driven “derangement of thesenses” that contributes not only to art and the manufacture of images, but tothe conscious and willful use of those images to effect political change: thescience of the shaman, the magician, the psychological warfare expert. Theleaders of these assaults cynically manipulate the minds of their followers tothe extent that suicide missions become glorious … particularly those in whichlarge numbers of civilians are murdered, as hideously and as brutally aspossible for maximum effect. This is not a new development, of course. TheJapanese in World War II gave us a foretaste of the “kamikaze” impulse. Theblack magicians behind these and other acts of desperate courage committed bythe credulous and the lonely and the pious never lead these doomed individualsin the suicide runs, but pull the strings from a safe base in a friendlycountry, moving huge funds across borders with alacrity, and ordering mayhem byemail and mobile phone. To find these sorcerers we need more than satellites andsmirking condescension. We need more than SIGINT and HUMINT. We need a“backdoor” into their psyches.This was begun during the Carter administration when remote viewers were taskedwith locating hostages taken by terrorists, including CIA agent William Buckley,whose exploits and murder were detailed in Books I and II; it was reinforcedwhen remote viewers were tasked with finding SCUD missile launchers during theGulf War. At this time, remote viewing cannot be considered a replacement fornormal intelligence gathering operations and probably will never be; but it is avaluable supplement to those endeavors and has the additional virtue of beinginexpensive and seemingly undetectable. There is no earthly reason why theseprograms cannot be reinstated and the methodology perfected. There is, in fact,no reason why private individuals or private organizations cannot practice thesetechniques on their own, independent of government supervision or involvement.Shamans and magicians have been doing so for thousands of years. And thetraining manuals exist: either the grimoires of the sorcerers or the officialmanuals of the remote viewers. Terrorist organizations have been using methodsvery similar to these for indoctrination and training of assassins, and theSoviet Union has experimented to an unsettling degree with the ability to causeheart attacks and other ailments from a distance using the powers of the mind.The powers of consciousness.THE GHOST IN THE MACHINEArt is a school of self-transcendence. So is a voodoo session or a Nazi rally.—Arthur Koestler45Arthur Koestler, himself fascinated for many years by the phenomenon ofcoincidence (and author of the influential essay The Roots of Coincidence),traces modern preoccupation with it to Schoepenhauer, and from Schoepenhauer toPaul Kammerer and from there to Jung and Pauli. What all of these gentlemen hadin common was an understanding that coincidence represents an acausal “force” or“principle” in the world, operating outside traditionally-understood science,but nevertheless a part of our experience. Koestler actually goes much furtherand much deeper into the study of this phenomenon than even Jung and Pauli, whoseemed to stop short: Jung not enough of a physicist and Pauli not enough of apsychologist, perhaps.In Janus, a book published towards the end of his life, before this accomplishedphilosopher, sometime Marxist, and historian of science committed suicide withhis wife of many years after he learned he was stricken with a debilitatingterminal sickness, Koestler laid out the parameters for an educated debate overthe issue of coincidence and its role in both physics and in consciousness. Asit transcends the initial attempts by Jung and Pauli to identify coincidencebeyond the tag “acausal connecting principle” and goes right to the heart of thematter by identifying coincidence with paranormal abilities as well as withevents in the “real world,” his ideas bear some review. One should remember thatKoestler did begin his professional life as an admirer of Communism, laterabandoning this political creed and defecting to the West; his political lifeand background are therefore valuable to us, for they give Koestler a uniqueperspective on the historical and scientific problems we face when we considercoincidence as more than just a curiosity.Koestler begins his argument by pointing out that a human being’s brain isactually two brains: a reptilian brain, responsible for our instinctualbehavior, and a neocortex, a “new brain,” that lies atop the old brain and isresponsible for our intellectual superiority to other creatures on the earth.Koestler believes that it is the imperfect control of the reptilian brain by theneocortex that has led to humanity’s predicament. He points to an explosivegrowth in technology from the time of the ancient Greeks to modern spaceexploration in only 2500 years, and the parallel decline in human ethics andmorality, which began with Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism and which led toHitler, Stalin, and the spiritual poverty of modern psychology.He emphasizes that only human beings feel no compunction about killing membersof their own species and, indeed, are capable of such obscenities as humansacrifice to appease some invented deity. He does not believe that humanitywages war and commits genocide because of aggression; instead, he blameshumanity’s ills on an excess of devotion. It is loyalty to a king or to a causeor to a religion (quite often, all three) that motivates a man to leave his homeand put on a uniform and endure months or years of self-sacrifice, boredom,hunger and deprivation. Soldiers, as Koestler points out, are rarely aggressiveand certainly not territorial. They have subsumed their individuality in thegroup, the tribe, the cult. They follow orders. They kill, not out of convictionor aggression, but on command, out of loyalty to an authority figure andidentity with a group.For Koestler, the most powerful weapon in the arsenal of humanity is language.46The Word. For it is language that both unites groups and divides humanity amongthose very groups, and gives it the rationale for killing fellow humans. It islanguage as it is understood by the psychological warriors and the advertisingexecutives. It is language as understood by the ancient Greeks as well as byBruno the Renaissance magician.Thus, Koestler attacks the reductionism of scientists and philosophers fromPavlov to Skinner, from Freud to Desmond Morris, which blames the evils ofhistory on instincts and natural aggression. In fact, he goes even further tosuggest that this loyalty to authority begins as a form of brainwashing in thehuman infant, which remains helpless and in parental control for a much longerperiod than the infant offspring of other mammals. “Brainwashing,” he writes,“starts in the cradle.”47 Children drink in religious fanaticism and tribalidentification along with their mother’s milk. In this, Koestler andpsychiatrist R.D. Laing (and Ignatius Loyola) are in perfect agreement. It wasthe malleability of the brain of the human child that encouraged a generation ofbehaviorists and determinists to devote special attention to the establishmentof those “secret schools” for the indoctrination of the young and their moldinginto the Cold Warriors of the future. Whether we believe the Whitley Striebermodel of the secret school, or the Jack Sarfatti model, it is clear that thistype of environment did exist, and not only in the United States but mostespecially in other countries, such as in China under Mao, in the Soviet Unionunder Stalin, in Germany under Hitler, and in those African and Asian nations oftoday which train boys and girls of nine and ten years old in the arts ofassassination and soldiering.Koestler’s interest is obviously political in much of what he writes, but he hasabandoned the jingoistic politics of the political party, the slogan, the massrally, for a scientific view of the human being that transcends socialorganizations. (He was imprisoned as a suspected spy during the Spanish CivilWar and narrowly escaped execution.) Like Jung and like historian of religionMircea Eliade, who both had a flirtation with Nazism, Koestler’s briefinvolvement with Communism was salutary in the long run: they all abandoned thedream of equality and freedom from want promised by social organizations andturned towards a pursuit of spiritual (or, perhaps, psychological) freedom asthe means to cure humanity’s ills. Marxism—as self-consciously more “scientific”than its competitors—was in a sense the perfect laboratory environment for thedevelopment of these ideas, for Marx looked at history as inevitability: humansociety progressed from a feudal state to an industrialized state to a socialiststate and then to a communist state (I am summarizing mightily here) accordingto the Marxist dialectic. The world would eventually evolve into communism andworkers would live in a paradise on earth as there was no paradise anywhereelse. When the “inevitability” of this process was called into question—when theworkers’ states of the Soviet Union and China did not automatically induceworking class ecstasy—then history as evolution was called into question, aswell. As Koestler understands, the history of science and technology is onething; the history of human civilization is quite another.In an effort to come to terms with this schizophrenic aspect of humanity,Koestler considers human beings to have two (at times mutually contradictory)impulses: that of self-transcendence and that of self-assertion. Self-assertionmay be thought to be analogous to the instinct of individual survival andexpression at the cost of society; self-transcendence—to which he also refers asthe integrative faculty—is the impulse to go beyond one’s personal comfort andsatisfaction to meld with the common good, to sign the social contract. Thesetwo impulses, to Koestler, represent a continuum of two extremes, with much ofhuman behavior occupying a kind of middle ground, as humans attempt to satisfyboth at once. This leads to Koestler’s concept of “bisociation,” by which hemeans “a distinction between the routines of disciplined thinking within asingle universe of discourse—on a single plane, as it were—and the creativetypes of mental activity which always operates on more than one plane.”48Koestler uses this concept to explain both humor and tragedy, and the creativearts (which includes every creative act, including those that occur withinscience and mathematics) and then inevitably turns to the subject ofcoincidence:Coincidence may be described as the chance encounter of two unrelated causalchains which—miraculously it seems—merge into a significant event. It providesthe neatest paradigm of the bisociation of previously separate contexts,engineered by fate. Coincidences are puns of destiny. (emphasis in original) 49Koestler goes on to talk about the “law of large numbers” or “law ofprobability” that Jung identifies with Newtonian science in general. Whenobserving, for instance, that dogs were biting people according to an average ofabout seventy-five incidents per day in the 1950s in New York City, Koestlerasks a question: “How do the dogs of New York know when to stop biting and whento make up the daily quota?” 50He reprises the sentiments of mathematician VonNeumann who looked at probability as “black magic,” in which “we are faced witha large number of uncertainties producing a certainty, a large number of randomevents creating a lawful total outcome” (emphasis in original).51This, of course, is also the case with quantum physics, in which theuncertainty of life at the quantum level produces the relative stability andcertainty of the perceived universe.Koestler realizes the implications of what he is writing, of course, and drawsthe same comparison between paranormal abilities and coincidence that are drawnby Jung and many others. He begins by speaking about the “integrativetendency”—which he also refers to as the “self-transcendent tendency”—as theimpulse to create order out of disorder: i.e., transcending the individualisticinstincts of survival to attain a high degree of integration of the individualwith society. He then draws a parallel between the self-transcendent tendencyand psychic phenomena:The present theory is even more hazardous by explicitly suggesting that theintegrative tendency operates in both causal and acausal ways, the two standingin a complementary relationship analogous to the particle-wave complementarityin physics. It is accordingly supposed to embrace not only the acausal agenciesoperating on the sub-atomic level, but also the phenomena of parapsychology and‘confluential events’. We have seen that ESP and ‘synchronicity’ often overlap,so that a supposedly paranormal event can be interpreted either as a result ofESP or as a case of ‘synchronicity’.… The present theory suggests that in asimilar way telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, psychokinesis andsynchronicity are merely different manifestations under different conditions ofthe same universal principle—i.e., the integrative tendency operating throughboth causal and acausal agencies. (emphases in original)52This connection between the paranormal and the synchronistic is at the heart ofthis entire three-volume study. We have examined the coincidences of history,such as those that surround the various political assassinations in America inthe last half of the twentieth century. We have also studied some paranormalphenomena. We have explored theories regarding the practices of shamanism, thetechniques of mind control, the manifestos of the surrealists, the espionage ofthe remote viewers, and the visions of the UFOlogists. The Frenchmen, Pauwelsand Bergier, have suggested that coincidence may offer us a new way of lookingat history; Jung and Pauli have suggested that coincidence may offer us a newway of looking at reality. The theories presented in this chapter—to which anincreasing number of physicists and other scientists subscribe—may offer notonly a way of looking at history, but a way of taking an active part in itscreation.THE RED TINCTUREConsciousness is basically a device for registering meaning …—Colin Wilson, Order of Assassins: The Psychology of Murder53There is a tool with which we are theoretically able to cause change to occur atwhat we may call the quantum level (and, correspondingly, on the higher levelsas well, once the fundamental change has taken place at the root level of thequantum). That tool is meaning. And the phenomenon of synchronicity asunderstood by Pauli and Jung reveals this meaning in action.Those new to quantum physics will probably find it strange that one of thepioneers of this discipline was intimately familiar with alchemy, psychology,and even the I Ching, and could carry on a correspondence (and hold his own)with the likes of a Carl Gustav Jung. One comes away from the correspondencebetween Jung and Pauli with a sense that the physicist Pauli understood that theJungian idea of the unconscious and its structures was essential to a completegrasp of not only psychology but also physics. Pauli’s letters are full ofreference to Kepler, whom he studied not so much for his contribution to sciencebut rather for his alchemical work, in which Pauli saw the germ of quantumphysics.Pauli was a consistent and dedicated recorder of his dreams, and he wouldanalyze them in concert with Jung, not only during the two years of Pauli’stherapy with Jung, but long after that therapy had ended and the two haddeveloped a kind of professional relationship based on the exchange of ideas,principally those concerning synchronicity.Pauli’s dreams were remarkable in that their symbolism seemed to mirror hisphilosophical preoccupations. As someone who was familiar with alchemicalauthors such as Robert Fludd, he was able to communicate with Jung on a shareddeep level. Pauli understandably felt a certain kinship with the alchemists,since they were—at least in Jung’s view—attempting to harmonize physics withconsciousness, with spirituality, and this was obviously a concern of Pauli’s,as is evident from the correspondence. While Pauli was certainly interested inhow his dreams were relevant to his personal growth, he also had the desire tolearn how they contributed to understanding the broader picture of quantumphysics and consciousness.These letters are a valuable resource, for they demonstrate an approach towardpsychology by a physicist, while Jung is approaching physics through psychology.There are occasions when Pauli will correct a malapropism of Jung’s indicating atoo hasty-analogy between some element of physics and that of psychology, andthese are valuable as well, for they show how deeply Pauli was reading Jung.They also discuss astrology and other “occult” practices, as well as some of theexperiments in parapsychology of the day, such as those by Duke Universityprofessor J.B. Rhine. It should be remembered that this correspondence lastedfrom the 1930s to the 1950s; that is, it spanned the years of the rise ofNazism, World War II, the first atomic bombs, and the Cold War. Pauli wasAustrian, and Jung was Swiss. They were both German-speaking Europeans caught upin the madness that science, occultism, and politics had unleashed on the world.Taken in this light, their letters have a certain poignancy.It is on the subject of synchronicity and the “meaningful coincidence” howeverthat the two men are most fascinating. Rather than dismiss coincidence asscientifically irrelevant or trivial, they approach it as evidence of theoperation of a deeper physical process, and quite possibly as the crossroads ofphysics and consciousness.In a letter to Jung dated June 28, 1949, Pauli—discussing a little-known essayof Schoepenhauer’s on “the ultimate union of necessity and chance”—writes,… whereas [Schoepenhauer] wanted at all costs to cling to rigid determinismalong the lines of the classical physics of his day, we have now acknowledgedthat in the nuclear world, physical events cannot be followed in causal chainsthrough time and space. Thus, the readiness to adopt the idea on which your workis based, that of the “meaning as an ordering factor,” is probably considerablygreater among physicists that it was in Schoepenhauer’s day.54Jung and Pauli were discussing “meaning as an ordering factor” in the context ofconsciousness—in the perception of meaningful coincidences by the consciousmind—as well as in the nuclear world. The assumption being made by both Jung andPauli is that somehow the rules of the quantum or nuclear world also obtained inconsciousness, if not in the Newtonian world of linear cause-and-effect. Whatthe modern theories of “quantum consciousness” propose is that there exists amechanism in the brain that may be in control of consciousness and that thismechanism functions at the quantum level where non-locality is a feature: alevel where the Newtonian concepts of time and space do not apply. Pauli goes astep further by associating Jung’s idea of synchronicity with an alchemicalprocess that Jung refers to as the conjunction process and what the alchemistsreferred to in the Latin as coniunctio. The conjunction process is the union ofopposites that leads to wholeness, to healing, for which normal human sexualrelations (or “Eros”) may be considered emblematic. And one of the alchemicalsymbols of the successful completion of this process is the “red tincture”:… what strikes me first from the psychological angle is that a far-reachingparallel exists with what the alchemists referred to as the “production of thered tincture.” Experience has shown me that what you call a “conjunctionprocess” is generally conducive to the appearance of the “synchronistic”phenomenon.… And it is more likely to make its appearance when the pairs ofopposites keep in balance as much as possible. (emphasis in original)55Pauli goes on to compare the concept of radioactivity to synchronicity:… Just as in physics, a radioactive substance (through “active precipitation”from developing gaslike substances) radioactively “contaminates” a wholelaboratory, so the synchronistic phenomenon seems to have the tendency to spreadinto the consciousness of several people. (emphasis in original)56And:… The physical phenomenon of radioactivity consists in the transition of theatomic nucleus of the active substance from an unstable early state to itsstable final state … in the course of which the radioactivity finally stops.Similarly, the synchronistic phenomenon … accompanies the transition from anunstable state of consciousness into a new stable position, in balance with theunconscious, a position in which the synchronistic borderline phenomenon hasvanished again.57This is quite clearly a workable hypothesis for the operation of synchronicityas a phenomenon which moves from an unstable state of consciousness to a stableone, at which point it disappears.Pauli goes a bit further in a letter written to Jung on June 4, 1950 (at theoutbreak of the Korean War), in which he relates more dream material, and thenwrites of his experiences at Princeton University, where he discussedsynchronicity “on several occasions.” He then makes an interesting comment whichis very much in line with Jung’s own published writing on synchronicity:… I made a point of stressing the difference between the spontaneous appearanceof the phenomenon … and the induced phenomenon (by means of a preliminarytreatment or a rite), as is the case with mantic practices (I Ching or arsgeomantica). (emphasis in original)58Spontaneous synchronicity and induced synchronicity. Here we come to the veryheart of the power behind the sinister forces. Even Pauli seems somehow aware ofthe larger implications of this theory when he writes to Jung on November 28,1936:I would like to hear sometime what you think about the collection of dreams … inwhich the dark anima asserts with a certain persistence that there is a“magical” connection between sexuality and eroticism on the one hand, andpolitical or historical events on the other.59In all the writings of the physicists and the quantum consciousness theorists wehave encountered thus far, there has been avoidance of the core question at theheart of their identification of synchronicity (“meaningful coincidence” and“acausal connecting principle”) with quantum mechanics: the politicalramifications of a consciousness that can be manipulated as much as subatomicparticles can be manipulated, but using as the “energy source” what Pauli’s“dark anima” calls “sexuality” and what Ioan Coulianu’s Giordano Bruno calls“eros,” resulting in the phenomenon of induced synchronicityAre the many, many coincidences that surround some of America’s most critical“political or historical events” representative of this type of inducedsynchronicity? Were Pauwels and Bergier correct in postulating that thephenomenon of synchronicity and meaningful-coincidence could lead to “anentirely new conception of history”? Were these scientists-intelligenceofficers-occultists, godfathering the birth of modern remote viewing with theirdisinformation article on the Nautilus experiments in telepathy, telling ussomething they already knew?It would seem at first glance that an induced synchronicity is one in whichthere is an element of cause-and-effect, and thus negates the entire concept ofan “acausal connecting principle”; but what Pauli references is not a means tocause a synchronicity to occur, but a means of observing synchronicity bycreating an environment conducive to its observation—such as the Chinese systemof divination known as the I Ching—or by creating an event through a normalcause-and-effect mechanism in the narrow, determinist sense which “throws off ”synchronicities the way radium throws off radiation. There are occasions inwhich synchronicities seem to multiply; it is not known whether this is theresult of conscious observation (in which naturally occurring synchronicitiesnormally ignored are singled out for study, and thus seem to be multiplying) orof some other factor.While the entire Jungian theory of synchronicity is based on its acausality, arethere circumstances that are more conducive to synchronicity than others?Synchronicity is a connecting principle, connecting events that are otherwisenot related by cause-and-effect, and it involves meaning. Meaning, as we haveseen, is the bedrock of consciousness.As Pauli pointed out above, synchronicity seems to accompany the transition froman unstable state of consciousness to a stable one. Perhaps, then, theappearance of synchronicity is an indication that an unstable state in theunconscious mind is reaching stability in full consciousness. This is in accordwith Jung, who gives the phenomenon of synchronicity a grounding in thearchetypes, those structures in the unconscious mind that are sources of psychicenergy and which manifest themselves in dreams, visions, and art. It is thesearch for meaning in these phenomena that has given rise to religion andphilosophy, reaching a kind of apotheosis in alchemy, which celebrated the imageas repository of meaning—something which the surrealists understood at once.Jung drew a strong comparison between ESP and synchronicity in his one publishedessay on synchronicity, because both phenomena seemed to violate the laws ofclassical physics in the same way: they ignore the limitations of space andtime. The experiments in remote viewing, therefore, would be related—in Jung’sview—to the phenomenon of synchronicity. One of the remarkable facts aboutpsychic phenomena that attracted Jung’s attention was the degree to whichenthusiasm or strong emotional excitement affected the results of ESP testsconducted under laboratory conditions: the results were actually better if thesubjects were enthusiastic about ESP, believed in ESP, or were otherwiseemotionally stimulated by the testing procedure. Famous psychics, when presentedwith the sterile laboratory environment, often tested badly. The English trancemedium Eileen J. Garrett attributed her own poor performance to the fact that“she was unable to summon up any feeling.”60 This close association of feelingand paranormal abilities (on the one hand) and feeling and synchronicity (on theother) would have been familiar to Renaissance magicians like Bruno, whoconsidered such feelings an aspect of “eros.” Given a workable set ofcorrespondences—i.e., the magical “links” determined by the structure of the“Matrix” (to use Swann’s terminology)—and sufficient “eros” in whatever form,the magician would be able to cause paranormal phenomena to occur.In the case of Eileen Garrett, the ESP test cards used were “soulless”; shewould have had better results (in her view) with something more akin to a Tarotdeck. In other words, with images drawn from the pool of archetypes in thecollective unconscious: the spring of synchronicity as well as of paranormalabilities.We may recall the presentation of Penrose and Hameroff to the RAND Corporation,during which they said that the “heightened experience” was conducive toachieving the quantum state in the human brain. Psychology, medicine, andphysics seem to agree with the Renaissance sorcerers in this regard.Jung ends his 1973 monograph on synchronicity with the following sentiments:Synchronicity is no more baffling or mysterious than the discontinuities ofphysics. It is only the ingrained belief in the sovereign power of causalitythat creates intellectual difficulties and makes it appear unthinkable thatcauseless events exist or could ever occur. But if they do, then we must regardthem as creative acts, as the continuous creation of a pattern that exists fromall eternity, repeats itself sporadically, and is not derivable from any knownantecedents.… For these reasons it seems to me necessary to introduce, alongsidespace, time, and causality, a category which not only enables us to understandsynchronistic phenomena as a special class of natural events, but also takes thecontingent partly as a universal factor existing from all eternity, and partlyas the sum of countless individual acts of creation occurring in time. (emphasisin original)61Creative acts. A pattern, like Swann’s “Matrix,” that exists from all eternity.The sum of countless individual acts of creation. The creative acts not only ofart and music and literature in the normal sense of creation but also thecreative acts of politicians, generals, bishops, and popes. The creative act ofritual magic, the shamanistic séance, the Nuremberg rally, the assassination ofa president, the coronation of a king.History, then, can be understood as a function of the operation of thisprinciple in a higher sense as surely as—in a grosser sense—the cause-and-effectmechanism of Newtonian physics is a useful way of looking at wars and electionsand assassinations: accumulations of dates and places and names that arequantifiable and identifiable, like the chemical formulae we learn in highschool science classes. In this “higher sense,” historical events are linked subrosa or sub mensa by connections and “correspondences” that only come to ourattention as intriguing little coincidences or ironic commentaries, the stuff of“deep politics,” not admissible as evidence in a court of law but nonethelessdemonstrating motive in a more profound way: the motive of another, occultparticipant in the crime; for the pattern of connections understood by Pauli,when acted upon by Arthur Young’s “quantum of action,” can produce effects inunforeseen ways and lead us back to “first causes” we would never have expected.To students of Renaissance magician Giordano Bruno, such as the late ProfessorIoan Culianu, the links between persons, objects, and events can be activatedthrough “eros.” As Aleister Crowley would say, centuries after Bruno, “Love isthe law, love under Will.” Will is Arthur Young’s “quantum of action,” and“love” or “eros” is the energy expended by that Will. Will may be thought of asintention, an intellectual decision made by a human being to effect some change;love or eros is the power of that intention when linked to the object of thewill. If the energy is powerful enough, and the link substantial enough, thenchange can be effected at a distance, instantaneously and with no loss ofenergy.This idea of unmediated change at a distance is central to the idea ofoccultism, but anathema to most modern models of science beginning with Newton,though Newton himself was a practicing astrologer and occultist. In the kind ofphysics one learns in school, objects must act upon each other to effect change.A billiard ball must strike another billiard bill, or a gust of wind toss driedleaves along the ground, or radio waves be picked up by an antenna and modulatedinto sound. In other words, all change is mediated locally. The idea of a kindof mental ray that emanates from our brain or our eyes and charges across spacein an instant to move a solid object, or “see” events at a distance, is thestuff of comic books and science fiction; yet that is just what the moderntheories of quantum consciousness suggest might be possible.To Jung, the link that exists between these events is entirely psychological;i.e., there is no physical basis for the link, otherwise we are back at thecause-and-effect Newtonian school of physics, and synchronicity operates outsidethose parameters. The links are connections of meaning, and it is still doubtfulwhether physics can demonstrate a scientific basis for meaning. However, canconsciousness act upon matter and change it?Of course, every time we make a conscious decision to do something—to lift abook or throw a ball—we are demonstrating the action of consciousness uponmatter. A traditional scientist could disagree, however, by saying that acomplex series of physical actions involving human musculature and the firing ofneurons in the nervous system is what “caused” the book to be lifted or the ballto be thrown. To Arthur Young, the decision to lift the book or throw the ballis a demonstration of another type of law, but just how “physical” isdecision-making? Is it the result of an eventually-predictable set of naturalsteps in a linear chain of cause and effect? If so, then human beings have nowill and cannot be judged for their actions. This was the problem facing ArthurYoung, and it contributes to the discussion about synchronicity.Manson’s situation is, however, infinitely worse. From the very beginning, hisexperiences seemed to inform him that what we all secretly know about ourexistential condition might very well be wrong!—R.C. Scharff, “Understanding Charles Manson,” in The Manson Murders: APhilosophical Inquiry (emphasis in original)62The issues of good luck versus bad luck are familiar to the general public, butthese matters scientists consider to be sheer chimeras of superstition, withoutany basis in reality. The Communists, of course, considered luck—and all itsancillary charms, talismans, potions, spells—to be part of the opiate of thepeople for the very same reason: it was unscientific, and adoption of practiceslike these only enslaved the people and kept them from participating in the realpower of the oligarchy, where it was believed luck (good or bad) did not exist.Likewise, any belief in miracles and psychic healing, etc. was derided in favorof confidence in the science of medicine. If only everyone abandoned these sillybeliefs and instead adopted a purely scientific outlook with its faith in themiracles of modern medicine, then everyone would bebetter off.Except that people still die in hospital beds. People are still hit by cars,drown at sea, and have jetliners crash into their office buildings. Whilescience can account for how so much evil happens in the world, it cannot offerany reason why. It has abandoned that aspect of chemical and physical reactionsto the moralists, but at the same time it has cut the moralists off at the kneeswith its insistence that everything that happens in the universe happens as aresult of mechanistic laws. Thus, the people—for whom their own individual livesare perhaps more important than the big picture of scientific advancement andstatistical probabilities of survival—fall back upon charms, talismans, prayers,shamans, psychic healing and all the rest. While science insists that none ofthis works, it is incapable of ensuring any individual that he or she will notbe stricken by disease, or die as the result of a car accident, a terroriststrike, a falling brick.These things are the result of a confluence of events in the Matrix, and theperson who is victimized by them is occupying a particular spot—not only inspace and time but also in another dimension, the quantum dimension perhapswhere considerations of space and time are not so ironclad as they are in theperceivable world—where the scarlet threads of murder, sickness, and naturaldisaster may run through him and annihilate him. The use of charms, talismans,prayers, etc. is intended to readjust an individual’s position in the Matrix sothat these threads do not strangle him; this conscious focus on avoiding painand misery may cause neural firings affecting the quantum level, where themicrotubules make minute adjustments to the parameters of time and space, andthe individual narrowly misses being beaten, eaten, or otherwise incapacitatedin an event we refer to as “coincidence.”Science is also unable to explain the basis for the profound sense of loss wecan feel at the death of a loved one; or the guilt in recognizing the evil ofour own past actions. These are the emotions, after all, that prompt thesurvivors to pick up a gun or blow up a bus. Psychology (surely an inferiorscience by any method of calculation) only admits that these feelings exist, andthat one must come to terms with them … but these are ideas that are the productofa worldview that has been formed by scientific thought, which is, itself, weakon questions of moral responsibility and spirituality. The idea that negativefeelings should be exorcised—by psychotherapy or drugs—is the mechanisticscientific worldview taken to its logical conclusion. As R.D. Laing and othershave pointed out, it may be wrong to consider anti-social behavior (such as thatof the schizophrenic) as something that must be suppressed with anti-psychoticdrugs and leather restraints. There may be another dimension to the humanexperience—to consciousness—that science does not understand, because it refusesto acknowledge that there is any importance to events outside the parameters ofits measurements. It is, once again, the case of the drunk looking for his keysunder a streetlight because the light is better there. The keys are in thedarkness. And in the darkness is superstition, mysticism, art, music, madness,and death.

Gabriele Amorth, Chief Exorcist of Rome2As we have seen, not only do private intelligence agents haunt America, but theentire secret history of the nation is replete with covert action by a varietyof individuals and official and quasi-official government organizations thathave penetrated not only domestic political parties, terrorist groups,revolutionary cabals, and cults, but have also penetrated the inner senses ofthe human mind. Like the ghost-story spooks of children’s fairy tales, they haveinvaded our dreams, our waking thoughts, and our sleeping unconscious to anextent no one would have believed possible one hundred years ago, using avariety of techniques: from the hypnosis and automatic writing of theshell-shock therapists and surrealist artists of the first half of the twentiethcentury, to the drugs, psychic driving, psychological warfare, and remoteviewing of the last half, governments have been intent on delving into thepowers—and understanding the weaknesses—of the human mind. But by limiting ourcollective attention to questions of the mind only, we have ignored what may bea larger issue, a more dangerous threat; when we use the word “mind” we aremaking a value judgment where psychological, parapsychological, and paraphysicalphenomena are concerned. We have successfully robbed “mind” of spirit. That mayhave been a mistake.While medical men like Dr. Cameron hammered at the neurological functions of thehuman brain with drugs and sensory deprivation in an effort to erase memory andrecreate personality from the ground up, other scientists and intelligenceofficers approached the mind directly through the manipulation of images. Inthis, they were following in the footsteps of the ancient Greek philosophers,who understood that phantasms were the only means through which the real worldwas perceivable to the soul. The Greek word from which we get“fantasy”—fantasia—is translated as “imagination, the power by which an objectis presented to the mind (the object presented being fantasma),”3 and was commonusage in the age of Plato and Aristotle. It represents a surprisingly prescientunderstanding of how the brain “sees”: an object is presented to the brain as aphantom, as an image. In other words, there is an intermediate step between theperception of an object and its appearance in the brain: the image. The ancientGreeks understood this and, later, the Renaissance philosopher-magicians whorealized that in this image-making faculty of the brain there resides greatpower, for the brain relies on images exclusively, and treats everything it“sees”—trees, sky, people, artifacts—as images. It is not dissuasive that theimages thus perceived also bring with them sounds, and smells, and tactilesensations. These are all part of the complex “image” created by the brain inorder to contemplate “reality.” To the Renaissance magician, this entireconstruct could be fabricated in order to cause change to occur in the world:focus on the image itself, on the “technology” of the image, and one couldobtain tremendous power, for the language of the brain is image. Image isreality, and reality is nothing more than one long propaganda film.When one speaks or writes of “mind control,” a presumption is often made thatone is a conspiracy theorist reveling in the most outlandish tales of sinistergovernment plots to brainwash the masses. Unfortunately, the historical recordis clear. Intelligence organs—including those of the military—have been involvedin precisely that sort of research in many countries for at least the past sixtyyears, if not longer. What has been generally ignored in the books and paperspublished thus far on the subject is the extent to which real knowledge aboutthe functions and processes of human consciousness has been obtained in thismanner; what has also been ignored is the blowback from these programs.Scientists were not allowed to publish the most exciting results of theirresearch, as they came under security classification. Men like Hal Puthoff andRussell Targ, Ewen Cameron and Frank Olson and William Sargant were prohibitedfrom sharing their work with their peers. Always listening was the enemy—theSoviet Union and the People’s Republic of China, countries devoted to atheismand credited with the first applications of what would become known as“brainwashing,” itself a spiritual technology stripped of its religious context.Most writings on the technology of the religious experience—whether it be yoga,or meditation, or shamanistic ritual, or the taking of peyote or magicmushrooms—stress the dangers of unguided spiritual “experimentation.” In thedays most of these texts were written, there was no science of psychology, nopractice of neurology or understanding of neuropathy. Madness was oftenconsidered in purely theological terms. Even so, the warnings were explicit:disaster would be the outcome of any attempt to reach nirvana through crude,artificial means, or without the guidance of an experienced guru, or by anunclean and untrained ascetic. In the case of government investigation of theparanormal, and of the human mind, none of these precautions were heeded.Psychiatrists like Ewen Cameron ran roughshod over their patients’ psyches,doing permanent damage to the consciousness of innocents. Bureaucrats likeSidney Gottlieb authorized government expenditures for covert research that wasresponsible for massively dosing prisoners, psychopaths, and children withhallucinogens and other drugs … human beings whose identities are no longerknown to us or to anyone. Alive? Or dead? Serial killers … or ghosts?Others have died in the attempt to discover the truth about reality, truth thatwas protected by men in white jackets or blue uniforms or grey flannel suits.Captain Mantell, Morris Jessup, James McDonald … all died in pursuit of thattruth, the first man in actual pursuit of a UFO, and the last two suicides fromthe stress and humiliation that dogs every genuine researcher into thisextremely sensitive subject.These are the hungry ghosts that haunt America. These, and so many others. As wehave seen in various statements by a wide range of experts, it has becomeincreasingly difficult to separate an intelligence operation from the operationof another force in the world: two phenomena, both secret and “occult,” linkedby a common thread of coincidence and synchronicity. Where did this “other”force come from? How do we cope with its effects? How do we exorcise the hungryghosts of America? As frivolous as these questions may seem to a traditionalhistorian, they actually go to the heart of what it means to be human, and aswell to the heart of what we have come to call “reality.” Questions of good andevil, life after death, punishment and revenge, God and demons … for all ofthese ideas, which are central to the life of every human being, we normallyrely upon priests or ministers or other religious leaders, or, if we areatheists, upon philosophers, artists and even scientists. It would never occurto us to question history itself, which we see largely as a stage on which theseideas are played out in a kind of cosmic drama, the end of which we cannotpredict but which we hope will mean that the guilty will be punished and thesufferings of the innocent redeemed; but the answers to our perpetual questionsabout life and existence may be encoded in our history—not the “Disneyland”version, to use Jim Hougan’s phrase for the type of canned history one is taughtin schools and universities, but—our secret history, our forgotten history forwhich our classical, schoolroom-style history is but the outward sign andsymbol.The historical model I am proposing in these volumes should be obvious by now.By tracing the darker elements of the American experience from the earliest daysof the Adena and Hopewell cultures through the discovery by Columbus, theEnglish settlers in Massachusetts and the Salem witchcraft episode, the rise ofJoseph Smith, Jr. and the Mormons via ceremonial magic and Freemasonry, up tothe twentieth century and the support of Nazism by American financiers andpoliticians before, during, and after World War II, and the UFO phenomenoncoming on the heels of that war, we can see the outlines of a kind of politicalectoplasm taking shape in this historical séance: politics as a continuation ofreligion by other means. The ancillary events of the Charles Manson murders, theserial killer phenomenon, Jonestown, and the assassinations of Jack Kennedy,Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Marilyn Monroe are all the result of thedemonic possession of the American psyche, like the obscenities spat out bylittle Regan, tied to her bed and shrieking at the exorcists. It is said thatdemonic possession is both a way of testing us, and of making us aware of thereal conflict taking place within us every day.The fact that so many American men and women in positions of power and authorityhave been specifically involved with occult practices is something that not evenI had anticipated before I began the research for this work. Initially, Itreated the one or two politicians who “dabbled” as a kind of anomaly; myoriginal focus had been the unhealthy, almost incestuous relationship betweenChurch and State, in America specifically and in the world in general: religiousbeliefs as the motivation for dangerous policy decisions and strategic maneuvers(such as Ronald Reagan’s apocalyptic Christianity, and Nancy Reagan’s devotionto agenda by astrology, and George W. Bush’s devotion to evangelicalChristianity). The more I looked, however, the more I found men with bizarrebeliefs and involved in questionable, occult practices at the highest levels ofthe American government, and buried deep within government agencies. I alsodiscovered that occultism was embraced by the American military and intelligenceestablishments as a weapon to be used in the Cold War; and as they did so, theyunleashed forces upon the American populace that cannot be called back.Those that were not involved in occultism per se were involved with Nazism inone form or another, and thus were aiding and abetting not only an enemy ofAmerica and an enemy of humanity in general, but what was most certainly and byany definition a cult: the most powerful and most dangerous cult the modernworld has seen so far. The moral imbecility of those engaging these men asscientists, spies, and agents of American foreign policy—and then defending themagainst those who begged for justice, hiding them on American soil—is beyondcomprehension. The guilty include the Dulles brothers, Walkers and Bushes, HenryFord, Richard Nixon, and so many other household names in American politics. Wecan try to make excuses for them, try to rationalize away their actions in thelight of realpolitik, but then we become as bad as the Germans who claimed theywere only following orders.Watergate revealed the existence of “sinister forces” to me in many ways. Thescandal opened the floodgates of conspiracy theories going back to the Kennedyassassination and beyond. It tied together so many loose ends, yet posited morequestions than it offered answers, revealing a secret political struggle thathad been going on for decades, ripping apart the very fabric of America with apopulace oblivious to it all. One inevitably was forced back to the CIA and themind-control experiments that began in the late 1940s and extended nearly to thepresent day. Coincidence piled on coincidence, indicating the existence of apowerful, subliminal force working at the level of chaos—at the quantumlevel—and struggling to manifest itself in our reality, our consciousness, ourpolitical agenda. This dynamic was uncovered by a Swiss psychologist and anAustrian physicist, but it capably describes a force working within the contextof American history and American politics that is suppurating below theconsciousness of the people but able to erupt without notice. A sinisterforce. Fascism.When the science editor of Time magazine—Leon Jaroff—became aware of theremote-viewing experiments taking place at SRI under Puthoff and Targ, he wasalarmed. To Jaroff, the paranormal research at SRI was akin to the occultismthat, in his view, gave rise to fascism in Germany, and he felt that theirresearch should be destroyed. 4Theodore Adorno (1903-69), the German philosopherwhose “F-scale” or “fascism scale” became a controversial subject inpsychological circles after his expulsion from Germany in 1934, attacked the“irrational” for the very same reason: his belief that the irrational (toAdorno, everything from astrology to occultism) in mass culture inevitably leadsto fascism.5 One is almost forced to ask the obvious question, the one not askedin polite company: does the “irrational” include religion? Of course, it does,but science prefers religion to be a vehicle for instruction in ethical culture,and not supernaturalism; yet it is humanity’s confrontation with thesupernatural that lead to the development of religion and, eventually, ethicsand moral values.Therefore, it is perhaps not the belief in the irrational that leads to fascism,however, but the marginalization of the irrational that does so, for itencourages a parallel belief in conspiracy. Since people in general have directexperience of the paranormal in their lives—from events as trivial ascoincidence to as traumatic as poltergeist activity, incidents of ESP, UFOsightings, or even remote-viewing—to find their experience ridiculed by theestablished authority is insupportable. They confront this “disconnect” comingto them from authority, and thus begin to question authority—its wisdom, or itsmotives—itself. They become prey to those who would encourage their “irrational”beliefs and point an accusing finger at the very authorities—scientific orpolitical—who would deny them the secret power or arcane knowledge they couldotherwise possess. The debasement of the paranormal in culture only serves toincrease its value among the population, who treasure their unusual experiencesin secret, and who build up entire cosmologies around them, since they have noother context in which to understand what they know to have occurred. Thus, forme, fascism is the result not of irrational beliefs but of the monopolization ofthose beliefs by others: men and women who exploit the divide between the directexperience of the masses and the intellectualist denial of their experiences bya privileged, powerful elite.The shaman in primitive cultures is a person who has managed to integrate theirrational into his own personality and, by extension, into the life of hissociety. His act of personal self-transcendence—to use Koestler’s terminology—isan act of social integration which also successfully integrates the irrationalinto the life of society through his social role as healer, therapist, and seer.The serial killer is a shaman who has not managed to integrate the irrationalwith the life of his society, as society no longer has a place for it or acontext within which to understand what is happening to him. The irrational inmodern society is consigned to the dustheap of psychoanalysis, if not of historyitself. The same is true of the fascist.The fascist embraces the irrational because it is transcendental, and thefascist yearns to transcend his natural state, to become more than human, tobecome—as Hitler said—a “new man.” Since the fascist becomes the only politicalperson who tolerates the irrational, he becomes the figurehead of the people whohave encountered the irrational in their own lives. The fascist is a shaman whohas not managed to integrate the irrational in his own life, but who still needsthe approval and support—and, if possible, the adulation—of society in order toact out his fantasies. The serial killer differs only in that he has no need ofsociety’s approval: he gave that up a long time ago, and regards society withhatred and suspicion. The fascist and the serial killer share this in common:they both feel a tremendous need for self-transcendence but fail to integratethe irrational needs and experiences of their psyches with either themselves(the fascist) or with society (the serial killer). The successful shaman hasdone both: he has interiorized the essential conflicts of the irrationalexperience in the “rational” world, and has also integrated both the elements ofhis own personality as well as his own personality (with all of its irrationalexperiences) with society in general. However, had society in general notwelcomed his achievements, there is every possibility that he would have becomea social pariah and, from there, a dangerous individual, fueled by the dangerouscomponent of shamanism: sexuality.Our society has no place for the shaman, so we marginalize both him and hisexperiences. The shaman comes back, then, to haunt us in other ways: either asthe iconic serial killer or as the dreary fascist. Both are evil, either evil“in and of themselves” to borrow the clanking terminology of theexistentialists, or as channels for an evil force that is older than history,but of whose machinations history is the unhappy result.THE ORIGINS OF EVILMyth is a two-way mirror in which ritual and philosophy may regard one another.It is the moment when people normally caught up in everyday banalities aresuddenly (perhaps because of some personal upheaval) confronted with problemsthat they have hitherto left to the bickerings of the philosophers; and it isthe moment when philosophers, too, come to terms with the darker,flesh-and-blood aspects of their abstract inquiries.—Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty6The problem of evil is one that has bothered theologians and philosophers forthousands of years. The problem can be expressed simply: Why does God permitevil to exist in the world? If God is all-powerful, then God must be permittingevil to exist; if so, then God is evil, or blind to the sufferings caused byevil (which cannot be so, because one of the definitions of God is that he/sheis all-powerful and all-knowing). The only logical conclusions to draw are thateither God is not all-powerful, or not all-knowing, or … that God is evil.This problem did not exist in ancient times, when there were a multiplicity ofgods all in conflict with each other. Human beings would cast their lot with oneside or the other; the opposing side was the enemy, but not necessarily evil inthe moral sense. The disasters that befell human beings—sickness, death, famine,drought, etc.—were caused by demons, the foot-soldiers of the “bad” gods. Onecould appease them, or exorcise them.As the pantheism of our ancestors became the monotheism of the Jews, Christiansand Muslims, God became One: the Creator and the Redeemer, the Preserver and theDestroyer. Yet, somehow God was “all good.” The Christian New Testament offeredus a God who was loving and merciful, holding out expectations of reward in anafterlife (obviously, it would have to be an afterlife; the good and theinnocent are cannon-fodder in this world). The God of the monotheists demandsloyalty above all else. He will test that loyalty with severe trials, such asexperienced by Job in the Old Testament, when Satan persuaded God to let himpush Job to the limit with every imaginable suffering: essentially laying awager with God that Job would give up His worship and turn apostate. Somehowthat scenario became the operative one in the monotheistic cults: evil existedbecause it was God’s way of testing our loyalty to Him.Of course, that gave rise to a host of other logical inconsistencies. If God is,indeed, all-knowing, then God would have known in advance how Job would havereacted. There would have been no need of any test, not for Job and not for therest of us. Why, then, are we tested?We are then given the argument that God is demonstrating that we have free will,and can choose to be loyal to Him or not. Again, that begs the question. If Godis all-knowing, then He already knows what choices we will make. And so on.Another argument, and one that has never garnered much support, is that what weconsider to be evil—pain, suffering, death—is not evil at all. It is only ourperception of these things that makes them evil. “It’s all good.” Unfortunately,we can easily think of dozens of cases where that argument is unacceptable: thesuffering of children, for instance—beings so small and vulnerable that theirsuffering cannot be the result of any choice they have made. The Asians,confronted with this obvious fact, came back with the elegant concept ofreincarnation. Thus, an infant who suffers in this life is paying for a sincommitted in a previous incarnation. This also provides the satisfying corollarythat there is a continuity of identity of some kind after death and through along succession of rebirths. There have even been fully documented cases ofsmall children spontaneously exhibiting knowledge of other lives in other placesthat they could not have garnered in their short lives but must have“remembered” from a previous existence (e.g. in Twenty Cases Suggestive ofReincarnation). The fact that many of these cases take place in countries andamid cultures where reincarnation is an accepted phenomenon may skew thestatistics in an unsatisfactory way, and raises the suggestion that theseexperiences may be the result of some other kind of paranormal event, such astelepathy.Reincarnation (with its concomitant ideal of karma, the burden of one’sactions—good and bad—that one carries from lifetime to lifetime) is an elegantsolution, but—like the heaven and hell of the monotheists—it admits of no realproof beyond the anecdotal. If evil is not the result of a linear chain of causeand effect—a chain over which we have control—then where did it come from? Whatis its purpose? Whom does it serve? And why does God not protect us from it?The answers to these questions may not be palatable. They bring us to amythology that is at once quite old and at the same time the stuff of sciencefiction and fantasy. It is as much part of the ancient Sanskrit texts as it isof the Middle Eastern Gnostic documents. It is also a recurring theme in UFOlore as well as in pulp fiction. Because it comes up so often in the humanpsyche, it is worth examining here, even as it has been abandoned as a workablehypothesis by the monotheists who have given us thousands of years of refinementand civilization, art and music and literature … and Inquisitions, Crusades,Holy wars, and genocide. It is an explanation for the schizophrenia thatcharacterizes the human experience.Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty—a colleague of the slain Ioan Culianu at the Universityof Chicago—has studied the problem of evil as it appears in Hinduism, one ofhumanity’s oldest religions, based on one of its oldest languages: Sanskrit, alanguage so ancient and so complex that even today it is extremely difficult togive satisfactory translations of Sanskrit texts (as the ongoing and stilluncompleted project to create a comprehensive Sanskrit dictionary has shown).What she has to say about Hindu concepts of evil is universal in application,and has resonance with early Christian and gnostic belief systems, as well aswith mythologies as remote from each other as the Aztec and the Daoist. Shewrites,The belief that the gods create evil for man in order that man should depend onthe gods—and the priests—recurs in Sanskrit texts. The gods find evil necessaryfor their very existence; they allow the demons to thrive in order that theythemselves may thrive as gods, to force men to worship them.7This is, of course, an exceedingly cynical appraisal of the problem, but onethat is familiar to students of Hinduism. It depicts the gods as venal entitieswho desire worship and sacrifice, and use men—and their fear of demons—the waygovernments use their populations. If it is true that “the organizing principleof nations is war” then it is equally true of the cosmos, according to thisview.The one invariable characteristic of the gods is that they are the enemies ofthe demons, and the one invariable characteristic of the demons is that they areopposed to the gods. For this reason, when the later myths began to apply newmoral codes to the characters of individual gods and demons in myths, a numberof inconsistencies arise, for the two groups, as groups, are not fundamentallymorally opposed. (emphasis in original) 8This important point speaks to the problem we face in dealing with spiritualevil. Although gods and demons are at war with each other and—as Wendy DonigerO’Flaherty says elsewhere—“mankind is caught in the crossfire,”9 there is nomoral difference between the two. Each is equally good or equally bad, dependingon whose propaganda you believe. It also posits an ongoing struggle forsupremacy between the two groups, something that would be familiar to anyone whohas studied Manichaeism and Gnostic dualism, which considers humanity thebattleground between the opposing forces of light and darkness. Yet, even thisconcept is “reductionist”:… in most Hindu texts, even when life is clearly desired and death feared, deathis not the key to the struggle between gods and demons. For although they fightfor the elixir of immortality, and the gods are said to win it ultimately, godsand demons are equally mortal and equally murderous to mankind. Finally, thoughthe gods and demons are sometimes identified with light and darkness, these aremerely symbolic expressions of contrast rather than true opposition.10“Equally murderous to mankind.” A sobering thought, and one which themonotheists reject, even as their texts are replete with instances of an angryGod destroying entire cities in his wrath. The monotheists struggle to explainwhy God would take vengeance on living beings in one instant, but threateneternal punishment for evildoers in hell after death in the next. Which is it?Punishment here and now, or punishment later? Or both? If we understand theexistence of evil in the context of a war between opposing “gods” then evilbecomes, in a sense, more palatable. The innocent always suffer in a war;civilian targets and “collateral damage” are inevitable. If we, as human beings,can assist one side or the other in this conflict and thereby ensure that oneside wins, then evil—as we understand it, as the “collateral damage” of theconflict—should come to an end. This is not as sophisticated an approach as thatof, say, Thomas Aquinas or St. Augustine, but it has the advantage of beinglogical and clear, and of not requiring the mental gymnastics necessary to placeevil within a framework of the divine testing of free will and human choice.But if the gods and demons—merely opponents in a cosmic war, after all—are incombat with each other, and if humanity has become a kind of spiritualbattlefield, then where did the gods and demons come from in the first place,and why is humanity “caught in the crossfire”?The belief is often expressed that the demons were not only the equals of thegods but their superiors—the older brothers, the original gods from whom thegods stole the throne of heaven.11This, of course, is pure Lovecraft. It is also purely Sumerian, which isprobably the most ancient of all recorded religious cultures. The idea thatthere once existed an ancient race of gods that was overthrown by another groupof deities goes back to the Sumerian creation epics. It is even reflected in theTalmudic idea of the nephilim. It is resurgent in the gothic horror of H.P.Lovecraft, and it makes an appearance in some of the theories of alien abductionand the Erich von Danniken “chariots of the gods” books. It is such a common anduniversal theme, that it is amazing the monotheistic religions have not managedto incorporate it into their theologies in such a way that this is no longer acontroversial issue; instead it is a persistent “rumor” in literary circles aswell as in alternative spiritual beliefs.The identity of a class of Hindu gods known as the asuras has been the subjectof a great deal of controversy in this regard. They are among the oldest ofspiritual forces recognized in the Sanskrit literature, and even the name asurais quite controversial itself. Religious historian Wash Edward Hale (recipientof a Ph.D. in Comparative Religion from Harvard University’s Divinity School in1980) has written an entire book on the subject, demonstrating how little weactually know about the origins of Sanskrit terminology.12Asura has been linkedetymologically to everything from the Zoroastrian god Ahura Mazda to ahypothetical Assyrian cult; the term asura itself seems to mean “lord,” on thatthere is no disagreement, and has been applied to both humans and gods. With thepassage of time, however, it seems that these beings were devalued in comparisonwith the devas who were considered the “good” gods, the asuras gradually takingon the characteristics of demons.Professor of Comparative Religion at the University of Manchester, Trevor O.Ling has made a study of evil in Buddhist thought, and begins with an overviewof the Hindu beliefs from which Buddhism developed. What he has to say about theasuras is relevant to our theme:According to the Udana and the Anguttara Nikaya they are said to beocean-dwellers, together with various sea-monsters, nagas and gandhabbas. On theother hand they are said in the Samyutta and Anguttara Nikayas to be dwellers ina city. (emphasis in original)13This idea of the asuras as ocean-dwellers as well as dwellers in a city, andtheir association with sea monsters is, of course, pure Lovecraft. His “Cthulhu”is a type of sea monster who “lies dead, but dreaming” in a lost city at thebottom of the abyss, but who is worshipped in secret by strange cults who dreamof the day when his rulership will be reinstated on earth.This concept appears also in the Sumerian creation cycles in which the ancientgoddess of the abyss Tiamat—who reappears in the Biblical Hebrew term tehom fora kind of sea monster—is slain by a race of younger gods, children of Tiamat,who create the known world from her body ripped asunder, and from her blood andtheir own breath, the young gods create human beings. This is an ancient story,which nonetheless is echoed in Arthur Koestler’s idea of the two human brains,one reptilian and ancient and one newer and more intellectual and calculating:humans partaking of the characteristics of both “gods.”In Biblical times, the existence of this sea-monster/demon was recognized in theterm Leviathan, and the existence of a cult that worshipped Leviathan:Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to rouse Leviathan. (Job,iii:8)And:In that day the Lord will punish with his sword, his fierce, great and powerfulsword, Leviathan the gliding serpent, Leviathan the coiling serpent, he willslay the monster of the sea. (Isaiah, xxvii:1)Certainly a strange preoccupation for a tribe who lived in the desert lands ofPalestine; it is possibly a survival of Babylonian mythology, although some(such as William Smith in Smith’s Bible Dictionary) have claimed that theLeviathan mentioned in the Bible is either a whale or a crocodile, and sometranslations of the Hebrew have used “dragon” in place of “monster” or“Leviathan.”Buddhism differs from Hinduism in several important respects, but germane to ourstudy is its concept of evil. In Buddhism, evil is personified as Mara, a god(or demon) of death and evil. It is Mara’s project to tempt the Buddha away fromhis meditations. Buddha, however, conquered Mara and at the same time conquereddeath itself.14 In this, perhaps, he is a precursor to the Jesus who alsoconquered death, albeit in a different fashion. In Buddhism, we have a singlepowerful god-man, the Buddha, in conflict with a single, powerful demon, Mara.Buddha becomes superhuman during his life; Jesus—according to the predominanttheology of the twenty-first century—was born a God, although there wereheresies that insisted that Jesus became God while on earth.But Mara shares a great deal in common with the Christian Satan, for Mara is anadversary and represents the created world, Samsara, the world of illusion andMaya,15 just as Satan is said to be “Lord of this world” and is capable oftaking Jesus to the mountaintop and offering him everything in sight if only hewill fall down and worship the demon. Indeed, it has been alleged in variousplaces that Buddhism—which began in India during the sixth century B.c.—came toinfluence Christianity through Buddhist missionaries that were said to havetraveled as far as Palestine by the first century A.d. Buddhism comes as closeas possible to a kind of monotheism while still retaining much of itspolytheist, Hindu roots and terminology.The danger in this approach is that one elevates evil to the level of a god, aforce balancing that of good and threatening to conquer goodness, or at the veryleast to thwart its plans. Even Aleister Crowley, no stranger to the demonic,asserted that the Devil per se does not exist, that evil had been elevated bythe ignorant to a monad equal in power to that of any God:The Devil does not exist. It is a false name invented by the Black Brothers toimply a Unity in their ignorant muddle of dispersions. A devil who had unitywould be a God.16Crowley accused those who worshipped evil (the “Black Brothers”) of havingcreated the Devil, which is quite a difference from the evidence of historicaland scriptural texts, of course, and may reflect more of Crowley’s own personalphilosophy than it does years of philological and theological study. However, asthe world progressed from wars fought with rocks, to bows and arrows, swords andshotguns, it still seemed as if evil was the stuff of smaller demons: the spentcartridge, the torched hut, the thrown spear. Then, the Bomb was dropped onHiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. It suddenly became possible to startthinking about a force of evil, something unitary and powerful beyond allprevious imagining. It suddenly began to look like there was a Devil, andweapons of mass destruction became his calling card. To concern oneself withindividual demons seemed almost quaint, missing the point.Like the Christian (and Manichaen) concept of an eternal conflict between goodand evil, Buddhism acknowledges the ongoing struggle against Mara but—again,like Christianity—also maintains that the Buddha was the first to overcome Mara,and therefore opened the road to Enlightenment for everyman. Jesus is said tohave suffered and died “for our sins” and to redeem humanity; he descended intohell after his crucifixion and then ascended into heaven after his resurrectionon earth, thus demonstrating his power over death. Thus, both Jesus and Buddhaovercame death and became immortal; whether Jesus was born superhuman or becameso during his trials in the desert and his other mortal struggles against eviland death is a purely theological issue. (Of course, one could always say thatsince the conquest of death by Jesus was foreordained, that he was certainly“born a God,” in a kind of exegetical Monday-morning quarterbacking.) And, justas demons possess the innocent in the Christian (and Jewish) traditions exploredby Oesterreich and others, so too does Mara possess innocent villagers,requiring the application of exorcisms.17Although no case can be made that the Christian mythos is merely Buddhism infancy dress, there are important similarities between Jesus’ confrontation withSatan and the Buddha’s confrontation with Mara. As Ling points out in hisanalysis of some of the literature on comparative religion which focuses onSatan and Mara,In each case the symbol came into being as the result of the experience andinsight of a great personality. In each case it appears to have reflected theexperience of critical encounter with a spiritual force which was hostile toholiness. (emphasis added) 18Of course, it is this very spiritual force thatconcerns us in this study.What is fascinating about Mara is that he is the lord of the five senses, ofphysical reality, and of consciousness as well. 19Mara is, in fact, the lord ofthe Matrix, for Mara’s domain (Maradheyya) represents—in the Pali scriptureknown as the Sutta-Nipata—an “entanglement, strongly stretched out and verydeceptive. Sometimes this is called Mara’s stream.” 20The goal of Buddhism is totranscend not only physical reality (with all its limitations, passions, andother emotions) but consciousness as well, in order to attain Nirvana. Thisentails gradually reducing one’s attachment to physical objects, then tophysical sensations, entering a state of sensory deprivation in which eventhoughts and ideas are “objects” to be avoided and one’s individualconsciousness disappears, subsumed into the collective “cosmic consciousness”that is Enlightenment. It is easy to see how attaining this state would betantamount to conquering death, for death is an event that occurs to thephysical body; in the perfect state of meditation envisaged by the Buddhists,the reliance on the body as a means of survival is abandoned. It is, perhaps,the ultimate “self-transcendence,” just as Mara represents the ultimate in“self-assertion.” Mara is, quite simply, the source of all problems, thepulsating core of evil.Trevor Ling uses the analogy of a man fighting mosquitoes; one can take measuresto fight against each individual mosquito, or one can take measures to defeatall mosquitoes. The same with a man being shot at: does he dodge each bulletindividually, or does he take measures against the man with the gun? 21Inpolytheist traditions with a multiplicity of demons, man has fought each oneindividually. With the coming of the Buddha, according to Ling, there was arevelation: namely, that the source of all demons was, in essence, one demon;the source of all ills was one Father of Sickness. It reoriented the focus ofhumanity from the day-to-day battle against hordes of individualdemons/sicknesses/cruelties/horrors to the identification of a single, monistfountain of all suffering. In the Pali Canon, this is Mara.Unfortunately, knowing this and doing something about it are two differentthings! We still have to dodge bullets, and mosquitoes, and evil people, one byone. It takes a certain type of individual—a Buddha, or a Buddha in themaking—to focus his or her attention on the source of all evil and take carefulaim. For the rest of us, there is Kevlar, and pesticides, and exorcism.The essence of the animistic attitude to life is that the ills which manexperiences are attributed to wholly external forces. These forces, conceived ashaving an existence separate from his own, he regards as hostile. They must beavoided if possible … or they may be manipulated to advantage by one whopossesses the means or the skill to do so. This last kind of response, themanipulation of hostile forces, is the one characteristic of animistic and otherforms of magic. It was in this direction that animism shaded into Brahmanism ina way that is in striking contrast to the Buddhist attitude to what are calledthe ‘low arts’. The object of the Brahmanic sacrifices was ostensibly to chainthe demons; the real object was an extension of this attitude at a more profoundlevel, namely the manipulation for men’s advantage of what were believed to becertain hidden natural forces.22We have already studied this “manipulation of hostile forces” as put intopractice by everyone from Siberian shamans to remote viewers. It is a mainstayof Hinduism today, and the practices of Hinduism which verge on the paranormalare evidence that the knowledge of the manipulation of these forces has beencultivated and preserved through thousands of years, even as the monisttraditions of Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Buddhism decry their use.The last twenty years or so has shown a marked interest in, and popularity of,the subject of Evil. There have been cultural studies of Evil, from HowardBloom’s The Lucifer Principle and Paul Oppenheimer’s Evil and the Demonic, tosociological and historical overviews such as Jeffrey Burton Russell’s TheDevil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity and ErvinStraub’s The Roots of Evil: The Origins of Genocide and Other Group Violence.Even Elaine Pagels has published The Origins of Satan, a study of how Satan cameto be identified in early Christianity. In this age of holocaust and genocide,of Kosovo and Croatia and Cambodia, nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,the subject of Evil has become fashionable again and no historian of religion isable to ignore its appeal.Howard Bloom, who trained as a scientist and then left science to run a publicrelations company for musicians such as Prince, Billy Joel, Billy Idol, BobMarley and Bette Midler (among many others), is an example of someone who (likeKoestler) has functioned in two separate worlds and has the benefit of a largerperspective. Bloom blames Evil on the necessities of evolution, and—like a firstcentury Gnostic—places the onus directly on Nature itself. Anyone who watchesthe Discovery Channel is likely to be confronted with dramatic evidence of thecruelty of Nature, of course, whether it is a hurricane, earthquake, flood orsimply one animal devouring another. Of course, Bloom’s thesis is not so narrowas that. He borrows from Koestler even as Koestler is not identified in thetext, by recapitulating Koestler’s theory of the holon, except that the holon inthis instance Bloom calls the “superorganism.”Koestler viewed everything in nature as inferior to the level above it in termsof complexity, and superior to the level below it. Essentially, what ArthurYoung described in his “arc” that led down from light to nuclear particles,atoms and then molecules and from there up through plants, animals and finallyman, Koestler was describing in terms of a hierarchy leading down from organismsat the top to sub-atomic particles at the bottom. Each level of Koestler’shierarchy is a subset of the level above it; conversely, each level of thehierarchy contains within it complex arrangements of the level (cells,molecules, atoms, etc.) below it. Koestler understood each “sub-assembly” ofthis hierarchy—whether the cells of the human heart, or the atoms that make up amolecule of water—as functioning as a “quasi-independent whole, even thoughisolated from the organism or transplanted into another organism.”23To Koestler, each of these “sub-assemblies” was “Janus-faced,” i.e., one facelooked to the level above it and was a sub-assembly of that level, and one facelooked at the level below it which contained its own sub-assemblies. ThisJanus-faced object Koestler calls a holon and emphasizes that the holon is morethan the sum of its parts (in reference to its quasi-autonomous features, butalso in consideration that a human being for example is more, obviously, thansimply a collection of its component elements).As noted, Bloom characterizes human beings as parts of what he calls a“superorganism,” 24“disposable parts of a being much larger than ourselves.”This is one of his “five ideas,” which—he writes—“illuminates a mystery that haseternally eluded man: the root of the evil that haunts our lives. For withinthese five small ideas we will pursue, there lurks a force that rules us.” 25Theother ideas include the principle of the self-organizing system (which issimilar, again, to Koestler’s concept of a “self-regulating open hierarchicorder,”26) the meme (a “self-replicating order of ideas” which is the root ofthe images and visions that provide both coherence to society and whichencourage it to go to war), the neural net or “group mind,” and the “peckingorder.”To Bloom, humanity’s contribution to the violent way of life it has inheritedfrom the apes, from Nature itself, is the “dream of peace. But to achieve thatdream he will have to overcome what nature has built into him.” 27It isinteresting that a writer with a scientific background as well as a politicalbackground (who wrote position papers for congressional candidates) and abusiness background in the media should arrive at the conclusion that evil ishard-wired in us by Nature itself, and that only by overcoming this programmingcan we achieve our “dream of peace.” This is something that no church-goingRoman Catholic would disagree with, as it is a modern explanation for what isknown in the Church as “original sin”: the dogma that every human being is bornwith the taint of sin which only a decent life of holiness can neutralize. Inother words, every person born of woman is born defective in the eyes of theChurch. Only becoming baptized into the Church and following its regulationswill free one of this defect. (It is a great marketing gimmick, of course:“What? I have original sin? Get it off me! Get it off me! What’s it going tocost?”)As mentioned, this concept was well-known to the Gnostics, that disparate groupof syncretist mystics who wielded tremendous influence in the first fewcenturies of the Christian era. By blending eastern and western, Jewish andChristian concepts into a single coherent whole, they cast a long shadow overeverything from the Dead Sea Scrolls of Qumran to the Nag Hammadi texts of Egypt… to the Cathars and Manichaeans, and eventually to modern ceremonial magic, therise of the secret societies, and the occult revival of the twentieth century.While there were many different versions of Gnostic belief, they agreed on somebasic issues. First and foremost was the idea that matter was inherently evil,and had been created by the “demiurge,” a being that opposes God and whofashioned the world from chaos, the abyss, one of whose terms is the Latinmatrix. According to some Gnostic texts, the God in the Garden of Eden whocreated Adam and Eve and warned them against eating of the Tree of Knowledge wasthe Demiurge and not the benevolent Deity; God’s presence in the Garden wasactually that of the Serpent, who pointed the way of freedom to Eve.The Gnostic texts—as well as traditional Biblical scripture—refer to the demonicrulers who assist the Demiurge as archons, a term that means “chief ” or “ruler”or “prince.” The archons are invariably evil, and represent forces that opposeGod. In this, they are virtually identical to the Hindu asuras, a Sanskrit wordwith the same meaning as archons.In Gnosticism, there are two main schools of thought concerning the true natureof evil. The “Eastern” view—which has its origins in Zoroastrianism andManichaeanism, and thus demonstrates a possible link to Aryan Hinduism—statesthat good and evil are two supreme powers struggling for control of the world,and will continue to struggle forever. The “Western” view—which has its originsin Egypt and the Middle East—defines evil as a result, rather than somethingwith an autonomous existence. This theory describes the creation of matter as aseries of emanations of light, of spirit, leading from the divine Source andbecoming grosser with each rung of descent until spirit is buried as a dim sparkwithin matter. (This is virtually identical to the way Arthur Young explainscreation.) Benjamin Walker, who writes on culture, history, and religion, hasoffered a concise introduction to this Gnostic belief:… evil is the natural consequence of the descent of the emanations, so that asthe emanations recede from the primary divine source there is a progressivediminution in their goodness and light. Again, when God withdrew his presence tomake room for the world, Satan was free to exercise his will in opposition tothe divine, as a consequence of which evil arose.… Evil is not an abstraction ora passive condition, but a positive and violent force arising from the activeoperation of Satan and his archons.28Of course, this is so similar to the Indian concept of Mara, the Lord of Evil,as the ruler of physical creation, the five senses, matter and evenconsciousness itself, that it could have been devised by a Pali scholar ratherthan a Syrian Gnostic.From India to Egypt and Palestine, evil is perceived as a force under thedirection of what can only be called politicians. “Lords,” “chiefs,” “rulers,”“magistrates,” or “princes,” archons or asuras, the implication is the same:evil is somehow under political control. Further, matter is seen as evil, theresult of an entrapment or degradation of light. Thus, we have two disciplinesin which evil is being described: one, a scientific approach, shows evil to bethe result of light “descending” and becoming matter, much like Arthur Young’sfamous diagram of the “arc”; the other, a political approach, shows that thismatter—creation itself—is under political control by a Demiurge and his team ofarchons, or “rulers.” God, in this context, was the Serpent in the Garden ofEden: a kind of rabble-rouser who urged Adam and Eve in their rebellion. “God,”as Nik Aziz said in Malaysia, may truly be “a gangster.”Evil as matter, evil as a blind force. There is no contradiction necessarybetween the two, since the discoveries of quantum physics illustrate that theheart of all matter is force.Ancient Egyptian religion was no exception to this rule of evil as blind force,and as an eternal opponent to the forces of light. Osiris and Set were brothers,Osiris representing Light and Set, Darkness. There are several versions of thestory of the murder of Osiris by Set, but it is certain that Set did, indeed,kill his brother (the first murder in Egyptian religion is fratricide, as it isin Genesis) and dismembered his body. Again, we face dismemberment in areligious or spiritual context that is far removed from the dismembermentvisions of the Siberian shamans, but which shares essential characteristics. Inboth the case of Osiris and the case of the shamans, dismemberment precedesillumination.Isis, the wife (and sister) of Osiris collects the various pieces of Osiris’body after they had been scattered throughout Egypt and the Nile by Set. Sheputs the pieces together and becomes impregnated by the momentarily reanimatedcorpse. She gives birth to Horus, the Hawk-headed God, who then goes to battlewith Set. Osiris, meanwhile, is reborn and takes his place among theconstellations of the heavens, becoming the prototype for the resurrection ofhumans. The mummification ceremonies typical of ancient Egypt were designedaround the premise that the deceased would become an “Osiris” and experiencerebirth just as the original Osiris did.The parallels with Christianity are interesting, of course. The betrayal ofOsiris by his brother, Set, is analogous to the betrayal of Jesus by Judas. Insome accounts, Set manages to convince Osiris to try out a sarcophagus which hasbeen built specifically for his size. This occurs during a party at which thefriends of Osiris and Set are in attendance. Osiris lays down in the coffin, andSet nails the cover shut, killing his brother. In the Christian account, Jesusis at a Passover seder with his disciples, and Judas leaves early to report hispresence to the Roman authorities. In both cases, there is a gathering offriends and colleagues and the betrayal of a “brother.”And in both cases, the manner of death is not a simple one. In the case ofOsiris, he is either shut up in a coffin to die a slow death of suffocation or,in the more generally accepted form, he is dismembered and the pieces of hisbody (fourteen in number) are scattered throughout Egypt. In the case of Jesus,he is first beaten and tortured, and then crucified, with nails driven into hiswrists and ankles; but even crucifixion is not enough, for his side is piercedwith a lance. In a Christian hymn, it is written, “They have pierced my handsand my feet; they have numbered all my bones,” which is about as close to adescription of dismemberment as one would wish, the total violation of the humanbody.And, of course, both Osiris and Jesus are “reborn.”The number fourteen is of interest, as well. Osiris was chopped into fourteenpieces. In every Catholic church, one will see a commemoration of the suffering,crucifixion and burial of Jesus in a series of plaques—called the Stations ofthe Cross—which are invariably fourteen in number. (Oddly, to the Chinese,fourteen is an unlucky number (not thirteen), because the pronunciation of“fourteen” in Mandarin and other dialects is a homonym for “is dead”: shi si.)In the revisionist Christianity of the secret societies, the Priory of Sion, thebooks of Baigent, Lincoln and Leigh, Jesus does not die on the cross but issecreted out of Palestine and flees to France in company with Mary Magdalen, whobears him children … a bloodline that is said to exist to this day. (Naturally,the French believe that the heirs of Christ are French, a belief that explains agreat deal!) Mary Magdalen could be seen as an analogue of Isis, of course,hiding with Jesus and becoming pregnant by him. In the exoteric Christianitywith which we are familiar, however, the Virgin Mother of Jesus isiconographically identical with images of Isis. The same blue robes covered withstars. The images of the Virgin Mother holding the Baby Jesus are identical tostatues and drawings of Isis holding the Baby Horus, son of Osiris.Either this is the result of deliberate borrowing by Christianity of Egyptianreligious concepts—which has not yet been proved beyond reasonable doubt—oranother force is at work, like Jung’s archetypes, manifesting in the unconsciousminds of various races at various times across the globe. Gnosticism comesclosest to weaving the various occult strands of Egyptian mysticism, Jewishmysticism, and Christian theology, as well as concepts from the Persian cult ofMithra and the Phrygian cult of Attis (both of which eventually became Romancults) as well as other cults of west Asia, into a coherent whole representingthe consistent features of each of these beliefs and practices, and findingcommon ground among them. Of course, in the process Gnosticism has overturnedsome traditional beliefs, as they sought the esoteric meanings behind theaccepted scriptural texts. Thus, to the Gnostics, the Creator of the OldTestament is the Demiurge and not the benevolent God represented by Jesus. Aclose reading of the Old Testament would tend to support this view: Jehovah isforever destroying cities and smashing armies, laying waste to huge tracts ofthe Middle East, sometimes for the merest of slights. He certainly seems to actin the role of a fantastically powerful demon rather than a Prince of Peace ofthe “God is Love” variety.The Gnostics were not the only ones pulling together a religion out of severaldisparate cultic elements; what we know today as modern Christianity owes muchof its character to St. Paul, a convert to the new faith who decided that thereligion would have broader appeal to the Gentiles if it incorporated some paganelements. In this, he was like a modern takeover baron, buying a small,successful corporation and changing its identity to fit a larger marketstrategy, thus stripping the original company of its character and firing itsmost loyal employees to make the new shareholders happy, at least for the firstfiscal quarter or two. St. Paul as the Gordon Gecko of Christianity? Perhaps.What happened to the original Christian message has virtually disappeared underthe heavy furniture of the Church; the cults who were the closest in mission andtheology to the early Church were dissipated throughout the Middle East and asfar as Afghanistan and, some say, Kashmir: small groups of Jewish mysticsconsidered heretics by both Jews and the new, Pauline Christians. Another branchwound up in Africa, in Ethiopia, in possession of a Gospel of St. Thomas,unaware that the New Testament canon would be decided by the emissaries ofConstantinople and that their Gospel had no place in it. It is not only modernAmerican history that has to be revisited; as we have seen, the history of theChurch is now under heavy attack from the revisionists, experts in Biblicalexegesis and analysis, archaeology and philology, who are piecing together theevents of the time of Jesus from the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Nag Hammadi texts,and new scholarship. Writers such as Elaine Pagels, Robert Eisenman, and HughSchonfield have made tremendous contributions to our understanding of thispivotal period in Western history; popularizers such as the team of Lincoln,Baigent and Leigh (Holy Blood, Holy Grail) have brought the results of thisresearch to the mainstream media. Through all of this, the Church has remainedsilent, preferring to offer no answer than to trap itself in responses that itknows will be undermined by the next discovered parchment, the next jar ofscrolls.A new approach to Jesus and to God; and, with all of this, a new approach to theidea of divinity, and a new concept of the problem of evil.Trevor Ling reminds us, in his book on the Buddhist mythology of evil, thatthere is consternation in our hearts when we confront the otherworldly. Herefers to the work of Rudolf Otto who, in his influential Idea of the Holy,argued that our experience of the divine and the demonic may be confused, afeeling he called “daemonic dread”:This daemonic dread, [Otto] claims, ‘first begins to stir in the feeling of“something uncanny,” “eerie” or “weird.” It is this feeling which, emerging inthe mind of primeval man, forms the starting point for the entire religiousdevelopment in history. “Daemons” and “gods” alike spring from this root …29In this, Otto agrees with Jungian psychoanalyst Adolf Guggenbuehl-Craig, whoidentifies the sinister with the divine:The sinister is always the unintelligible, the impressive, the numinous.Wherever something divine appears, we begin to experience fear.30And:Everything that has to do with salvation possesses … a sinister, unfamiliarcharacter … 31Even Elaine Pagels, Professor of Religion at Princeton University, was unable toavoid the implications of the experience of the paranormal for the idea of evil:“Evil, then, at its worst, seems to involve the supernatural …”32The emphasis in these writers is on the personal experience of evil as somethingof an otherworldly, paranormal or supernatural nature, evil “at its worst.”Further, it is possible to confound the experience of the divine with theexperience of the satanic, as both Otto and Guggenbuehl-Craig point out. Thesesinister forces are also numinous; the sinister may also be … divine.This is clear in the mystery religions, of course. Initiation into these cultsalways involves a preliminary period of tremendous fear and horror, the initiateblindfolded and bound, brought into the sacred precincts on the point of asword, and made to swear terrible oaths which involve—in Freemasonry, forinstance—threats of death and dismemberment should the initiate reveal anythingthat is to be shown to him. Our problem, as human beings, is that we are unableto differentiate between the divine and the demonic: our psychologicalreactions—fear the experience of the sinister, dread—are the same for both.Certainly, the stars of the Old Testament felt this way when coming face to facewith Jehovah. God is not only stern and just in the Old Testament, he ispositively homicidal. He demands absolute loyalty on the pain of death. He tellsAbraham to kill his own son, and then changes his mind a little later on. Hesubmits Job to unimaginable torment, just to win an argument with Satan. Hecomes up with circumcision as a means of identifying the Chosen People (a simpletattoo would have been nice, or an identification card). He destroys Sodom andGomorrah, tears down the walls of Jericho, floods the earth to destroy everyliving thing except whatever Noah could fit on his ark. Speaking of arks, theArk of the Covenant was so dangerous that merely to touch it was enough to causedeath, so it was paraded before the enemies of Israel, who promptly fell downwith hemorrhoids.(I Samuel, V) So, yes, our experience of the divine has been …sinister. It has been frought with danger, with threat of destruction bothphysical and spiritual. And, at the same time, we have seemed to have been pawnsin some larger game.Why did Jehovah permit the enslavement of the Jews under the Pharaoh, forinstance? Why the seven plagues of Egypt? Why didn’t Jehovah simply appear tothe Pharaoh—as he had with Moses—and tell him to let his people go? SinceJehovah was so capable of destroying entire cities on a whim, why did he allowthe Egyptian cities to survive undamaged? Why the elaborate miracle of theparting of the Red Sea, and then luring the Pharaoh’s troops into a trap,drowning them in the suddenly “unparted” waves? If we are to take these storiesat face value—and many, many do—then Jehovah was a god to be feared, yes, a godcapable of supernatural abilities, but not a god one could love. Jehovah appearsin the Old Testament as a kind of military dictator with psychic powers. How,then, to tell the difference between god and demon? When Jehovah himself iscapable of so much bloodshed, so much vast destruction, what then is evil?SEX, DRUGS AND ROCK ’N’ ROLLThe philosophers have struggled with the concept of evil only because theexistence of evil in the world seems to laugh at any pious descriptions of thenature of God. All of the religious and metaphysical texts of the worldrationalize the existence of evil: it is either God’s means of testing us (aridiculous assertion on the face of it, and especially when we confront thesuffering of children and infants), or it is the result of humanity’sabandonment of God’s laws (also ridiculous, and for the same reasons), or it isthe result of a war taking place between the forces of light and darkness(somewhat better, but substitute “light” and “darkness” for virtually any pairof opposites you like, and then degrade the image of God somewhat to that of acombatant of roughly equal powers as the Devil). What most religions agree upon,however, are the effects of that evil: murder, war, rape, sickness, humansuffering in general, and particularly that of the innocent.Evil only describes the suffering of human beings, the beings uniquely—it isbelieved—conscious of their own mortality, aware of the linear passage of time,capable of falling in love … in short, those things that depend upon a certainperspective about reality that is unique to us. Religion attempts to transcendthose basic assumptions, especially the Asian religions in which even thepassage of time is dismissed as a kind of illusion (something with which ourquantum scientists would agree). If we are able to disown fears about mortality,ignore time as the dance of Maya, and renounce the love of one person andtranslate that into love for all of humanity, and then abandon even that love,then we are able to destroy Evil. Evil comes from attachment, say the Buddhistscriptures. Dissolve all attachments, and absolute freedom is the logicalconclusion.I fear nothing; I hope for nothing.—Blaise Pascal, PenseesWhat is compelling about the shamanistic approach to spiritual freedom is thatthe very practices which the Buddhists believe tie one down to attachments onthe material plane are the same practices the shamans use to attain supernaturalpowers. Yes. Sex, drugs and … well, drumming. Tools that had been used byoccultists, artists and shamans for millenia gradually became part of theculture, and in so doing were robbed of their transcendent influence. Just asthe scientists would have us worship technology in place of religion, we findourselves using the technology of religion as entertainment. Yet, even then,there is some “redeeming social value.”Susan Sontag brought to our attention earlier the link between creativity andmadness, especially with reference to the case of French playwright AntoninArtaud. In another essay, this one on pornography, she brings to our attentionthe similarities between pornography on the one hand, and science fiction on theother.33 By doing so, she makes some very compelling points about spiritualtranscendence and the appropriateness of marketing this transcendence to themasses.Pornography is one of the branches of literature—science fiction isanother—aiming at disorientation, at psychic dislocation.34This idea of disorientation and psychic dislocation is familiar to us by nowfrom our study of Rimbaud, as well as from our treatment of shamanism andoccultism, as well as our foray into the mind-control projects of the American(and Soviet) governments. Sontag takes these ideas further in her idea thatpornography fits the criteria of psychic dislocation as easily as do the variousreligious technologies themselves. Many people will be offended by what seems tobe a defense of pornography, when what Sontag is doing is explaining its powerrather than moralizing about its role in society. Both pornography and sciencefiction depend heavily on fantastic elements which bring the reader out of thenormal, everyday world and into a sacred space of tabu. In the case of sciencefiction, the tabus are largely scientific: one bends the rules of Newtonianphysics using words instead of mathematical formulae. One is expected to suspenddisbelief, to permit one’s mind to wander outside the limits of consensusreality. Pornography operates on similar principles. It removes the experienceof sexuality from social norms, social limits, and places it in another sacredspace of tabu: one in which every conceivable type of sexual coupling and sexualact is not only permitted but encouraged. Both forms of literature excite theimagination and encourage a kind of mental daring. Both are heavily orientedtowards manipulation of the image. And, in this, they share a great deal withreligion and the technologies of the religious experience.In some respects, the use of sexual obsessions as a subject for literatureresembles the use of a literary subject whose validity far fewer people wouldcontest: religious obsessions. So compared, the familiar act of pornography’sdefinite, aggressive impact upon its readers looks somewhat different. Itscelebrated intention of sexually stimulating readers is really a species ofproselytizing. Pornography that is serious literature aims to “excite” in thesame way that books which render an extreme form of religious experience aim to“convert.”35This comparison of the influence of pornographic literature to the conversionphenomenon studied by Sargant, Lifton and others may clarify somewhat the ideabehind the sinister forces of this work’s title, for sex has always been a majorfocus of the world’s religions, and control of the sexual impulse—either throughcelibacy or strict regulations concerning matrimony, homosexuality, pedophilia,bestiality, etc.—is a hallmark of virtually every religion in the world. Eventhe curse of the serial killer is linked inextricably to sexual impulses (afterall, the serial killer was first known as a “lust killer”), and avant-gardephilosophers such as Wilhelm Reich could postulate that sexual function anddysfunction were behind everything from mental illness and physical illness tototalitarianism and even the UFO phenomenon.The virtual impossibility of regulating the sexual impulse, however, has givenrise to the tremendous degree of inconsistency and hypocrisy in our world, andthis is not only a matter of Western decadence but a problem in virtually everycorner of the globe. We have the spectacle of Catholic priests being brought totrial for sexually abusing children. We have women in Africa, as well as inPakistan and some other Muslim nations, being subjected to corporalpunishment—including, incredibly, rape—for being the victims of rape. We haveentire villages in Southeast Asia dedicated to supplying the “sex tourist,”offering children of both sexes for the pleasure of middle-aged European andAmerican travelers. All of this makes the secret practices of Hindu Tantrismseem tame and decorous by comparison, and elevates even so venal a character asAleister Crowley to the status of a true Victorian gentleman.Predictably, everything from rape to serial murder to pedophilia is blamed onaccess to pornography. In other words, and according to this theory (which isvery popular among the Christian Right), the minds of otherwise innocent men andwomen are being manipulated by images (in pornography and in mainstreamtelevision and cinema programs with violence and/or sex as the subject matter)to commit atrocious acts against individuals and society. In the East, modernWestern movies and music videos are routinely blamed for the decadence of Asianyouth. While this argument seems puerile to anyone with an ounce of common sense(from “the Devil made me do it” to “Madonna made me do it”), it does reveal anunconscious understanding of the function and power of the image, something thatis not discussed openly in any of these societies, since elites in every societywish to manipulate images in their own way and not have their agenda (andmethodology) revealed to the public at large. To open up this discussion togeneral public dialogue on the power of the image and how it is used bypolitical parties, religions, intelligence agencies, and advertising companieswould be to invoke doubt as to the relevance or justification of using anyimages. It would most certainly instigate a serious conflict over the role ofcensorship, and probably place authority for media and image manipulation rightback in the hands of governments.Pornography occupies a special place in this discussion, since it is a form ofmanipulation that is almost universally proscribed in all places yet stillenjoys a strong and resilient popularity despite its official status as anillegal, or at the very least immoral, medium. It is difficult to understand theundeniable power of pornography if it is regarded simply as another form ofliterary or artistic expression. Although it does address one of the most basicof human appetites, one has the feeling that cookbooks—which, after all, addressthe most basic human appetite—do not enjoy quite the same cachet. There isanother dimension to pornography that transcends that of all other literary andartistic forms. Even today, the number of Web sites devoted to pornographyoutstrips by far every other genre of site. Pornographic sites on the Internetactually finance the Internet and are a source of tremendous wealth for theirowners. The ease of downloading pornographic images, stories, and even entiremovies, has made the Internet the method of accessing pornography favored overretail outlets in the strip malls and on the back roads of America. PornographicWeb sites have even been used by Islamic terrorist organizations as a means ofcommunicating, by encoding information in graphics files.Sontag’s remarks on pornography vis-à-vis the expression of religioussentiments, and in comparison to science fiction, are worth recalling today. Theessay was written in 1967 in response to an erotic novella by Bataille, and itcontains virtually an entire precis of Hermetic thought as it pertains to theinitiatory process. It is an extraordinary document, and one that perhaps couldonly have been written in the Sixties. So much of what was written—indeed,discovered—in the Sixties has since been devalued in a kind of scientificbacklash, yet will one day form the core of another discipline, something akinto art and yet more like magic; or perhaps it will be magic, the Western Tantrathat Francis King thinks magic really is.Sontag’s writings of this period can be taken together with those of R.D. Laing,Michel Foucault, Wilhelm Reich, Antonin Artaud, even Noam Chomsky and otherlegends of the time. Laing’s breathtaking and ground-breaking works onpsychology and psychiatry—especially concerning schizophrenia—have been devaluedby a mechanical approach to mental illness which insists that the origins areorganic and that schizophrenia can be treated with drugs. Thus, it is assumed,Laing’s work has no merit and can be safely ignored. By stripping meaning fromthe experience of mental illness, science has merely shoveled the dirt under thecarpet. Would Artaud have been happier if he were sane? Van Gogh? Strindberg?Nietzsche? Is their art the result of mental illness, or was mental illnessmerely a means to an end, a necessary approach to that level of truth? With theright drugs, the schizophrenic is now a functioning human being, more or lessacceptable in society, and science is happy with the result. What if thisapproach had been taken towards the schizophrenia of the Siberian shaman?Obviously, the response of science would be to rejoice in the “cure” of theshaman, because who needs shamans, anyway? And isn’t that the point, after all?The war of science on superstition is a front for another war, the war onmeaning. Science manifestly does not provide meaning for scientific events, andin fact is unequivocal about the lack of meaning in scientific phenomena (asopposed to the last five thousand years of recorded history in which every eventis accorded some degree of meaning). Meaning is the enemy; there is only thefact of science, the raw data. At the heart of science’s war on superstition isthe war on religion, and on mysticism and the possibility of spiritualenlightenment. To an extent, one can sympathize with science’s point of viewthat religion has brought nothing but trouble to humanity (as if science hasbrought nothing but goodness). One can point to the Inquisition, to theCrusades. One can also point to the glories of the Renaissance, of the Gothiccathedrals, of religious music and art. Both religion and science have given,and have taken away.Sontag is right to link the literature of sex with the literature of religionand, even, to science fiction. That is a perceptive and illuminating conclusion.In the East, the literature of sex is quite often the literature of religion, asin the Hindu Tantras for instance. And both sex and religion have as their goalin these literatures the quest for fabulous powers, mystical cities, andalternate realities … i.e., have something in common with the literature ofscience fiction.And the linkage of madness with art, with religion, with pornography is a validone, as we have been at pains to demonstrate in these pages. The sexual powersare demonic, and they live at the juncture—perhaps, the tangent—of the real andthe ideal, of this world and another. Demonic forces can be summoned by thesexual act; demonic forces perhaps do the summoning themselves at times (theincubus and sucubus of medieval legend). In India, the forces are more divinethan demonic, but to a Western observer gazing on the frightening image of Kali,an important Tantric goddess, the distinction may seem moot. These forces aremaking themselves known in alien abduction experiences and in satantic cultsurvivor experiences. The perverse, the obscene … these are the elements ofpornography that point to a transcendental state of mind, one that is notaccessible to everyone and, in fact, shouldn’t be.The experiences of Whitley Strieber and other self-confessed “abductees” almostinvariably contain a sexual element. It would seem that the alien forces thatabduct our citizens are inordinately concerned with human reproduction, andremove ovae and sperm from healthy individuals for further study orexperimentation (according to the published accounts). The witches’ sabbats asreported in the medieval press reveal the same sort of link between paranormalcontact and sexuality. The Hindu Tantras are themselves a technologyfor achieving this type of contact through the manipulation of sexual imageryand energy. The Renaissance magician Giordano Bruno set out the parameters forthis technology in his own work, principally in De Vinculis, the text analyzedso thoroughly by Ioan Culianu. The implications are obvious: the manipulation ofthe image, and especially of the sexual image or image of sexual potency orreference, need not be the sole domain of the intelligence agency or the secretsociety; it can become the practice of the individual, the mystic, the artist,the magician.On a biological level, we may characterize this as the conscious control ofunconscious forces: as the deliberate control of the autonomic nervous system,such as is revealed in the alchemical documents of, for instance, ThomasVaughan. This control of previously automatic nervous system functions has asits corollary the conscious reorganization of the firing of the synapses in thehuman brain in an attempt to exert some influence over the quantum level ofconsciousness. As such, this technology is extremely dangerous. As poet andphilosopher Kenneth Rexroth pointed out in his introduction to the work ofThomas Vaughan, it was this very technology—in an unsupervised environment—thatkilled the Welsh alchemist and his wife.Sexuality may seem like a jarring note in a political history, except that thecase of Bill Clinton has brought the connection between sex and politics tointernational prominence, even as there has been no real attempt to understandwhat significance the combination of political leaders and sexual activity hasfor the electorate. There have been other politicians whose careers were marredby sexual exploits, of course, such as Wilbur Mills, the Democratic chairman ofthe House Ways and Means Committee back in the 1970s (a Thirty-Third DegreeMason, incidentally), who got in trouble with an Argentine stripper; formerIndiana Senator Gary Hart, whose presidential campaign imploded with therevelation of Monkey Business; or even President Jack Kennedy, tarred inrevisionist histories with a succession of mistresses that included everyonefrom Mary Pinchot Meyer and Judith Exner to Marilyn Monroe. The fact thatRepublican campaign strategists routinely search for sexual gossip regardingtheir Democrat opponents is ignored by most commentators; no one looks anydeeper into the sexual obsessions of career Republican politicians, perhapsfearful of what might be found there.Fascism is another area in which sexuality plays an important role, and it wasthis close relationship between sex, mysticism and politics that caught theattention of Susan Sontag, whose insights into the functions of creativity,madness, pornography and fantasy have helped us thus far already. Her essay“Fascinating Fascism” clearly shows how the culture of Nazism rang hidden bellsdeep within the Western psyche, and continues to do so today. That Nazism is acult similarly obsessed with sex is no revelation; it begins with a faultytheory of genetics (eugenics) which attempts to justify a “purity of blood”program in which, for example, only Germans who could demonstrate an unbrokenline of Aryan ancestry going back to the year 1750 were permitted to join theSS. Sexual relations with Jews were believed to cause a pollution of thebloodstream, even if no children were conceived as a result. The mere fact thatone had slept with a Jew was enough to convince the Nazis that one’s spirit wasnow impure.At the same time, the Nazis set up the infamous Lebensborn project in which SSofficers (and thus of proven purity of blood) were encouraged to mate with asmany pure Aryan women as possible in order to increase the number of Aryans onthe planet. These children were brought up in Nazi orphanages, “baptized”according to Nazi ritual, and indoctrinated with the Nazi beliefs on thesuperiority of their race and the divine nature of the Fuehrer. Homosexualitywas believed to be an illness of which one could become cured; alternatively, itwas viewed as a crime against nature, and homosexuals were sent to theconcentration camps along with the Jews, the Communists, and anyone elsebelieved to be “deviant” politically, racially, or sexually. When it came tosex, the Nazis were as relentless in their own way as the Vatican. Thenewsletters and broadsides published in Germany in the early years of thiscentury, showing blonde Aryan women being violated by crazed, hairy, Semiticmonsters was a clear expression of German sexual insecurity, a major motivatingforce behind the creation and success of the Nazi Party.The German occult organizations that existed until their suppression by theNazis in the 1930s were openly concerned with sexuality and the mystical ormagical attributes of sexual relations. As described in more detail in UnholyAlliance, organizations such as the Ordo Templi Orientis, the Brotherhood ofSaturn, and so many others believed that there was a sexual secret at the heartof occult literature, concealed behind symbols and archaic references to theRose and the Cross, the Dew, the Red Tincture, etc. Biological functions frommenstruation to ejaculation were examined carefully and compared to steps in thealchemical process. When Aleister Crowley was initiated into the Ordo TempliOrientis, he rewrote many of their basic rituals to reflect more brazenly thesexual component of the “mysteries.” The “sacrament” of the Gnostic Mass, forinstance, was (and possibly still is) composed of both semen and menstrualfluid, mixed with flour and fashioned into “cakes of light” … certainly adangerous substance to consume in these days of AIDS and othersexually-transmitted diseases. The rubric of the Gnostic Mass which requires thePriestess to stroke the Lance of the Priest in a prescribed fashion comes asclose as one would wish to a Grand Guignol approach to organized occultism,something which the late Italian director Federico Fellini would haveappreciated.It is not for nothing that Sontag calls sexuality one of the “demonic forces” inhuman consciousness:Human sexuality is … a highly questionable phenomenon, and belongs, at leastpotentially, among the extreme rather than the ordinary experiences of humanity.Tamed as it may be, sexuality remains one of the demonic forces in humanconsciousness—pushing us at intervals close to taboo and dangerous desires,which range from the impulse to commit sudden arbitrary violence upon anotherperson to the voluptuous yearning for the extinction of one’s consciousness, fordeath itself.36This demonic force can be tamed, however, and made subject to conscious control.It is probably this ancient idea that informs modern Church requirements ofcelibacy for its priests, while at the same time it forgets to train its clergyin the transcendental nature of celibacy as a means for controlling the sexualimpulse and, by extension, deeper, autonomic nervous system responses. Theecstatic sexual union so prized and so sought after by romance novelists andpornographers alike is only a preview, a kind of demonstration, of the potentialof the human nervous system. Like the visions that come from ingesting ahallucinogenic drug, the transcendental moment that can be obtained from apowerful orgasm in the normal course of events is only advertising. The mainevent takes place at the point one is able to control these visions (or theseorgasms) consciously, for it is then that the “heightened state” of Sir RogerPenrose’s quantum consciousness can be initiated, manipulated, and made to servea higher purpose, but only in those who have been prepared—through a system ofinitiatic instruction—for this experience, for this power:What’s really at stake? A concern about the uses of knowledge itself. There’s asense in which all knowledge is dangerous, the reason being that not everyone isin the same condition as knowers or potential knowers. Perhaps most people don’tneed “a wider scale of experience.” It may be that, without subtle and extensivepsychic preparation, any widening of experience and consciousness is destructivefor most people.37To have initiated this process in oneself without proper preparation or guidanceis dangerous, and possibly suicidal. To initiate it in others without theirconscious understanding of the dangers involved, or even—as in the case of EwenCameron and other scientists and doctors under the intelligence agencyprograms—in unwitting and involuntary subjects, is not only unethical, it ishomicidal. The case of Frank Olson is just one case among many hundreds, if notthousands, that took place in the United States alone. It was as if a cult beganinitiating members without their knowledge, and without their psychologicalpreparation: members who would not have been accepted as novices under normalcircumstances and who were then subject to extreme spiritual and psychologicalpressures all at once. Some would have survived; most would have become victims,Children in the Land of Memory who can never find their way home.In case this assertion seems unduly hyperbolic, one only has to refer to thework of one of the early LSD researchers from the days of Timothy Leary andRichard Alpert and the Esalen Institute: the Czech defector Dr. Stanislav Grof.The Soviets seem to make a habit of exploring coincidences.—Ostrander & Schroeder, Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain 38Grof is perhaps best known as one of the founders (along with psychologistAbraham Maslow) of the field of Transpersonal Psychology, a system of psychologythat maintains that individual consciousness is part of a larger, “cosmic” or“transpersonal” consciousness, and that we share many psychological features incommon with everyone else. This is a form of Jungian psychology, which itselfasserts the existence of an “ancient racial memory” that is common to allpeoples, and which is populated—as we have seen—by the archetypes. But Grof didnot arrive at these conclusions through a normal academic path.A native of what was then known as Czechoslovakia, Dr. Grof had begun his careeras a Freudian analyst in the 1950s, earning an M.D. from the Charles UniversitySchool of Medicine and then his Ph.D. from the Czechoslovakian Academy ofSciences. (This after Grof, a hardcore Walt Disney fan, first seriouslyconsidered a career in animated movies!) Before obtaining his degrees, he workedas a medical student at the School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, duringthe 1950s. Without going into too much detail concerning his duties under whatwas a Communist—if eventually a somewhat dangerously liberal Communist—regime,he states in many places that the Sandoz Pharmaceutical firm had sent hisinstitute a quantity of LSD-25 for testing and evaluation in 1954. Heparticipated in that testing regimen. From 1960-1967, he worked as the PrincipalInvestigator of the psychedelic research program at the Psychiatric ResearchInstitute of Prague. All in all, he studied the effect ofhallucinogens—principally LSD—on thousands of hospital patients for ten years inCzechoslovakia before finding himself in the United States at the time of theSoviet invasion and the end of the Prague Spring of 1968.Czechoslovakia at that time was a hotbed of paranormal research and scientificstudies at the cutting edge of consciousness technology, as the Ostrander andSchroeder book—published in 1970—so amply documents. Dr. Karl Pribram—whoseholographic theory of the universe is one of the most important meta-physicalsystems to be unveiled in the last 30 years—also hails from Prague, the capitolof Czechoslovakia; David Bohm, the physicist who has had such an impact on the“quantum consciousness” field, is of Czech ancestry and was a good friend ofPribram. ESP research in Czechoslovakia was highlighted in Psychic DiscoveriesBehind the Iron Curtain, and the application of astrological methods to thefield of conception and fertility also has its roots in CommunistCzechoslovakia.While it is generally known that the Soviets abused psychiatry for their ownends, and hospitalized many a political prisoner, using electroconvulsivetherapy (ECT or electro-shock) on healthy individuals as a means of torture andinterrogation, and applied various other types of “alternative therapies” aswell, such as the use of narcotics and hallucinogens, it is not known to whatextent these methods were used in what was, after all, a Soviet satellite state.In the 1950s, at the very height of the Cold War, the pressure on the staff atthe various psychiatric clinics to make every use of new technologies must havebeen enormous—either as genuine therapies, as experimental programs on unwittingor unwilling subjects, or as out-and-out torture, interrogation and“brainwashing” techniques. As LSD was introduced into the Iron Curtain countriesin 1954, and Grof eagerly accepted any opportunity to test it (on himself, andlater on others) the CIA was experimenting with LSD in the United States—on bothunwitting and voluntary subjects, and not with the slightest interest in usingLSD as a “therapy” of any kind. Grof became the lead or principle investigatorin the use of LSD in Czechoslovakia, and tested or reviewed the testing ofthousands of subjects there before he accepted a position at Johns HopkinsUniversity as a Clinical and Research Fellow in 1967.Prior to this, however, we find Grof among interesting company. In the periodMay 8–10, 1965 we find him listed as one of the registered participants at theSecond International Conference on the Use of LSD in Psychotherapy. Among hisfellow participants we find Harold Abramson, Humphrey Osmond, Walter Pahnke, andothers familiar to us from Operation BLUEBIRD and MK-ULTRA documentation. Atthis time, Grof was still living in Czechoslovakia, but it would not be longbefore he found himself in the enviable position of holding an importantposition at Johns Hopkins in the United States … one that would leapfrog him tothe Maryland Psychiatric Research Center in Catonsville, Maryland—where hebecame the Chief of Psychiatric Research, remaining there until 1973 in chargeof the “last surviving government-sponsored psychedelic research project in theUnited States.”39Czechoslovakia was invaded by the Russians in 1968, to put down what was seenas a trend towards liberalization, as the Czech satellite began to wobble offcourse. Fortunately, Grof was in the United States and decided to stay. In otherwords, defected; a defection made easier by the public acknowledgement of hiscontribution to the field of psychedelic research in the form of his fellowshipat Johns Hopkins; a contribution that was obviously noticed by those in the CIAresponsible for LSD testing and other mind-control technologies.I am not trying to make any kind of judgment on Grof ’s motives, or to impugnhis history as a therapist, either in Czechoslovakia or in the United States.There is no evidence that he worked for the CIA, either wittingly orunwittingly, either voluntarily or through some kind of coercion. It is just aquestion of being in the right place at the right time. Absent a Russianspecialist in LSD research, though, a Czech specialist would have been a godsendto the Agency. Grof would have had up-to-the-minute knowledge of the state ofthe art of LSD applications in psychotherapy and thus could have given theAgency a window onto the Soviet capabilities in that regard. This would havebeen of great importance and interest to Sidney Gottlieb and the other MK-ULTRAstaffers, since it was largely due to the perceived threat of a Sovietmind-control program that the American version was begun. In addition, the CIAwould have been crazy to ignore the fruits of Grof ’s data on thousands of LSDtreatments in Czech hospitals. However, that he is a respected and honoredpsychiatrist with a string of accomplishments to his credit is not to be denied.That he abandoned the proforma atheism of his Communist youth is obvious fromthe work he has done since then, and from his wholehearted embrace ofspirituality as a necessary factor in human growth and development. It is tothis work that we now turn for reasons that will become obvious.Grof ’s interest in the psychedelic experience can be gleaned from his manywritings, in books, articles and interviews over the years. His focus has beenon the death and rebirth experience of those who have taken LSD, and his remarkson the use of the drug by unprepared individuals are worth study. He alsorealizes that insights obtained during the “non-ordinary states ofconsciousness,” or “NOSC,” as he calls them, bear striking similarities to thetheories of quantum physics on the one hand (he mentions David Bohm, KarlPribram, Rupert Sheldrake and Gregory Bateson in this context40) and the manyanthropological reports of shamanistic experiences on the other. Grof realizedthat there was a connecting thread between the state of consciousness obtainedby taking hallucinogens and that spoken of as quantum consciousness, much asPenrose and Hameroff themselves were implying in their Defense Departmentlecture. He also understood the relationship that exists between these statesand the occult trances of the shaman and the mystic. What is astonishing tosomeone who is coming to all of this material “fresh” is that no one took thisargument to its logical conclusion. We shall do so shortly.After leaving his position at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, Gof tookup a post at the Esalen Institute—stomping ground of Jack Sarfatti, Saul-PaulSirag, Alan Watts, John Lilly, Timothy Leary, and so many others who figure inour story, including a side-trip by Charles Manson—where he stayed for manyyears.The Esalen Institute was founded in 1962 by Richard Price and Michael Murphy,and takes its name from a Native American tribe who once lived in the region. Itwas the first of the “human potential movement” centers, and attracted a diversegroup of spiritual leaders, psychotherapists, physicists, philosophers,martial-arts experts, painters, writers, filmmakers, etc. For many Americans,the Esalen Institute would probably typify everything they hate aboutCalifornia, but the influence of Esalen on the fields of medicine,psychotherapy, and international relations cannot be denied. Their establishmentof a group designed to reduce conflict through peaceful resolution brought themto the attention of American political and intelligence careerists, as well asthe Soviets. (It was the Esalen Institute that brought Boris Yeltsin to theUnited States for the first time, to visit President George H.W. Bush as well asformer President Ronald Reagan.)The same year that Esalen was founded, Abraham Maslow (who developed the conceptof the “peak experience”) appeared on the scene and—according to the Esalen Website—“came to play an important role in its development, leading severalworkshops and guiding the founders. Esalen workshop leaders eventually played apivotal role in the growing discipline of humanistic psychology.” These wouldinclude, of course, Stanislav Grof who—with Maslow—would found TranspersonalPsychology.Before Grof arrived at Esalen, however, Esalen members would play a pivotal rolein the founding of Arica, the mystical school established in Chile by OscarIchazo. (One of the Esalen members who traveled to Chile to work with Ichazoincluded John Lilly, he of the dolphin studies.) Ichazo, the son of a Bolivianmilitary officer, joined a mysterious occult group in Buenos Aires in the 1950swhen he was a young man. Based largely on this experience, he wound up in Chiletraining people in his system of mysticism and psychotherapy formed around theEnneagram, a nine-pointed symbol that is familiar to students of Gurdjieff. Inthe arid, northern Chilean city of Arica he attracted the attention of a Chileanpsychiatrist, Claudio Naranjo, who then spoke about him and his technique to theEsalen crowd back in California. A group of about fifty Esalen participants flewto Arica in 1970 to undergo a rigorous training program under Ichazo, includingone Jan Brewer. Brewer would tell Jack Sarfatti that Arica had “been started inChile by high-ranking fugitives from the Third Reich who were masters of theoccult.”41This may seem an outlandish claim at first, except that it was made by one ofthe first Esalen trainees to study in Arica, and my own direct experience inChile with occultists who had Third Reich connections tends to make me lessincredulous than I otherwise would be.42 Ichazo’s background as the son of aBolivian army officer—at a time when Bolivia was riddled with Nazi fugitives,one of whom (Klaus Barbie) would become head of Bolivian Intelligence—is alsosuggestive of a deeper military and fascist connection to the Arica movement inChile.One has to put oneself back in the context of the time: Chile had been asupporter of Nazism during the war, and was in the midst of political upheavalat the time Esalen visited Chile in the period 1970-71. Salvador Allende hadbecome the first democratically-elected Socialist president in Latin America,and efforts were underway by President Nixon and Henry Kissinger to have himousted militarily, a program that culminated in his assassination and themilitary coup of September 11, 1973 that put General Augusto Pinochet in power.Chile’s own self-proclaimed Nazi occultist, Miguel Serrano (a former Chileanambassador and intimate of Hermann Hesse and Carl Jung), was applauding theoverthrow even as Nobel Prize-winning poet Pablo Neruda was dying, surrounded byChilean troops who did not permit him to get the medicine he needed to save hislife. Whithin this suppurating political morass we find forty of America’s bestand brightest sitting at the feet of a Bolivian mystic, characterized by ClaudioNaranjo as a kind of control freak who was not to be trusted.Nevertheless, Esalen embraced the Arica work and helped to establish Ichazo as aNew Age guru in North America. This is something that Sarfatti finds disturbing,going so far as to wonder if Michael Murphy—one of the co-founders of Arica andthe most visible spokesman for the Institute—was a kind of “Puppet Master,” orpossibly an innocent dupe of the intelligence community, citing the involvementof one George Koopman who was an employee of the Defense Intelligence Agencywith the Institute and with Sarfatti himself, as well as of Harold Chipman, aformer CIA officer with heavy involvement in Asia for the Agency and then inCalifornia overseeing the remote viewing research of Puthoff and Targ at SRI onthe Agency’s behalf. This was the Institute in 1973 when Stanislav Grof joinedthe faculty, fresh from his stint researching LSD on the government payroll.I do not want to appear as someone who sees a fascist or a satanist hiding inevery corner. My intention is somewhat more specific. The politicalconsciousness of those who have been leaders of some of the manifestations weknow as the human potential movement has been somewhat shallow, or non-existent.Their writings, speeches and interviews reveal no interest or understanding ofpolitical responsibility; indeed, their view of life as “bliss,” and that theworld would be a happier place if everyone practiced a more spiritual approachto life, ignores the immediate problems of hunger, disease, and genocide. Inmany ways, the quest for personal fulfillment that is the hallmark of the humanpotential movement is possible only in a safe, healthy and relatively affluentenvironment, such as obtains in the United States and in other Westerncountries.This is a dilemma that has concerned me for much of my life: the desire topursue a spiritual path and lifestyle against the responsibility to act in asocially accountable way to aid those oppressed by political regimes, epidemics,famine, war. There are those who say that the individual pursuit of one’sspiritual goals can go a long way towards helping rid the world of evil, but tothose on the front lines it seems a vain and self-serving fantasy, especially inlight of the terrible suffering visited upon the innocent by religious fanaticsthe world over.It is probably this basic dichotomy between these two approaches to life thatleads to the attraction between fascism and occultism on the one hand, andatheism and communism on the other, each missing an essential element only to befound in its opposite; for it is the fascist who despises humanity in generaland the common good, and the communist who despises spirituality and the highergood. Both are interested in the technologies of consciousness, however, if onlyas weapons to be used in their continuing struggle … with each other. Yet, noneof those involved with the human potential movement of the 1960s and 1970s—amidthe assassinations, the Vietnam War, the military coup in Chile, Watergate,etc.—seemed to understand the political ramifications of what they were studyingand doing, and how this “technology” could be used, and was being used, forpolitical and military purposes both overt and covert by forces on both sides ofthe great Cold War political divide.Grof in his writings about this time (1973, when he joined Esalen) is extremelyprescient about the psychological and spiritual value of the LSD experience.Like Koestler, he is a European Communist who has defected to the decadent Westand discovered the Soul in the process. What is more important, he bases hisconclusions on more than 4,000 LSD experiments, a huge database that surrenderssome interesting data.In 1973, he published an article entitled “LSD and the Cosmic Game: Outline ofPsychedelic Cosmology and Ontology” in the Journal for the Study ofConsciousness. In this article, he states that he had “personally conducted over3000 psychedelic sessions” since 1954, when the first shipment of LSD arrived inPrague from Sandoz Pharmaceutical. He also had “access to records from over 1800sessions run by several of my colleagues in Europe and in the United States.”More importantly, he goes on to state,The majority of subjects in these sessions were patients with a wide variety ofemotional disorders, such as severe psychoneuroses, psychosomatic diseases,borderline psychoses and various forms of schizophrenia, sexual deviations,alcoholism and narcotic drug addiction.This is in parallel with the US government’s own practice in the 1950s oftesting LSD on prisoners—usually violent offenders and sexual psychopaths—andpatients in mental institutions. Dosages ranged from 10 to 250 micrograms of LSD(in Prague) and from 300 to 500 micrograms at the Maryland Psychiatric ResearchCenter; in the latter case, Grof was using the LSD in an atmosphere conducive to“healthy” spiritual and psychological states, the “set and setting” approach. InPrague, however, the approach was rather more clinical. His report is based onboth the Prague and the Maryland research.He talks about the current (1973) state of LSD use in the United States, when itwas largely a phenomenon of the young, anti-war crowd so perfectly exemplifiedby Leary and others:Many hundreds of thousands of persons in the United States alone have beeninvolved in unsupervised experimentation with psychedelic substances … many ofthem are repeatedly confronted with the experiences and insights described inthis paper. Experiential sequences of this kind can have an enduring effect onthe world-view of the psychedelic drug users, their life philosophy, and basicsystem of values.This is an interesting and ambiguous statement. He begins by speaking aboutunsupervised experimentation (which he clearly dislikes) and then ends bylinking that to an “enduring effect” on the world-view, philosophy and values ofthe users. One wonders if the effect is to be understood as positive, ornegative? One also wonders if the LSD experimentation undertaken by the militaryand the CIA falls under the category of “supervised” or “unsupervised,” sincethe military and intelligence applications would not have been designed toelevate the mind or spirit of the subject, but to break down his or her psycheand make it more malleable to the controllers.Grof continues by linking the insights obtained by LSD users to the sacredscriptures of the Hindus, the Vedas, which—as we have seen—had some veryinteresting things to say about the nature of Evil, God and the Devil. He thengoes further to associate LSD insights with the new, post-Newtonian physics ofEinstein, Heisenberg, Schroedinger and Niels Bohr, eventually culminating in abrief overview of the work of David Bohm and Karl Pribram, the “holonomic” modelof the universe.Since his article addresses cosmology and ontology, he finds himself consideringthe problem of Evil. He speaks of his LSD subjects having visions of gods anddemons from every culture, even cultures with which they were not familiar (andthus reinforcing Grof ’s idea that there does exist a kind of “ancient racialmemory” or “collective unconscious” à la Jung, common to all humans regardlessof their ethnic origins). Subjects would see ancient Egyptian gods as well asChrist, Buddha, etc. In addition, visions of “Satan, Lucifer, Kali, Lilith,Moloch, Hekate, Pluto, and Coatlicue” were not uncommon.According to Grof, his subjects revealed a sense that Creation had taken placeas a kind of outpouring of consciousness from the unitary Universal Mind, which“initiates a creative play that involves complicated sequences of divisions,fragmentations, and differentiations” that eventually leads to “an infinitenumber of derived entities that are endowed with specific separate forms ofconsciousness and selective self-awareness.” These “derived entities” or “filialconscious entities” then gradually lose contact with the Universal Mind,building screens that divide them from each other and from the Universal Mind.That is, they gradually “forget” their origins, and their interconnectednesswith each other.This is nothing less than Gnosticism, of course. The descent of spirit intomatter is discussed from a psychedelic, twentieth century perspective but it isthe descent of spirit into matter nonetheless. It is also reminiscent of ArthurYoung’s “arc” and Arthur Koestler’s Janus-faced holon system. (Later in the samearticle, Grof actually refers to the “derived entities” as Janus-faced, but withno reference to Koestler, as Koestler had not yet published Janus.) Under theinfluence of LSD, the subjects experience this “screening” process and graduallybreak down these barriers and eventually enter into the Presence of theUniversal Mind. This, again, is Gnosticism and shares a great deal in commonwith the shamanistic experiences described by Eliade and others. Grof links themto Jain philosophy, as well as to “the monadology of G.W. Leibnitz, and to theholonomic theory of David Bohm and Karl Pribram.” He goes further, linking themto Sri Aurobindo and “the system of Kashmir Shaivism,” and again illustratingthe Asian focus of many consciousness pioneers of the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s. (Apopular and amiable authority on Zen Buddhism, Alan Watts, gave the very firstEsalen seminar.)43Thus, it should probably come as no surprise that the conclusions of Grof whenit comes to the nature of Evil are typically Asian, and specifically Hindu orVedic. As Alan Watts says in his autobiography, “Somehow the atmosphere of Hindumythology and imagery slid into [LSD experiences], suggesting at the same timethat Hindu philosophy was a local form of a sort of undercover wisdom,inconceivably ancient, which everyone knows in the back of his mind but will notadmit” (Watts, p. 344).LSD subjects, Grof reports, describe Evil as “an indispensable instrument in thecosmic process.”The recognition that evil is the price that has to be paid for the creation ofthe existing experiential realities and that it is not only a useful, butnecessary ploy in the universal drama tends to bring forgiving andreconciliation.According to the insights of LSD subjects, the Universal Mind has to negateitself and create its polar counterpart in order to enter the process ofcreation.This could have been extracted from the work of a Wendy Doniger or a TrevorLing, or one of the first or second century Gnostic writers. To Grof, workingfrom his LSD database, this negative principle of creation “permeates inincreasingly concrete forms all the levels of the process of creation” includingbeing responsible for the splits and “screening” that prevent the individual“derived entities” from contact with each other, and with the Universal Mind.Since the divine play, the cosmic drama, is unimaginable without separateentities, without distinct protagonists, evil is thus absolutely essential forthe creation of the universe … the experience of unification and consciousnessexpansion is typically preceded in the LSD process by an encounter with theforces of darkness, confrontation with evil appearances, or passing throughdemonic screens; this is typically associated with extreme physical andemotional suffering.Again, we are on familiar ground. The hideous visions and experiences of theshaman—externalized in the case of the serial killer—are once again before us.LSD provides an opportunity to undergo this experience, but in a sociallyacceptable “set and setting,” under the comfortable supervision of a therapistwho may or may not have undergone the complete spiritual transformationpersonally. There are those who might complain—reasonably enough—that thedrug-induced spiritual experience is to the real spiritual experience as thetravelogue is to the place visited. Alan Watts mentions that many people whohave had a positive experience with LSD then abandon the drug and go on to morespiritual work.44 The implication is that the LSD experience (or any experiencewith a hallucinogen, such as psychedelic mushrooms or peyote) is initiatory: itstarts one on a spiritual path, like the drugs taken at the Rites of Eleusis,but is not the path itself. That is why it is dangerous to take the drug underany circumstances other than under the careful tutelage of an experienced userand in a setting of spiritual (psychological) protection. That is why theBLUEBIRD and MK-ULTRA experiments were so wrong, not only from a moral orethical standpoint, but from a deeper, more profound point of view.Grof reiterates that evil “is inextricably woven into the cosmic fabric andindispensable for the existence of experiential worlds” and thus that “it cannotbe defeated and eradicated in the world of phenomena.” The parallels withGnostic thought and ancient Hindu theology could not be more emphatic. Theworld, then, is under the control of the Demiurge, or Lord Mara, or Satan. Thephenomenal world is evil, and since it cannot be defeated there is only …escape.Thus the polarity between good and evil is usually transcended simultaneouslywith the sense of alienation and individual separateness, with the distinctionbetween inactivity and action, and with the illusion of the objective reality ofthe phenomenal world.While all of this may be perfectly valid, and is certainly in line with some ofthe more advanced spiritual disciplines throughout the world and throughout theages, it can also be understood as a way of avoiding political commitment andsocial involvement. We can comfort ourselves with the consideration that thephenomenal world is an illusion of which Evil is a necessary component; but whena little girl dies from a sniper’s bullet, or an old lady collapses from hungeron a city street, or one million Cambodians are slaughtered in the killingfields, or six million Jews are turned into smoke and ash in the concentrationcamps, then these theological, cosmological, and ontological speculations are ofvery little use.But does that mean that we must abandon the technology of the spirit, the“machineries of joy” as I have called them, after Bradbury, in order to do “goodworks”? When spiritual growth virtually requires isolation from the world atlarge, how to look out for our fellow human beings? How to contribute in ameaningful way to the world and its relentless struggle with the very real, ifalso very illusory, forces of evil? Perhaps the example of the shaman—a personwho has undergone all the enormous psychological pressures and spiritualstresses of which Grof, Eliade, and so many others write—is the example tofollow, for the shaman returns to his village and becomes a healer, a seer, atherapist, and a spiritual force to be reckoned with. The shaman is not a luxuryin his village; he is not reading tea leaves or bending spoons or checking youraura. The shaman is a necessity, a requirement for the life of the village. Forall of his or her strangeness and other-worldliness, the shaman is a committedmember of the community and performs valuable (and life-saving) services. Theshaman can also, however, attack villagers, attack other shamans, and kill froma distance. The interest of governments in these latter powers at the expense ofthe former is what has damned them, and led to the present state of affairs inwhich the Pandora’s box of consciousness—what is commonly known as the “blackbox”—has been recklessly opened, and the demons and evil spirits of the OtherSide let loose upon the world.And the opening of that box was quite easy, once the right tools had beenobtained and a general understanding of the problem was at hand. As Grofexplains later in the same article:There exists a wide spectrum of mind-altering techniques that can facilitate theoccurrence of such unusual states. … They involve the use of psychedelicsubstances or a combination of various extreme situations, such as prolongedstay in the desert, exposure to unusual temperatures, sleep deprivation,fasting, social isolation, sensory overload, physical pain, difficult bodypostures, and respiratory maneuvers combining hyperventilation and withholdingof breath.Similar changes of consciousness can also be produced by various laboratory andclinical techniques. We can mention in this context sensory deprivation andoverload, electric stimulation of the brain, kinaesthetic devices, variations ofhypnotic induction …Paging Dr. Cameron. Will Dr. Mengele please pick up the white courtesy phone?I don’t want to make light of the above, and I don’t want to over-react. Infact, what Grof is saying is quite correct: non-ordinary states of consciousnesscan be reached by any and all of these methods, and many more besides. This isobvious from the vast literature on the subject, from the lives of the Christiansaints, from the examples of Hindu ascetics and Siberian shamans. What ismissing is the context under which these technologies should be used. Thenon-denominational methods advanced by Grof and others in the field may not besufficient; cultural loading may actually be a requirement in this case, ratherthan an obstacle. Yet, Grof is understandably reluctant to call in the priests.Further along in this seminal essay on LSD and the “cosmic game,” Grof complainsthat most existing religious systems are replete with “inconsistencies andparadoxes,” and says,Many of them are unable to reconcile such fundamental contradictions as theassumption of a benevolent, omnipotent and omniscient creator and the existenceof evil and suffering in the world; omnipotence of God and the concept of sin,as well as man’s responsibility for his actions; or the supreme justice of Godand the inequities existing among people.He then notes that many religions are in conflict with each other, each cultclaiming a “monopoly on God and infallibility of their creed; they hate, rejectand persecute the members of the competing religions.” Then he goes on toexplain this gross inconsistency by falling back on the game scenario of theUniversal Mind:According to the metaphysical system described above, the inconsistencies andparadoxes existing within the individual religious frameworks, as well as theconflicts between them, have been deliberately created by the Universal Mind andbuilt into the scheme of things as important elements in the cosmic game.In other words, we are back to the Gnostic Demiurge, a God who created thephenomenal world as a place of evil, a matrix of matter in which to entrapspirit.The only religions exempt from this problem are those that are “characterized bytheir universality and all-encompassing understanding, compassion and tolerance.They have a definite pantheistic emphasis and believe in ultimate unity of allcreation.” The spiritual path, according to Grof, is one in which the individualgradually rises from self-awareness, to awareness of the connections thatconnect him or her to everything else in creation, and then eventually back tothe Universal Mind itself. This is a basic blueprint for the initiatory systemsof most of the world’s secret societies. The identification of a matrixunderlying all of creation and the interconnectedness (as detailed in thedoctrine of signatures, or correspondences, of the medieval magicians andalchemists) of all “things,” all phenomena, used as a machine to elevateconsciousness to higher levels, is familiar to all students of hermeticism andof the hierarchical structure of occult lodges or orders, from the Freemasons tothe Rosicrucians and the Golden Dawn, the OTO, etc. These disciplines provided aframework, an intellectual context, within which the non-ordinary states ofconsciousness described by Grof could be integrated into the psyches of theinitiates, while at the same time surrounding the initiate with a social supportapparatus so that the intense preliminary stages of psychological disintegrationwould not be summarily dismissed as psychosis or mental disease.Like Eliade and R.D. Laing, Grof understands that the mental states accompanyingthe various stages of “illumination” are construed as mental illness,“particularly schizophrenia,” by mainstream science. He claims that the work ofhis colleague, Abraham Maslow, has begun to change all of that, with Maslow’sdiscovery of the “peak experience” and its identification as a “supernormal”state rather than a pathological one. Grof was probably being optimistic in thisregard, since mainstream psychiatry and psychotherapy at this time are stillresistant to the idea of these states as anything other than mental disorders.With new drugs to combat some forms of schizophrenia, Laing’s insistence that“mental breakdown may also be mental breakthrough” has been devalued, eventhough one could argue that suppressing a mental state through chemical means isnot the same as curing it, and does not mean that the existential nature of theschizophrenic state has been somehow explained away by describing it as achemical imbalance. One could reasonably wonder if the state preceded theimbalance, or the imbalance the state; and then ask if the cause-and-effectrelationship between chemical “imbalance” and mental state was a validperspective in the era of quantum consciousness.At least Grof realizes that not all “peak experiences” may be blissful, and onceagain touches the edge of our argument by stating,However, the peak experiences can also occur under circumstances which areunfavorable and critical for the individual; in this case, the ego consciousnessis shattered and destroyed rather than dissolved and transcended.This is true for situations of severe acute or chronic physical and emotionalstress, as well as circumstances in which body integrity or survival areseverely threatened. Many people have experienced fundamental spiritual openingat the time of accidents, injuries, dangerous diseases or operations.And, we may add, during torture, interrogation, “brainwashing,” “psychicdriving” and “depatterning.” Remember that Grof is coming from a background inwhich he performed LSD research—since 1954—on the behalf of first the Czechgovernment and then the US government at the same time that these governmentswere experimenting with LSD for military and intelligence applications. Theabove remarks by Grof would have been quite interesting to the project leadersof these agencies, as they point the way towards alternate methods ofinterrogation and “brainwashing,” using techniques already in their arsenal butapplying them towards different goals. Although the agendas of the intelligenceagencies would have been unique to them, the resultant effects on the psyches oftheir subjects would have been to open them up to spiritual forces for whichthey were not prepared (neither the subject nor the controller), and forpsychological (and spiritual) blowback that could not be predicted.Grof then makes reference to the works of Arthur Young (of the original Nine) asrepresentative of the “convergence between mysticism, modern consciousnessresearch, and quantum-relativistic physics,” before proceeding to a discussionof the holonomic model of the universe proposed by David Bohm and Karl Pribram.He mentions in passing that “Karl Pribram formulated then a neurophysiologicaltheory that connects the holonomic concept of the Universe to brain anatomy andphysiology.” From there, he goes on once more to associate these ideas with theHindu Vedas.That Arthur Young should appear in this article is not surprising, but what maybe more astonishing is the fact—related by Jack Sarfatti—that The Nine actuallylectured at Esalen! Twenty years after the first appearance of The Nine to thecircle around Andrija Puharich, they again manifested in the person of one JennyO’Connor. Ms. O’Connor was “channeling” The Nine and came to the attention ofWerner Erhard, the neo-fascist creator of a school of self-development known as“est,” for “Erhard Seminar Training,” and always printed in lower-case letters.(Erhard had famously changed his name from Jack Rosenberg to “give up Jewishweakness for German strength.”) Sarfatti himself had been a visitor to ArthurYoung in the company of Puharich and Ira Einhorn, and had worked sporadicallywith Arthur Young’s Institute in Berkeley, California. Oddly enough, he seemsnot to have been aware of Young’s involvement with The Nine in its earliestincarnation. In the late 1970s, Jenny O’Connor was referred to Sarfatti by oneof the est people, and Sarfatti was not impressed. Nonetheless, O’Connor becameensconced at Esalen, channeling messages from The Nine and having influence oversome management decisions and organizational structuring at the Institute, atthe same time that Esalen was being visited by Soviet officials as well as byEinhorn, various physicists, Stanislav Grof (who was “Scholar-in-Residence” from1973 to 1987), and many, many others.Grof does not ignore the psychic abilities and coincidences that sometimesattend the spiritual awakening. In a 1996 interview with Russell E. DiCarlo, hestates,… karmic experiences are often associated with meaningful synchronicities. Forexample, a person has a difficult relationship with another person and has apast life experience that shows the two of them engaged in some sort of violentconflict. One of them is the victim and the other the aggressor. If this personcompletes reliving that incident and reaches a sense of forgiveness, his or herattitude towards the other protagonist changes in the positive direction.… Whatis quite extraordinary is that at exactly the same time a significant change inthe same direction often occurs in the other person.… This can happen even ifthere was not a conventional communication or connection of any kind betweenthese two persons.45In other words, a “non-local” relationship develops of which quantum physics hasgiven us the exemplar. Grof believes that reincarnation is a “pragmatic concept,reflecting an effort to understand the complexity of these experiences thatspontaneously emerge in non-ordinary states.”In his work Books of the Dead: Manuals for Living and Dying,46 Grof provides uswith illustrations of some of the visions seen by his LSD patients, those whohad taken high doses of the drug and experienced death and rebirth scenarios. Onpage 29, for instance, we see a drawing of a “Moloch-like deity with afurnace-belly and tearing claws” which “immediately preceded psychologicalrebirth and the opening into light.” One wonders what would have happened hadthe individual been given the same dose of the drug but under conditions lessthan ideal: a government laboratory, for instance, or a CIA safe house? Wouldthey have been classed as psychotic, and would they have beenprogrammed—inadvertently to be sure—to regard the experience as a negative one,thus blocking their psychological or spiritual growth? And would anyone havecared? Would this person’s rather ambiguous mental and emotional state haveaffected his or her performance in the outside world, as a teacher, orscientist, or criminal, or spy, or soldier?Or would the weight of what they had experienced—and the lack of a competentsocial structure to explain it and support it—have led that person to leap froma hotel room window on a cold night in the City of New York?Probably this chronic mutual suspicion of our neighbor’s capacities … will neverbe settled to everyone’s satisfaction.… It doesn’t seem inaccurate to say mostpeople in this society who aren’t actively mad are, at best, reformed orpotential lunatics. But is anyone supposed to act on this knowledge, evengenuinely live with it?

It was an attemptwhose ambition was exceeded only by my general ignorance. I did not belong toany political party. I did not study political science, or have a degree inAmerican history. I was, however, an American born and raised. My father hadbeen politically active, and the FBI had taken notice of him, however slight itmight be. I had been politically active in New York City to an extent during theSixties. And during all that time I was surrounded by the converging elements ofradical, alternative politics and radical, alternative religions. They seemed tobelong together, as if resistance to one form of authority demanded resistanceto all others: religion, art, music, literature, psychotherapies, sex. In 1967,anti-Vietnam War protesters—led by Crowley-follower Kenneth Anger—had linkedarms at the Pentagon and tried to levitate it, chanting prayers of exorcism.Exorcism! And the Pentagon, after all, is a five-sided figure that would havebeen familiar to medieval sorcerers as an emblem of Mars, and of protectionagainst sinister forces.I suspected that the secrets I sought involved some equivalent convergence ofreligion and politics; after all, religion has influenced politics and politics,religion for thousands of years. In many cultures, political leaders are alsoreligious leaders, such as the Dalai Lama of Tibet, the Emperor of Japan, thePharaohs of Egypt, etc. Did we, as Americans, leave all of that behind? The“divine right of kings,” the sanctity of the royal blood, and “whom does theGrail serve?” Did we break so thoroughly and so completely with our Europeaninheritance? Is the American miracle a result of “independent inventionism” orthe more logical and aesthetically appealing “diffusionism”? Is America theresult of European culture taken to its logical conclusion? Or is it truly analien force in the world, a magnet for the dispossessed, the greedy, thecriminal, the apostate, the heretic, the eros-driven immigrants of fourcenturies?More generally, what is the role of coincidence in history, particularly inAmerican history? Is coincidence an actual force in and of itself, or evidenceof the action of another force, something working outside linear, Newtonian,Cartesian consensus reality? Is there a scientific basis for this force? Ifthere is, then how do we explain its role in our own history? How can we ignoreit, when so many commentators on history and science have spoken of itsinsidious power, from District Attorney Jim Garrison to nuclear physicistWolfgang Pauli? Indeed, coincidence piled on coincidence during my own researchfor this work, defeating logical explanation. How else to explain the appearanceof books I specifically needed—little-known works on particular events in UShistory—turning up with eerie regularity in second-hand book stalls on sidestreets in Kuala Lumpur? Even a privately-published monograph by remote viewerIngo Swann? And a series of academic works on Salem witchcraft, etc.?The Voice article linked such disparate elements as the Charles Manson murders,Richard Nixon and Watergate, E. Howard Hunt and occultism, Howard Hughes, andeven Disneyland. It may have been intended as whimsical, but the links—as Iwould later learn from the work of Professor Culianu—are themselves evidence ofone of the strongest forces in history. For the sin of revealing these forces,Giordano Bruno was put to the stake during the Inquisition. For the sin ofrevealing these same forces, Professor Culianu was murdered in 1991.Where should I start?I began Book I with the assumption that the phenomenon of Charles Manson and his“family” was a case study in the manipulation of these forces, whetherconsciously or unconsciously or, what is more likely, intuitively: a combinationof both. Village Voice reporter Craig Karpel saw a link there, and hisassociation of Manson with Richard Nixon was enough to start a whole train ofthought going in a bizarre direction. Like most people in the mid-1970s, I knewa little about the idea of the “Manchurian Candidate,” and the suspicion thatour government had been involved in projects of that nature. It would be a fewyears before the story was generally known, due to the revelations that came outof the Watergate and associated hearings, but the theme was an ever-present onein the media, from the British television series The Prisoner to AnthonyBurgess’ A Clockwork Orange to the culturally-distorted mind-control scene inCasino Royale, starring “War of the Worlds” broadcaster Orson Welles as acrypto-Aleister Crowley.There was an assumption on the part of many Americans that Nixon and Mansonrepresented an evil force in their country, Robin Williams’ famous “Manson-NixonLine.” Many readers will be appalled at the association, however glib, of one oftheir Presidents with a murderer like Charles Manson, but it is neverthelesstrue that many Americans did feel this way, and that from their point of viewNixon’s body-count was much higher than Manson’s. Although I was one of thoseAmericans who disliked Nixon and who opposed our involvement in the Vietnamconflict, I did not suspect—at the time I began this work—that Nixon’s perfidyextended beyond the Watergate break-in to include collusion with the Dullesbrothers to protect Nazi war criminals and the attempt to keep the Vietnam Wargoing on long enough to ensure his election in 1968.But it was Manson himself that beckoned from the American heartland. We areaccustomed to a certain belief that our politicians say and do unpleasant thingsin order to win elections or stay in power; although Nixon’s crimes are a matterof public record and will be distilled many times by historians in the decadesand centuries to come in the context of twentieth century American politics,Manson’s crimes represent something far darker and more mysterious than simplegreed or cupidity. Manson became an icon of evil in its pure form, an iconrivaling Nixon’s own. Manson was not a politician, not supported by wealthybusinessmen and neo-fascist bankers. He was “poor white trash,” the type of manwe associate with trailer parks, reformatories, and biker gangs. He carved aswastika into his forehead. He compared himself, favorably, with Jesus. He spentmost of his life in prison, and most of the rest of his life trying to get backinside. He ordered murders to be committed. He had sex with minors. Hestockpiled weapons and stole cars. He may be thought of as the opposite end ofthe spectrum from Nixon, but it is a spectrum of evil nonetheless.If I wanted to understand political witchcraft, I would have to begin withManson, and if I began with Manson I would have to begin with the town whereManson was raised. That led me to the Indian mounds of Ashland, and from themounds I began to wonder if these ancient Adena structures in the very center ofManson’s home town worked a weird kind of sorcery over its citizens. Tounderstand that, I would have to understand Indian mounds in general and fromthere try to put the entire concept of sacred structures into some kind ofcontext. This led me, inexorably, to early American history and prehistory, andI found myself reading Hawthorne and Lovecraft, New England’s native sons andspiritual heirs of the Salem witchcraft tradition.Slowly, an entire secret history of America was making itself known, throughobscure academic journals, narratives both fictional and non-fictional,epigraphic remains, archaeological digs, and fragmentary documentation of allsorts. It was a detective story, and at the heart of this story is a mysterydeep and profound: the hungry ghost that haunts the American landscape.Manson would lead me to the Scientologists and occultists who supervised hispsychological and spiritual training while in prison; to more Indian mounds,this time at Chillicothe where he underwent his spectacular “conversion”experience in 1954 and “stopped thinking”; to his alleged murder of Marina Habein Los Angeles; and from there to her father, Hans Habe, the Nazis and OperationPaperclip.Operation Paperclip would lead to Nazi General Walter Dornberger and BellAerospace, and from there to Michael and Ruth Paine and the Kennedyassassination; it would also lead to Nazi General Hubertus Strughold andRandolph Air Base, Nazi medical experimentation, and Whitley Strieber and alienabductions.The Kennedy assassination would lead me to David Ferrie and the AmericanOrthodox Catholic Church, to Fred Crisman and Guy Bannister and the UFOs overWashington State, and before I knew it to Andrija Puharich, Arthur Young, “TheNine,” and the New Age movement, even including Jim Jones and the massacre inGuyana.Manson would also lead me to Hollywood, for it was here in Southern Californiathat he worked his black magic, convincing even the Beach Boys of his bona fidesas a spiritual leader, and becoming de facto guardian of DiDi Lansbury, thedaughter of the woman who portrayed the control agent of the ManchurianCandidate in the film. It was in the Tate/Polanski home that Jane Fonda—whoportrayed Night in the film version of The Blue Bird, filmed in Moscow where theoriginal stage play had its Stanislavski-directed premiere—had a party for herhusband director Roger Vadim only hours before the Manson killings were tobegin. Manson Family victim Sharon Tate, of course, had been one of the lastpersons to dine with Robert F. Kennedy the night of his assassination, at asmall gathering hosted by Manchurian Candidate director John Frankenheimer.Through all of this, the rhythm of coincidence and synchronicity beat softly butpersistently. It seemed as if everyone were aware of the pattern of coincidenceunderlying historical events, despite the fact that no one looked any deeper atthe phenomenon; so this prompted me to investigate coincidence from a scientificperspective which meant, of course, quantum physics and the newly-emergingconcept of quantum consciousness. With this, we were investigating not onlyAmerican history but the very nature and composition of reality itself.The physical territory of the Americas in terms of ancient prehistory gave usthe “deep background” that we needed to place this Secret in some kind ofphysical context: the Adena and Hopewell cultures that predated what we know ofthe Native American civilizations. In Book I, we looked at the “Indian burialmounds” and marveled at their astronomical alignments, in some cases the equalof anything to be found in Egypt among the pyramids: a science that was notmaintained by their putative descendants, the Native American Indian tribes. Weexamined some of the evidence supporting a Diffusionist theory of the populationof the Americas by races from Europe, Africa and Asia, and looked atepigraphical evidence for a Phoenician and Celtic migration to the Americasbefore the arrival of Columbus: pagans from the East setting up altars in theWest.We also looked at the voyages of Columbus and realized that the motivation forthese journeys was religious and political: to find a way to raise money for anew Crusade against the Muslim rulers in Jerusalem, and to find a way to attackthe Muslim nations from the eastern side rather than from the Mediterranean. Inso doing, we came across the story of the Arawak Indians encountered byColumbus, a member of whose race would eventually wind up in Salem,Massachusetts, accused of igniting the witchcraft hysteria of 1692.From there, we saw how Joseph Smith, Jr.—the founder of the Mormon religion, anddescendant of one of the Salem accusers—began his career as a ceremonialmagician in the woods of upstate New York, an American Dr. Dee or Faustusconjuring spirits at a burial mound in an attempt to find gold and buriedtreasure. We watched as he became a Freemason, and was soon thereafter murderedby an angry mob, even as he was clutching an imperfectly-made talisman forprotection.The first people who lived in the Americas; the discovery of America byColumbus; the Salem (and many other) witchcraft trials (with notes on thepractice of occultism, alchemy, astrology and magic by both political leaders inhigh positions as well as impoverished Joseph Smith, founder of Mormonism) ...all of these important episodes of American history—many familiar toschoolchildren—had at their root religious and occult motivations and agendasthat are not discussed in the classroom. Cotton Mather himself viewed America asa land possessed by the Devil, even as it was destined to become a NewJerusalem.That was our “deep background,” a preparation for what was to come.For it was an investigation of Charles Manson that led us to Ashland, Kentuckyand the burial mounds that are the heart of the town, and to a horrible crime onChristmas Eve in which three children were killed and their house burned down,after two of the children—young girls—were raped in the sight of a handicappedboy who could do nothing to defend them, or himself. The alleged perpetrators ofthis crime were caught, amid much controversy, and caused the Ashland Massacre,in which troops and civilians fired on each other in an effort to retain custodyof the three killers. So much death and violence for such a small town, in anarea that gave us Manson, Bobby Joe Long, and other murderers, as well as thedeadly Hatfield and McCoy feud. And, in the midst of all of this, the moundsquietly at rest, dead but dreaming.Manson’s childhood in Ashland progresses to his incarceration at Chillicothe,Ohio, at the site of another, more elaborate, complex of burial mounds. Hislieutenant in the Manson Family, Squeaky Fromme, will do time at another prisonsituated at another set of burial mounds, this time in West Virginia, and nowfor the attempted assassination of President of the United States.The mounds seem to be a silent element in this story, and it is odd how manyprisons are built on or near a set of burial mounds. Do we unconsciouslyassociate violent offenders with something ancient, pagan, and shamanistic?Indeed, these mounds are not all “burial” mounds, but were constructed accordingto the same astronomical principles as the monuments at Stonehenge and thePyramids at Gizeh: alignments to the sun and the moon and the stars, an attemptto measure time and to channel mysterious forces. Certainly, these were theactions of uneducated, illiterate humans from the dawn of prehistory. It is allsuperstition, nothing more.Odd, then, that Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is also built on the site ofIndian burial mounds. It was to Wright-Patterson that the first Paperclipscientists were taken, in July of 1947 at the time of the purported Roswellcrash of a flying saucer, and at the same time that debris from the crash waspurportedly taken there. Odd, then, that the Atomic Energy Commission built anuclear facility less than half a mile away from the “Seal mounds,” a few milessouth of the Chillicothe complex. The Seal mounds are virtually unique among theHopewell mounds in that they are oriented (precisely) towards the four cardinaldirections and the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, rather than towards the winterand summer solstices which is the more common mound orientation. More stuff tofuel a television mini-series, or an episode of The X-Files. But nothing there.No smoking gun. Just fantasy and science fiction, paranoia and superstition.After all: Charles Manson, UFOs, burial mounds, serial killers, Nazi scientists,Indian shamans, astronomical alignments, nuclear energy … this is not the stuffof mainstream history, of academic scholarship. It’s the raw material ofadolescent daydreams and the slick, pre-packaged pablum that has replacedorganized religion in the United States at a time of great moral, political andcultural upheaval. It’s H.P. Lovecraft on steroids, nothing more. But then wetook apart these elements, piece by piece, to see what was ticking (like a bomb,if not a clock) behind them. We discovered that the FBI did indeed investigateUFOs in the late 1940s, and did indeed file these reports under the rubric “X”;but what we did not expect to find was that one of the principle players in thisepisode was a man who would later figure prominently in Jim Garrison’s Kennedyassassination investigation: Fred Crisman, a man said to have worked for the OSSduring World War II and later for the CIA, a man whose role was to createconfusion and disinformation. We did not expect to find that one of the FBIagents responsible for investigating the series of UFO sightings in the PacificNorthwest in 1947—the “X” files—was Guy Banister, another player in the Kennedyassassination conspiracy who would wind up in New Orleans as an associate of LeeHarvey Oswald, running anti-Castro operations from his walk-up office on CampStreet, an address stamped on Oswald’s “Fair Play For Cuba” flyers. Confusionand disinformation.We looked at the claim of alien abductee Whitley Strieber who said that, as achild in the 1950s, he had been taken to a “secret school” with other smallchildren. A claim with very little documentation to support it, until we comeacross other “secret schools” in operation at the same time, including oneattended by theoretical physicist Jack Sarfatti and operated by the SandiaCorporation, a company that ran on Defense Department contracts. Then we comeacross a man who shared a bus ride into Mexico with Lee Harvey Oswald, a man whoran a “secret school” in that country and who had been a Nazi supporter duringWorld War II, running a paramilitary camp for adolescents in Tennessee. Strieberclaimed his “secret school” had two locations: one in San Antonio, at the OlmosBasin, and another in Monterrey, Mexico. Strieber had also been taken toRandolph Air Base, which was staffed with more than a hundred former Naziscientists and medical officers under the Paperclip program, including GeneralHubertus Strughold: men responsible for experimentation on live human subjectsat the death camps.Then we came across the startling episode of the Finders, a group of culticpretension and CIA protection, and with an international reach that specializedin children, shipping some of them to a “secret school” in Mexico. In 1987.What did all of this mean?We investigated the possibility that some of these events may have been relatedto an ongoing psychological warfare program of the Army and the intelligenceagencies, which we have come to know as BLUEBIRD or as MK-ULTRA, but which hadmany names depending on the military or intelligence agency involved. Again, wediscovered more than we expected to find.We found what Ed Sanders referred to as the “Manson Secret.”The arcane doctrines and methods of a discarded science are at the heart of thisstudy, because they reveal the mechanisms by which society in general, andindividuals in particular, have been manipulated by forces beyond theircomprehension. The modern adoration of the principles of Newtonian science—asbest represented by commentators such as the late Carl Sagan, Martin Gardner,and the coven of professional skeptics around them—has served only to obscurethe means by which more open-minded specialists have been able to work theirmagic with impunity, often to the detriment of entire populations.If we review the manuals on psychological warfare as practiced in the Congo inthe 1950s, or in Vietnam in the 1960s, we see the politically-correct (“wink,wink, nudge, nudge”) approach to what is, after all, witchcraft and black magic.The same may be said for the manual on remote viewing that was used by the USmilitary as late as the 1980s, and perhaps even more recently than that. Theopposition to the remote viewing programs came not as a result of a cost-cuttingconsciousness or a desire to rid the Pentagon of an unprofitable boondoggle, butbecause it smacked of New Age, anti-Christian sorcery. Remote viewing wasattacked by the Time magazine science editor because it was a form of occultismthat could lead to fascism. In other words, opposition to this program was basedon religious and political grounds, not on scientific ones.While the agencies may have abandoned the remote viewing programs, they have notjettisoned psychological warfare, which is, after all, an essential weapon intheir arsenal. All of these techniques, from psychological warfare to remoteviewing, have their origins in occultism. Although we can confidently trace thebeginnings of this art to Giordano Bruno and the magicians of the Renaissance,they go back much further in time than that, to the days when occultism,religion, science, art and politics were one, and the chief of state wasworshipped as a god and reality determined by the limits of his kingdom; andworks of theater were works of ritual; and magic was the context within whichscience evolved; and works of art were media to communicate directly withsinister forces.We have suggested that much of this material can be learned through a carefulstudy of the religions of the East: Hinduism, Taoism, Buddhism, etc., or throughan examination of modern writings on shamanism. However, the most accessibletechnology for a Western mind would be the theory and practice of ceremonialmagic. This, after all, was the method by which Joseph Smith, Jr. talked toangels and looked for buried treasure, founding a new religion in the process.It was also under study by governors, doctors, and clergymen in the early daysof Colonial America and provided the atmosphere in which the Salem witchcrafttrials took place. Miscellaneous tomes on magic can be found at the crime scenesof serial murder, and in the libraries of politicians. It was the means by whichL. Ron Hubbard jump-started Scientology; and by which Jack Parsons made animportant series of contributions to the defense and space programs. Magic wasthere when MK-ULTRA began its search for the secrets of the paranormal andinterviewed witches and wizards in America and beyond. It is a fascination thathas not died with the passage of time, or the passage of laws, whether civil orscientific. If, as Crowley has written, “magic is the science and art of causingchange to occur in conformity with will,” then it has obvious attractions forthe politician and the general, type-A personalities whose will is surpassedonly by their egos.Ceremonial magic begins with a basic premise that is sometimes formulated as theHermetic axiom, “As above, so below,” a simple phrase with enormousimplications. Magicians believe that connections or links exist betweenperceived phenomena, and that to operate on one side of the link is to causechange to occur on the other. To fashion a talisman of gold is to trap the powerof the sun; to make love to a priestess is to invoke a god. The magicianoperates in a world of “non-locality,” a world where a force may be an object, awave may be a particle, and everything is in immediate communication witheverything else, from the very basic sub-atomic particles that comprise matterand energy, to the couplings of Tantric deities in a cave on Mount Meru. Themagician deals with multiple personalities as a matter of course: demons,angels, spirits of the dead, are all around him, all the time. Like the G-scaledoctor in his white robes in a basement somewhere in the Virginia countryside,or the Canadian psychiatrist in his Mount Royal retreat, surrounded by taperecorders and hallucinogens, the magician also uses these multiple personalitiesas subjects to work his own will in the world: to gain wealth or knowledge, topenetrate mysteries and reveal secrets … to assassinate from a distance.The magician, to protect himself from the terrible forces he evokes, standswithin a magic circle made of concentric rings and illuminated by candles andesoteric symbols. From within this position, he gives the orders that causechange to occur. (As William Burroughs once said, the magician in his circle isa like a Mafia don, insulated from the acts he orders to be committed by ringsof spiritual “made-men.”) The magician speaks with invisible beings and summonsinfernal powers. The demons he conjures all have titles like Prince and Duke,King and President. The demons are all politicians, with constituents of theirown. And the magician pulls their strings, surrounded by an aura of deniability,an aura created by Newtonian science, since science states that what themagician does is impossible, the result of superstition and ignorance. “There isno such thing as the Mafia,” stated J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI. Andthe capos laughed.In the texts of ceremonial magic we find the formulas for attaining that“abaissement du niveau mental,” that “dereglement de tous les sens” so necessaryfor the first step of initiation, that toe-dip into chaos, that lifting of theVeil of the Temple, that courting of madness and ecstatic vision. Moreimportantly, however, we also find the technology for keeping oneself sane, forputting order into chaos, a system and a systematized approach to controllingpsychosis and for tripping across that corpus callosum between the right andleft hemispheres of the brain, lowering and raising the threshhold ofconsciousness, the niveau mental, at will.Like the texts of alchemy, the grimoires of magic appear on their face to beincomprehensible works of superstition and fraud. The promises of riches are noless frequent in the grimoires than they are in the alchemical works; but thegrimoires are written in language plain enough to follow: cut a willow branch atdawn, or summon Jupiter on a Thursday. It is the accumulation of all of theseactions, in the order prescribed, that elicits from the operator the sensationof incipient psychosis, a gradual descent into madness, which is the first signof success. The magician dissociates, creates alternate identities for himselfwith their own names and abilities and personalities. As the magician travelsthrough the various levels of his art, his costume changes (red for Mars, whitefor the Moon) and the incense burning on the brazier changes (sandalwood forVenus, myrrh for Saturn) as each stage in the process prompts the appropriateresponse from him, elicits a new personality with all the subterfuge of scentand sight and touch and taste and hearing, all manipulated according to therubric, all designed to break the magician down into multiple personalities andrebuild him again like Osiris from his dismembered bones, fragments of identityscattered throughout the landscape.During this process the magician learns the power of the symbol, of the image.He learns to manipulate these images, and to create ones of his own. He learnshow to influence judges, sway kings, defeat armies, be worshipped, loved, adored… all through image, through what today we might call advertising, orpsychological warfare, using a technology that existed before printing, beforeadvertising, before psychoanalysis. Through auto-hypnosis, the magician learnsto hypnotize. Through self-degradation, he learns how to degrade others. Throughself-manipulation, he discovers how you can be manipulated. After gazing intothe Abyss of his own soul, he has no fear of gazing into yours, of reaching downand pulling up the sludge of your sins, draping them around your shoulders likea cloak, and never getting dirty himself in the process.In all the revivalism of pagan religions, shamanism, Wicca, Buddhism, Taoism,Hinduism and Tantra that has taken place alongside est, and neurolinguisticprogramming, and enneagrams, and the self-congratulatory seminars at Esalen, andthe new psychologies of Maslow, Perls, Adler, Grof, and others, all that New AgeCalifornia dreaming, the one medieval subject that has been studiously ignoredhas been ceremonial magic. Even alchemy has won its pride of place, due tovolumes of alchemical analysis by Jung and his followers, gaining credibilityand acceptance among the gentle, bearded, silently enraged men of the PacificNorthwest.But ceremonial magic is the black sheep of this earnestly sincere family of“alternative” beliefs and practices. It is too literal, too “hands on,” for anindustry that is more comfortable with ambiguity and theory. It seems to havemore demons than angels, and the Latin, Greek and Hebrew prayers and chants arefierce and aggressive and threatening, replete with curses and the waving ofswords. Yet the technology hidden among the conjurations and exorcisms of thegrimoires goes to the heart of psychology, alchemy and shamanism. The complexdoctrine of signatures and correspondences that forms the infrastructure ofceremonial magic is the key to the good-natured, well-intended but confusedtherapies of the New Age gurus.And, of course, it is also the key to the foul-natured, evil-intended programsof the military and intelligence organs of America and its allies and itsenemies.In order to understand fully what we mean by “the Manson Secret,” we mustexamine the technology of consciousness as it has been revealed in the course ofthis entire work. The reader must also be thanked for persevering on a long roadthat may have seemed confusing or obscure at various turns. It is hoped that thefollowing pages will put all of the previous chapters into sharper perspective.SPACE: THE FINAL FRONTIERThe ancient cultures of the world have not left us much in the way of writing.The earliest forms of the written language—Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptianhieroglyphics, and Chinese characters—did not make their appearance untilroughly five thousand years ago; but some of the world’s most astonishing featsof architectural engineering were built by cultures that did not have a writtenword. Stonehenge in England is a prime example, a neolithic monument that isdated to about 2800 B.c., or about the same time writing developed in the MiddleEast. The menhirs of northern France, the pyramids of Peru and China, and theburial mounds of North America are further examples of this phenomenon. What isimportant about this is the fact that these stone and earth structures werealigned astronomically, as even the toughest of critics among the scientists arenow forced to agree. More than that, however, is the actual location of many ofthese sites, for they occupy points on the surface of the earth that aremathematically significant or are built in dimensions that suggest a preciseknowledge of the curvature of the earth and the exact distance from the earth tothe sun. That such a perfect science could exist in the absence of a writtenlanguage or symbol system is startling enough … but that the ancientsdemonstrated a knowledge of everything from the precession of the equinoxes tothe circumference of the earth at different degrees of latitude indicates thatthey possessed a source of information unique to them, and which has been lostto history.However, when one speaks of the pyramids, for instance, and their relationshipto specific stars and then extrapolates from there to a presumption of thehistorical basis of ancient religions, one is apt to sound like a crank or atbest extremely credulous. Some of the brightest minds of the past hundred yearshave been castigated for holding theories in contradiction to those of organizedacademia, even though those theories were based on the same evidence availableto the professional historians, archaeologists and anthropologists of theirgeneration. What is usually lost in this bitter exchange is the acknowledgmentthat previous cultures held some of the same, “exploded,” theories and builttheir civilizations around them. This is the point that interests us here. As Ipointed out in Unholy Alliance, it is not necessary to believe in astrology tobelieve that the Nazis believed in it. In the case of sacred geometry and whatthe modern New Age movement calls “geomancy,” we have a case in point.Spaces can be considered sacred or demonic, and structures can be built in thosespaces to take advantage of the former or protect against the latter. We havethe examples in our own culture of the church and the haunted house: twobuildings at the opposite ends of the spiritual spectrum. In the case of thechurch, it is interesting to realize that many of the Gothic cathedrals ofFrance—for instance—were built on sites sacred to the pagans who had worshippedthere previously. Even St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome was built on the site of theMithraic tauroboleum, where bulls were sacrificed and initiates bathed in theirblood. The Cathedral of Chartres is a famous example of a Gothic structure builtover a pagan shrine, complete with a spring and a “black Madonna.” It is saidthat the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City is another suchexample.The orientation of sacred structures always follows strict guidelines, no matterwhat the religion or the country. In the Catholic Church, the altar is always inthe East, the place of the rising Sun. Worshippers enter from the West, theplace where the Sun “dies.” There are similar requirements in India—the systemof sacred architecture known as Vaastu—and in China, the now-popular systemknown as Feng Shui or “Wind and Water.” Many volumes have been written about theorientation of the pyramids of Egypt, some more credible than others; no matterhow one feels about some of the theories advanced for their design, no one candeny that the pyramids do follow a strict layout and orientation according tothe four cardinal points. The great stone circle at Stonehenge is acknowledgedto be a kind of astronomical calendar, as are many of the mound systems in NorthAmerica.This insistence on the precise design and placement of sacred structures is ameans of creating a microcosm, a perfect image of the entire world. To theEuropean initiates of the secret schools—such as the mysterious Fulcanelli,whose book on the Gothic cathedrals was seminal, and Schwaller de Lubicz, whosework “deciphering” the Egyptian temples is famous among a certain class ofEgyptologist—these buildings are books, meant to be read by those who have beenschooled in their “language.” From the perspective of the occultist of the lasthundred years or so, we are just beginning to understand sacred architecturenow; it would be a mistake to ignore its message only because we feel that suchedifices were the work of the scientifically naïve or of ignorant savagesmindlessly baying at the sight of the moon. The investment of time and resourcesin the creation of these monuments was enormous, stressing their respectivecultures to their limits. It was important for these peoples to do what theydid, to build the structures they did, and to orient them as precisely as theydid. To look at them as mere curiosities only demonstrates our ignorance, nottheirs.This is not to say that American architects have been totally ignorant of theidea of sacred geometry. As many authors have pointed out in the past— usuallyin those volumes of discarded science to which I have frequently referred—evenWashington, D.C. was designed according to arcane principles for themanipulation of secret forces. The same author whom we mentioned in the contextof the “green language”—the erudite David Ovason, also the author of the New Agebestseller The Zelator: The Secret History Behind History—has written The SecretArchitecture of Our Nation’s Capital. The Masonic and Rosicrucian (read“Templar”) influences are all there to be examined.Unfortunately, with all the recent volumes that have been written on the subjectof arcane geometry and sacred architecture, there seems to be very little in theway of explanation regarding just how these vast machines of stone and earthworkwere to be “used.” Some scholars have risked their reputations in support of theidea of a kind of sophisticated paleo-astronomy which was linked to architectureand the erection of huge buildings in accordance with a secret tradition—thePyramids of Gizeh arranged like the constellation Orion, for instance, withopenings in their faces placed in order to capture the rays of distant stars.Yet the fact that these buildings are bare of written explication means that wecan only guess at their true purpose. It’s a bit like looking at an elevator forthe first time: we can see it’s a small room with a door that closes, and a setof numbers on a kind of magic plate next to the door, but unless we canassociate that little room with the number of floors in the building, and fromthere to finding the machinery of cables and pulleys that would levitate theroom, floor by floor, and the openings at each floor that would allow the roomto access them, we will be at a loss to describe its function. In the case ofthe Pyramids at Gizeh, we have the small room and we have the dimensions of thePyramid, the various shafts, the mathematical relationship of the Pyramid to thecircumference of the earth at that latitude, and the relationship of the size ofthe Pyramid to the distance between the sun and the earth … but we have no ideaof its function. We have not seen the elevator “move.”In the case of the Gothic cathedrals, we have at least some very suggestivestatues and stone carvings that, albeit obscurely, can point us in somedirection and give us some hint as to their function. To Fulcanelli (and, later,Louis Charpentier), the message of the cathedrals was alchemical in nature, anallegory describing the steps to be taken in the Great Work: the perfection ofthe soul, the refinement of its grosser elements, and its alignment—like apyramid—to a distant Star. Jung understood alchemy to be a form ofpsychoanalysis, a means of achieving psychic integration through the use of asymbol system incorporating many of the archetypal elements he had discovered inhis own work. Thus, we can jump from the alchemical allegory of Fulcanelli tothe psychological allegory of Jung to get at least the beginning of an answer tothe mysteries of the Gothic cathedrals.But can a “sacred space” also be dangerous? Can it be sinister?When I studied the life of Charles Manson and found several links to Indianmounds—from Ashland, Kentucky to Chillicothe, Ohio and Moundsville, WestVirginia—it occurred to me that burial mounds are the haunted houses of Americanprehistory. While they were sacred to the Adena and Hopewell cultures that builtthem—places of burial and of astronomical orientation and ritualobservances—they might very well be inimical to outsiders. In addition, some ofthe ancient sites were possibly erected by outsiders to the American shores:Phoenicians, according to Barry Fell, or Celts; Druids, perhaps, or Irish monks.(That there was a large “Mound Culture” in neolithic Europe is by now acceptedby most archaeologists and historians; the mounds of Asia and South America arenow coming to light, as well.) There is no way to know for sure how theirrituals were conducted, or to what gods or goddesses. It is a distinctpossibility that some of these practices may have migrated to America onforgotten waves of tentative immigration centuries—if not millennia—beforeColumbus, even though this transports us back to the disturbing fictions of H.P.Lovecraft.But how to connect the burial—and other—mounds of America to something ascontemporary as serial murder and the Manson Family? That does seem to be quitea stretch. Oddly enough, it is a theme that has begun to influence Americanliterature, particularly of the horror variety, although it is nowherearticulated to the extent it has been here.Stephen King, in The Shining, describes the Overlook Hotel which is the scene ofmurder and mayhem in his novel as built over an Indian burial mound. In the filmPoltergeist, a housing development is found to be erected over another Indianburial mound, with ensuing supernatural events including hauntings, possession,and poltergeist activity. In 2003’s Identity, starring John Cusak, a motel whichis a scene of murder and mayhem and also a platform for working out acomplicated plot involving multiple personality disorder is likewise built onthe site of Indian burial mounds. A hotel, a housing development, and a motel.Possession, hauntings and MPD. Burial mounds in all three. It would seem thatawareness of a link between these phenomena is moving just beneath the consciousthreshhold of American culture, looking for a way to make itself better knownand understood. It may be nothing more than a kind of repressed guilt over thetreatment of the Native Americans, manifesting as an evil force that threatensour lives and our sanity. Or it may be something else.Another early 21st century production, the 2002 European film Darkness, starringLena Olin and Anna Paquin, treats this subject in even deeper terms: set in ahouse in Spain that was built according to occult specifications to evoke thegod of Evil, a house haunted by the ghosts of six slain children, and a ritualthat can only be performed during a particular solar eclipse that occurs onlyonce every forty years; the slain children laid in a circle, their heads towardsthe center and their legs extending outside, like the burials in the Indianmounds of America, the Cathar burials, the bodies found at Waco. This film isfictional, of course, but the occult details are remarkably coherent: artists,as in the Lovecraft tale, sensing the forces at work before the rest of us.The old Clovis migration theory that has dominated American archaeology for solong is now on the verge of being exploded. Archaeological finds in SouthAmerica have gone a long way to disproving the dates used for the Clovispeoples, wreaking havoc with the timeline. Something was going on in Americalong before the arrival of Columbus. Successive waves of European migrationafter 1492 trampled on the sacred sites of unknown civilizations. Early pioneersremarked on the appearance of “Indians” with blue eyes and blonde hair, or“Indians” speaking, incredibly, Welsh.Adena and Hopewell artifacts show raptorial birds, objects found in the sameareas as modern sightings of the Mothman and other creatures of dubious origin.Our early forefathers in New England were obsessed with religion and occultismto an alarming degree. They brought slaves and indentured servants from Africaand South America, people who brought their own religious sensitivities withthem and who would have looked at the mounds and other prehistoric evidence froma perspective different from their white owners’. The founder of the Mormonreligion was himself a ceremonial magician, using the same grimoires thatgenerations of European occultists had used before him to conjure spirits andcommand demons. He used this magic at the site of another mound, and thereby“discovered” the plates on which he claimed the Book of Mormon was written.There is something about the American landscape that elicits a superstitiousresponse in its inhabitants. Writers like Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe,and H.P. Lovecraft created bodies of work that are appreciated more in Europethan in America: stories of early American witchcraft and superstition, linkedwith flamboyant deaths, murders, and mysteries, ancient cultures, and visitorsfrom the stars. It is startling, and a little unnerving, to see the extent towhich these gothic horrors have found expression in modern American historicaland political events. America itself is a housing development built over aseries of “Indian” burial mounds, a development erected largely with the aid ofAfrican slaves, so it should come as no surprise when our children becomederanged, violent, and possessed. An alien past has come to haunt us, so itshould come as no surprise when we confront demons we do not recognize,demanding sacrifice we do not understand.The medieval grimoires have told us that the best places for an operation ofceremonial magic is the abandoned building or ruined church, the cemetery, or acrossroads at midnight. In other words, a place of ghosts and hauntings, of tabuand desecration, or a place of fateful decision. In pagan Europe, Hecate—thegoddess of witchcraft—was the goddess of the crossroads. In Haitian voudoun, thecrossroads are sacred to Baron Samedi, he who guides one into the Underworld. Acrossroads, à la Lovecraft, is a place “between,” an intersection point of theley lines that are said to run through the earth, channeling its telluric energyat those very sites where the sacred monuments were erected: Stonehenge andNewgrange, the Pyramids and the ziggurats, the Gothic cathedrals and the burialmounds. Asian culture is similarly concerned with the flow of this putativeenergy, as demonstrated by their adherence to frankly mystical practices such asvaastu and feng shui. America, ignoring these ideas, has seen fit to buildprisons and military bases at the sites of the burial mounds: Chillicothe,Moundsville, Wright-Patterson … In other places, the burial mounds have sat inthe center of horrible events, such as the mounds at Ashland, Kentucky; noattempt was ever made to placate or pacify whatever spiritual forces may existin those places, if only to appease the consciences of the European settlers whohad evicted the previous inhabitants to build their farms, their houses, theirsaloons and banks. And prisons.If America was truly settled by Asians who had walked across the land-bridgejoining Siberia with Alaska—the Clovis argument—then it stands to reason theywould have brought their religion and their magic with them. It would haveoffered them a sense of identity and cohesiveness as they trekked thousands ofmiles in an inhospitable climate into unknown territory. As they walked in thedirection of the rising sun, they might have been seeking the source of lightand life itself. We know very little of what they practiced, and can only referto the shamanism of Siberia and the Taoism of China for clues. Both of thesecults were (and are) stellar-oriented, with myths containing the element of aladder leading up a central pole into the heavens, a pole that linked the worldabove and the world below with this world; if nothing else, it was the leitmotifof the pyramids and the ziggurats.If, on the other hand, America was also settled by refugees or explorers ortraders from Europe and North Africa, then we have a better idea of the faithsthey brought with them, which would have included the unknown astronomicalbeliefs of the builders of Stonehenge or the astrology cults of the Middle East.In either case, an awareness of astronomy and its association with architectureand sacred buildings and sites would have been an essential part of theircosmology, as well as provided the technology of spiritual transformation(either of the individual or of the whole tribe), and would have included abelief in magic and the cultivation—in their shamans—of the “heightened states”mentioned by Penrose and Hameroff thousands of years later in their presentationbefore the Defense Department, states that are capable of exerting an influenceover reality itself.The academically-neglected rituals of European ceremonial magic are clear aboutthe importance of the ritual site, and its careful preparation. They are clearabout what the LSD prophets would later refer to as “set and setting”: thecreation of a specific environment to elicit a specific psychological response.The experiments of Ewen Cameron in Montreal also included the carefulmanipulation of the environment of his subjects. What these latter-day shamansignored was the second integral part of the technology of consciousness: time.TIME: OUT OF MINDAs may be expected of cultures that placed a tremendous value on theastronomical orientation of their sacred structures, the notion of time andperiodicity was inextricably linked to notions of sacred space, and both wereessential to their religions. Early on, the ancients demonstrated a sureknowledge of the solstices and equinoxes. The pre-literate culture that createdStonehenge was able to arrange that massive stone circle in such a way that itcould be used to calculate the solstice sunrise. This was important to acivilization that depended on agriculture, for they could compute the seasons ofplanting and harvesting according to the length of the solar year, although wedo not know for sure if that was the use to which Stonehenge was put.Admittedly, we can think of no other use unless the calendar was important forother reasons, such as for some unknown ritual calculations.In the case of the Great Pyramid at Gizeh, however, the precise astronomical andgeophysical design and placement of that structure cannot have had anything todo with seasons of planting and harvesting, which were determined by theinundations of the Nile. There was obviously something much more profound takingplace in the minds of the Pyramid architects, something that was alsoresponsible for the spate of pyramid-manufacture throughout the world at roughlythe same time, as discussed by Dr. Robert M. Schoch of Boston University inVoyages of the Pyramid Builders: The True Origins of the Pyramids from LostEgypt to Ancient America,2 and by anthropologist William F. Romain in Mysteriesof the Hopewell: Astronomers, Geometers, and Magicians of the EasternWoodlands.3The astronomical alignments of these monuments and the prevalence of tombs in ornear them indicates an association of sacred spaces with the “travels” of thedead into the heavens, what Romain calls the “azimuths of the underworld.”Romain identifies three different types of sacred geometry in use by theHopewell peoples: the square, the circle, and the octagon. The square hebelieves was used by the builders of the mounds to indicate the heavens, thecircle for the earth, and the octagon for the phases of the moon. While there isnot enough space to go into all of Romain’s calculations and other evidence, itis enough to say that he provides a compelling argument for the orientation ofthe various Hopewell mounds as a means of facilitating the transport of thesouls of the dead to the Afterlife, which, in this case as in the case ofancient China, ancient Egypt, etc., meant outer space. In other words, theHopewell mounds (and, perhaps the Adena mounds as well) were a type of machine,a technology for extraterrestrial travel. And the travel could go both ways.The alignments of the mounds—and, again, of the pyramids of variouscivilizations including the Egyptian, the Sumerian, the Aztec, the Chinese, thePeruvian, etc.—are all to very specific points on the horizon. In somecases—perhaps most cases—these alignments are to the rising and setting sun atthe winter and summer solstices. In other cases, they may be to the rising andsetting sun at the spring and fall equinoxes. In still other cases, they are tothe maximum and minimum rising and setting of the moon. In one or two specialcases, we even have instances of the orientation of some of these monuments tothe cross-quarter days, the days midway between the solstices and equinoxes.Always, however, the orientation of these structures is in a sacred space andoriented to a sacred time.In the case of the American mounds, we know very little about the religion andcosmology of their creators, except where revealed by the very structuresthemselves, which are huge and represent the investment of tremendous resourcesin their design and erection. Found within the Hopewell mounds in various sitesacross the American midwest—in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana—are artifacts that arecompelling in their design, which seem to be focused on the square and onvariations of the theme of four corners or four directions. Among these is theswastika.Although commonly associated with the Nazis, the swastika is an ancient symbolthat was known in India, China, northern Europe, the Caucasus, and in North andSouth America as well. Pieces of copper cut into swastika shapes have been foundin various mound sites. It was one of the “proofs” that the crankanthropologists of the SS-Ahnenerbe used to justify their claim that at one timethe Aryan race was in control of the entire globe and had penetrated to itsfurthest reaches. Discoveries of swastika-decorated pottery and potsherds havebeen found in the Taklimakan desert of western China as well as in Tibet, and inthe burial mounds of America.When Charles Manson carved a swastika into his forehead, was he invoking thehorrors of the Third Reich, or was he evoking an ancient Adena or Hopewelldeity, something from beneath the burial mounds in his home town of Ashland,Kentucky; something that may have possessed his spirit one evil night when hismother was at the bar, picking up another “uncle” while she left little Charlieoutside, alone, prey to the demons of hunter-gatherers, worshippers of theraptorial bird?While it is fashionable to speak of the people of these civilizations aspeaceful agrarians, that is not necessarily the complete picture. Burialevidence in some of these mounds raises suspicions that the bodies interred werenot always the result of death from old age, sickness, or accident. Further, theorientation of charnel houses to specific points on the horizon which would onlybecome “activated” by the passage of a celestial body once in a year or, in thecase of some of the lunar placements, once in every nine years, suggests anotherline of questioning: were human beings killed, sacrificed, at specific times tocoincide with the rising or setting of the sun, the moon, or a star?We have seen that many of the serial murders carried out by the Son of Sam cult,the Zodiac killer, etc. took place on days special to the calendar used by theseancient Americans (as well as by European pagans and occultists). This may havebeen accidental—“coincidental”—but their number suggests otherwise. We have alsoseen how often the mounds themselves appear in our narrative of the cases ofCharles Manson, Squeaky Fromme, and others. Chillicothe itself, one of theforemost mound sites in America, is the site of a federal prison which hasboasted not only Charles Manson among its guests but also serial killer HenryLee Lucas (and who knows how many others?). Another mound site, of possibly lessimportance, lies in Beaumont, Texas—a site that shows up in both the Son of Samcase as well as in the Henry Lee Lucas case. According to Lucas, the “Hand ofDeath” cult that he insisted existed in Texas, and was responsible for murdersthroughout the United States, was based in or around Beaumont at one point, andwas responsible for the murder of a lawyer there. Beaumont is a suburb ofHouston, and is where Sam cultist John Carr’s ex-wife lived with their daughter.Berkowitz visited Beaumont when he obtained the famous .44 Charter Arms Bulldogrevolver that was used in the Sam killings. Houston has been identified in theSam literature as a cult center for the group rivalling Los Angeles; Minot,North Dakota; and New York City.According to Beaumont: A Guide to the City and Its Environs “compiled andwritten by the Federal Writers’ Project of the Work Projects Administration inthe State of Texas” and published circa 1939, the area had been home to a tribeof Native Americans known as the Attacapas. This name, we are informed, comesfrom the Choctaw words hatak (man) and apa (eats). In other words, they werecannibals. On page 25, the anonymous but federally-funded writers go on tostate,They told of a deluge that once destroyed the world except for those people wholived on high land. The women of the tribe, using the shoulder blades of buffalofor spades, were made to build great earthern [sic] mounds with their hands, andatop these mounds the big chiefs had their lodges.Some of these mounds still exist in the Beaumont area, or did at the time thebook was compiled.Thus, we have cannibals and mound-builders in the same breath. We are told thatthe Attacapas (like the ancient Sumerians) believed their origin was in the sea,so they tended to stay near the water as much as possible, building their moundson the banks of the Neches River that winds through Beaumont like gentlepersuasion. In fact, the Attacapas mounds are the only evidence of amound-building culture in the entire State of Texas, aside from a set of moundson a farm near Nagodoches.Beaumont is probably not so well-known today as it was in the 1930s when thebook was written. On January 10, 1901, oil was discovered at Beaumont—at the nowfamous Spindletop oil fields—and history was made: Texas became an oil state,and the fortunes of George DeMohrenschildt, the Hunt brothers, the Bush family,and so many others were in the process of being made. “Spindletop” becameanonymous with wealth and prosperity and conspicuous consumption, as any of uswho may remember the old Spindletop restaurant in Manhattan can safely attest.Strange, then, that the place that gave America its oil wealth and oil baronsshould also be the place where cannibals and mound-builders, satanists andserial killers would have come calling; for in the age of the Attacapas (or“Attakapas”) Indians there was no wealth to be had in oil, and in the days ofHenry Lee Lucas and the Son of Sam, Beaumont had fallen from its old glory days:the fields were dry, and the mounds had all but disappeared.The Chinese word for “coincidence” is composed of two characters, fu and he. Thefirst character, fu, means “symbol” and is the same character used to representfuzhou, or the name given to Taoist magic symbols and occult incantations. Thesecond character, he, is familiar to me from my work abroad, as it appears inthe ever-present hetong or “contract”: it means “to join” or “to combine” even“to agree” or “to be equal to.” Thus, the Chinese term for “coincidence”actually means “symbols joined together” or “combined symbols” or even, perhaps,“symbols that agree with each other.”Thus, we see the theme of Giordano Bruno and the other Renaissance occultistsreprised in this simple combination of characters from half a world away:coincidence as symbols combined. Coincidence as evidence of magical forces, oreven as a kind of agreement or contract: a covenant. The Latin word forsacrament—used these days in its ecclesiastical sense to refer to specificrituals such as communion, confirmation, and penance—originally meant a“contract,” or an “oath taken by soldiers.” The “Holy Sacrament” in Catholicterminology refers specifically to the consecrated Host of the Mass, the whitewafer that represents, that is, the Body of Christ, and which represents a NewCovenant between God and humanity.I only point this out to show how pervasive certain concepts are, regardless ofculture, race or religion: that the rituals performed by Chinese sorcerers andCatholic priests have at their heart an understanding that there is anagreement, a contract, between human beings and spiritual forces, and that therituals themselves are representative of this. To take this one step further,may we suggest that the phenomenon of coincidence is an indication that justsuch a “contract” is in effect? We have already seen that there is a clearrelationship between ritual (the “heightened states” of Penrose and Hameroff )and coincidence, a dynamic that works at the sub-atomic, quantum level. We havealso seen that the doctrine of signatures or correspondences is an integral partof all magic ritual. Is this Hermetic concept what is understood by the term“contract” or “covenant”? After all, in a Christian context, Jesus promised St.Peter, “What you seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven, what you loose onearth shall be loosed in heaven.” Is this the New Testament version of “asabove, so below”?The Chinese also believed in sacred space and sacred time, and more elaboratelycreated entire technologies for traveling in “heightened states” to the stars.At the time the CIA was investigating these same methods, R. Gordon Wasson hadalready sampled the “magic mushroom” (known as “God’s flesh”) in a small villagein Mexico and written about his experience in Life magazine, prompting ascientist on a CIA contract to accompany Wasson on his next trip. Thisfascination with psychotropic substances was to prompt Wasson’s study of thehallucinogenic mushroom’s influence over religious and mystical experience theworld over, a perspective that was adopted by Allegro in The Sacred Mushroom andthe Cross, and by Timothy Leary in his experiments with LSD-25. What was notwell known at the time—but has become better understood now with the renewedinterest among archaeologists in American prehistory—is that these samemushrooms (versions of Amanita muscaria) were in use among the mound buildercultures, where carved effigies of the mushroom have been found in the burialsites.This association of the hallucinogenic mushroom with the sacred sites indicatesa reverence for the psychedelic experience and a context of sacred space andsacred time surrounding its use. To researchers like William F. Romain, it is anindication of the beliefs of the prehistoric peoples of America in the creationand use of the mound structures as a gateway to other worlds, a gateway thatcould be used in both directions. The conjunction of lunar, solar and stellarearthworks in early America with the use of psychotropics and ritual lead us tothe conclusion that the early Americans—possibly, but not definitively, theancestors of the present-day Native Americans—had a technology for otherworldly“travel” (such as remote viewing) of a type which eventually came to theattention of our military and intelligence agencies, and which would have led tosocial organization and control of these early peoples such as the Adena and theHopewell in line with extraterrestrial forces (as the design and orientation oftheir sacred structures to the stars instructs us).This ancient American preoccupation with the stars—a consuming interest that isparalleled in virtually every other ancient civilization—found its apotheosis inthe Postwar appearance of The Nine. We would not be talking about this event atall, had it not been for the participation of some of America’s most notablefamilies in this series of séances taking place in Glen Cove, Maine. We wouldnot be talking about this event at all had it not been for the organization ofthese séances under an Army captain who was responsible for paranormal, chemicaland biological research during the Korean War. A man who worked for Dr. LaurenceLayton, the father of the only convicted Jonestown murderer.The message of The Nine—that it was an extraterrestrial force hovering over theearth in a flying saucer of some kind and that it intended to guide a generationof human beings in expanded consciousness—was something that Andrija Puharichtook very much to heart, so much so that twenty years later he was still talkingabout it, this time to Uri Geller and the people at SRI who worked on DefenseDepartment contracts in remote viewing. As we recall, one of the originalmembers of the séance that contacted The Nine was Arthur Young, thefather-in-law of one of the Kennedy assassination personalities, Ruth Paine. (Itwas to Arthur Young that Puharich would take Geller, Einhorn and Sarfatti twentyyears after the original seance.)One wonders: was the assassination of John F. Kennedy something in line with theagenda of The Nine? After all the discussion we have entertained here on thesubject of coincidence and synchronicity, it would be foolish to ignore therelationship between a charter member of The Nine and the family of the allegedassassin of the President of the United States. It strains credulity to thebreaking-point to simply assert that the fact that Lee and Marina Oswald livedwith Arthur Young’s daughter-in-law, a woman who visited Young only two monthsbefore the assassination, is pure “coincidence,” a mere accident of history withno meaning. Yet, we are puzzled by the eminence of Arthur Young and his wife,Ruth Forbes Paine Young, among the New Age philosophers of the American Postwarera. There is no mystery about Arthur Young’s contribution to the defenseestablishment; his invention of what would become the Bell Helicopter would havefar-reaching effects, through the Vietnam War and beyond. To his credit, heabandoned the military-industrial establishment shortly after the end of WorldWar II to devote himself to the philosophical questions that haunted his wakinghours.Yet, he managed to obtain for his son-in-law—Michael Paine—a position with BellAerospace, a company that was being run by the former Nazi General Dornberger.All of this leads us to wonder if we have been mistaken in our belief that thefield of alternative religion, mysticism, and the paranormal was solely thedomain of the Beats, the hippies, yippies, and other counterculture types thatproliferated during the 1960s on a wave of acid and angst. The ChristianFundamentalists would have us believe that the New Age is a work of Satan, andthat it represents the Left in America. But mysticism has rarely been the focusof the Left anywhere.As we have seen, the Nazis (at least, in the form of their most rabid devotees,the SS) were ardent occultists and mystics. These were the same people who werewooed by the American Right after the war, brought to the United States andprotected by prominent Republicans even as prominent Democrats—like HelenGahagan Douglas and Eleanor Roosevelt—were arguing for their arrest andprosecution. Many of the individuals who claim to have been approached by TheNine or by their representatives—men like Jack Sarfatti, Andrija Puharich,Arthur Young, Walter Breen, etc.—worked for the military-industrial complex atsome point in their lives, if not for long periods at a time. Whether they didthis as convinced members of the Right, or simply because that is where the jobswere, is actually not relevant to our case. What is relevant is that this iswhere they wound up, deliberately or not, intersecting with some of the mostimportant and pivotal events and personalities of the Postwar era. Men whoattended séances with The Nine, who heard metallic voices on the phone, knockson the walls, and who spent murky months or years of their childhoods at “secretschools.”THE TECHNOLOGY OF SOCIOPATHSThese were not the men, however, who found their personalities splitting, a gunor knife in their hands, blood on their clothes. These men went on to lead livesof privileged sanity. It was the other group of individuals who came to theforefront of America’s attention: the sociopaths who formed cults and sought themassive initiation of the planet in their own perverse secret societies, the menwho used the tools of the magician like the famous Sorcerer’s Apprentice andwrought chaos and destruction all around, to the edification of the men in thelab suits and government grants who were busy refining the very same techniques.The use of hallucinogens by Charles Manson and those around him leads us to viewwhat he was doing with his “Family” in a more specific way. Previously, it wasthought that Manson and his “hippie” followers were simply following the generaltrend inspired by Leary of “turning on, tuning in, and dropping out,” and wereusing psychedelics as an escape, or a crutch, or as a source of cheap mysticalexperience. But the combination of Manson’s Scientology and occult training inprison (including his contact with the Process and possibly the OTO), hishorrific childhood experiences, his compulsive sexuality, and the use of LSD andother hallucinogens in specifically ritual circumstances suggests another agendaentirely. He was conscious of the uses to which hallucinogens could be put, andhe himself underwent an LSD-assisted “crucifixion” in the California desert, aswe have seen. The breakdown of the psyches of his followers throughindoctrination, sex, and drugs, coupled with the creation of alternatepersonalities, the removal of his followers to isolated encampments far fromcity centers, his insistence that they commit criminal acts like stealing,fraud, etc. to further isolate them psychologically from society, and themanipulation of their memories so that they began to view their childhoods assomething evil and “programmed,” all contributed to their creation as murderousrobots who would do anything to please “Charlie.”Manson’s doctrine of an imminent race war in which whites and blacks would be ateach others’ throats was merely a reprise of the Gnostic doctrine of the war ofLight and Darkness, made vulgar and devalued by identifying the races as thewarring factors but, ironically, more accessible to his innocent listeners byusing racial color as an indicator of spiritual worth. After all, skin color isa uniform you cannot change; there is no defection possible from race, which iswhy racism has been kept alive for so long and with such hideous consequences.Mansonism is a peculiarly American form of Nazism, of fascism. It was born inthe streets of Ashland, Kentucky and reared in the reformatories and prisons ofthe heartland among the poor, dispossessed class we cavalierly categorize as“poor white trash,” but which contains in its bloodlines the heritage of thefirst English settlers: religious refugees and criminals fleeing persecution whocarved a hardscrabble life in the hollers and later the coal mines of WestVirginia and Kentucky. Like many a Skinhead of Europe and America, Manson was awhite man who felt he had been cheated of his birthright, and who was preparedto take matters into his own hands in order to achieve some kind of parity, ifnot superiority. The fact that he was short in stature, of limited education andbizarre appearance, was both an obstacle to his becoming even more powerful thanhe was, and an asset among the young women who were drawn to him and who feltunthreaten by his demeanor and attitude. In addition, he understoodinstinctively the value of associating with Hollywood celebrities, for there areno better manipulators of images than Hollywood directors, producers,screenwriters and actors. Hollywood has a power that has still not beenthoroughly appreciated and dissected by social critics, because to fullyunderstand Hollywood one must understand the discarded sciences.Manson did, to a large extent, understand these sciences and what they couldoffer the man who could use the technology to create a New World Order out ofthe flotsam and jetsam of America’s youth. Everything we have seen in printabout Manson’s philosophy has shown it to be derivative and weak, a hodge-podgeof jargon from various disciplines half-learned and half-invented. It didn’thave to be sophisticated; it only had to be immediate, forceful and raw. Whatcould seem more real, more edgy and avant-garde, than a lifelong prisoner turnedmystic and revolutionary? A sort of poor man’s Jean Genet? What was there, afterall, that made Manson different from Jim Jones, for instance? They both espouseda philosophy that was part alternative religion, part revolutionary politics,and used the force of their cults of personality to convince others that theywere reincarnations of gods, meanwhile focusing attention on racial issues; theydrew their followers from the streets, literally, preaching an amalgam ofMarxism and Manichaenism, and both would eventually instigate mass slaughterswhile fueled by apocalyptic visions.It was important to both Manson and Jones to keep their followers off balance,through poor diet, erratic schedules (disruption of the body’s circadianrhythms), the breakdown of sexual identity through forced sex acts with membersof the opposite sex, the same sex, and with Manson and Jones themselves. Mansonincorporated drugs into this repertoire for a more complete dereglement de tousle sens, and both men created a bunker-like mentality among their followers byinsisting that outside forces were bent on their destruction and could not betrusted. Both men created a very specific spiritual context for all of thisthrough their diatribes on religious and mystical themes laced liberally withsexual and political references.At the same time that Manson cultivated Hollywood celebrities, Jones cultivatedpolitical leaders on a local and national scale. Had Jones and Manson managed tolink up, they would have made a formidable pair, covering all the social andpolitical bases. But sociopaths rarely work together.The “technology” of sociopaths, however, was found to be amenable to consciouscontrol and emulation. What Manson and Jones were doing was nothing that was notalready understood by the experimental psychology programs of the CIA and itssub-contractors. They had been performing such operations for quite some time.We have the hypnosis experiments as recounted by Estabrooks and others; the LSDexperiments that had taken place in prisons and mental hospitals and militarybases; and, of course, the whole panoply of psychological warfare operationsthrough the past decades. The Army had experimented with a psychotropic drugknown as BZ (a “phenylglycollate ester of 3-quinuclidinol” which was termed a“hallucinogenic chemical warfare agent”) in Vietnam, at Bong-san in March of1966, 4an event that was fictionalized in the film Jacob’s Ladder.The “contribution” of people like Manson and Jones was the revelation thatmasses of people could be made to do almost anything if their psyches had beenmanipulated through the use of image and emotion: the technology of magic anderos. The sexual component of the Manson Secret is very important: it providesthe energy by means of which the links—the interconnectedness between events,people, objects, ideas—may be “activated.” This is very old, very standardoccult practice even if it is not always explained as such in the grimoires.After all, in many cases the magician uses eros to forge links with objects andideas in his own unconscious, without the intermediary of other people. This wasconsidered to be a grave secret, for it would enable virtually anyone to contactthe “sinister forces” independently. Such a person would be virtuallyinvulnerable to surveillance, unlike a group of people meeting for rituals,training, etc., a group that could be penetrated by a government agent or anInquisitor.But men like Manson and Jones need an audience; they need a group, for they needthe power of the group. Their psychology is messianic; it’s no fun being God ifno one knows it but you. Their purpose was to replace the existing powerstructures with one of their own, and for that reason their doctrines werealmost always self-defeating. Their philosophy was impure: their goal was notthe spiritual liberation of individuals or even the emancipation of theproletariat, but the creation of a theocracy based on their own, personalrevelation. These were cynical men, beholden to another force from which theytook their orders. In Jones’ case, it seems he was working for the CIA; theinformation in Book II demonstrates that. His relationship with Dan Mitrionedemonstrates that.In Manson’s case, the votes aren’t in yet, but the details of the Tate andLaBianca killings strongly suggest specific motives for those crimes that mayhave had little to do with Manson personally, being contract hits. These weremen who could use the Manson Secret effortlessly, pragmatically, and cynically:a new brand of covert operative who hides in plain sight, committingassassinations thick with plausible deniability. The individuals who followedthem were only a means to an end. In this, they are what other magicians likeCrowley would have termed “black brothers”: magicians who have confused theirown illumination (and, it must be insisted, a genuine spiritual illumination)with the Ultimate Truth, and their own egos with divinity. They were notprepared to sacrifice their egos completely, to “take the oath of the Abyss” andrenounce everything in the Long, Dark Night of the Soul. Instead, their powersturned inward and rancid. They became demons that feasted on human blood:spiritual entities, to be sure, and powerful, but of such an evil nature thatthey are not exactly poster-boys for the New Age.The American intelligence and defense establishments were not concerned withthat, however. They only wanted to know how all of this was done.They wanted to understand—and employ—the Manson Secret.The secret, as employed by Manson, seems simple:First, the removal of subjects to a “sacred space” in the desert, with attendingisolation from society; breakdown of personality through drugs and sex and “mindgames”; bestowal of alternate personality or personalities (new names like“Squeaky,” “Sadie,” etc.) operative only in relation to Manson, thus becomingManson’s “alternates,” like multiple personalities of Manson himself;identification of an external evil—the police, the blacks, etc.—as a threat tothe group. And fear is the key element of the Manson Secret that makes itdifferent from other initiatory or shamanistic practices. “Get the fear,” Mansonis known to have encouraged more than once. There is life only within theFamily; outside is death and loss of identity. Identity is race, and gender, anddevotion to the leader, the Führerprinzip. Family is reinforced through crimescommitted together, through mutual sex, and through paranormal experiences.Leadership is tantamount to divinity: Manson is a son of God. The paranoia ofthe occultist becomes the paranoia of the social outcast, the prisoner, thecriminal, the junkie, the murderer. Murder is a form of human sacrifice inManson’s gestalt, and commission of the murder makes a Family member “made,” asin the Mafia, as in the Son of Sam cult.Manson has thus brought together elements of Scientology and the Process, alongwith the Crowleyan “Do what thou wilt,” and crystallized them in the persona ofan outlaw. The development of “heightened states” among his followers causedthem to experience the world and reality so differently that the cohesiveness ofthe original Family members still exists: those that have abandoned the Familyhave become born-again Christians or some type of mystic, i.e., they have notreally abandoned the path that Manson set them on. While serial killers areshamans who have not made it back, Manson Family members are a programmedshaman: i.e., people chosen from society at random and forced to go through theshamanistic experience even though they were not ready and their guru was notprepared for the responsibility; thus, the CIA’s mind-control experiments weremirror images of what Manson was doing to his followers in the desert. They wereboth forcing individuals to go through an initiatory experience, the differencebeing that with Manson there was at least the context of a religious or mysticalnature—however eclectic or wrong-headed and undeveloped—which the CIAexperiments lacked.With the Manson Family you had a tribe of shamans who were willing participants,and that made them stronger. With the CIA, you had unwitting guinea pigs whowere only useful to the extent that the programming was effective and focused ona single target or targets, such as assassination. Sirhan Sirhan might have madea good Family member: he had already tried Rosicrucianism and Theosophy inSouthern California and was walking in Manson’s footsteps, but he had no socialgroup for reinforcement; instead, he most likely had a controller and a singletarget. Sirhan was as much an outsider as Manson, due to his Palestinianbackground and his thwarted dreams of becoming a jockey, etc. Like Manson, heturned to occultism and mysticism for answers. Like Manson, he became amurderer, except that in Sirhan’s case he was likely programmed to kill bysomeone who saw in him the same elements as a Mansonoid, and knew that Sirhanwould do as instructed.How can we draw such a strong comparison? The dates for Manson and Sirhan areonly one year apart, in the same city, and they shared the same cell (albeit ayear apart), built especially for Sirhan and occupied later by Manson. Manson’svictims included the actress Sharon Tate; Sharon Tate had dinner with RobertKennedy the night he was assassinated by Sirhan. The coincidences link the twomurderers as they do the two victims. The alchemical/ hermetic path ofinitiatory death and transformation was consciously applied by Manson, even tothe extent of an LSD-assisted crucifixion in the desert; one of his members hadparticipated in rituals with the Church of Satan, and Sharon Tate’s husband hadfilmed Rosemary’s Baby while Sharon herself was rumored to have been initiatedinto witchcraft by Alex Saunders. Manson had been audited in prison by aScientologist who later turned up around Squeaky Fromme. The initiatic elementsbehind Manson are many; they are reprised in the Son of Sam case, and in manyothers (such as Matamoros, the Zodiac Killers, etc.).This is the Manson Secret: the use and abuse of hermetic and initiatic(shamanic) processes as a means of manipulation of individuals and groups; therecognition that within the initiatic process is a wealth of psychologicalknowledge and technique that can be used for evil as well as for good; theincorporation of Fear as a substitute for Faith.The Manson Secret is black magic, and it was black magic that informed the CIA’smind-control programs as well. These same processes are being used— virtuallywithout change—among terrorist organizations and revolutionary cells throughoutthe world, who have realized that the most effective tool for violent action isthe properly initiated cult member. Ecstasy is just another face of fanaticism;eros is another face of magic. Fascism is the natural environment for both, forit speaks directly to the passions and the unconscious mind, through the use ofsymbols, repetitive slogans, and group ritual; i.e., magic. Socialism, beingmore cerebral, lacks the erotic element so necessary for mass appeal. Maochanged that for a while by ignoring Marx’s dictum against creating a “cult ofpersonality” and turned himself into an image, a magical link to the eternal.Transmute the ecstasy or the eros to a high pitch of passionate dedication to acause, and use the theory of the magical link competently, and you have createdan assassin, or a priest, a lover, an actor; or a politician who cannot bestopped except by a bullet.Many of our most infamous cults have been apocalyptic: that is, they fueled thepassion and the anxiety of their followers through identification with a givendate, a point in time. This point was to be the end of time, the end of history,the end of the world. This apocalypse point was central to the thinking of bothManson and Jim Jones, as well as so many other cults, including some of theChristian Fundamentalist sects that have been predicting the end times for somany years it has lost its allure. The Jehovah’s Witnesses have been makingspecific predictions, as have many others. As pointed out by Picknett andPrince, even The Nine have not been averse to millennial fevers, scheduling anevent at the Great Pyramid of Gizeh for the turn of the millennium that wassomehow called off at the last moment due to machinations behind the scenesinvolving the Egyptian Museum.The point is that while the cults have identified their sacred space—theirtemple, ashram, cave in the mountains or shack in the desert—they also needed asense of urgency, an idea that revolution was around the corner, a sense offear. They sought to transcend the kind of sacred time represented by thepyramids, Stonehenge, the Indian mounds: a time that is cyclical, reliable,permanent. They needed to extend their boundaries beyond sacred time to aprofane time, a demonic time. For the Son of Sam cult and others like it, it wasenough to adopt the pagan calendar of quarter and cross-quarter days because itwas an anti-calendar, a calendar valued by the underdogs, the satanists, thepagans, the occultists, a calendar that speaks of ancient mysteries andsupernatural power and which is in tune with the actual movements of the sun andmoon; but for the modern apocalyptic cults, cults shorn of mystery andindividual possibility and initiation, an end-point was needed, since in anapocalyptic cult there can only be one leader, one initiate, one Führer.These cults are full of people who lack the imagination to look beyond what theysee as the general decay and decadence of our society, of our entire world. Theyfeel history winding down, coming to a stop, and pray that all the evil in theworld will be destroyed by an avenging angel they like to think is on theirside. Those who follow a sacred calendar know that time does not flow in alinear direction, but in cycles and epicycles, spirals and holograms. They knewthis before our scientists did, and they memorialized this information in theirstanding stones and mounds of earth. There is a pattern to time, as there is apattern to space, a pattern to our nervous systems, a pattern to consciousness.What goes around, comes around.This idea of a sacred calendar—dates associated with meaning—provides a platformfor the operation of coincidence and “synchronicity.” Sacred calendars programthe mind, the unconscious, so that it vibrates in accordance with an ancientpattern. Coincidence can best be understood within the context of time, thetimeline, the calendar personal and general. There is the grand calendar of themasses, of society: the quarter and cross-quarter days, or the Christianecclesiastical calendar, the Jewish calendar, the Islamic calendar with itsfasting month and pilgrimage month, the Asian lunar calendars with theircolorful gods and goddesses, etc. Then there is the microcosmic, individualcalendar of family deaths and births, moves and changes. The synchronization ofthese two calendars gives rise to dates of meaning, of importance. To perform anact of acknowledgment on one of these dates is to give it added power, addedmeaning, a more profound sense of importance which then forges further linksdeep within the matrix of correspondences, giving the consciousness of theindividual a rare power and more penetrating insight into not only society butthe individual’s own role and relationship to society. One begins to experiencea flow: of time, of awareness, of meaning, even of power.Christianity adopted the pagan calendar because of this very phenomenon. Jesuswas not born on December 25; but it was an important Roman festival. Halloweenwas scheduled to occur on the same day that the European pagans believed thedoor between the worlds of the living and the dead were open, October 31, across-quarter day. The feast of the Virgin Mother was scheduled for May 1,another cross-quarter day of tremendous importance to pagans. Just asChristianity adopted the sacred places of the pagans—the sites of pagan worshipthat became Christian shrines, even including St. Peter’s Basilica itself—sothey adopted the sacred time of the pagans, performing a coordination ofastronomy and geography that would provide their leaders and their saints withan enormous reservoir of meaning, a matrix of secret power. It was a platformthat enabled their faithful to soar. Is it any wonder the Muslims wish to denyboth Jews and Christians complete access to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem,the site of Solomon’s Temple, knowing how the apocalyptically-minded of bothreligions view the building of a third Temple on the site as a signal to usherin the End of Days?By focusing on apocalyptic time—the end of time, the end of history—one robsoneself and one’s co-religionists of power. Everything is drained towards thatsingle end, that omega point of destruction. Life begins to loose its beauty,its meaning, its relevance. The time for redemption runs out. Grace is in shortsupply. Careers are denied; love is postponed.But the apocalyptic cults function within the other calendars, like it or not.There are points of tangence, of convergence, with calendars they do notrecognize and they can be interpreted thereby. Thus the rise and fall of aManson, or a Jim Jones, can be predicted; the graves of their followers andtheir victims can be visited on special days, days made sacred by the blood ofhuman sacrifice. And the cycles start again.I like to think that most people, if given a clear choice, would select goodover evil. The problem is that good and evil are often only relative terms; theabsolute nature of either one is difficult to confront, face to face. Theexperience of the divine may often be confused with an experience of evil; thatis what is meant by “sinister”: a threat of something dangerous, of somethingnefarious, an attitude of secret knowledge and secret strength. As many quotedpassages have already noted in the preceding chapters, we often see the divineas “sinister.” The other reflex is to see the demonic as divine. After all, inthe Western tradition, Lucifer was a fallen angel, the most beautiful of God’screation. It is natural that our experience of Lucifer would be a positive one.That is why the image is so powerful, much more so than the written word, whichrequires some level of thought and conscious participation. The image actsdirectly on the unconscious mind, conveying whole libraries of information in asingle moment, setting up connecting links with other images, other ideas. Thatis why, frankly, the image is not to be trusted. One needs a powerful internaleditor, one that questions each image to understand its purpose, its target, itsorigins. This is what the Christian Fundamentalists call the “power ofdiscernment”: the ability to tell if a spirit is truly good or evil. One cannotrely on pure image alone. One needs another source of information. One needs acontext.Unfortunately, as in the case of the UFO phenomenon and many paranormalexperiences, we have very little in the way of context. Our religious traininghas been largely abandoned in the last fifty years, or has been abused by venalleaders and prophets who see a way to make a fast dollar and an easy reputation.Our scientific training has been outdated and monopolized by a scientific elite.Our political awareness has been virtually useless, manipulated by cleverpitchmen, campaign managers and spin doctors, to the point where we don’t knowwhat we value anymore, or what the American experiment is all about. We need tostart relying on ourselves, and that means thinking for ourselves (as painful aprocess as that may be, and I do not say that lightly).It means going back to our museums and art galleries, concert halls andlibraries, to get a better understanding of our own culture and the sacrificesmade by individual artists, musicians, and writers to bring eternal truths toour attention. It means turning off the television set. Now, at a time whenWestern—and particularly American—culture is under attack as “decadent” or“worthless” or “non-existent” or “shallow,” it is important for us tore-evaluate our culture, for it contains some surprises. We have listened for along time to the Europeans tell the Americans that they have no culture; theproblem is not that Americans have no culture, it is that they do not know whatthat culture is. American culture is far richer and far more powerful than ourEuropean relations would admit. We need to know what it is and to understand it,and to teach it in the schools, and to do that we need to have a context inwhich to understand it. And that means learning about the creative functions andtheir relation to psychology, to visionary experience, and to the frontiers ofquantum physics.It also means learning how to use our neglected “paranormal” abilities: thoseabilities so assiduously studied by our military and intelligence agencies forthe past fifty years. These abilities only seem paranormal now; in futuregenerations they will be realized for what they are: the application ofconsciousness to science, the continuation of politics by other means … meansnot dreamed of by Clausewitz.The “sinister forces” of our title were identified as Nazism by Robert Jackson,and as extraterrestrials by General MacArthur. The Bible warns of spiritual evilin high places, and the scriptures of India speak of the dangers of a humanbeing storming heaven using occult practices; the ancient Sumerians understoodthat evil dwells beyond the planets in the realm of the stars (Igigi); andNazism was concerned with the creation of a new man and the worship of Lucifer.So what are the sinister forces? Are they simply the emanations of a deeper evilforce, or do we confuse the sinister divine with the sinister satanic? For mostof us, confrontation with any spiritual power is a matter of dread, awe, andfear (vide Guggenbuehl-Craig).The Nazis took the bold—and insane—step of evoking these forces deliberately, byinstitutionalizing all sorts of occult ideas and theories and practices in theSS, the Ahnenerbe, and other places. The American political and economic machineemulated some of these practices in their support of Nazism, racism andeugenics; by supporting Nazism they were allowing a deep moral evil to enter thecountry at the highest levels of power: the CIA, NASA, the USAF, etc., andeventually US corporations, such as Bell Aerospace, ITT, etc. When the CIAscientists began their assault on human consciousness, without regard topsychological or spiritual fallout, they were following in the steps of the Nazidoctors, and in some cases using captured Nazi files and captured Naziscientists as their guides. American politics and American science began toincorporate Nazi elements at the same time they were opening the American mindand consciousness, through drugs like LSD and through irresponsible mentalprogramming experiments on prisoners, the mentally-ill, the unwitting, and theunsuspecting. As the remote-viewing program has shown, there is a possibilitythat “heightened states” of consciousness are capable of near-miraculous feats,including space exploration (vide Swann). The alien abductees speak of thesinister agenda of the aliens, the horrors to which they have been subjected. Ifthese are truly alien beings, then they are adept at using the Manson Secret ontheir subjects; if they are not alien beings, but military or intelligenceofficers in the midst of an experimental program, then the Manson Secret isalready in their hands, and MK-ULTRA was a decoy.The only defense we have against the sinister forces is to develop our ownmental capabilities—individually—as a firewall against psychological warfare,cultural colonialism, mind control, and the remote viewers and telepaths of theenemy. Our churches, our political parties, our schools, our media are all assuspect as our secret government agencies. The Republicans have shown a callousdisregard for the hideous crimes perpetrated by the Nazis in order to allow themto fight the Communists. I do not believe it was simple pragmatism that led themto that position; they too often voice opinions and demonstrate actions thatwould be clearly in accordance with a Nazi agenda. Richard Nixon was the mostobvious example of this, with his anti-Semitism and his sociopathic personality,as evidenced by his collaboration with Nazis and by his version of the OctoberSurprise. This is not to exempt the Democrats from the same accusations, but inthe case of the Democratic Party, the anti-Semitism or pro-Nazism of individualsis more the rule than is a wholesale collaboration with Nazism as a virtualparty platform. Remember that “sinister forces” were accused of creating theeighteen-and-a-half minute gap in the Nixon Oval Office tapes. Haig was moreright than he knew.The involvement of Hollywood as the medium for the sinister forces is previewedin the Lovecraft story where artists are the first point of contact for upcomingevents of a global nature: Hollywood represents the artist of America, at leastin a gross and commercial way, fueled by the fantasies and dark dreams of themen and women who have prostituted themselves and their abilities to the enginesof the major studios while struggling personally to put forward a more wholisticpoint of view, sometimes below the radar and sometimes unconsciously. Hollywoodis the new religion of America and, to a certain extent, of the rest of theworld as well. Hollywood brings the gods—the stars, “every man and every womanis a star”—down to earth, where they can be seen and heard and touched by themasses; not only Hollywood, of course, but also the music industry, and not onlyin California and New York but also in Bollywood and Europe and Mexico andBrazil and Venezuela and China and Hong Kong and so on. Americans emulate moviecharacters more than they do the saints of their religions: they dress likethem, drive the same cars, have the same attitudes, talk like them, andeventually adopt the same cultural mores. Hollywood is a vast mind-controlengine, which is why many independent films are ignored by the public: they donot want to think independently, they want to have their consciousness massagedby the old, familiar rituals. The tools of Hollywood are the tools ofpsychological warfare, of mind control and behavior control. Of advertising, inits most pernicious sense.Ronald Brownstein, in The Power and the Glitter: The Hollywood-WashingtonConnection, makes this idea very clear with examples from the 1940s to thepresent day. He speaks of Hollywood’s dismay when Ronald Reagan was embraced bythe electorate:It was widely assumed that Reagan had mesmerized the public with cheapstagecraft.… Almost without exception, the Hollywood left was convinced that itsown understanding of the actor’s tools provided unique abilities to penetrateReagan’s façade and expose the shallowness it saw behind it.5Hollywood seems most powerful when it is least conscious of what it is doing.The actor Mike Farrell—who portrayed B.J. Hunnicutt on the television seriesM*A*S*H—was stunned by the fact that he was recognized by refugees from theKhmer Rouge living in camps set up on the Thai-Cambodian border in the 1980s.6This is the phenomenon against which the developing nations—and particularlythose nations dominated by religious fundamentalism—are now protesting,sometimes with violence. They have understood that media—all media—are a form ofpsychological warfare, “world-view warfare.” All media contain elements ofcultural assumptions and biases that may not be obvious, even to their creators,and which, to governments with a tenuous hold on the loyalty and confidence oftheir citizens, seem subversive and dangerous. America’s experience during theCold War instructed its leaders that the best wars are those which are neverfought with guns and bombs, but with ideas. Colonialism in the old sense isexpensive and unfashionable. Cultural colonialism, however, is much cheaper,uses fashionable media, and is plausibly deniable.The same elements we have discovered used by Manson and Jones and many otherscan be found in the dissemination of media messages throughout the world.Television has replaced scripture in many households; certainly many people paymore attention to their television set than to their religion, even in religiousstates. Sitting around a television set in the comfort of their own homes,people are isolated from one another in a social context, but united with othersthousands of miles away in a cultural context. They are massaged by images thatcarry subtle sexual intentions—attractive actors, singers, models, the sexualtensions of the soap opera and the movie—and are introduced to a world thatencourages a value system somewhat at odds with their own, using powerfulimages, colors, music: a subliminal package that causes shifts in consciousness.The danger of this can only be sensed by those already attuned to a deeperspiritual state of mind, where the assault of these images can be seen for whatit is: a form of psychological warfare, of brainwashing, of culturalimperialism.By encoding this system in a vast media machine that incorporates television,cinema, and the music industry, Hollywood has developed tremendous power. Thisis not to say that this power is evil in and of itself; that would be naïve. Thepower of Hollywood should be respected for what it is, a kind ofinstitutionalized—or industrialized—mind control. The more actors, writers,directors and producers are aware of this, the more powerful this systembecomes. The Reagan phenomenon was the wake-up call for many in Hollywood, evenif they had not understood that the Kennedy election, twenty years earlier, oweda great deal to the power of television, the first such election to do so. Nowit is important to maintain the struggle in Hollywood among the factions thatwould seek to dominate this power for one agenda or another. Hollywood hasalready learned the Manson Secret; it would be a disaster if only one party orone set of fundamentalist beliefs were to monopolize its use.Terrorism, by contrast, is the new witchcraft; terrorists are aligned againstall states, and thus are rebels everywhere and despised everywhere. They attackculture, and not military targets, to maximize the fear factor. Terrorist cellsare the modern equivalent of the witches’ coven, and the Patriot Act is theequivalent of the Inquisition.A favorite target of terrorist states is Hollywood, for all the obvious reasons.Yet, they have learned a great deal about the power of the image from Hollywood.Why else bomb a school bus? A hospital? The World Trade Center? Terrorism, as wehave seen, is a form of psychological warfare, and as such owes a great deal tothe same technologies in use by Hollywood and by our own intelligence agencies.Indeed, many of the important terrorist figures now arrayed against America gottheir training from the CIA during American support for the Taliban guerrillasfighting the Soviet invasion. One of the more infamous of terrorist“interrogators”—Dr. Aziz al-Abub of the Hezbollah in Lebanon—had received histraining in mind control at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, and employedvirtually the same methods as his American counterparts. The “brainwashing war”that began in 1950 with the Korean conflict, and which involved the UnitedStates versus China and the Soviet Union, has now percolated down to the popularlevel, the terrorist level: the technology of torture, pain, sensorydeprivation, hypnosis, and drugs is available to everyone, and is much cheaperto employ than a Stinger rocket or a Kalashnikov.In the case of the Islamic terrorist organizations, these heinous practices arecarried out in the name of God by men who, “inflamed with prayer,” do notquestion their application. Just as America viewed the Communist nations asatheistic and godless, and used that as one of their many justifications for theexcesses of the Cold War, so do the Islamic terrorists view America as the GreatSatan, a decadent society that is an affront to God and which must be destroyed.The real war may very well be that which is being played out in Jerusalembetween fundamentalist Christians, messianic Jews, and determined Muslims overthe site of the Temple of Solomon and the Dome of the Rock. In the Middle Eastwe have catastrophic military technology in the hands of religious fanatics,true believers who will fight to the last drop of their blood—and ours—for God,manipulated by cynical men who know these robot warriors for what they reallyare: pawns in a game whose rules only they know, men who gleefully employ theManson Secret.Who, then, are the sinister forces? Demons? Or Gods? Aliens, or … us? We are indanger of losing our freedom because of this threat to our lives and culture,since our leaders know only one way to respond to terrorism/ witchcraft, andthat is the stake and the forced confession. Our leaders cannot talk to us aboutthe real problem; they cannot admit their own failure of imagination.We have been talking about the end-times endlessly, this begun by ourfundamentalist Christian Coalition, whose most notable spokespersons have beenJerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Ronald Reagan and, now, George W. Bush—and havebeen making films and writing books and articles about the apocalypse (bynuclear war, nuclear accident, asteroid strike, holes in the ozone, etc.) atsuch a furious pace, that we may infer that we are either predicting it throughsome unconscious means, some “heightened state” that has been activated in ourquantum consciousness, or that we are calling it, summoning it in an act ofdesperation, so tired of the world the way it is and simply wanting it all toend.We are all so tired of the epidemics, the urban violence, the danger ofterrorism, of biochemical warfare, of nuclear war, of hunger and starvation, ofgrinding poverty and fear of unemployment, of the bankruptcy of both ourselvesand of the private and public sectors, of the dwindling rain forests, therapidly depleting water supply, the absence of anything like spiritual renewalor cultural values in our media (except, perhaps, in the art, concert music,opera, and literature that has become less and less accessible to the people,with the dwindling financial support of our respective governments for both thearts and for the education necessary to enjoy them), of sexism, racism,ethnophobia, anti-Semitism, of the sheer volume of noise being created bytechnology without content, without meaning, of air and earth and waterpollution, of the toxic substances in our food, of the incapability of scienceand medicine to be consistent about what is good or bad for us to do, toconsume, to behave, to believe.… And at the same time we are so terrified ofsome cosmic apocalyptic event that would wipe out the planet that we live undera cloud of danger and despair and try to smile through it all for the sake ofour children. We have a love/hate relationship with life itself. We, as asociety, have become sick; and that is actually the good news.As we have noted in the above pages and at length, the sickness of an individualpaves the way for spiritual enlightenment and psychological integration. Theacute schizophrenia we are now experiencing as a society may be the necessarypreliminary step to a shamanic-style rebirth. The hideous violence anddegradation we see all around us—and on our television screens and computermonitors—may be the signal that the dismemberment of our society is at hand. Thesinister forces have been evoked from within the magic circle of the OvalOffice, the videocam, the seal on the floor of CIA headquarters at Langely, andin a million other places. These may be alien forces from another planet oranother dimension; or they may be demons, battalions of demons as in a paintingby Breughel, marching through our blasted landscape and meting out torture anddeath along the way. Our saving grace as Americans is the fact that we canrecognize this, that we do not simply sit still and watch from the sidelines asour civilization crumbles around us.We are not “good Germans.” Hitler’s Germany will forever remain our example ofthe sinister forces that we have come to despise, the complacency of a citizenryin which evil triumphs because good men do nothing. We are Americans, and we arebiased, and bigoted, and provincial, and arrogant, and naïve, and stupid; all ofthis is true. But we are also dreamers; our worst citizens have been guilty ofbad dreams, perhaps, but were dreamers nonetheless. We are a sentimental peoplewho cry at Disney movies, for which the sophisticated European laughs at us.Europe, the heir to the Renaissance: clearly the last time there was anythingremotely resembling grandeur on that continent. Bitter in their shameful historyof genocide and holocaust and collaboration and cowardice, and eager for companyin their spiritual deterioration, Europeans are the crowd that stands below abuilding and urges the potential suicide to jump. We will ignore them, for weare not standing on top of that building to jump, but to reach just a littlehigher.We have committed some grave sins in our history; of this there can be no doubt.The slaughter of the Native American population is perhaps the first sin, andone of the most grave. The brutal, inescapable fact of slavery is another, withits sickening offspring, racism; also the way some of our wealthiest and mostpowerful families and leaders sponsored eugenics and genocide in everything fromthe murderous Tuskegee syphilis program to state laws banning interracialmarriages. Our colonial attitude to the peoples of Latin America is another, anugly legacy from the people we fought for our own independence, foisted onweaker neighbors to the south; thousands upon thousands of people have died inLatin America, and millions more suffered incredible hardships, due to Americanforeign policy in the region. Our support of military dictatorships around theworld is another grave sin, from the Shah of Iran to Pinochet of Chile, fromMarcos in the Philippines to Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and so many others.Hiroshima was a horrible crime, and Nagasaki even greater, for we did not need aNagasaki after the holocaust of Hiroshima.Many wonder why America is so violent; possibly it is an understandable reactionto a sense of enormous guilt, and the unfairness of this burden of guilt on theshoulders of decent men and women who would have had nothing to do with theabove crimes, if they had been given a choice. Our gun-toting population isperhaps consumed with a kind of death wish, a suicidal need to purge the earth,and this may be due—I contend—to the necessity of confronting our collectivehistory and not finding enough to rejoice and celebrate, not enough that isinclusive of all Americans. Since the assassination of President Kennedy, wehave become a distrustful and cynical population; we watched our sons anddaughters come back from Vietnam and wept for those who made it back alive aswell as for those who did not. We began to doubt our goodness, and this has madeus angry and hateful and paranoid; for it is of central importance to everyAmerican to believe in the American dream. Without that belief, we become lesserbeings living in a lesser country: a crass, commercialized landscape of stripmalls and fast food and electronic churches.Thank God we have people in our country who bring these sins to our attention,and some of us listen, and some of us grow up to work against that mentality.When the rest of the world wishes to criticize us, they do so by referencingreports and data in our own newspapers, magazines, and news programs: they donot realize the irony of this, since in their countries it is illegal to use themedia to criticize their governments. But while our elected officials may beguilty of cynicism and cowardice and evil intentions, our electorate is not. Ourpeople still believe in the old dreams, the idea of what it means to be anAmerican. That is why they were all so shocked by the events of September 11,2001.They could not understand why anybody would hate them. They have not beenabroad. They don’t speak the language. They haven’t done the reading. They havenot seen the handiwork of which our elected officials and our intelligenceagencies and our corporate leaders are capable. And for that, we should begrateful. For if they did know all of this, and if they were not shocked bySeptember 11, then the only conclusion we could draw is that they wereaccomplices in all of this and actually were the war-mongers and racists andneo-fascists the rest of the world thinks they are.But their shock was the shock of the innocent, and perhaps of the stupid and ofthe ignorant … but not of the evil.We could sum up with a quotation from the late, lamented Walt Kelley’s Pogocomic strip: “We have met the enemy and he is us.” Once we realize this, we canbegin to make America the place of greatness and beauty and transcendence thatit was intended to be, intended to be by our founding fathers who were, afterall, Freemasons and Rosicrucians and Templars and freethinkers and mystics, whobelieved in spiritual regeneration and psychological integration.Instead, we will end with another quotation.That first Sunday in June 1968, at the funeral for Robert F. Kennedy—the last,best hope for a renewed America for a long time to come—his brother, SenatorEdward Kennedy, read the eulogy. It contained Bobby’s favorite quotation, onethat he would use to revive his flagging spirits or to raise the energy of hisfollowers.It is a beautiful sentiment, but how many listeners in St. Patrick’s Cathedralin Manhattan that solemn spring day realized the original context? As Bobby’sbody lay in the center aisle of that Gothic pile, surrounded by those who lovedand admired him, his “robopathic” assassin in jail in Los Angeles staringstupidly around him in confusion, the men who authorized that murder toastingthemselves in comfort in the boardrooms and cloakrooms and living rooms andconference rooms and bedrooms of America, some of them even there, in the churchwatching the funeral service with cynical satisfaction, knowing that the lastassassination had taken place and that America was ripe for the plunder, thewords of their sinister god were being quoted as epitaph:“You see things; and you say, “Why?” But I dream things that never were; and Isay “Why not?”The quote comes from George Bernard Shaw’s Back to Methuselah, and they are thewords of the Devil.Brooklyn Heights, 1975—Kuala Lumpur, 2003—South Florida, 2006--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Walter Lang, in his Introduction to Fulcanelli’s Le Mystere des Cathedrales,Brotherhood of Life, Las Vegas, 2000, p. 22 2 Dr. Robert M.

The Prime Minister was able to unite his people against amysterious, common enemy: a foreign enemy, an infidel army, a colonial powerpreparing to invade Malaysia if not with troops (although, after the invasion ofIraq, that still looked like a possibility to many) then with bearer bonds.International Jews. Foreign bankers. The IMF.Sinister forces.Outside my window the mosques still rang with the amplified call of the muezzin.But down the street, the prayer hall on Jalan Damai was filled with idealistic,clear-eyed, sometimes hateful young men in sarongs and knit skull-caps, sittingcross-legged, listening to a sermon mixed with political speeches, and calls tojihad. Other Muslims could be seen getting into their cars. Mercedes. BMWs.Hondas. The more plebeian in Protons and Kancils. They have asked God forprotection, but they are still paranoid. And why not?So am I.Dogs with broken legs are shot; men with broken souls write through the night.—Kenneth Patchen, The Journal of Albion MoonlightWhat has obsessed me in these pages is not the paranoia of the clerk, but of thecongressman. Of the President, and the Pentagon. Of five-star generals and CIAdirectors and scientists and clergymen. Of police officers and FBI profilers.This is not the paranoia of the loser, of the victim—pathetic,understandable—but of the winner, the victor. The paranoia of the people incharge. People who should know better, and probably do. It is what they fearmost that I fear most: what they do not want us to know. The paranoia ofexperts. If you’re not paranoid, you don’t know all the facts.It is the paranoia of men who shred documents in the executive offices at CIAheadquarters, like schoolboys hiding dirty magazines; of a sitting President,nervous about “the Bay of Pigs thing”; of an Attorney General, and his murderedbrother.There is blood, and there are documents. This is history. You can’t have onewithout the other. Blood. Documents. Guilt. Innocence. Knowledge. Ignorance.Frustration. Fear. But you can’t know history unless you know fear. You can’tknow history unless you feel the pulse of life under your fingers; unless youcan stare the guns in the face. Unless you can stand in the prisons, and thedeath camps, and feel the gaze of informers and spies and soldiers on your backin foreign countries … and on your own doorstep, your own driveway. The rest isonly bookkeeping.The world has always been like this, of course. It has always been run bypeople: superstitious, religious, fearful, paranoid, ugly, hateful, murderouspeople. That is nothing new. But at a specific point in the century we took thisa step further. We opened Pandora’s box, the black box of human consciousness.We flipped open the lid, and rummaged around inside. And we loosed monsters onthe earth. Monsters who feed on human flesh, and who drink the nectar of humansouls.Churches harbor the danger as much as hospitals; there is nowhere to go, no oneto trust. To come to that conclusion one would have to read all these books,mountains of references to be cross-checked and verified in virtually everydiscipline known to us: political science, history, archaeology, paleoastronomy,comparative religion, occultism, psychology, philosophy, medicine, physics,chemistry, business, finance, geology, geophysics, mathematics, anthropology,Watergate, Wall Street, assassinations, intelligence programs, alien abductions,epigraphy, linguistics, Hollywood, communications science, military history.Thousands of books, piles of documents. Is it any wonder, after all, that theshots—the shots that changed the world, that martyred a President, that ended areign of hope—were believed to have come from a place where books were stored?Back in Kuala Lumpur, the phone would ring very late at night (or very early inthe morning). I was in Asia, so twelve hours separated me from the people I knowand love in the States. They, in the sunlight of yesterday, still dealing with aday that is already closed for me. I didn’t want to answer. I didn’t want totell them how that day would turn out.Back on the East Coast, the days are reversed, but the phone no less ominous.hate telephones. I hate being summoned to account for myself, my presence, myactions, when those who should be accountable never are. More to the point, Icannot talk now. Faced with this horrible reality, I have come to learn that Iknow as little about myself as about anything else. How can I speak on thephone? Who will do the talking, the listening? What truth can really be spoken,when we have been baptized with lies?The phone continues to ring, then stops."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe task of acknowledging the many hundreds of people who have contributed to myunderstanding of this subject is gratifying, but daunting. In the first place,research for this three volume work began in 1975 and continued at a more orless steady pace—interrupted by the vicissitudes of a quotidian existence (a dayjob)—and took place all over the United States as well as in many foreigncountries. In addition, recourse was had to archives and libraries and, with theadvent of the Internet, to on-line resources as well. That means that the numberof individuals who had some input to my work increased exponentially with eachpassing decade.I will try to identify those who most influenced my work and my point of view,therefore, with apologies to anyone I may have missed.Pride of place must go to Norman Mailer, whose support of my earlier work—UnholyAlliance—provided a tremendous boost to my self-confidence at a time when I wasten thousand miles from the States and deeply immersed in the research forSinister Forces. I will be forever grateful to the man who is arguably the be,tliving American writer for so openly sharing his views and opinions on themassive undertaking I had set for myself.Close behind are some of the other members of the Dynamite Club, such as JimHougan and Dick Russell, who not only provided forewords for Volumes 1 and 2respectively, but who also contributed their advice and information. Jim Hougan,particularly, was extremely helpful when it came to the chapter on Jonestown,and his article on the subject in Lobster—cited in the text—is groundbreaking.Dick Russell’s magisterial work, The Man Who Knew Too Much, was inspirational inits scope (and its size!), and his background on some of the other charactersmentioned in these pages was valuable and enlightening.Paul Krassner is a hero and an icon to many of us who remember and cherish theSixties and the crusading journalism of The Realist, a tradition that has notfaltered in lo, these many decades; I found myself referencing hiswork—particularly concerning John Lennon—long before he agreed to provide aforeword for Volume 3. Paul, I am not worthy!Whitley Strieber was someone who believed in this effort from very early on,while I was still in foreign lands and struggling to put this initiated view ofAmerican history into some kind of perspective. His own works show how eventscan be seen and understood on more than one level, and even more than onedimension, and this idea helped me to formulate my own ideas concerningsynchronicity, coincidence and conspiracy. We vacillate between a no-nonsense,empirical and near Positivist approach to the subject matter … and a mystical,transcendental illuminative vision of the same material.I think we both realize that the truth lies somewhere in that twilight zonebetween the waking world and the sleeping, between consciousness and theunconscious, between occult revelation and scientific certainties. There areconspiracies, and there are coincidences; what we explore is the matrix thataccommodates both and takes reality into another realm of connection andcoherence altogether. As is shown in this work, one can be a conspirator and amystic both; it will be up to history to decide which approach is the more …reliable.But this book would never have seen the light of day had it not been for KrisMillegan. As the publisher of TrineDay, a small house that dares to printuncomfortable facts and to “speak truth to power,” Kris has weathered many apolitical storm over the books he has midwifed to press. Attacked by lawsuitsfrom the Special Forces Association, among others, because he dares to exposethe harsh realities of government conspiracy and corruption, he bravely acceptedthe onerous task of publishing a huge work—Sinister Forces—that ran to almost2000 pages of manuscript, something no other agent or publisher wanted anythingto do with; but that didn’t stop Millegan, himself the son of a former CIAofficer, and who spent some years of his early childhood in the same countries Iwould wind up living in decades later. Kris’ work on Skull & Bones has alreadywon him worldwide acclaim (there is a Japanese translation of his work). Thework he has done will stand the test of time, and future generations will beamazed that our country was able to function for so long (while ignoring thevast corruption and injustice uncovered by Kris), like the man in the MalcolmLowry novel who ignores the tiger chewing on his shoulder and pretends there isnothing wrong.I’m proud to be part of the Kris Millegan tradition, and this necessarilyincludes Russell Becker, TrineDay’s editor, who painstakingly walked me throughthis entire manuscript to clarify and correct, identify and determine, both myideas and my language, which, at times, had resulted in sentences that werenearly gothic in construction. Many thanks to you both.Between all these brave men of vision there is a woman of equal vision andstrength of character, and that would be the late Judith McNally, who passedaway prematurely just as this book was going to press. I’d known her forthirty-five years, from when I was a struggling writer in Brooklyn Heights tothe present day, when I am a struggling writer in South Florida. The strugglegoes on—la lucha sigue—but with staunch allies and friends like Judith McNally,it seemed more like choreography than chaos. Thankfully, she was also a personwho spoke her mind without reservation and was an unforgiving critic; many isthe writer whose work has been tested and refined in the heat of her athanor,the dross slowly transformed to the glitter of something redeemable. Thank you.Other influence, information and support have come from a diverse group offriends, associates, and fellow-travelers, among whom must be mentioned DavidBlackburst, for whose biography of David Ferrie we all await; and Tracy Twyman,whose late-lamented publication Dagobert’s Revenge was a fascinating collectionof all things Grail-ish, and who since has written persuasively on everythingfrom the Merovingians to the American monetary system to the furor over theDanish cartoons of the Prophet (for which she has been “banned in Pakistan”). Iwish to acknowledge the novelist Katherine Neville as well, for the long phoneconversations that cleared up a lot of my thinking on some of the scientificpersonalities discussed herein; your fans (among whom I number myself ) eagerlyawait your next novel.In Europe, my old friends Gennaro Oliva and Patrizia Ronchetto deserve pride ofplace; there can be no more amiable guides to the life and culture of theContinent. Grazie mille.In China, the same can be said of Peter Wong and Wang Lei, whom I have known foralmost two decades. There is a book waiting to be written on Peter Wong’s life,but who would believe it? Xie-Xie Ninmen.In Malaysia, the trilingual Cecelia Ang was professional as well as patient andunderstanding with this ignorant gwei-lo during his long and sometimesfrustrating sojourn in her native land. In business, as in culture, she helpedme to see layers of meaning as well as of beauty in her country that the touristor the foreign businessman could never discover. M’goi and terimah kasih.In Singapore, Tham Yar Leong—businessman and geomancer—was my window to theworld of Asian religion and mysticism. We spent many long hours discussingeverything from the Knights Templar and the Freemasons to feng shui and Buddhisticonography. O mi to fo.I have to give special thanks to the late Steve Orlando, of Longboat Key andStonington, a man among men who understood that life was for living. His senseof what was valuable and important extended to his employees and his friends …and they were often the same people. A rare human being, he is missed.And to Frank Diener, “Third World Man” and fellow-traveler in the dark realms ofdeveloping nations. This green beer is for you, Doctor!To the Australians David Redfern and Larry O’Toole, the latter who told me to dothe counter-intuitive and focus on my strengths instead of trying to correct myweaknesses. You were right.And to the bishops, Walter Propheta, Colin Guthrie, and George Augustine Hydeamong many others. Propheta introduced me to the arcane world of the WanderingBishops when I was still only seventeen years old. Colin Guthrie and GeorgeAugustine Hyde helped to fill in some blanks since then.To Anthony Chang, Zhang LiDe and Zhang Qiang, who introduced me to China tradeand, more importantly, to China itself, in the process giving me some of my mostunforgettable memories.To Kurt Neustaedter, who started me on the trail to the East without knowing it.To Ingrid Celms, who was there at the beginning.To the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa, from whom I accepted an initiation many years ago inNew York City.To the occultists Herman Slater, Ray Buckland, Maurice Woodruff, Leo Martello,Ed Buczynski, Ed James, Jim Wasserman, Martin Mensch, Richard Capuro, and somany, many others known over the years, such as Allyn Brodsky and the late JerryBirnbaum, Kris Dowling, Elizabeth Bick Dowling … the list goes on and on.To CIA agent Arthur Hochberg, and to contract agent Antonino Rocca, and severalothers who do not wish to be named. I value your (both voluntary andinadvertent) confidences.To Clark Stiles (“Sunken civ”) able electronic forum administrator whoselong-standing support of different ideas in archaeology and anthropology werestimulating and productive.And of course to Rose and Vivica. Vivica was not yet born when I began thiswork, and she is now a beautiful and talented woman of 25 years. As for Rose,strangely she hasn’t aged at all. She must have a portrait hiding some-where;yet I am sure it would look just the same anyway.To these, and to all the others not mentioned here, I offer my sincerestgratitude. I hope this work is worthy of your many and varied contributions andlives up to the expectations you have had of a project that has taken thirtyears to complete.Any errors, of course, remain my own.PETER LEVENDA"},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYFOR SINISTER FORCESNot all the books, documents and other sources used as background for thistrilogy are listed here, for the simple reason that such a Bibliography would bebook-length itself. Instead, I have chosen those items that would give thereader an idea of where to begin to duplicate the research I have done. Inaddition, I have not divided the Bibliography simply into a “Primary Source”section and a “Secondary Source” section, since it was suggested that dividingthe Bibliography by categories might be more valuable, as Sinister Forces coversa wide range of disciplines, cultures, and historical eras. Instead, I haveidentified primary and secondary source material within each category, whereappropriate.I hope that this decision was the right one.That said, one can reasonably be assured that where documents are listed in thetext—such as items from the JFK Collection at the National Archives or theMK-ULTRA documents released by the CIA—these are primary source material. I havetaken pains to ensure that these documents are identified as clearly aspossible, enabling future researchers to find them in their respectivelocations.Naturally, over the past decades, research has also entailed not only documents,but flesh and blood human beings. I have spoken with literally hundreds ofpersons over the course of this historical investigation, many of whom would notbe pleased to find themselves identified here. In the Acknowledgments section,therefore, some individuals have been mentioned but without revealing how theyassisted me or what type of information they offered. In the case of Chinesemilitary officials, former CIA and FBI officers, and others with links to theirgovernments, this is understandable. In the case of religious leaders and cultmembers, this is perhaps less so but just as necessary in many cases. Iinterviewed all these on a “deep background” understanding, and I have notallowed these interviews to form the core of this research but have insteadbolstered their statements with documentation and independent corroboration.In the case of the wandering bishops, I was—as discussed in the Appendix to BookI—personally involved with this phenomenon and knew many of the primary playersduring the 1960s and 1970s, and have since interviewed others in the past tenyears. My previous association with Walter Propheta and his colleagues enabledme to open dialogues with surviving members of his operation, as well as withvarious sects, denominations, and other splinter groups.Further, my personal association with members of various “cults” and New Agedenominations going back thirty years has made it easier for me to understandthe relationship that exists between cults, crime, and political maneuvering,including intelligence-gathering. I hasten to point out that not all cults havecriminal or intelligence agency connections or interests; many of these groupsare composed of sincere seekers after spiritual realities. Yet, even then, theyand their technologies can be manipulated by others less scrupulous.
