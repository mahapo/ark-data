What many people may notrealize is that Willard Mitt Romney is not the first Mormon to run for Presidentof the United States.That honor goes to the founder of Mormonism himself, Joseph Smith Jr.What many people also may not realize is that Mitt Romney is not the firstMormon to be focused on the acquisition of wealth.That honor also goes to the founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith Jr.In fact, and according to at least one critic, Joseph Smith Jr. was the firstreal leveraged buyout king, anticipating Mitt Romney's career by at least 150years.The story of the origins of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,more commonly referred to as the LDS Church or simply as the Mormons, is a storyof treasure-hunters and sorcerers. This book is not an attempt to denigrateMormonism or Mormon politicians or presidential candidates, even though thefacts presented here may seem at times outrageous or bizarre. This is the realstory of a religious denomination that some consider a cult, even a dangerouscult. Since I have written several books that touch on the subject of “religiousdeviance”, I am sensitive to the label “cult” and do not use it lightly. Afterall, Christianity began as a cult, as a renegade Jewish sect: a spiritualpractice observed in secret, in hidden catacombs and Roman cemeteries before itbecame a state religion in the fourth century CE. One uses the term “cult” atone's peril.Yet in the case of Mormonism we have a number of factors that drive EvangelicalChristians crazy and which arouse suspicion in members of other denominations aswell.For instance, Mormonism's roots in ritual magic. Or its involvement withFreemasonry. The outlawed practice of plural marriage. And the strange practiceof the baptism of the dead by which the LDS Church “converts” departed souls ofother faiths to Mormonism (presumably without their consent!).If we deconstruct the history and practices of the LDS Church we gradually cometo the realization that what we are seeing is something truly different fromcontemporary mainstream Christianity. It should be noted that Mormons considerthemselves Christians, even though many Christian denominations refuse to extendthat designation to the LDS Church. My intention is not to come down on one sideor another in that particular debate. What I want to do, however, is make thedata available in order to enable a reader who may not be aware of Mormonism'sstrange history to make an informed decision…either as a seeker after spiritualknowledge, perhaps considering conversion, or as a voter in an election. The controversy over John F. Kennedy's candidacy for president is still fresh inmy mind, of course. I was only ten years old when he was elected, but the factthat he was a Roman Catholic—as I was born and raised—was a staple ofdiscussions at home and at school. Kennedy was accused of having allegiance tothe Vatican rather than to the United States, forcing him to make an impassionedspeech in which he made his loyalties clear.It may be time for Mitt Romney—or for whatever Mormon political contenders maycome after him—to consider making the same sort of speech, in order to allay thefears of Evangelicals and others who believe that there is something veryunusual about Mormonism. In the United States, we believe that Church and State are separate. Of course,they are, according to the US Constitution and more specifically the Bill ofRights. But religious feeling and political agendas are often brought togetherin a single political candidate. We are, after all, human beings and subject tohuman emotion and psychological conditions. However much we try tocompartmentalize our political beliefs and our religious beliefs, in terms ofeveryday activity the one may wash over into the other. We know this because thepolitical influence of various religious groups is well-known, and reportedendlessly in the media.Ronald Reagan, who is idolized by many on the political Right, was a member ofthe same religious denomination (the Disciples of Christ) as Jim Jones, thepreacher responsible for the Jonestown massacre of 1979. Reagan believed in animpending apocalypse, the End of Days. Jim Jones did his best to bring it on, atleast for his followers in the Guyanese jungle where they met their hideousfate. The phrase “drink the Kool-Aid” as a reference to mindlessly following anagenda or a leader comes from the mass murder and suicide at Jonestown wheremany of the victims were told to drink a cyanide-laced soft drink.George W. Bush famously told Evangelical Christians that God had told him to runfor president.But Richard Nixon, as the nation's first and so-far only, Quaker president,ignored his religion's pacifist teachings entirely when he ordered the Christmasbombing of Cambodia during the Vietnam War.What is worse, then, we may ask: a religious zealot as president, or a religioushypocrite?As the above examples suggest, the answer to this question may depend on thereligion. And that is where this conversation about Mormonism must begin.Evangelical Christians, Roman Catholics—and Americans in general—should asktheir political candidates (and especially their presidential candidates)whether or not they are true believers in their respective religions. HadRichard Nixon been a true Quaker, it is entirely possible that Cambodia wouldnever have been bombed and that the Vietnam War would have ended years earlier.Had Ronald Reagan truly believed in the apocalypse and the Second Coming ofJesus, he might have hurried it along with a few well-placed missiles.If a person running for President of the United States is a true Mormon…whatdoes that mean for the rest of us?The author's intention is that this book goes somewhat towards answering thatquestion."},{"pageContent":"ORIGINS"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE:THE SORCERERSamuel Smith v. Mary Easty.The deposition of Samuell Smith of Boxford aged about 25 years who testifiethand saith that about five years since I was one night at the house of IsaacEstick [Easty] of Topsfield and I was as far as I know not Rude in discorse andthe above said Esticks wife said to me I would not have you be so rude indiscorse for I might Rue it here after and as I was agoeing home that nightabout a quarter of a mile from the said Esticks house by a stone wall I Receiveda little blow on my shoulder with I know not what and the stone wall rattledvery much which affrighted me my horse also was affrighted very much but Icannot give the reason of it.—From the Historical Collection of the Topsfield Historical Society concerningthe Salem witchcraft trials of 1692JOSEPH SMITH, JR.—THE FOUNDER OF MORMONISM—came from a long line of occultistsand religious zealots. For instance his ancestor, Samuel Smith, was one of theaccusers of Mary Towne Easty who was eventually hanged as a witch at Salem onSeptember 22, 1692. Even his father was well-known as an occultist and exorcist.It should be remembered, however, that Joseph Smith lived in a time and placethat was replete with various cults and ceaseless sectarian strife. New prophetswere commonplace; new revelations were the subject of endless discussion. Therewas no single form of Christianity that made it to the shores of the New Worldin the seventeenth century, but dozens of different denominations some of whichspun off even more schismatic groups in the century that followed. Manybelievers had come to America to escape various forms of religious persecutionin England, France and Germany, from both Protestants and Catholics.In short, North America was colonized largely by heretics.This was a different set of circumstances when compared to the southern part ofwhat would become the United States as well as Mexico and Latin America.Colonized by Spain, these were areas subject to Roman Catholic influence and—insome cases, particularly those of the Native American populations—forcedconversion. The Holy Inquisition arrived in the Americas under the Spanishsword. Christopher Columbus himself had planned his expedition to what wouldbecome the “New World” in order to raise money for a new Crusade against theIslamic forces in Jerusalem, an expedition financed by the King of Spain who inthe same year had expelled the last remaining Caliphate from the city of Grenadaand who was preparing for an assault on the Holy Land…an assault that neveractually materialized.Thus religion was a determining factor in the European “discovery” andsubsequent colonization of the American continents. The European settlers whohave come to represent for many Americans the romantic notion of pious Puritansand quaint Quakers fleeing persecution in their home countries in order to carveout a life of freedom in the New World were, in some instances, religious bigotsthemselves. While they may have been escaping religious intolerance in Europe,they lost no time in establishing their own intolerant communities oflike-minded faithful in the American colonies.Others, however, were considerably more enlightened. Alchemy and magic wereserious topics of discussion and research in seventeenth century America, atleast among the intelligentsia. It should be remembered that several members ofthe Royal Society in England were alchemists, and these would include EliasAshmole (1617–1692) and Isaac Newton (1642–1727). Ashmole died the year theSalem witchcraft trials began in the colonies; Newton was fifty years old whenthe trials and subsequent hangings took place. Educated Englishmen who settledin the New England area brought with them the same intellectual pursuits theyenjoyed back home, represented by well-stocked libraries of books on alchemy,magic, theology, astrology, and various forms of spiritualism. Indeed, theseventeenth century Governor of Connecticut, John Winthrop Jr, had a personallibrary that included more than 250 volumes on occult subjects and was a regularcorrespondent with some of the most famous occult scholars of the day.Those who were believers in the basic tenets of Christianity found themselvesliving in a world populated by spirits both good and evil. The Bible is full ofaccounts of direct contact with the Divine, of prophets and angels, witches andpagan idolators. The Biblical accounts do not deny the possibility of magic anddemonolatry; on the contrary, such practices are recognized in order to becondemned. They are not condemned or prohibited because they are superstition orfantasy, but precisely because they work: a person can evoke spirits to visibleappearance, as in the case of the Witch of Endor. A person can use divination todetermine the will of God and future events, as in the case of the Urim andThummim. A person can perform magical feats that are astonishing andspectacular, as in the case of Moses versus the Egyptian priests.And ritual is efficacious and often necessary, as in the many instances ofsacrifice and ritual performed at Solomon's Temple, among other examples fromboth the Old and the New Testaments.The Protestant Reformation, however, was among other things a critique of theway in which Roman Catholicism interpreted these examples. The ritual of theMass and of the practices associated with exorcism, healing, etc. wereconsidered degenerate forms of the original Faith. Luther—himself originally aCatholic priest—railed against the inaccessibility of the Bible and the ritualswhich were available only in the Latin language which meant that only thewell-educated could read the Scriptures; this implied that there was a built-inpossibility of corruption in the Church, since the priests could represent theScriptures in any way they chose, secure in the knowledge that the averageCatholic could not hope to read the originals anyway. Luther wanted to stripaway the institutionalized obfuscation of Christ's teachings and that requiredpublishing the Bible in the vernacular and removing the mystification of theChurch's elaborate rituals.One of the results of this reform was an arbitrary division between conceptslike “religion” and “magic” in the Protestant worldview which became the norm inthe West for the next several centuries (up to the late twentieth and earlytwenty-first century when this dichotomy came to be challenged by a new breed ofhistorians of religion). Roman Catholicism, or “Popery” as it was referred to byProtestants, was tantamount to superstition and magic, a distortion of Christ'soriginal teachings. Religion was pure belief; it was faith in the word of Godand in nothing else. Ritual was suspected as being the work of the Devil. Byextricating magic from religion, the Reformation had unwittingly pitted allmagic against religion. Comfortable—yet purely arbitrary—valuations of “white”or “good” magic versus “black” or “evil” magic became irrelevant. The grace ofGod descended from On High to the human population below; there was no going inthe other direction. There was no possibility of manipulating spiritual forces.Calvinism—the logical conclusion of this sort of fatalism—was the eventualoutcome. A human being's destiny was fixed; there was no changing it. Thespiritual fate of anyone had been decided long before birth, for God kneweverything and therefore had already determined one's destiny.The reaction against this idea was inevitable. In those pre-Enlightenment daysbefore revolutionary concepts about the rights of human beings became codified,there was a suspicion that human existence was perfectible. There was a beliefthat life can be improved; that hard work combined with a modicum of luck ordivine favor—which can be earned along the way and not predetermined beforebirth—can result in better circumstances both materially and spiritually. Yet,the prevailing social structures of church and community made it dangerous toexpress such sentiments openly. The possibility of human perfectibilitytherefore was something to be pursued in secret, in the study of forbidden booksand the practice of forbidden rituals, of magic.And as human beings can be “perfected,” can attain higher spiritual states, socan everything else in creation, and most especially, metals, a beliefrepresented by the equally clandestine practice of alchemy.Magic can be understood as an expression of the belief that all human experiencecan be modified, corrected, and improved upon by the deliberate and consciousaction of humans themselves. Spiritual power flows in both directions: up anddown Jacob's Ladder like the vision of the prophet who saw angels ascending anddescending between heaven and earth. Indeed, those very angels themselves couldbe summoned, could be made to answer the call of the magician, for is it notChristian theology that states that human beings were elevated above the angelsby God?And did not Jesus say to St Peter that what Peter sealed on earth would besealed in heaven? (Matthew 16:19)Alchemy and magic thus share a worldview that is somewhat in contradistinctionto that of many organized religions. Both the alchemist and the magician areactive participants in creation and especially in their own spiritualdevelopment. They believe that creation is ongoing, that the natural evolutionof metals is towards the perfect metal, gold; that the natural evolution ofhuman beings is towards the perfect human being, the divine Adam. While theactivities of the alchemist and the magician are quite dissimilar—the alchemistin the laboratory, the magician in the temple or in a graveyard at night, or inthe woods far from human habitation—they both understand that the forces thatexist in the world can be manipulated by the wise operator. They do not wait forthe Divine Light to descend. They are in a hurry.In a very real sense, the alchemist and the magician are scientists. The proofof divinity, of spiritual realities, lies in the direct experience of them andis not taken on faith alone. They require tangible proof that their efforts arerewarded, not in the next life but in this one. The magician wants to see theangels and the demons with his or her own eyes; the alchemist needs toparticipate in the physical transformation of metals like lead and iron intogold. In a way, a way that normative religion would reject, the alchemist andthe magician are determined to prove spiritual reality. Their experiments andrituals are demonstrations of the power of the divine that exists in Creation.They offer tangible evidence of the existence of God and of the veracity of theScriptures in ways that no average pastor, no seminary-trained minister ofChrist, could hope to equal. Yet, for all that, they became outsiders. Thealchemist and the magician would never be accepted into the embrace of thechurch unless they repented of their deeds, unless they destroyed theirnotebooks and grimoires.Or unless they went on the offensive, and created their own church.THE EARLY LIFE OF THE SORCERERJoseph Smith Jr. was born on December 23, 1805 to Joseph Smith Sr and Lucy MackSmith in the town of Sharon, Vermont. His parents were familiar with currentoccult practices at the time, living in the post-Revolutionary War era that wasa hotbed of religious experimentation. Joseph Sr. himself was already acquaintedwith the use of the divining rod for finding buried treasure.Their fifth child, Joseph Jr., seemed to have been marked at an early age forsomething important. His birthday was at the winter solstice and nearly onChristmas Eve, the day commonly accepted as the birthday of Jesus. At a youngage he developed a bone infection which required his use of crutches for sometime. Later, as a pre-pubescent youth with spiritual interests, he began to usethe divining rod to find underground sources of water.His childhood in Vermont took place at a time when there was a tremendousreligious revival taking place all over the northern states, from New England toNew York and Pennsylvania. The American Revolution, followed by the War of 1812which began when Joseph Smith Jr was only seven years old, led to tremendoussocial and economic upheaval in the newly-independent States. His fatherexperienced terrible luck at farming with three years of crop failures in a rowand was going bankrupt. He tried to augment his family's meager income withtreasure-seeking using a divining rod, but with limited or no success.A divining rod is normally a forked branch or a specially-made wand of wood ormetal that is used to point to the location of buried valuables. The operatorholds the forked ends in his/her left and right hand—a bit like a steeringwheel—and invokes a higher power to enable him/her to be drawn to theunderground location. The rod will then bend towards the spot where the operatorshould begin digging.The use of the divining rod was extremely popular throughout that part of thecountry for more than a hundred years. In fact, the author knew of people usingthe divining rod in New Hampshire as late as the 1960s, mostly to find waterduring the drought of 1963–1964.But finding water or gold was not the only purpose of the divining rod. It couldalso be used as a means for spiritual communication.A group known as the Fraternity of Rodmen was active in Vermont at the time theSmiths lived there. The Fraternity was composed of men who—for instance—woulduse divining rods to determine who built the so-called “Indian burial” mounds byasking if it had been the Egyptians, etc. until the rod would respond at themention of the Welsh. If the rod did not move, the answer was “no.” Any movementwas usually interpreted as a “yes.” 1 [part0005.html#ft1]This went further to the extent that the Fraternity began receiving instructionsto build a temple, since they were informed that they were descendants of theLost Tribes of Israel. The idea that the New World was the ultimate destinationof the wandering tribes had tremendous currency in those days, and groups likethe New Israelites were formed along the lines of that belief. Other groupsinsisted that the Native Americans were themselves remnants of the Lost Tribes,while such seventeenth-century luminaries as Cotton Mather claimed that the “RedMen” were in fact Devils incarnate since there was no mention of the NativeAmericans in the Bible.Eventually, the group known as the Fraternity of Rodmen began making predictionsabout the end of the world, which was due to take place—according to theirreckoning—on January 14, 1802. One eyewitness to those events remembered hearingthat Joseph Smith Sr had been involved with the Rodmen and with their failedprediction concerning the apocalypse of 1802.This event is mentioned to situate the reader in the place and time in whichJoseph Smith Jr had been born and raised. Divining rods, angelic communications,and the all-important seer stones or shew stones—ancestors to the crystalball—were part and parcel of a religious and spiritual environment that saw thegenesis and growth of charismatic religious movements side by side with magic,alchemy and other occult practices.The Smith family eventually left Vermont for the town of Palmyra, New York about1816, where Joseph Sr tried to improve his circumstances and where his sonJoseph Jr began to work with the occult practices he learned from his father. By1817 at the earliest Joseph Smith Jr began actively divining for water and by1819 he was using occult methods to find buried treasure.It should be noted that this is not an isolated phenomenon. Hard-working peoplewho nonetheless find themselves in straitened circumstances—usually through nofault of their own that they can see—often resort to otherworldly measuresthrough desperation. A farmer with useless land, a drought, or sick cattle mayfind himself willing to try a divining rod, a seer stone, or more elaborateoccult rituals in order to achieve some of the luck that falls on his neighbors.These are people who are perfectly willing to do whatever it takes to succeed inlife, but find that they have been thwarted through circumstances over whichthey have no control. Occultism offers a means to seize that control usingunconventional methods. This represents a belief that all events are connectedthrough some invisible medium; that there are hidden forces at work in the worldwhich seem to favor one person rather than another. This may be due toastrological influences—something as simple as being in the right place at theright time—or to something more specific. If astrological influences are atwork, then it stands to reason that a close observation of astrologicaltimetables would help ensure the successful outcome of any endeavor. Almanacswere the source for much of this information, and it was understood thatplanting cycles depended on observance of the lunar calendar, for instance, sowhy would human cycles of health and wealth not depend on similar planetarypositions?At the same time, the pious were known to pray to God and the saints for help inevery stressful circumstance: to heal sickness, or to find a lost article or amissing person, or to protect against an epidemic. Would not that prayer be moreefficacious if it was timed to the appropriate astrological cycle?This mechanistic view of the universe provided a measure of hope to thedisenfranchised and dispossessed. After all, the alternative was unthinkable:that some people were simply born lucky while others were destined for a life ofmisery regardless of their piety, their hard work, or the force of their will.Instead, the universe was like a giant clockwork and all one had to do was getinside the gears and make certain adjustments—through the use of ritual, for themost part—and fortune would smile.As can be seen, the Smith family was one of many who clung to the belief thatdivine providence could be manipulated, could actually be managed. This was notseen as antithetical to religion but as an extension of religion into mundanereality, a kind of “God helps those who help themselves” way of thinking. It wasalso a way of taking power back from the priests.The Protestant Reformation made it possible for average laypersons to conceiveof themselves as religious specialists. Until that time, the privilege ofrepresenting the Word of God was the province of the priesthood and especiallythe Catholic Church. It was, in a sense, a monopoly. Martin Luther changed allof that and made it possible for anyone to read the Bible in the common languageand receive revelations directly from God. New churches, new religiousmovements, denominations and sects sprang up like mushrooms after a spring rain,each with their own prophet and their own revelation. The Reformation offered akind of democratization of religion, particularly of Christianity, and in sodoing made divine contact accessible to everyone. Once the authority of theCatholic Church was denied, then anyone could become a priest, a prophet, aminister of God. This also meant that the old ways of worship could bechallenged, and the old canons of the Church altered, changed, amended…orcompletely disregarded. Once the Catholic Church ceased to hold a monopoly onTruth and the Law, then anything was (at least potentially) permissible so longas it was presented in the context of Christian culture and Biblical authority.Magic offered just such an option. Its rituals were couched in Biblical phrasesand invocations, with Hebrew and Latin terms and prayers used throughout andthus preserving some continuity with the Old and New Testaments as well as withthe institutionalized Church. God was called upon, as was Jesus and varioussaints as well as the angels and archangels. And just as Roman Catholic priestshad the power to cast out demons, so did the new and independent religiousspecialists.Such as Joseph Smith.In 1830, a neighbor—Newell Knight—fell into a fit that was interpreted asdemonic possession. It would be Joseph Smith who exorcised the demon in acelebrated case. This was years after he had performed the rites of ceremonialmagic in the woods of upstate New York and recovered the fabled golden plates onwhich was written what would become the Book of Mormon.THE RITUALS OF THE SORCERERThe Second Book forms a complete treatise on the mysteries of the Cabala andCeremonial Magic; by the study of which, a man (who can separate himself frommaterial objects, by the mortification of the sensual appetite-abstinence fromdrunkenness, gluttony, and other bestial passions, and who lives pure andtemperate, free from those actions which degenerate a man to a brute) may becomea recipient of Divine light and knowledge; by which they may foresee things tocome, whether to private families, or kingdoms, or states, empires, battles,victories, &c.; and likewise be capable of doing much good to theirfellow-creatures: such as the healing of all disorders, and assisting with thecomforts of life the unfortunate and distressed.—Francis Barrett's The Magus (preface)The occult environment of the early nineteenth century in New England and NewYork was a mélange of alchemy, divination, and magic. Alchemy was believed to bea source of wealth, so its practice among the poorer population involved frauds,counterfeiters, and hoaxsters. It seemed like a “get rich quick” scheme for manywho were suffering because of the economic uncertainty that plagued the earlydays of the Republic, and they never questioned why it was that these“alchemists” were willing to help them create gold—for a fee, of course—ratherthan simply make the gold themselves in private. However, there were alsoserious alchemists in the United States in those days, particularly inMassachusetts and Connecticut where university presidents and professors wereinvolved in a serious study of the subject and often in regular correspondencewith like-minded professionals in England and elsewhere abroad.A key element of the alchemical worldview is the idea of perfection andespecially of perfectibility. This is the cornerstone of hermetic thought ingeneral, that human beings are in a process of spiritual evolution which can be“jump-started” through a series of initiations, whether by more highly evolvedhuman beings (such as masters of secret societies) through ritual and training,or via self-initiation through the more solitary practices of alchemy and magic.Mormonism, in order to be understood, must be viewed through the lens ofoccultism and particularly of the hermetic form that Joseph Smith embracedthroughout his life and especially in the last five years or so when heincorporated Masonic and other ideas—such as differing levels of priesthood—intothe Temple. It was as if he had seen something ineffable and had to surround itwith a fortress of secrets, passwords, arcane rituals and silence in order toprotect it from misuse or profanation.It can be said that much of the secrecy has gone out of Judaism, Christianityand Islam. The only remaining secrets in these three Abrahamic faiths are to befound in their mystical analogues: in Jewish Kabbalah, Christian mysticism (suchas Rosicrucianism), and Islamic mystical sects such as the Sufis. Secrecy andreligion do not, as a rule, go together but secrecy and occultism (the very word“occult” means “secret” or “hidden”) do. What Smith did was to incorporate amystical practice or process within a religion, making it the central feature ofthe organization if not of the faith itself. It is perhaps for this reason morethan any other that Mormonism is decried as a “cult.”The basis for this occult approach to religion is to be found in Smith's earlyspiritual practices. We have mentioned that he began his career by divining forwater and for buried treasure. This was not as antinomian as it might appear,since there was a tradition of the divining rod in that part of the world thathas continued to the present day. While the alchemist tried to manufacture gold,the diviner simply went looking for it. The diviner's assumption was that thegold already existed—either as ore or as buried treasure—and all that wasrequired was a kind of mystical “ground penetrating radar” to find it. Thealchemist's assumption was that all metals naturally evolved towards gold—theperfect metal—and all that was required was to hurry the process along. Sincethe method for transmuting lead into gold was not written down clearly in auser's manual but had to be discovered by reading Nature itself (as well as theheavily-encoded alchemical manuscripts that were virtually impossible todecipher) the easier approach was to simply look for gold that already existed.This anyone could do provided they had a forked stick and limitless patience.But what separated the successful diviner from the failed seeker after gold wasthe character of the diviner himself (and they were usually men). The divinerhad to demonstrate a connection with the invisible forces that guarded thetreasure, either through prayer or through some charismatic aspect of hispersonality. Possession of a divining rod alone was not enough to guaranteesuccess; a certain innate occult power was also required. Thus some divinerswere celebrated for their abilities, and this included the young Joseph SmithJr.It is generally acknowledged that Smith had a knack for finding things with hisdivining rod and, later, his “shew stone.” It is impossible at this remove todetermine the truth of any of these claims or to interpret them within any kindof scientific framework. We can venture a possibility that some of Smith'salleged success with occult methods was due to several factors, most especiallySmith's age at the time that these experiments began.Poltergeist activity, for instance, is believed to occur around teenaged boysand girls, particularly those undergoing some form of emotional or psychologicalstress. While this phenomenon is by no means scientifically validated toeveryone's satisfaction, some recent studies tend to support at least thecontention that these events are somehow related to the stress levels of thoseindividuals who suffer from this condition. Knocks, bites, pinching, thelevitation of objects, and various other forms of psychokinesis are included inthe list of possible poltergeist activity. While the cause-effect relationshipis unknown, there is no doubt that poltergeist activity has taken place. Thefamous Annemarie Schneider case of Rosenheim, Germany in 1967 is just one,well-documented, case that was investigated by physicists from the Max PlanckInstitute who came away secure in their opinion that no fraud was involved, norwas the poltergeist activity the result of anything they knew of physics. Ms.Schneider—who was nineteen at the time of the investigation—had experiencedsevere personal trauma prior to the events in question and was believed to havebeen suffering from neurosis. She was eventually identified as the cause of thepoltergeist phenomenon, which took place in the office where she worked as asecretary.Joseph Smith was growing up in stressful circumstances due to poverty and a setof parents that might be characterized as dysfunctional today, or at least“odd.” Contributing to this was the wave of religious fervor combined withoccult activity that was sweeping the Burned-Over District of New York at thetime of the Second Great Awakening. When Smith began his divining activity in1817, he was not yet twelve years old. If there is a correlation between psychicphenomena, youth, and emotional stress then Joseph Smith was a prime candidate.Add to that a family that was already involved in various forms of occultactivity and you had a laboratory for creating a psychic, a medium, or someother spiritual practitioner. Or someone who pretended to be.The motivation for seeking perfection may be due to the identification of flawswithin one's own personality or circumstances and the desire to erase them or totransform them into something nobler. For a twelve-year-old farm boy with adivining rod, the possibility of becoming something other, something valuable,must have been irresistible. And the pressure to find money, buried treasure, orgold likewise must have been intense. Like a Zen koan, the solution was notnecessarily logical.Making the rounds of bookstores in the early nineteenth century was anencyclopedic work by Francis Barrett, entitled The Magus. Published in 1801 inEngland, it is a compendium of occult lore and most especially of thatdiscipline known as ceremonial magic, taken from such authoritative sources asthe Three Books of Occult Philosophy by Cornelius Agrippa, as well as the FourthBook of Occult Philosophy (which was attributed, erroneously, to Agrippa, andwhich has the most direct instructions for the practice of ceremonial magic).While we are not certain precisely when Joseph Smith first set his eyes on thisbook, it is beyond doubt that he was working with a copy in the period shortlybefore his death for the design of the talisman he was wearing on the day he wasmurdered came directly from the pages of The Magus.Ceremonial magic is, as its name implies, a form of magic that relies heavily onthe correct performance of ritual. These rituals are designed to contactspiritual forces directly, through the use of invocations, ritual gestures,incenses appropriate to the spiritual force being summoned, etc. The alchemisthas his crucible and retort, his alembic and oven. In the alembic, a piece ofraw material is sealed and operations performed on it to initiate its physicaltransformation. The magician, on the other hand, is the raw material of thetransformation and the ritual chamber, the magic circle, is his alembic. Tosimplify, in the alchemist's laboratory lead is transformed into gold. In themagic circle, the lead transforms itself.Joseph Smith did not understand this at first, not when he was a young teenagerpracticing magic for the first time. However, as he matured into his role as theProphet, he realized that the first steps he took on the path of ceremonialmagic were leading him towards the same conclusion. This is evident fromobserving the development of Mormonism from just another quasi-Christiandenomination into an initiatory structure with secret ceremonies and higher andhigher levels of spiritual responsibility. The end result of all this refinementcan only be the apotheosis: the goal of Hermeticism and of ceremonial magic (aswell as alchemy) in particular.The Magus sets all this out quite clearly. While sections of the book aredevoted to the manufacture of talismans, “natural magic”, alchemy, potions andphiltres, and the Kabbalah, the portion of the book that usually attracts themost attention is that on ceremonial magic. Barrett insists that a person bemorally pure before engaging in these pursuits, as the quotation that beginsthis section indicates. Barrett states that the goal of all of this is to attainthe Divine Light and to help other human beings in their suffering thereby.We may find precursors to the Mormon prohibition against alcohol and caffeine inthis preface to The Magus, but that is purely speculation since many religionshave dietary restrictions of various kinds. Purity, however, was an importantelement of early Mormonism and even of Smith's ability to find the golden plateson which the Book of Mormon was inscribed, as we will see. But thecharacterization of the magician as someone who is possessed of divinity anduses that power to help others must have impressed itself on the mind of JosephSmith, who effectively elevated the status of magician to that ofdivinely-inspired Prophet. The connection between Joseph Smith as magician toJoseph Smith as prophet is a direct one, a solid line rather than a dotted line,for it was the ritual of magic that produced the Book of Mormon and created areligion.His first operations of ceremonial magic began in earnest on September 22, 1823,one hundred and thirty-one years to the day after the execution of Mary TowneEasty as a witch in Salem, Massachusetts after accusations of witchcraft bySmith's ancestor, Samuel Smith…an event which the Smith family certainlyremembered as Joseph would one day return to Salem to seek buried treasure inhis ancestor's neighborhood. It was also the first day of autumn, and the firstdegree of the sign of Libra. As one of the quarter days of the year (the othersbeing the spring equinox and the winter and summer solstices) it formed part ofthe occult calendar with which Smith was familiar from his reading of occulttexts or from common knowledge as presented in the almanacs of the period.At the time of this all-important magical operation, Joseph Smith was not yeteighteen years-old.Up to this time, Smith had been using a “shew stone” or “seer stone.” This was astone that he would put into a hat, and then peer into the hat at the stone andthereby obtain visions. Evidently the placement of the stone in the hat wouldensure that Smith could gaze onto the stone in darkness as he held the hat up tohis face. This is virtually identical to the practice of gazing into a crystalball, as no doubt many readers have already surmised.One of his visions was of a spirit who told him that golden plates were buriedin a cave on the Hill Cumorah.There was no hill named Cumorah at the time, the word “Cumorah” having come fromthe Book of Mormon itself. There also is some controversy as to just which hillin the Palmyra region would have been Cumorah. The area is riddled withdrumlins, which are ripples in the earth caused by glacier movement. None of thedrumlins would have had a natural cave, but perhaps that is the point.In any event, armed with his vision and with instruments necessary for a ritualof ceremonial magic, Smith retired to the hill in question and—at the stroke ofmidnight on September 22, 1823—performed the occult evocation. It was by hisaccount a success. The golden plates were revealed. However, and according toone version of the story, as he made to grab them from their resting place, anamphibious creature of some sort jumped out of the cave, turned into a man, andhit him on the head, burying the plates once more and keeping them out of thereach of the teenaged magician.The nature of the creature has been open to some debate, as we will see shortly.That it was amphibious is interesting, for it means a being that can exist inthe land and the sea, a potent symbol of the transformative process.But why did the spirit prevent Smith from taking the golden plates?According to Smith, it was because Smith's own motives were not pure. He wasthinking only of the gold and of enriching himself thereby, and not of higherspiritual matters.Smith would keep returning to the Hill Cumorah and its mysterious cave yearafter year, from 1823 to 1827, on the same day. It was in the final ritual ofSeptember 22, 1827 that Smith would finally be allowed to take the plates whichwere covered in a form of hieroglyphics as well as a pair of magic spectaclesthat would enable him to begin the process of translating what would become theBook of Mormon.In order to do so, he had to convince the guardian angel of the plates that hewas pure of heart and that his motives were blameless.The angel's name was Moroni.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0005.html#fn1] The idea that the Welsh may have built the mounds was notoriginal with the Rodmen. As august a personality as Dr John Dee—the Elizabethanmagician, mathematician and spy—was convinced that the New World had beenvisited by the Welsh long before Columbus. It was also with Dr. Dee that we havean early example of the use of the “shew stone” or “seer stone” that JosephSmith used. In Dee's case, the stone was made of obsidian brought over from theNew World itself."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO:THE ANGELBe it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this workshall come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator of this work, has shown untous the plates of which hath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; andas many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with ourhands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearanceof ancient work, and of curious workmanship. And this we bear record with wordsof soberness, that the said Smith has shown unto us, for we have seen andhefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which wehave spoken. And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the worldthat which we have seen. And we lie not, God bearing witness of it.The “Testimony of Eight Witnesses” inThe Book of MormonTHE ANGEL MORONI, who first appeared to Joseph Smith the night before his firstoperation of ceremonial magic on September 22, 1823, had been a human beingbefore he was an angel. This is an important point, and one which is oftenneglected or ignored.Just as Smith grew up in an atmosphere of strange religious sects and occultpractices, as well as serious Hermetic work with the goal of human perfectionalways in mind, so too did some ancient texts imply that humans could becomeangels and indeed had become angels. The most famous of these is the AngelMetatron.Familiar to students of Jewish mysticism and particularly of merkavah, “chariot”or “throne” mysticism, Metatron appears as the name of an angel who sits on athrone in heaven. There are various explanations for Metatron, and there wereattempts by early Jewish scholars to link him with Enoch (Gen. 5:24) who was“taken” to heaven by God and presumably transformed from a human being with acorporeal form to something more supernatural.In the early eighteenth century, a Jewish apocalyptic text was publishedentitled “The Revelation of Moses,” which purported to be a description of howMetatron transformed Moses's body into spiritual substance—i.e., “fire”—in orderthat Moses may ascend the seven heavens and approach the throne of God. Elijahthe prophet of the Old Testament was likewise taken directly—and bodily—toheaven (2 Kings 2:1) where it is presumed he exchanged his corporeal form forsomething able to withstand the heavenly environment.Thus, Joseph Smith's Angel Moroni comes from a distinguished line of prophetswho were transformed into spiritual entities. These cases especially areinteresting because they relate directly to the practice of Jewish mysticismknown as “the Descent to the Chariot.” This was a process of visualization andritual in which the mystic ascended the seven heavens to approach the throne ofGod. The “Chariot” in the title can be taken to mean the chariot that broughtthe prophet Elijah to heaven as well as the chariot that appeared beforeEzekiel, a biblical episode that is directly connected to Ezekiel's vision of aNew Jerusalem with a rebuilt Temple of Solomon, a theme that obsessed JosephSmith in his final years.Moroni was the son of Mormon, and was entrusted with the golden plates on whichthe history of his people was written; thus the entire collection of various“books” was published under the name The Book of Mormon. Moroni's own genealogyis a key to understanding what the Book of Mormon is all about and thecontroversies that have bedeviled the text to this day.TREASURE GUARDIANSBefore we look at Moroni specifically, we must first address the most obviouselement of the discovery story: that of the amphibian who jumped out of the cavewhere the treasure was buried. How did the Angel Moroni—who had, after all, oncebeen a human being and a prophet—become transformed into a toad?In order to answer this question, we have to look at the persistent legendsconcerning buried treasure and the spirits that guard it.There was a recurring myth concerning buried treasure in North America,particularly on the eastern seaboard, which was connected with tales of pirates.The basic myth structure has a pirate burying treasure in a remote location andthen killing the man who had helped him dig the burial spot, in order that hisspirit would continue to guard the treasure. Many of these stories were linkedto the romantic legend of the pirate William Kidd (1654–1701), who waseventually captured in Boston and executed in London for piracy. Kidd had buriedtreasure on Gardiner's Island in New York, but that was retrieved by thegovernor and used as evidence in the trial against him. Rumors abounded,however, of Kidd having buried treasure all over the world, from Japan andVietnam to the Caribbean and Canada, and virtually everywhere in between. Thetreasure remained buried because of Kidd's execution in London in 1701, sotreasure hunters began scouring old records or listening to the tall tales oflocals in an effort to secure for themselves the hidden gold and jewels.It is known that Joseph Smith read the stories of Kidd and was enthralled bythem (as were many of his contemporaries). The idea that there could be treasureburied anywhere from Nova Scotia to Florida, and from the east coast as farinland as central Pennsylvania, was prevalent not only in fictional literaturebut as a mainstay of the treasure diviners. (Their modern equivalent might bethose who wander along the seashore or the countryside with metal detectors,hoping to find anything from loose change to Spanish doubloons.)Many of these stories involved the appearance of a ghost who would attempt tofrighten the treasure hunters away. The ghost was the spirit of the slain piratewho would often appear as he had when murdered: covered in blood and moaningpitiably. The treasure itself was always in a strong box of some kind, buried ina hole in the ground, and covered with a large stone. One had to lift the stoneand then retrieve the box, and do it all without saying a word. Silence was akey issue in the retrieval of this spectral treasure; should the treasure seekeras much as exclaim an “Aha!” the treasure would disappear and all furtherattempts to find it would be thwarted.It is interesting to note that the story we have told about Joseph Smith beingvisited by the Angel Moroni and then finding the buried box, only to have itdisappear when Smith's motives were not pure, may not have been the originaltale told by Smith.According to admittedly hostile sources contemporary with Smith, he first toldthe story of finding the buried box being guarded not by an angel but by theghost of a murdered man. This man had a long beard and his throat was slit fromear to ear. His clothes were covered in blood. It was the precise image from thetreasure-seekers legends with virtually no change of any kind.According to this version of the story it was only later that it becametransformed and with it the murdered pirate became the Angel Moroni who was, ofcourse, first a human being and a prophet and later an Angel.Mormons contest this reading of course, claiming that the Captain Kidd versionwas a later interpolation by critics hostile to Mormonism, who wanted to linkthe otherwise pious Joseph Smith to the mercenary pursuit of treasure-diggingand thereby devalue the Book of Mormon and the entire religion upon which it isbased.A long response to the Captain Kidd story by Mormon apologist Larry E. Morrismore or less successfully refutes some of these claims but ignores one vitalpiece of information: that the names of the Hill Cumorah and the Angel Moronimight be linked specifically to Captain Kidd.One of Kidd's destinations on his piratical tour of the Indian Ocean was theComoros Islands, which are off the southeastern coast of Africa, nearMadagascar. The capital city of the Comoros is…Moroni. The suggestion that theHill Cumorah began as the Comoros to young Joseph Smith, and that the AngelMoroni was christened after its capital city of Moroni, is so compelling that weare forced to consider that maybe the critics have a point. After all, there isno known etymological link between the words Cumorah and Moroni on the one handand their alleged Jewish origins on the other. The Mormon apologistabove-mentioned does not dispute the claim that Joseph Smith was familiar withthe Captain Kidd tales, nor does he address the Comoros/Cumorah or Moroni/Moronicoincidence (although others do2 [part0006.html#ft2]). Rather, he insists thatSmith had a visitation from an Angel on the night of September 21, 1823 andagain at the Hill Cumorah on September 22, 1823 and for successive yearsthereafter, and bases this on Smith's published testimony even though Smithpublished several versions of this episode which do not completely agree3[part0006.html#ft3], and there is also the version published by his mother, LucyMack Smith, which is hagiographic but which does not deny that the family wasinvolved in occult pursuits from time to time.4 [part0006.html#ft4]Mormon apologists usually want to point out that the milieu in which Smith wasraised was an amalgam of normative Christian religion with “folk magic”practices, such as the divining rod, and that it would have been unusual forSmith not to have been involved in such practices or to have been aware of them.They insist that the atmosphere of the time was such that the boundary betweenmagic and religion was blurred, at best, or non-existent at worst. They willalso cite Biblical precedents, such as Moses and Aaron and their magical battlewith the Pharaoh's magicians, for Joseph Smith's activities as a youth.The author does not dispute any of this. It has been well-documented byresponsible academic historians such as John L. Brooke in The Refiner's Firethat occult practices flourished alongside normative religion in earlynineteenth century America, not only among the farmers and laborers andmerchants but also among the educated and the intelligentsia. Religion mighthave provided solace for the soul, but could do nothing for the soil. Farmersand other workers needed more than piety in order to survive. They needed amechanism for wresting wealth out of the ground, one way or another. Magicseemed to afford them just such a means and—in the texts known as the grimoiresand other magical workbooks—the language was Christian and the approach wassacred. One called upon God and his angels in order to find gold, heal the sick,or locate lost cattle.That is why this author finds no discrepancy or inconsistency between Smith'salleged treasure-seeking on the one hand and his alleged conversation with anAngel on the other. In the context of ceremonial magic, one calls upon angels(or demons, or spirits of the dead) to find gold, heal the sick, and locate lostcattle. The Captain Kidd interpretation may be more of a distraction than isneeded, for the scene of the young sorcerer at midnight on the autumnal equinoxconjuring an Angel to find gold is perfectly consistent with the methodologyrepresented in the occult workbooks, such as Francis Barrett's The Magus.Mormon apologists, however, claim that there is no evidence that Smith ever usedthe entire ritual formula of ceremonial magic that was published in The Magusand therefore that Smith did not use the magic circle and other apparatus aslisted in The Magus to find gold.This critique has several problems, as anyone who has dabbled in ceremonialmagic at all would recognize, so it is perhaps to the credit of the Mormonapologists that they do not have direct experience of this phenomenon and thattherefore their reasoning is a little faulty.Virtually no one in impoverished circumstances would have been able toincorporate all of the elements Barrett (or, actually, the pseudo-Agrippa of theFourth Book of Occult Philosophy) insists are essential to the practice. Thereare swords, vestments, incenses, parchments, all without number. Special inksmade from the blood of specific animals and herbs. Lengthy personal preparationsinvolving sacred baths, etc. Most magicians of the author's acquaintance—and heknows a few—began their occult careers by ignoring most of these requirementsand doing the best they could with whatever they had available. So let it bewith Joseph Smith. To say that Smith could not have followed the instructions inThe Magus and therefore did not use the rituals at all implies that all of theother users of The Magus did. Smith was seventeen years old at the time of thefirst September 22 invocation. He would have taken a number of shortcuts.What would have been possible to do is what it seems he did do: choose aspecific time (midnight on the autumnal equinox), go to a secluded location,cast a circle, make an invocation, and wait. It was better than postponing theritual until all the various implements listed by Barrett could be obtained,consecrated, etc.Mormons also like to point out that the day chosen—deliberately oraccidentally—by Joseph Smith and/or the Angel Moroni for the first conjurationwas also the first day of the Jewish New Year, Rosh ha-Shonah. This would havebeen intriguing, especially in light of the “Descent to the Chariot” ideamentioned above since the Jewish New Year was an important day for this merkavahpractice, except that September 22, 1823 was not Rosh ha-Shonah.Recourse to Jewish calendars for the year in question demonstrates thatSeptember 22, 1823 was not Rosh ha-Shonah but the third day of Sukkoth. Sukkothis one of the holy days that follow Rosh ha-Shonah and Yom Kippur, both of whichtook place earlier in September (September 5th and September 14th,respectively). So although this allegation is repeated in many forums, it isincorrect. There was no correlation between the Jewish New Year and the day onwhich Joseph Smith struggled with an Angel. Thus we are left with the mostobvious of all the choices: that September 22 was selected because of itsastrological and occult significance as the autumnal equinox.But what about the toad?As with everything Mormon, there is controversy over this issue as well. Infact, the reaction of the Mormon hierarchy to a fraudulent document known as the“Salamander Letter” is evidence that the LDS Church did take the toad story aspossible fact.The story briefly is this:As some contemporaries of Smith record it, Smith told them that when he firstwent to take the golden plates out of the ground on September 22, 1823, that thetreasure was guarded by a toad. The toad then transformed into a larger animaland eventually into a human being or a spirit…the details are a little hazy anddepend on which of the testimonies one reads or believes. In any event, whatbegan as a toad ended as a slap in the head to Joseph Smith and the temporaryloss of the plates.Most historians discount the toad story since it was related either second-handor third-hand or was published by critics hostile to Mormonism. The issue shouldhave ended there, but in the 1980s a scandal developed in Salt Lake City—at theheadquarters of the LDS Church—over the existence of the Salamander Letter.This forgery pretended to be a letter by one of Joseph Smith's intimates statingthat the creature that was guarding the treasure on that first night was asalamander. The head of the LDS Church bought the incriminating document from aman later revealed to have been a master forger—Mark Hofmann—for a huge sum ofmoney, and then promptly buried the document deep in the Mormon vaults where itwas determined it should never see the light of day.Why was the reference to a salamander considered incriminating?To answer that, we have to return to our treasure-hunting scenario.One of the features of buried treasure stories is the guardian factor. As wehave seen, these can sometimes take the form of men or women who were murderedon-site—usually to protect the secret of the location of the treasure—and whosespirits now haunt the site. Other stories abound in the European literature,especially of demonic guardians of treasure. Such medieval sorcerer's workbooksas the Red Dragon or the Grand Grimoire feature the demon Lucifuge Rofocale, whois in charge of the treasures of the earth. A famous drawing (see below) of thisindividual shows him to be standing next to a buried pile of gold that iscovered by a rock.As can be seen, this demon appears in a quasi-animal form with a tail, clovenhoofs, and horns which was a typical concept of the Devil at the time. InEuropean magic, toads, lizards and other amphibians were consideredrepresentatives of the Devil or different manifestations of the Devil himself.Buried treasure was their domain, and they had to be propitiated in some waybefore they would release their bounty. Often, this required a pact. In thepopular imagination, this would be an agreement with the Devil, signed in thesorcerer's blood. There are many examples in history of such pacts, and a fewactual examples do remain such as the one allegedly signed by Urbain Grandier(of the famous “Devils of Loudon” episode in which the priest, Grandier, wasaccused of demonolatry in the year 1633 in France).images [../images/00002.gif]To make matters more interesting, the popular idea of a salamander was as anelemental figure associated with fire. There was a demonic aspect to thesalamander, and if Smith had indeed been confronted with a salamander then thereaction among some Mormons would have been that his entire experience had beenthe work of the Devil. When Mark Hofmann created his forgery—known as the“Salamander Letter”—he knew what he was doing. He knew that the LDS Church wouldtake any measures necessary to obtain the letter and hide it away forever. Thefact that they did so—that they paid a huge sum of money for the letter and thenburied it in their vault—is evidence that the Mormons themselves were insecurein their faith and harbored deep suspicions that Smith was engaged in occultpractices and that the result of those practices was the conjuration of a demonwhich then gave Smith a bogus scripture.As it happened, the letter was proven to be a forgery after a series of murdersand increasingly desperate steps taken by Hofmann to extort more money from theLDS Church, including a failed bombing attempt which left Hofmann himselfinjured. The exposure of the affair of the Salamander Letter was anembarrassment for the Church, for it called into question a host of assumptionsabout Smith, the Book of Mormon, and the Church itself. These assumptions werebased on the official doctrine that Smith was not involved in ceremonial magicor occultism. These assumptions would be shown to be faulty at best, orcompletely erroneous at worst.It is virtually impossible to separate the circumstances of Joseph Smith'sadventure with the golden plates from popular ideas of treasure-digging thatwere common currency at the time. Mormons insist that there is no connection, ora tenuous connection at best, but historians such as Brooke mentioned above havedemonstrated that treasure-digging was a well-known practice and that the stepsto be taken were common knowledge in rural New England and New York.For Smith to have spoken of a buried treasure of golden plates that wasprotected by a guardian spirit, and of the ritualistic nature of his pursuit ofthat treasure, can only mean that his story was to be taken in the context ofthe times. Perhaps Smith's genius lay in elevating the mundane and“superstitious” practice of treasure hunting to something more sublime: intransforming the bloody, murdered pirate or the loathesome toad into an angel inflowing white robes bathed in divine light, and the treasure into a sacredscripture with a new dispensation for humanity. By claiming that the AngelMoroni had once been a human being and was transformed into an angel wasconsistent with ideas of the ghosts of murdered pirates guarding the buriedtreasure. And the plates themselves were not clay tablets written in cuneiformor ancient parchments written in Hebrew or Aramaic, but instead were leaves ofgold on which was written “Reformed Egyptian.” All of the basic elements of thetreasure-digging myth had been taken up and subtly but dramatically transformed.Like the Catholic Church's appropriation of the Feast of Saturnalia asChristmas, or the erection of cathedrals on formerly pagan sites, Joseph Smithperformed a similar transformation of the occult themes current in his day.And it worked. After all, a visit to Salt Lake City and the Mormon Tabernaclethere would convince anyone that Smith had, indeed, discovered a source ofincredible wealth.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------2 [part0006.html#fn2] Some Mormons object that the Comoros Islands andespecially the settlement of Moroni did not appear in atlases or gazettes of thetime of Joseph Smith. However, they do not address the likelihood that Smithwould have been aware of this geography from stories of William Kidd who did, infact, visit the Comoros and Moroni during his travels.3 [part0006.html#fn3] At times, Smith refers to this Angel as “Nephi” which isone of the prophets in the Book of Mormon.4 [part0006.html#fn4] This is also a controversial point, and depends on how onereads the sentence in Lucy Mack's book. Apologists take it to mean that theSmith family never involved itself in magic; critics of Mormonism read the samesentence as meaning they did! There is no consensus of opinion on this issue."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREETHE NEW RELIGION…they have also as strong a faith in the power of their ark as ever theIsraelites had in theirs, ascribing the success of one party to their stricteradherence to the law, than the other, we have strong reason to conclude them ofHebrew origin. The Indians have an old tradition, that when they left their ownnative land, they brought with them a sanctified rod by order of an oracle,which they fixed every evening in the ground, and were to remove from place toplace on the continent towards the sun rising till it budded in one night'stime. I have seen other Indians, says the same writer, who related the samething. Instead of the miraculous direction to which they limit it, in theirwestern banishment, it appears more likely that they refer to the ancientcircumstance of the rod of Aaron, which in order to check the murmur of thosewho conspired against him, was in his favour made to bud blossoms and yieldalmonds at one and the same time.—Mordechai Noah, Discourse on the Evidences of the American Indians being theDescendants of the Lost Tribes of Israel, p 13 (emphasis in the original)IN ADDITION TO THE OCCULT IDEAS popular in early post-Revolutionary America,such as the divining rod and buried treasure, there were alternative historiesconcerning the new country in which the early Americans found themselves. Likethe “ancient astronaut” theories of today, these were based on fragmentaryevidence, suggestive associations, suspicion of authority, and energeticspeculation. This was a time of obsession about “origins”, as the Americans wereof European descent (or, in the case of the slaves, African or Native Americandescent) and had no deep cultural roots in North America. The cities they livedin were the cities they built themselves; there was no admiring of theRenaissance architecture of Italy, or the cafés along the Left Bank in Paris, orshivering at the Tower of London. There were simple homes, simple shops, and fewof these were more than a hundred years old by the time Joseph Smith was born.Thus, the land itself began to take on a mysterious allure. Who lived herebefore? Were the Native Americans descendants of some other race, some race notmentioned in the Bible? What ghosts haunted the forests of New England andupstate New York? What treasure awaited discovery in the dark and bloody ground?In short: just what had the European settlers and conquerors inherited in thiswild and untamed continent?There were at least two main currents of alternative history at the time. Thefirst involved the archaeological significance of what are commonly referred toas “Indian burial mounds.” These structures were found all over the Atlanticseaboard from Florida to New Hampshire and inland as far as Missouri and Texas,and some have survived to this day.Although referred to as burial mounds, not all of these structures were used forburial. Some had other ritual significance, although details have been lost totime as their builders do not seem to have left any written testimony other thanthe odd petroglyph of uncertain provenance. Some of the mounds clearly had anastronomical purpose (like Stonehenge in England) and were of staggering sizeand complexity. We can mention the famous Serpent Mound in Adams County, Ohio asonly one of these, a fabulous structure dated anywhere from 250 to 1000 CE.Other mounds, at Marietta and Chilicothe, Ohio and at Moundsville, WestVirginia, are mute testimony to the labors of a fantastic race of pre-Columbiansthat thrived more than a thousand years before modern Europeans began arriving.Some digging in these mounds often resulted in the discovery of pottery, ancientjewelry, or other artifacts—including curiously carved stone tablets—thusfueling a cottage industry in amateur archaeology and treasure-hunting. EvenCotton Mather—an observer at the Salem witchcraft trials—was aware of thestrange stone carvings and mentioned them in his Magnalia Christi Americanapublished in 1702. However, the nature of the builders themselves had not beendetermined conclusively thereby allowing for all forms of imaginative theoriessome of which have persisted till the present time in the continued absence ofdefinitive identification.This led to the second main current of speculative history, which was that ofthe Lost Tribes of Israel.The idea that ten of the original twelve tribes of Israel were “lost” has beenpersistent through the thousands of years that have passed since the BabylonianExile. Today, there is considerable controversy over this issue and even if anyof the tribes could be considered to have been truly “lost” at all, and notmerely assimilated into local cultures. Prior to the late twentieth century,however, the idea that ten of the twelve tribes were lost and scatteredthroughout the world proved to be seductive. Many theories were put forward,including the idea that descendants of the lost tribes included westernEuropeans, certain African groups, the Irish, the British, etc.One of the most prevalent theories was that the Native American population wasdescended from the Jews. This idea probably began with the voyages of aseventeenth century Portuguese explorer, Antonio de Montezinos, who claimed hehad found Jewish descendants among the Native Americans of what is now Ecuador.He was actually able to convince a noted Dutch Rabbi—Menasseh ben Israel—of thistheory, and ben Israel published an account of this in The Hope of Israel, abook printed in London in 1650. The impact of this book was tremendous, and thetheory was repeated in various forms and among various groups around the world.One of the proponents of this theory in the United States was a president of theContinental Congress and director of the US Mint, Elias Boudinot (1740–1821).Boudinot was an important early supporter of citizenship for Black Americans aswell as the Native American population; it is possible that his beliefsconcerning the Jewish origins of the Native Americans helped fuel his position.Another prominent American who subscribed to the Native American theory wasMordechai Noah (1785–1851). Noah, a Jewish-American and a Freemason, who wasnamed US consul to Tunis at the time of the Barbary Coast piracy episode, wrotea forty-page pamphlet detailing the evidence for the Jewish origins of theNative American tribes. His Discourse on the Evidences of the American Indiansbeing the Descendants of the Lost Tribes of Israel was published in 1837, sevenyears after the first publication of the Book of Mormon in 1830, which indicateshow strong this belief had survived the nearly two hundred years since thepublication of Rabbi ben Israel's book in London. It further illustrates thepopularity of this idea at the time Joseph Smith “translated” his epic work intoEnglish, which gave the Native American theory the force of scripture. MordechaiNoah was a well-known journalist and politician at the time Joseph Smith wasinvolved in treasure-digging in western New York and, indeed, at least one ofNoah's articles on the Jewish origin of the Native Americans was published inSmith's local newspaper, the Wayne Sentinel, on October 11, 1825 and thus rightin the middle of the Moroni conjurations (1823–1827) and five years before theBook of Mormon was published.According to the Book of Mormon, one of the lost tribes—that of Joseph, throughthe tribe of Manasseh—made it to North America six centuries before the birth ofJesus. This is a critical issue in the entire Mormon worldview. A corollary tothis is the revelation that Jesus himself appeared in North America after hisresurrection (3 Nephi 11—36).The tale begins with the story of Lehi, a member of the lost tribe of Joseph,who flees Jerusalem before its sack by the Babylonians in the sixth century BCE.He and his family travel by ship to America. From that time until about 130 BCE,the story is largely about Lehi and his descendants. By 130 BCE, however, thedescendants of Lehi split into two opposing forces, the Nephites and theLamanites.However, the descendants of Lehi were not the first inhabitants of the Americancontinent. According to the Mormon Book of Ether, a group called the Jarediteshad come to the western hemisphere around the time of the Tower of Babel, almosttwo thousand years before the arrival of the Lehi family.Recent archaeological and biological/genetic research and testing has shown thatthere is no scientific evidence for a Near Eastern or Middle Eastern origin ofthe Native American population. The emphasis is still on an Asian—andspecifically Mongolian or Siberian—origin. In light of this, the newestIntroduction to the Book of Mormon tends to qualify its position concerning theNative Americans and Jewish ancestry. However, this might be missing the point.While scientific breakthroughs in DNA testing—and corresponding archaeologicalbreakthroughs in the dating of America's earliest humans—mitigate against Mormonclaims of Jewish ancestry for the Native Americans, there is another option toconsider.Prompted by anomalous discoveries in ancient Native American mounds, severalresearchers began to come up with linguistic and other evidence to show that theNorth American continent (at least) had been visited by groups from across theAtlantic Ocean long before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492. BarryFell, a marine biologist at Harvard University, published several books thatpurported to show that North America had been visited by members ofcivilizations from Europe and North Africa. He based this theory on histranslations of petroglyphs (inscriptions carved into rocks) found all over thecontinent. While Fell's theories have been dismissed by mainstream academics onthe basis of what they claim is faulty methodology, recently there has beengrudging acknowledgement5 [part0007.html#ft5] that Fell did, indeed, discoverancient Celtic ogham runes on North American rocks. This indicates that thepetroglyphs may be as old as the first century BCE or as late as the fifth orsixth century CE (the widest possible range being allowed, as the precise datingof ogham is fraught with controversy). Ogham was used as a script by the ancientCelts, so to find it carved into rocks in North America is suggestive indeed ofancient travelers predating Columbus by at least one thousand years.Other ancient carvings found in North America have less to do with the Celts andmore to do with a possible Middle Eastern origin.Let us consider the Bat Creek stone which was discovered in a burial mound ineastern Tennessee in 1889. It bore carvings that were eventually identified in1971 (almost one hundred years after its discovery and therefore not the productof fraud) as ancient Hebrew. In fact, it was a type of Hebrew used in the firstcentury CE and is believed to translate as “For Judea”. In 1988, the site wascarbon-dated to a range of years from 32 CE-769 CE. That means that the latestthe stone could have been carved is more than seven hundred years beforeColumbus. While the stone is the subject of serious academic controversy, thereseems to be no doubt at this time that the stone was carved in first centuryHebrew and that the site is as old as it has been claimed. There is simply noexplanation for its presence buried in Tennessee soil in 1889.In New Mexico, we discover the Los Lunas stone. This stone boulder (claimed tohave been first discovered in the 1880s by a local farm boy) was covered inHebrew writing as well, but in a form of Hebrew—sometimes calledPaleo-Hebrew—that was used during the time of the first Temple. In other words,it would have been inscribed around the time Joseph Smith's Book of Mormonclaimed that Lehi had fled Israel. Indeed, this inscription was not translateduntil 1949 when it was interpreted to be an abbreviated form of the TenCommandments. Naturally, this provenance is not accepted by most scholars, whofeel that the lack of any other evidence of Jewish habitation at the siterenders the discovery suspicious at best.It is not my intention to get involved in a serious discussion of epigraphy,petroglyphs, or the fact or fiction of early Jewish settlements to the NewWorld. What is important to realize is the impact that these theories had onsociety in general at the time Joseph Smith was alive and before he wrote theBook of Mormon. We know for instance that George Washington was interested inthe burial mounds and that Thomas Jefferson began his own a scientificexcavation of a mound in 1781. Jefferson's Secretary of the Treasury, AlbertGallatin, was certain of the value to history of the mounds. Even President ofthe United States William Henry Harrison would publish his own study of themounds in 1838 with his Discourse on the Aborigines of the Valley of the Ohio.Thus, it may be relevant to suggest that Joseph Smith's “Lost Tribes” were notthe progenitors of the Native American population as Smith's view insists, butthat they could have conceivably lived side by side with the local populationsuntil they died out on their own. That there is evidence of a Jewish presence inNorth America prior to the Columbus arrival is, if not proven to everyone'ssatisfaction, still a serious historical possibility and cannot be dismissed.These two themes—burial mounds and ancient Jews in America—are central to theMormon thesis. Without them, there would be no Book of Mormon at all. And, as wehave seen, these two themes are intimately related for the discovery of Jewishinscriptions in burial mounds suggests that the Joseph Smith story had itsorigins in popular ideas concerning the very nature of America itself, ideasthat were in heavy circulation in the early nineteenth century and had little todo with lofty ideas about democracy and the Rights of Man.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------5 [part0007.html#fn5] Most notably by Canadian archaeologist David H. Kelley inan important 1990 article about Fell, published in the Review of Archaeology."},{"pageContent":"IDEOLOGIES"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTHE BOOK OF MORMONYea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of thelearning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians. And I know that therecord which I make is true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make itaccording to my knowledge.—Nephi 1:2–3JOSEPH SMITH HIMSELF STATES that his vision of September 21, 1823 included thereference to the burial spot of a text “…written upon gold plates, giving anaccount of the former inhabitants of this continent…and that the fulness of theeverlasting Gospel was contained in it…”.We can see that Smith was careful to say that the account was of the formerinhabitants of the North American continent, not the current ones (i.e., theNative Americans). It would have been an interesting curiosity had the textremained merely an imaginative version of who may have lived in America beforethe Native Americans arrived. However, it was the next line that catapulted whatwould become the Book of Mormon into eternal controversy, for “the fulness ofthe everlasting Gospel” became an essential component of this story of burialmounds and the Jewish tribes cavorting and praying and murdering among them.Somehow, Smith had connected current popular ideas about the mounds and aboutthe Lost Tribes to a new Gospel and thus to a new religion.What, then, is the Book of Mormon? How did it come to be?When Joseph Smith was finally allowed to take the golden plates on September 22,1827 after four years of trying, he had an artifact that was written in strangehieroglyphics as well as a pair of magic spectacles that would allow him to readthe hieroglyphics and interpret them. The nature of the spectacles is also, aswith everything Mormon, controversial.Some say that they were an actual pair of glasses made of different coloredlenses. Others that they were not spectacles at all, but a pair of stones—theUrim and Thummim—with which Smith performed the translation. Others that thestone or stones were placed into Smith's hat—just like the shew stones he wasused to using—and that he saw the translations in the crystal vision.Whatever version is correct, the ultimate take-away from this is that Smith didnot actually write down the translation of the Book of Mormon himself. Hedictated it to a string of scribes.The first such scribe was a local Palmyra farmer named Martin Harris. MartinHarris was not only well-to-do, he was also well-disposed towards Smith. Assomeone who changed his religion constantly, Harris saw in Smith a spiritualprodigy. He would later be one of the all-important Three Witnesses whotestified that they had seen the gold plates of the Book of Mormon with theirown eyes. (However, Harris would later recant his testimony.)From roughly December of 1827 to June of 1828, Harris took down 116 pages oftext. At one point, Smith had copied some of the mysterious hieroglyphics inwhich the golden plates were written, and Harris took this paper with him to NewYork in order to verify the authenticity of the Book of Mormon. He visited aprofessor of classical linguistics at Columbia College (later to become ColumbiaUniversity)—one Charles Anthon—who, Harris claimed, acknowledged theauthenticity of the hieroglyphics and the translation given by Smith. Thisaccount of the meeting was disputed, including by Anthon himself, who declaredin subsequent interviews that he believed the document to be a hoax and MartinHarris to be either deluded or insane. A copy of this piece of paper bearing the“Reformed Egyptian” hieroglyphics was among the forgeries sold as genuine byMark Hofmann to the LDS Church in 1980.Satisfied that the Book of Mormon was genuine and that Smith was not deceivinghim, Harris continued work as a scribe for the Prophet. After having copied downSmith's dictation in the amount of 116 pages, Harris begged to be allowed toshow the manuscript to his wife and neighbors. Smith reluctantly agreed. Themanuscript was then promptly stolen by either Harris's wife—who disapprovedstrongly of Smith and probably of her somewhat erratic husband in general—orsome friends of his wife, and was never seen again. Its current condition andwhereabouts are unknown.images [../images/00003.gif]The “Reformed Egyptian” Anthon Transcript as made available through theCommunity of Christ Church, said to be the original seen by Anthon and possessedby one of the Three Witnesses, David Whitmer.images [../images/00004.jpeg]There is controversy over this identification as well. Anthon said that thefigures had been drawn in columns and that there had been the drawing of a crudeAztec calendar on the paper he saw. The Hofmann forgery solved this problem.After this debacle, the Angel Moroni became understandably upset with hisprophet and took the plates and their accompanying “interpreters” (i.e., thespectacles or stones) away and did not give them back to Smith until September22, 1828. (Notice the recurrence of the September 22 date in this story.)Smith then fled from his upstate New York home to the town of Harmony,Pennsylvania in order to work on the translation, citing bizarre circumstancesthat were conspiring to keep him from working with the text. We do not knowexactly what these circumstances were, but they were evidently caused by evilsupernatural agencies that did not want the Book of Mormon to be translated.Not much was accomplished in the translation process until the arrival of OliverCowdery at the Harmony farm in April of 1829. At that point, work began apaceand by June 1, 1829 most of the Book of Mormon had been translated, with thebalance completed by July 1, 1829. Printing of the book—financed by MartinHarris, who basically mortgaged his farm to do it—began in August of that yearand was not completed until March 1830.Part of the reason for the long leadtime between August 1829 and March 1830 layin the extreme measures that were taken to protect the manuscript. It had to bebrought by hand to the printing office—accompanied by guards—and then returnedto Smith every evening. After the loss of the first 116 pages in Palmyra in1828, Smith was taking no chances.The rumors had begun to fly even before the book was printed, however. Thestories were all about how Smith found a “golden bible” buried in the earth, andof course everyone wanted to know what was in it. Many thought Smith was just aconman and a crook. As the episode was revealed that Harris had copied 116 pagesthat then disappeared, causing Smith to begin—not with the text of those missingpages but—at a different place in the encrypted text thus ignoring the pagesalready translated, it seemed that the fix was in. Smith could not start at thebeginning with the missing pages since he would never have been able to rememberwhat he had dictated. He had to start somewhere else, otherwise the hoax—if itwas a hoax—would have been revealed when and if the missing pages ever werediscovered.OUTLINE OF THE BOOK OF MORMONThe Book of Mormon is actually one of many “books” that comprise the entiremanuscript, but the aggregate is referred to as the Book of Mormon since it wascompiled by the prophet Mormon.Briefly, the breakdown is as follows:The first six books comprise the “Small Plates of Nephi.” Nephi was the son ofLehi, the first of the Jews who came to America at the time of the destructionof the first Temple. That means that the Book of Mormon begins at roughly 600BCE. These six books are named as follows, with dates corresponding to theevents related as per the official LDS chronology:1 Nephi2 NephiJacobEnosJaromOmni circa 600 BCE588–545 BCE544–421 BCE420 BCE399–366 BCE323–130 BCEThis section is followed by the short Words of Mormon, dated to about 385 CEwhen the prophet and warrior Mormon gives his son, Moroni, the plates on whichare recorded the entire Book of Mormon save the last two sections which arewritten or translated by Moroni himself.Thus, Mormon's abridgement and commentary on the Large Plates of Nephi run fromMosiah to chapter seven [part0013.html] of Mormon. As follows:MosiahAlmaHelaman3 Nephi4 NephiMormonEther Moroni 130–91 BCE91–52 BCE52–1 BCE1 CE–35 CE35–321 CE321–421 CE(concerns the Jaredites, who were in America two thousand years before Lehi andhis family arrived)401–421 CEMormon's abridgement of the Large Plates ends, as mentioned, with chapter seven[part0013.html] of Mormon. From chapter eight [part0014.html] to the end ofMormon is the work of Moroni who also added the sections entitled Ether andMoroni.In 421 CE, according to the chronology offered by the LDS Church, Moroni—thelast of the Nephite prophets—sealed the record and buried it, to be discoveredlater by the foretold Joseph Smith.A few important events can be discovered through close reading of the entireBook of Mormon. As early as 1 Nephi chapter 13 we read that America is seen in avision. By chapter 18, Lehi and his family of Jewish refugees—including his sonNephi and his brothers and sisters—arrive in America. This would be around 591to 589 BCE. Thus, from the very beginning, the Book of Mormon is an Americanscripture with an American focus. As the language in several other sectionsreveals, America is considered equivalent to the Promised Land.In 2 Nephi chapter 4 [part0009.html], Lehi dies. This takes place about 588–570BCE according to the LDS chronology. After this event, the Nephites and theLamanites (a tribe descended from the brothers of Nephi, “cursed” by dark skinwhereas the Nephites are white) separate from each other, forming two distincttribes. They never really get along after that. In fact, the Lamanites willeventually destroy the Nephites entirely at a battle that will take place at theHill Cumorah.In Jacob, chapter 10 [part0017.html], God tells the Nephites that no king willrule in America, that it will be a land of freedom. In verse 19 of chapter 10[part0017.html], God says “I will consecrate this land unto thy seed, forever,for the land of their inheritance.” Compare this to the promise God gave to theoriginal Jacob in Genesis 28:13: “There above it stood the Lord, and he said, Iam the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will giveyou and your descendants the land on which you are lying.” This reiterated theoriginal promise of God to Abraham himself in Genesis 15:18–21.Clearly, then, America was seen as a Promised Land in the Book of Mormon.But…promised to whom? If we take the first few books literally: a Lost Tribe ofJews descended from the Tribe of Joseph. That would seem to be unusuallyexclusionary, even for Mormons. But there was a safety clause: since theNephites would eventually accept Jesus as their Lord, then the Gentiles who didlikewise were also accepted into the New World's version of the Promised Land.This is not so strange as it first appears, for in the nineteenth century therewas a movement to offer land in America to the Jews as a sanctuary. In general,America was considered already a sanctuary; but in 1825 and thus around the timethat Joseph Smith was conjuring angels in upstate New York the Jewish diplomatand journalist Mordechai Noah was attempting to establish a Jewish refuge onGrand Island in the Niagara River, in Erie County, New York, to be called Ararat(after the mountain where Noah's ark rested after the Flood).Since this event—which flopped miserably—was very much in the news in 1825 andthus two years before Smith actually obtained the golden plates, it is possiblethat this story made it into the Smith scripture or at least influenced theentire project. And in actuality the date for the establishment of Ararat was inSeptember: the same month in which Smith would meet the Angel Moroni every year.Noah was also a believer at one time in the Jewish origin of the NativeAmericans, something of which the young Smith would have been aware. In fact,there are so many connections between Mordechai Noah's career and beliefs andthose of the Mormons that it is difficult to separate them, or to account forthese similarities as mere coincidences.In the book of Mosiah, we come across mention of the seer stones. In chapter 28,Mosiah uses the two seer stones the same way Smith would use them: to translateplates on which were written—in this case—the Jaredite story.Smith himself describes his seer stones as the Urim and Thummim, a clearreference to the Biblical device that was used for divination by the high priestof the Jews before the destruction of the First Temple. Scholars are divided asto the physical nature of the Urim and Thummim, and even what the Hebrew wordsmean. While it seems certain from the way they are portrayed (for instance, in 1Samuel 14:41) that they were used for divination similar to the way we wouldflip a coin today, there was never any indication that they could be used to“translate” a document. They seem to have been used for purely binary “yes” or“no” type questions. In Smith's case, however, they were referred to as“interpreters” and “seer stones” and even as “spectacles,” which gives some ideaas to how they would have been used by him. If we remember our crystal ballallegory, we can imagine that Smith would gaze either into or through the twoseer stones and thereby “read” the decrypted text, dictating the results toMartin Harris or Oliver Cowdery. It is only in the Book of Mormon that we havethe strange juxtaposition of a set of golden plates and a pair of magicspectacles to read them, a construct that appears in Mosiah and then again inSmith's own life.Shortly after Mosiah uses the two seer stones, however, war breaks out betweenthe Nephites and the Lamanites, as detailed in the book of Alma. This conflictcontinues for some time, the only respite being in 3 Nephi when—in chapter11—Christ appears in North America.This is said to occur shortly after the resurrection, and the events of the bookof 3 Nephi are dated by the LDS Church as having taken place from 1 to 35 CE. Ifwe accept the traditional date of Christ's crucifixion as 33 CE then he appearedto the Nephites less than 2 years after his death.The Book of Mormon contains many references to Jesus long before his appearancein America. His birth is predicted, as well as his death at the hands of hisenemies. Jesus occupies a central role in Mormon theology, even though he maynot be the Jesus that a Christian would immediately recognize. In 3 Nephi, Jesusinforms his followers that Israel will build a New Jerusalem in America, andthat the Lost Tribes would be gathered up there. In America, not in Israel.This is a key factor in contemporary Mormon thinking, and is what lies behindthe famous Mormon genealogical obsession. To the Mormons, the Native Americanpopulation of today is largely descended from the Lamanites. If the Lamanitesare descendants of the Tribe of Joseph (the Biblical tribes of Manasseh andEphraim), then in order for all of the Lost Tribes to come together, the NativeAmericans must be incorporated into the gathering. But what of the other tribes?Mormons hope that by genealogical research—and now especially genetic testing aswell—they would be able to identify members of the other Lost Tribes. Thegenealogical research—known in Mormon parlance as “temple work”—first beginswith individual Mormons who trace their ancestry back as far as possible. Theywant to be able to convert their ancestors to Mormonism since they presumablynever had a chance to do so while they lived. This “baptism of the dead” as itis sometimes called is one result of the research.Another result is the drive to determine whether or not any of the NativeAmerican population could be descended from the Lamanites or the Jewish peoplegenerally. With the advent of DNA analysis, the general consensus amongscientists is that today's Native Americans are descended from Asian peoplesoriginating around the Altai mountain range where Mongolia and China meet Russiaand Kazakhstan, the nearest Chinese city being Urumqi. No markers were foundindicating Jewish or Middle Eastern origins in Native American DNA, so thisshould have put the controversy to rest. However, it did not.Mormon geneticists and apologists put forward many arguments for this lack ofevidentiary proof of Lamanite origins for the American Indians. In some cases itwas suggested that the gene pool had been diluted over the centuries, anexplanation that is unscientific considering the persistence of DNA markers overhundreds of thousands of years. Other explanations given include the theory thatthe Lamanites were only a small community in North America and that the NativeAmericans came later and overwhelmed the tiny population, or that the Lamanitesincluded the Native Americans in their population through conversion orconquest; but that did not match the accounts given in the Book of Mormon forthe existence of millions of Jews on the continent as late as the fifth centuryCE. It also does not match the official LDS Introduction to the Book of Mormonthat still insists that the Native Americans are descendants of the Lamanites.There is also the conceit that the Lamanites were “cursed” with dark skin (2Nephi 5:21: “…the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them. Andthus saith the Lord God; I will cause that they shall be loathsome unto thypeople…”). As the enemy of the more pious (and considerably whiter) Nephites,the implication is clear: black skin equals evil. Thus it was not until 1978that African Americans were permitted to become Mormon priests and to becomeinvolved in the temple ceremonies, although there were Black members of the LDSChurch as early as Smith's own lifetime and Smith himself was known to supportthe abolitionist movement when he was running as a candidate for president. Butrace is obviously a genetic factor, and thus the Mormon approach to geneaologybecomes a complicated brew of race, ethnicity, spiritual approval, ancientorigins, Lost Tribes, politics, and the baptism of the dead. As one can see, inMormonism we have many of the features of the modern New Age and alternative orspeculative history phenomenon.And in fact it becomes a little more “New-Agey” by the time we get to 3 Nephi28. When Jesus came to America he appointed Twelve Disciples. Of the Twelve,three became immortal. These three Nephites—according to the Book of Mormon—liveamong us today and are the topic of much Mormon folklore. We may find echoes ofthis idea in the figures of such Biblical personalities as Enoch and Elijah—whobecame immortal and who, in the case of Elijah, may still walk among us—or thefabled Nine Unknown Men of Talbot Mundy's novel (1923). This also findsreverberations in Theosophy's Great White Brotherhood and Madame Blavatsky'sMahatmas: advanced beings or “ascended masters” who walk among us unrecognized.Those three Nephites were the lucky ones. By chapter 6 [part0011.html] of thebook entitled Mormon, there was a big battle at the site of Hill Cumorah. Bychapter 8 [part0014.html], the Lamanites had destroyed the Nephites, and Mormonhimself was dead. This took place in the fifth century CE. Thus, in 421 CE,Moroni—who had written chapter 8 [part0014.html] and the remaining sections ofthe Book of Mormon—was entrusted with hiding the golden plates that were therecord of the Nephites and their centuries-long struggle in North America. Theywould not be seen again for 1400 years.The themes that will occupy Mormon thought for the next 180 years are foundeverywhere in the Book of Mormon. The origins of the Native Americans. Americaas the Promised Land. The gathering of the Lost Tribes. Seer stones and goldenplates. Racial struggles. And all within a Christian framework.Critics point out that the language—and some of the text—of the Book of Mormonis lifted from the King James Version of the Bible, a book with which JosephSmith was certainly familiar. The rest of the Book of Mormon is moreproblematic, of course. With its basic theme of America as the site of the NewJerusalem and the appearance of Jesus among Jewish tribes in America in thefirst century, CE we have what can be considered a rather brilliant amalgamationand expansion of the ideas and speculations that fueled the imaginations ofAmericans at that time. Add to that the fact that the golden plates werediscovered via acts of ceremonial magic and conjuration, with special attentionpaid to the astrological calendar, and translated with the equivalent of acrystal ball, and you have not a scripture, perhaps, but a compelling fantasynovel.Thus the Book of Mormon is very much a product of its time and place and is notas anomalous as many Mormons would believe. But does that make it a hoax?For purposes of comparison, how did Moses get the Law transcribed onto thosestone tablets?Twice?Mormonism may give us the key to understanding religion in a different way.Atheists have always complained that religion itself is a hoax, a collection offairy tales for the intellectually-challenged. Marxists generally agree:religion is the opiate of the people, a technique to keep the masses distractedfrom their exploitation by the rich who mouth religious platitudes they don'tbelieve in order to keep control over those who do.To an extent, both of these points of view are correct. Religion has been usedto manipulate and control the credulous. It's part of the arsenal ofpsychological warfare. Appeals to an invisible but higher power will always workon large segments of the population that seek an easy answer to life'suncertainties and a strong leader who talks directly to God. The magicians andalchemists of the world—people like Joseph Smith, in fact—take it uponthemselves to by-pass organized religion (to eliminate the middle-man, so tospeak) in order to gain direct experience of the divine. Sometimes they arelucky, and get a nod in their direction by some weird, inexplicable event ordramatic change of circumstances. Sometimes they are not so lucky and, like thespirit medium who has to fake every séance even though the first one was real,they find themselves forced to ever grander claims of spiritual contact in orderto validate the first one.It is too easy to call Joseph Smith a swindler and a fraud. He may have been allof those things, but something happened to the uneducated, barely-literatebarefoot farmboy from Sharon, Vermont in the autumn of 1823. Something dramatic,something that actually did change the world (or a part of it). Maybe not forthe better, maybe not for the worse, but change it it did.Compared to Moses, Smith was a superstar. Moses had the education and thetraining—among the priests and magicians of ancient Egypt—to create a religionout of the odds and ends of the Egyptian, Babylonian and other pagan elementsthat were common in his day, and was helped along the way by various scribes whocobbled together what became the Torah over a period of centuries. Smith had nosuch advantages. His “Torah” flew fully-formed out of his mouth. Complete. Inone go.The stories of the angels, and the seer stones, and the golden plates just mighthave been a kind of gypsy fortune-teller window-dressing to dazzle the rubes.The golden plates are gone, you say? So are the Tablets of the Law. So is theArk of the Covenant. What's your point?Is the strength of Judaism and the entire Judaeo-Christian-Islamic traditionbased on the stories of miracles and madmen, or is it to be found in thespiritual and moral teachings of their respective scriptures? From the vision ofone human being alone in a desert, or a cave, or a forest in upstate New York,we have the Torah, the Qur'an, the Book of Mormon.So maybe the Indians are not descended from a weird Jewish tribe called theLamanites. Maybe Jesus didn't visit America after he rose from the dead inPalestine. I submit that the author of the Book of Mormon just might have beenone of America's greatest storytellers, a novelist along the line of a Melville,minus the humor.And then everything got out of hand."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVEPIETY’S RAINBOW: THE FATAL TRAJECTORY OF JOSEPH SMITH, PROPHETThe “Book of Mormon” has been placed in our hands. A viler imposition was neverpractised. It is an evidence of fraud, blasphemy and credulity, shocking to theChristian and moralist. The “author and proprietor” is one “Joseph Smith, jr.”—afellow who, by some hocus pocus, acquired such an influence over a farmer ofWayne county, that the latter mortgaged his farm for $3,000, which he paid forprinting and binding 5000 copies of this blasphemous work.—The Geneva Gazette, April 28, 1830THE BOOK OF MORMON WAS PUBLISHED in March of 1830, when Smith was not yet 25years old. Martin Harris had paid for its publication through the mortgaging ofhis farm in Palmyra, New York.It was not a best-seller.It is interesting to conjecture at this remove whether or not Smith initiallyintended the book to be a new scripture when he was first dictating its pages.After all, there were many predecessors to the Book of Mormon when it came tousing Biblical sources as inspiration for the view that America was the PromisedLand and the Native Americans were Jewish descendants, as we shall see. One ofthe most prominent of these was first published in 1823 and then again in 1825:just when Smith was in the midst of his occult activity on Hill Cumorah and atthe same time that Mordechai Noah was writing on the same theme. This was Viewof the Hebrews or The Tribes of Israel in America, by Ethan Smith (no relationto Joseph Smith). As one can see from the title alone, virtually all of Smith'smajor historical themes are covered by Ethan Smith's book, published seven yearsbefore the Book of Mormon.But Ethan Smith's book was not a scripture. It was written in the style ofEnglish common at the time and made no pretenses toward a “King James”vernacular, which is how most of the Book of Mormon is written. One of thestandard complaints against the Book of Mormon is precisely that its style ofEnglish is virtually identical to that of the King James Bible. Why would JosephSmith, who was translating the golden plates directly from “Reformed Egyptian”into English, not use the style of English common at the time, the style heactually spoke? It is as if it had to be translated first into contemporarynineteenth century American English and then from there back into seventeenthcentury King James English: a double translation. The only reason for thisbizarre decision had to be that he wanted the Book of Mormon to resemble themost famous scripture of his time and place. In order for it to be accepted as ascripture, it had to sound like the only scripture anyone knew.Critics condemned the book with dozens of similar observations and mostly withridicule, and the attacks began even before the book was published. As early asJune of 1829, a local area newspaper printed the title page, which itselfaroused hostility: The Book of Mormon: an account written by the hand of Mormon,upon plates taken from the Plates of Nephi. Smith had taken the title page tothe federal district court in order to secure his copyright, and at the sametime tried to interest local publishers in printing the book. One of these, E.B.Grandin, printed the title page in his Wayne Sentinel as a “curiosity.” Theimmediate response of the public seemed to be that the book was a combination of“imposition” and “superstition.”It would cost $3000 to print and bind 5000 copies of the book in 1830. Smith didnot have the money, and prevailed upon his friend Martin Harris to use his houseas collateral to raise at least half of the cash. In the end, because Smith wasunsuccessful in finding anyone else who would underwrite the publication, Harriswould wind up fronting the entire amount and losing his home as a result.Although Harris never complained about this to the press, the press neverthelessconsidered him a dupe of Smith. But this was not the end of the controversy.Newspapers all over the area began reporting the existence of the “Golden Bible”long before and long after its publication. It was generally treated as a newsitem of some curiosity at best, or as a scandal at worst. Even such a notablejournalist as Mordechai Noah himself would get involved in the furor, on theanti-Mormon side. It is possible that Noah's involvement disturbed Smith, sinceNoah would have seemed to him to be a logical ally.One can immediately ascertain the positive or negative view of Smith taken bycorrespondents by the way they printed his name. If the view was neutral orfavorable, he was called “Joseph Smith” or “Joseph Smith, jr.”. If the reportwas unfavorable, he was invariably called “Jo” or “Joe” Smith. The use of thediminutive form of Joseph implied a devaluing of the overall message. How couldanyone take seriously a self-appointed prophet with the name “Joe Smith”?And prophet he was, at least to his small circle of followers. He began toordain priests in his new religion in 1829, even before the Book of Mormon waspublished. This was coming at a time when a proliferation of new religions wasin the news everywhere in the northern part of the United States. Strange sectswith charismatic leaders were popping up in Vermont, northern New York, andelsewhere making it difficult for another group to distinguish itself asdifferent from all the rest.For instance, as early as 1796 the “Prince and Prophet” Richard Brothers, ofCanada, had published “A Revealed Knowledge of the Prophecies and Times. Bookthe First. Written under the Direction of the LORD GOD” which concerned, amongother things, “the restoration of the Hebrews to Jerusalem by the Year 1798,”advertised in the Albany Register of June 10, 1796. When the restoration did nottake place, the wind rather went out of Brothers’ sails.About twenty years later, on October 13, 1817, the Albany Daily Advertiser wouldreport the existence of the Vermont Pilgrims. Led by Isaac Bullard, thisperipatetic group originated in Canada and wound its way through Vermont to NewYork and from there, to Pennsylvania and parts west and south as the Prophet'scaravan split into two groups. Bullard bragged that he had not changed hisclothes in seven years. He claimed to be the incarnation of the Biblical prophetElijah, and had abolished marriage among his converts, forced his devotees topray prostrate on the ground, and had the men eat standing up, sipping theirrepast through a tube that was inserted into a common bowl of gruel…all thisamong other oddities, including the belief that Bullard's infant son was Jesus.These stories were picked up by the Wayne Sentinel, the newspaper in JosephSmith's town of Palmyra, on May 26, 1826 with the caution:This fete of folly and delusion, is perhaps worthy of notice, as furnishing astriking instance of the blindness of credulity—the wilderness of fanaticism,and the miserable propensity of the mind, to believe itself possessed of powerswhich do not belong to humanity.Later, other authors would link Bullard's group with the Mormons by suggestingthat their “fanaticism” and blind allegiance to their “prophet” made themspiritual siblings. This may have been a rather unfair comparison, as IsaacBullard did not leave behind a new scripture or anything resembling anintellectual accomplishment in the field of exegesis or revelation. Without theBook of Mormon, Joseph Smith may indeed have been just another spiritualimpostor or prophet-wannabe, another Prophet Isaac on the road to Ohio; but itwas on the strength of that scripture and the method in which it wasreceived—golden plates, shew stones, “reformed Egyptian” and all—that Smith wasable to connect so many diverse strains of popular religion and alternativehistory together. All he needed now was some sort of organization to promotethese ideas and help sell the book, which was languishing on the shelves,ridiculed by the mainstream media.Among his earliest converts, of course, were the scribes who painstakingly tookdown Smith's dictation, line by tortured line. Oliver Cowdery was one of thefirst of the Elect. He and Smith had a revelation in May of 1829 that theyshould be baptized and ordained into the “Aaronic priesthood”. So Smith andCowdery baptized each other and proclaimed their sacerdotal status. By April ofthe following year, their nascent “Church of Christ” (as it was known then) hadabout a half-dozen elders and around seventy members. (Fourteen years later, bythe time of his assassination, Smith's church had 20,000 followers.)In June of 1831, Martin Harris became ordained as a High Priest while at theChurch's new headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio. It was perhaps the least Smithcould do for the man who singlehandedly financed the Book of Mormon and who losthis farm and his wife in the process.The move to Kirtland, Ohio was the beginning of the real launch of Mormonism.Prior to that time Smith found himself facing a great degree of hostility andridicule in New York. A prophet, after all, is without honor in his own country.He might have quoted the New Testament response to Jesus: “Can any good thingcome out of Nazareth?” (John 1:46) Or, we might ask, out of Palmyra, New York?The move to Kirtland was prompted by a revelation that Smith had concerningestablishing Zion—the New Jerusalem—in the territory of Missouri. As it was forBullard before him, the lure of the west as the Promised Land was irresistibleto Smith. It was also probably motivated by a desire to isolate his followersfrom general society, as the small northeastern towns where Smith grew up andbegan preaching his new dispensation were filled with people who either knew himor his family, either directly or by reputation. By isolating his flock he wouldbe able to control them more easily, as well as control the way his message wasreceived and interpreted. Not to put too fine a point on it, this isolation canbe seen as the motivating factor behind the move of Rev. Jim Jones of thePeoples Temple sect to the jungles of Guyana. Prophets flourish in physicaldistance from the people who actually knew them before the revelation wasreceived.The growing opposition to Smith and his teachings was another factor. As OliverCowdery began baptizing people into the new Church, the danger of mob violencehad begun to increase. Those who remembered Smith's treasure-hunting past wereconvinced that he was not only a blasphemer but a crook and a confidence man aswell. He was arrested as a “disorderly person” but managed to beat the chargesand escape the New York area with Cowdery before violence had a chance toescalate.At the same time, Smith was having trouble with his own Elect. It seems thateveryone felt they had a right to use seer stones to divine their owndestinies—and that of the new Church—and this meant that Smith's authority wouldbegin to erode. One of his first Witnesses, Hiram Page, claimed that he receiveddivine revelation (through the seer stone) as to the location of the NewJerusalem. Smith quickly reasserted his own position as Prophet and leader ofthe Church, and claimed a revelation that he was the only true Prophet and thatonly revelations that came through him were of genuine divine inspiration.Thus, things were threatening to get out of hand. First, the communities ofnorthwest New York where Smith had grown up and performed his occult experimentswith seer stones and magic books were in such opposition to him that violencewas possible. He had even been briefly arrested for these activities.Furthermore, his Book of Mormon was not selling. Second, his own people wereattempting to exert their own spiritual authority over the Church and theScripture he had created. Third, others who might have been expected to besympathetic with Smith's teachings—such as Mordechai Noah—were criticizing himheavily. With all of this opposition, both within and without his organization,he needed a bold move in order to control and direct the energies of hisfollowers and to keep them away from the influences of the press as well as fromthe courts.Whatever the actual reasoning behind the move, by January of 1831 the Smithgroup had arrived in Kirtland, Ohio—outside of Cleveland—and it was there onJune 3 of that year that the long-suffering Martin Harris was ordained a HighPriest in Smith's Church of Christ. Kirtland would prove to be the first realheadquarters of the Mormon denomination, and as such it is still revered to thisday by pious Mormons.And it would be in Kirtland that Joseph Smith got the idea to create his ownbank.Money-digging and treasure-seeking were never very far from Smith's mind. Thegenesis of Mormonism lay in Smith's early obsession with finding buriedtreasure. The obsession developed in a place and time that was rife with storiesabout alchemical transformations as well as an epidemic of counterfeiters. Asnoted previously there were two themes that ran through the alchemicalliterature: that of obtaining wealth through the transformation of metals(viewed as a natural process that only had to be hurried-along by the alchemist)and the perfectability of human beings, of which the transmutation of lead intogold was an analogue. It will be seen that Smith eventually abandoned thephysical transformation of metals in favor of the idea of human perfectibility.Before that happened, however, Smith had one more arrow in his mundanetreasure-seeking quiver. This involved a return to the Smith family ancestralhome in Salem, Massachusetts in 1836.This unusual event is recorded in several places, notably in the writings ofOliver Cowdery himself who was one of the participants along with Hyrum Smith(Joseph's brother) and Sidney Rigdon.Sidney Rigdon was the leader of a Christian group in Kirtland numbering aboutone hundred followers who joined the Mormons along with his entire congregation,thus doubling the size of the Church of Christ that year and becoming animportant member of what is called the First Presidency: the leadership group ofwhat would become the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In 1836 thisFirst Presidency numbered—aside from Smith and Rigdon—Oliver Cowdery and HyrumSmith. Thus, it can be said that the trip to Salem, Massachusetts involved theentire First Presidency of the Church in what appeared to have been a secretmission.A man called Jonathan Burgess—a Mormon—notified Smith that there was a treasureburied beneath a certain house in Salem. In the summer of 1836, the entire FirstPresidency of the Church went to Salem (a considerable distance from Kirtland,Ohio) in order to rent the house under which the treasure was said to be buried.Residency was impossible since the house was fully occupied; they rented roomsclose by and then began attempts to gain access to the house (either by rentingit or buying it) so they could obtain the buried treasure. Unfortunately, allattempts failed and they were forced to return to Kirtland without havingaccomplished their task.That this mission was occult in nature is demonstrated by Oliver Cowdery's diaryof the trip, in which he focused primarily on Salem as the scene of the famouswitchcraft trials. It was common knowledge among the Smiths that theirancestor—Samuel Smith—was one of those who accused Mary Easty of witchcraft in1692 and that his testimony had contributed to her sentence of death. For JosephSmith, this must have seemed like an odd homecoming. He had a pedigree in thattown, and was returning to the place where his ancestor had given evidenceagainst a witch only to appear—in secret, as it turned out—as a sorcererhimself.That Smith's old occupation of treasure-seeking using occult methods was themeans by which he figured to locate the exact spot in the house where thetreasure was buried is born out by a number of contemporaneous sources, and evenprominent members and historians of the LDS Church itself are forced to admitthat this was, indeed, the case although some have attempted to give thetreasure-seeking a different—more spiritual—spin.It was less than a year after his empty-handed return to Kirtland from Salemthat he came up with another get-rich-quick-scheme, although this one did notinvolve divining rods or seer stones but a fraud involving land, banking, andthe exploitation of the confidence of his investors. This was the KirtlandAnti-Bank Scandal, and the details are incredible.In 1836, upon the return to Kirtland by the church leadership, it was decided tocash in on the land speculation that was currently rampant in the area bycreating a bank. Smith was involved in building the Kirtland Temple, which heintended to be the headquarters of his new religion, and it was an expensiveaffair that was taxing the financial reserves of the Saints. Smith and hiscolleagues decided to go the legal route at first in order to set up the bank,and applied to the Ohio legislature for a charter. Several attempts to obtainthe charter were defeated in various ways. At the time, the Democratic Party wasin control of the Ohio congress and was considerably more fiscally conservativethan their Whig counterparts who were in general against banking regulation andin favor of what were then known as “quasi-banks”: financial institutions thatwere part of some other corporation or business and that functioned like banksbut which were not covered by a banking charter. As the Ohio congress held theline on issuing such charters in the period 1836–1837, there was no way forSmith to get full legal approval for his operation so he decided to go the“quasi-bank” route.At the same time, Oliver Cowdery had bank note plates engraved with the title“Kirtland Safety Society Bank.” When informed that they could not legally createa bank, he had the plates altered to read “Kirtland Safety Society Anti-BankingCo.”The early Church felt they had the law on their side. There were a number ofsuch “almost” banks in the country, and especially in the state of Ohio.Unfortunately, they also had the reputation of being “wildcat” banks:institutions that were totally un-regulated and answerable to no one. That meantthat other lending institutions were loath to deal with the quasi-banks.Obtaining credit would be a problem, as well as any type of money transfer thatwas based on paper and not on “hard currency.” And Smith needed as much hardcurrency as possible as he was deeply involved in the real estate speculationtaking place everywhere in the area.In order to convince his shareholders that the Kirtland Anti-Banking Company wassolvent and a good investment risk, Smith resorted to a ploy that is almost (butnot quite) comical in retrospect.He filled caskets with worthless junk iron and sand, and then covered them witha layer of shiny silver coins, presenting them as evidence that the bank had anenormous amount of silver on hand, which in fact it did not. The outcome waspredictable. The bank was insolvent after a year in operation and many peoplelost their savings when it went bankrupt. (The parallels to the 2008 bankingcrisis in the United States could not be more striking.)In fact, the Kirtland Anti-Bank was only one of many such institutions to failduring what would become the 1837 Banking Crisis, which resulted in five yearsof economic depression in the United States, triggered by President AndrewJackson's refusal to bail out the Second Bank of the United States withgovernment funds. The Second Bank had been chartered after the charter of theFirst Bank was not renewed in the aftermath of the War of 1812 and the militaryexpenditures, which nearly bankrupted the young nation, damaged the country'scredit standing. Andrew Jackson believed that the only true money was gold andsilver and refused to support a national bank, insisting that the states shouldcontrol their own banking systems. Opponents of Jackson—including the WhigParty, which was supported by wealthy industrialists and bankers—defended theidea of a national bank, of paper currency, and of looser regulations on theprivate banks. It is interesting to note that many prominent Whigs, includingAbraham Lincoln, eventually went on to establish the Republican Party after thecollapse of the Whigs in the mid-nineteenth century.Smith had a hard time recovering from the banking scandal. Many Mormons becamedisillusioned with Smith and the Church after the huge financial losses theyexperienced at the hands of their spiritual leaders. As we will see, it would bea pattern that would repeat itself with equally dire consequences in thetwentieth century when Salt Lake City (the Mormon capital of the State of Utah)was declared the “fraud capital” of the nation due to investment schemesinvolving many high-ranking Church officials resulting in the loss of more thantwo hundred million dollars in the period 1980–1983 alone.But as Smith was fighting off lawsuits and possible arrest over the failure ofthe Kirtland Anti-Banking scheme, he had other problems. Mormon settlers inMissouri were being forced out of the territory by the existing population whofeared a Mormon takeover of their land. These circumstances were made worse bySmith's revelation that Missouri would be the Promised Land and the New Zion.The situation escalated in 1838, just as the Kirtland Anti-Bank was failing andSmith began losing followers. It developed into what has become known as theMormon War.In January of that year Smith and his ally Sidney Rigdon fled Kirtland forMissouri. Arrest warrants were issued, and the possibility of mob violence wasalso very much in the air. An ad hoc militia had been formed to apprehend Smithand hold him for trial, and Smith had had prior experience with the law.In 1832, when Smith went to Independence, Missouri to regain control over thefledgling Mormon community there under the leadership of Oliver Cowdery, he wasmet with hostility. Cowdery felt that Smith had been ignoring him and the “NewZion” in favor of his relationship with Sidney Rigdon. In addition, localnon-Mormons were afraid that Smith would try to seize their land in the name ofhis Church. They also objected to what they felt was his abolitionist stance, aswell as Smith's overtures to the Native American population. Thus, Smith had twosources of conflict to resolve: from both within and without his organization.The trip ended badly.As an angry mob grew, both Smith and Rigdon were seized. They were beaten,tarred and feathered. They barely managed to escape Missouri with their lives.But they did not give up on New Zion.The Mormons who were left behind had to fend for themselves. They wereostracized by the earlier settlers, and came under increasing pressure to leave.Attempts by the Mormons to convert the Native Americans were stymied by thegovernment which did not recognize their legal authority to proselytize amongthe tribes; thus another potential source of moral support was denied them. Theyeventually came to an agreement with the local Missourians that they would notsettle in their area and peace was temporarily restored. Suddenly, however, therelationship between the Mormons and the settlers deteriorated to the point thatan all-out war began.Soon after that, Smith's bank had failed. Smith understood that Kirtland was nolonger a sanctuary for him or his faith. The temple he had been at great painsand expense to build in that city would have to be abandoned as the twodifferent camps of Mormonism—the Ohio and the Missouri wings—would begin tosever their relationship permanently.Instead, Smith decided to raise his own army and, basically, invade Missouri.As the split between the Mormon camps became serious, Smith moved his followerswest. The Kirtland temple became the headquarters of the anti-Smith group, andfor a time the town of Far West, Missouri was the headquarters of Smith and hisloyal followers. The original settlers who felt that the Mormons had violatedthe agreement they had reached back in 1833 considered this influx of newsettlers to the region as a serious threat.Alarmed by the thousands of new Mormon immigrants, and politically threatened bywhat could become a huge voting bloc in local elections, the Missourians beganto push back.To make matters worse, Smith found himself excommunicating his originaldisciples, including among them Oliver Cowdery himself. Cowdery did not welcomeSmith's sudden appearance in Missouri after all the work he had been at pains toaccomplish to keep the peace in that state and to develop his own power base. Bykicking his original disciples out of the Church, Smith had also takenpossession of their land which had been bought as Church property. It was avolatile situation and immediately became much worse.Sidney Rigdon—Smith's new golden boy—came to the defense of Smith and threatenedthe former Mormons such as Cowdery with physical violence if they did not leavethe territory. A secret society was formed, known as the Danites that would haveas their task the removal by force of the “dissenting” Mormons.6[part0010.html#ft6] Afraid of being murdered, the newly-excommunicated Mormonsfled to other parts of Missouri where they spread their story of Mormonpersecution. This had the effect of causing even more paranoia among theMissourians, and they began to arm themselves.On August 6, 1838, an election day, anti-Mormons gathered at the polling boothsto prevent Mormons from voting. A skirmish broke out between the two groups, andthe Missourians returned to their homes to get their weapons.Smith then led a militia of one hundred armed men to the home of a judge who wasrumored to have begun gathering his own gang to attack the Mormons. While thisevent did not turn violent, the die had been cast. Mormon militia groups and theDanite bands began a tug of war with the Missourians that would last all summerand into the fall and which resulted in the pitched Battle of Crooked River onOctober 25, 1838.In the previous few months, Mormons had attacked and burned Missourian towns andthe Missourians had reacted predictably and attacked Mormon settlements. ByOctober the situation had escalated and Mormon troops, including the Danites,faced a state militia under the command of Samuel Butler, who ordered his men tofire on the Mormon columns. The Mormons took heavy casualties but the statemilitia fled the battleground, leaving the upper hand to the Mormons.Reports of the battle—greatly exaggerated—reached the governor of Missouri andhe signed an executive order demanding the removal of the Mormons from the stateor, barring that, their extermination.Then on October 30, the Haun's Hill Massacre took place. A large band of morethan 200 vigilantes attacked a Mormon encampment in Caldwell County, Missouri.As the women and children fled for the safety of the woods, the Mormon men stoodtheir ground inside a blacksmith's shed and were surrounded by the vigilanteforce which murdered everyone inside, including a ten-year-old boy who waskilled so that he would not grow up to be a Mormon. A total of seventeen Mormonswere killed in the massacre.The state militia then marched on Smith's new headquarters in Far West, Missouriand demanded the surrender of the Church's leaders. Smith tried to negotiate apeace, but in the end he was arrested and sentenced to death. At the same time,the remaining Mormons at Far West decided to surrender their weapons to thestate militia. In response, the militia began destroying the farms and homes ofthe Mormons, even going so far as to slaughter their livestock and burn down anystructures they found. The leader of the militia—General Lucas—informed theMormons that he had orders to exterminate them all, and he would have done sohad they not surrendered. Lucas then went on to hold a court martial of Smithand the other leaders of the Mormon army, including Sidney Rigdon, and foundthem all guilty of treason. He gave the order to have them executed the nextmorning, but his order was disobeyed. Instead, the Mormons were bound over to acivil court for an inquiry on charges of treason, murder, arson, etc. and of thesixty men arrested only twelve—including Smith and Rigdon—were charged andimprisoned.In April of 1839, however, Smith and some of his co-defendants managed to escapecustody. The Mormons had already begun their retreat to Illinois, this timeunder the leadership of Brigham Young, where they would create a newheadquarters at Nauvoo, a city they had founded for the purpose. In themeantime, the State of Missouri seized all remaining Mormon land in order to payfor the militia action, warning the Mormons that should they venture back intothe State for the purpose of settling there every Mormon man, woman and childwould be killed.This was the state of play in 1839. Driven out of Kirtland, and then forced outof Missouri, Smith was eager to find a place to settle and build his newreligion. Sidney Rigdon, who had been such an important influence on Smith andthe direction the Church would take, was now losing his position as Smith'sright-hand man. This honor went to Brigham Young, whose ascendancy began asRigdon's declined. It would be Young who would bring the Mormons into what wouldbecome the State of Utah after Smith's death.But it would be Nauvoo that would see the changes that made Mormonism even morescandalous as Smith began receiving revelations there concerning the baptism ofthe dead and plural marriage, among others. It was also where Smith raised thelargest army in the State of Illinois, and from where he would begin his questfor the American presidency. The trajectory that began in the woods of upstateNew York and which reached a kind of zenith in Kirtland, Ohio was now plummetingdown to earth and an early grave.The Mormon War in Missouri would continue to haunt Smith for the rest of hisdays. Having escaped police custody after the 1838 inquiry, he was still awanted man in the state of Missouri and had to fight extradition. Incorporatingthe city of Nauvoo gave him certain legal benefits, including the ability tofend off extradition. Had he ever returned to Missouri, however, he would havebeen captured and jailed, and possibly given a harsh sentence if convicted ofthe counts of treason and murder that were hanging over him. The death penaltywas still an option, as was life in prison.The need for his own private army was probably based on his feelings ofvulnerability after the Missouri debacle. He also had disaffected Mormons tocontend with. Some of the men and women who had formed his earliest converts hadnow turned against him, including Oliver Cowdery who was one of the scribes andwho had claimed to have seen the golden plates with his own eyes. But that wasalmost ten years ago now, and as 1839 came to a close Smith had less than fiveyears to live.He wasted no time in coming up with newer and grander revelations. Nauvoo wasperhaps his most fertile period since the receiving of the golden plates andtheir ensuing translation. New doctrines came quickly. And so did new converts.In 1840, Smith proclaimed the doctrine of the baptism of the dead. In order tofully grasp the significance of this practice—which aroused a great deal ofcontroversy in 2012 as revelations were made concerning the Mormonbaptism-by-proxy of Anne Frank, of Nazi hunter and Holocaust survivor SimonWeisenthal's family, and of the still-alive but unwitting Elie Wiesel—one has tounderstand that the Mormon concept of the human soul and the afterlife is quitedifferent from that of Christian and Jewish beliefs.For instance, there is the concept of pre-mortal existence. This doctrine statesthat all human beings are co-existent with God, at least in terms of what Smithcalled “intelligence,” a concept possibly borrowed from such sorcerers’workbooks as Agrippa's Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy or Francis Barrett'sversion of the same in The Magus where planetary forces manifest as“intelligence” and “spirit.” In this scheme, human intelligence took on souls,which then incarnated into bodies as part of a process of spiritual education.As these bodies die, their spirits and intelligences are sent back to one ofthree grades or degrees of the heavenly afterlife. These are the telestial, theterrestrial and the celestial, with the celestial being the highest heaven.Everyone is assured of immortality and of a continued existence of more or lessbliss, depending on how one conducted oneself in this life and what lessons werelearned along the way. Evil people are still assured of a heavenly position,after they have gone through a kind of spiritual imprisonment for a time, butthey will never attain the highest, celestial, heaven.Since Smith arrogated to himself the ability to redesign the heavens of theAbrahamic faiths, he also assumed the authority to baptize those who had alreadydied without being able to convert to Mormonism. This practice began as livingMormons expressed the desire to have their deceased loved ones brought into thefold. They would “stand in” for the dead relative and accept the baptism intheir name. While that practice may be questionable to many, it was at leastconducted with the relatives’ approval and participation. Eventually, of course,the practice got out of hand. We will discuss this in more detail in the nextchapter [part0011.html] but for now it is enough to remember that themuch-reported Mormon affinity for genealogical research is connected to thisdesire to perform baptism by proxy.Another new doctrine revealed by Smith was that of plural marriage. This came in1841, but was revealed to only a few members at that time (even though there isconsiderable evidence that Smith condoned or defended the practice as early as1833). The theoretical basis for this doctrine is rather obscure, particularlyas the Book of Mormon forbids adultery and polygamy and Smith was alwayspublically condemning the practice. As a religious doctrine it did not becomeofficial until after Smith's death; however, the number of Smith's plural wiveshas been documented, although there is still some controversy over the exactnumber with estimates ranging from about 42 wives to 48.Plural wifery was related to another Mormon doctrine, that of “sealing.” Therewere two forms of marriage as understood by Mormons: the first was the standardform of heterosexual matrimony of a husband and a wife, a purely secularwedding. This type of union could be temporary, as the Mormons did allowdivorce. But there was another type of marriage and this was an eternal form. Inthis ceremony—conducted at the Temple—a man and a woman were “sealed” forever.It was a state that would continue after death and for all eternity in theafterlife.None of this implied total monogamy, however. One could be sealed to more thanone wife, just as one could be married to more than one woman. In addition,Smith—and some of his successors—would marry the wives of other men, therebyimplying that polyandry was also possible according to Mormon doctrine. In fact,one could be “sealed” to a spouse even after that potential mate had died. Thereare several accounts of women being “sealed” to Joseph Smith after the latter'sdeath.The practice of plural marriage became public knowledge and official doctrine in1852, eight years after Smith's death. It would continue as official practiceuntil 1890, when political pressure was brought to bear on the Mormons by the USgovernment as well as by public opinion. To be fair, there were many abuses bythose who claimed special dispensation from God to exploit the doctrine forlascivious purposes, and who claimed that “spiritual wifery” meant that theycould have their choice of any woman they desired, if even for one night, forthey were “married in heaven.” While such abuse was punished by excommunicationfrom the Church, the general public associated it with official Mormon policy.After all, once the idea of plural marriage (and “sealing”) was accepted howwould adultery even be defined? Was there an essential difference between a manclaiming to have received direct communication from God that it was acceptablefor him to ravish someone else's wife or daughter, and the official policy ofJoseph Smith that it was okay for him to do the same thing?As we will see in the following chapter, not everyone agreed.In addition to the more scandalous revelations concerning the baptism of thedead and plural marriage, Joseph Smith contributed the idea of a reformedpriesthood. He had instituted the priesthoods of Aaron and Melchizedek in theearly years of the Church; now he added a more ambitious degree of ordinationand initiation, called the “first anointing.” This was in 1842, at a time whenSmith had become fascinated with the rituals of Freemasonry.Probably the most antinomian of all the Mormon practices, this new obsessioncreated a secret society within the Church at its highest levels. It was nothingless than an incorporation of Freemasonry—its beliefs and rituals—as theChurch's innermost secret. Just as Smith believed he was restoring Christianityto its original meaning and purpose, he also believed he was restoringFreemasonry which he felt had been corrupted over time just as Christianity haddegenerated. What many commentators miss in examinations of Mormonism is thatthe religion is basically a hermetic and occult version of Christianity, a kindof “Christian Kabbalah”…albeit with presidential candidates and a famous choir.While Mormons themselves may resist this interpretation due to their insistencethat they be considered a mainstream Christian denomination, the facts argueotherwise. In this way, some Christian critics may be excused for claiming thatMormonism is a cult; but they fail to appreciate just what kind of cult it is.Smith had railed against Freemasonry at a time when the rest of the UnitedStates was similarly preoccupied. The Anti-Masonic hysteria began with thedisappearance of William Morgan on September 11, 1826 from a town not far fromPalmyra, New York where Smith was conjuring angels in the woods. Morgan was aFreemason who was threatening to publish the order's secret rituals, inparticular those of Royal Arch Masonry. Before this could take place, he wasarrested on a trumped-up charge and held in a jail in town, from where he wasabducted by a group of men believed to be Freemasons. He was never seen again.This incident sparked a public outcry against Freemasonry, and Masonic templeswere closed down all over the country in the aftermath. A political party, theAnti-Masonic Party, was formed in 1828 and ran a candidate for president tooppose Andrew Jackson who was himself a Freemason and proud of his membership.Eventually the one-issue party fell apart and its members sought the tweedyembrace of the Whigs.Anti-Masonic sentiments found their way into The Book of Mormon, which arguedagainst “secret combinations”, a way of saying secret societies. Since the bookwas published in 1830, it found itself in a congenial, anti-Masonic environment.It is one of the reasons why skeptics feel that Smith created the Book of Mormonout of whole cloth, since it so clearly reflected the biases and obsessions ofthe time in which it was published.However, as the anti-Masonic furor died down, Smith reevaluated the importanceof Freemasonry to his overall system. (What is not generally known is that heeven married William Morgan's widow, and took her as one of his plural wives.)On March 15, 1842 Joseph Smith was initiated into the first degree—EnteredApprentice—of Freemasonry at Smith's office in town. The following evening hewas passed to the Fellow Craft degree and then raised to the degree of MasterMason the same night. This was done in unseemly haste, and there is somequestion as to why it was allowed but in the absence of a satisfactoryexplanation we can only assume that there was a political agenda behind thisrapid-fire initiation.Once Smith had received all three degrees he then went on to insist thatvirtually every Mormon male of appropriate age and standing be initiated aswell. By the time these assembly-line initiations were completed there were moreFreemasons at Nauvoo than in the entire State of Illinois. This caused someantagonism with the other Freemasons who complained that the Nauvoo Lodge wasessentially a diploma mill for Masons. But the die had been cast.Shortly after publishing the Book of Mormon, Smith had introduced something hecalled the First Endowment, which involved ordination into the priestly order ofMelchizedek, a Smith creation. At Nauvoo, he added the Second Endowment whichinvolved a Masonic form of initiation and the introduction of what has beencalled disparagingly “magic underwear,” the Temple garments that, once bestowed,must never be removed. A glance at their design reveals that the Masonicinfluence on the Second Endowment ceremony cannot be ignored. (See illustrationson the next two pages.)The garment bears a reverse L on the right breast, and a V on the left. Thereverse L is the Masonic square and the V is the Masonic compasses. In fact,these symbols are described as the square and compasses in Mormon literature.The square and compasses can be seen on many Masonic documents and buildings,such as the following on a Masonic hall in England:In May of 1842, Smith went on to ordain a number of leading Mormons in theSecond Endowment ceremonies. These Mormons were all Freemasons, and includedSmith's own brother Hyrum Smith as well as Brigham Young, Hebert C. Kimball, andother famous Mormon leaders. The initiation ceremonies involved secrethandshakes, passwords, and a ritual illustrating the Fall from Eden, Adam andEve, etc. None of this may be revealed to outsiders. No one is permitted as anobserver. The Second Endowment is structured to be virtually identical to aMasonic initiation. This was Smith's idea of a “restored” Freemasonry. In fact,it was a restored Royal Arch Freemasonry.images [../images/00005.gif]The “magic underwear” are Temple garments that, once bestowed, must never beremoved. A glance at their design reveals the Masonic influence on the SecondEndowment.The core concept of the Royal Arch degree is that of buried treasure. Accordingto the ritual, the prospective initiates are taken to the spot where Solomon'sTemple had been destroyed. Work is about to begin on the Second Temple, and theinitiates are told to begin digging in a certain spot. As they do so, accordingto Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor, they discover “a secret vault, in whichthey found treasures of great benefit to the craft.” We find ourselves back onceagain with the seventeen-year-old farmboy in the woods outside Palmyra, New Yorkin 1823, being directed by an Angel who will guide him to a certain spot wheretreasure is buried.images [../images/00006.gif]The traditional Masonic design of the Compasses and Square.It is tempting to look at this rite in connection with Smith's own life andexperience. It had to seem as if the universe itself was speaking to him, inspite of all the hostility that his new scripture, new religion, and newdoctrines aroused in the general population. Joseph Smith in 1842 was broughtback to the Joseph Smith of 1823, full circle. What had been for him a crucialevent—the seminal event—of his life had reappeared, immortalized in a Masonicritual that had its roots in the England of the eighteenth century. It must haveseemed as if the Freemasons a century earlier had predicted—prophesized—thecoming of the new Prophet.Or the explanation may be more prosaic. William Morgan had been threatening toreveal the secrets of the Royal Arch degree at the time Smith was still going tothe woods every year to obtain the golden plates. As details of the degreeritual became known, Smith could have easily incorporated them into his personallegend. He, in effect, became the Masonic initiate who literally was told whereto find the buried treasure, thus enabling him to build the new Temple andrestore both Christianity and Freemasonry thereby.No matter how they are interpreted, these new developments in the structure ofthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints would have far-reaching impacton the character of the organization, making it even less approachable for theaverage Christian and turning it into a secret society with occult rites,strange sexual practices, and bizarre ceremonies and ritual vestments. Insteadof making his religion less controversial and more mainstream, Smith increasedthe strangeness level to an astonishing degree for that time and place. It wasas if he was committed to a path of self-destruction.And to add to the energy levels that were already tuned so high, Joseph Smiththen decided to run for President of the United States becoming the first suchMormon candidate.This was in February of 1844. He announced his candidacy, with Sidney Rigdon ashis running mate. His campaign would end with his death four months later. Inthe meantime, however, Smith's political agenda was far more complex and bizarrethan was generally known to outsiders.Smith had decided that he wanted some degree of independence from the UnitedStates government, and formed yet another secret group within the Church. Thiswas the Council of Fifty, and one of its first acts was to crown Smith as theKing of the Kingdom of God. Smith had decided that what the world needed was a“theodemocracy” or a God-based democracy with Smith as its head and divinerepresentative. The delusion was sufficiently intense that the Council actuallysent ambassadors to various European countries that year. At the same time,Smith was predicting with a great degree of confidence that the United Statesgovernment would be overthrown in a matter of years, and that he would be thereto pick up the pieces.At the same time, Smith was still fighting extradition to Missouri where he waswanted for charges of treason, murder and arson. This situation was exacerbatedby the attempted assassination of the former governor of Missouri, LilburnBoggs, by a man identified as a Mormon who was avenging Smith's maltreatment inthat state. Boggs, who survived the attempt, demanded Smith's extradition toMissouri for that crime, but the extradition request was eventually pronouncedunconstitutional.In response, Smith had raised the largest militia in the State of Illinois (theso-called “Nauvoo Legion” whose strength in 1844 was roughly 3,000 men, makingit almost half the size of the entire US Army!) and had the largest Masoniclodge in the state as well. He was definitely a political power to contend with,and this caused the Illinois legislature many sleepless nights as they ponderedways to contain him.By announcing for the presidency as an independent—on a platform that includedestablishing a national bank, free trade, the annexation of parts of Canada, andthe redemption of slaves with money from the sale of national land—Smith hadthrown down the gauntlet. With tensions rising high, several of his formerlystaunch supporters began to defect. Members of the First Presidency of theChurch swore out affidavits accusing Smith of polygamy. To make matters worse,in April of 1844 Smith himself had delivered a sermon at a general conference ofmore than twenty thousand Mormons in which he set forth his doctrine that thereare many gods, that men and women may become gods, and that God himself was oncea man like any other. The “King Follett” sermon, as it is known (due to itsbeing delivered shortly after the funeral of Mormon elder King Follett) becameanother hot button topic that threatened to bring down the Mormon Temple onceand for all.Smith may have felt that he was at the zenith of his career in those days. Witha huge militia, a massive Masonic presence, the Nauvoo Temple in the process ofbeing erected, and a national stage as he began his candidacy for president, itmight have seemed that he was at the height of his career. In actuality,however, his trajectory was in a rapid and fiery descent to earth.The man who had sworn an affidavit that Smith was a polygamist had then set uphis own newspaper in town, the Nauvoo Expositor, in which he roundly criticizedSmith and the direction the Church was heading. Smith, angry at the growingdissent among his followers, decided that the newspaper should be closed downafter only one edition. This was no sooner accomplished then a rival newspaperpublished an editorial calling for a violent reaction to Smith's autocratic rulein Nauvoo, which was, after all, still a part of the United States.In a growing state of paranoia tinged with hysteria, Smith declared martial lawin Nauvoo on June 18, 1844. The governor of Illinois begged Smith to back downand stand trial at the county seat in Carthage, Illinois for the unlawfuldestruction of the newspaper and its apparent violation of the First Amendment.At the same time, the governor mobilized the state militia in the event that anall-out war broke out between the Mormons and the other citizens of Illinois.Smith eventually relented, and surrendered himself at the Carthage courthouse.He was held over for trial on the additional charge of treason, and kept in asecond-floor room at the jail, along with his brother Hyrum Smith and two otherMormons.On June 27, 1844 a mob of men in disguise attacked the jail with the intentionof murdering the Mormons. Both Joseph and Hyrum Smith had weapons in theirpossession, pistols that had been smuggled in to them for their protection. Asthe mob ascended the stairs, firing at the Mormons, they were answered withreturn fire. Hyrum was shot and killed immediately. Joseph Smith returned fire,emptying his pistol, and then attempted to jump out the second floor window. Hewas shot instead and fell to the ground outside the jail, where he was shotagain and again. He died on the ground a few feet from the jail.The assassins were acquitted by a non-Mormon jury.According to historian D. Michael Quinn, at the time of his death Smith had beenwearing a talisman that had been copied from Francis Barrett's The Magus. Aninspection of this talisman—from a photograph in Quinn's book—shows that thetalisman which was intended to ensure success was engraved incorrectly. This isa regular problem among those aspiring magicians for whom the Hebrew alphabet ismerely a series of incomprehensible squiggles. The corruption of the Hebrew,Greek and even Latin texts in the sorcerers’ workbooks is well-known and plaguesthe efforts of modern practitioners to recreate the ancient rites. JosephSmith's talisman was no different.It was the talisman of Jupiter, a spiritual force that promises success in thecourtroom and with judges (Jupiter being the ruling planet of judges). It bearsan inscription in Hebrew that should read “Father Jophiel,” Jophiel being theruling Intelligence of Jupiter. However, as Smith's talisman was incorrectlydrawn, the inscription reads: “Father, not Jophiel.” The Kabbalistic numerologyof this mangled phrase then gives us the meanings “cut, divided” and “the end.”And so it was for Joseph Smith.The Prophet was only thirty-eight years old when he died.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------6 [part0010.html#fn6] This would find its modern manifestation in the ChurchSecurity department of the LDS Church in the 1980s."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXCHEMICAL WEDDINGS: THE ALCHEMICAL THEOLOGY OF JOSEPH SMITHThis day, todayIs the Royal Wedding day.For this thou wast bornAnd chosen of God for joyThou mayest go to the mountainWhereon three temples stand,And see there this affair.—The Chymical Wedding of Christian RosenkreutzBEFORE WE PROCEED FURTHER it is necessary to summarize some of the maindoctrines of Mormonism which are based on a number of scriptural sources as wellas various pronouncements and revelations by Joseph Smith. These have not beenadded to or subtracted from in any material way by his successors, althoughthere has always been an attempt to reinterpret some of the teachings in orderto bring them more in line with government regulations or public opinion. Thereinterpretations, however, have never denied the original intent of thescriptural source or revelation, but only made them more or less practical in amodern context. This is an important point to remember, for if the religious orpolitical environment in the United States ever softens in regard to such thingsas plural marriage the old revelations will become operative. ContemporaryChurch leaders have said as much, and have been reluctant to abandon the Mormontheology of the mid-nineteenth century. That some Mormon doctrines have not beenofficially enforced in the present day is not an indication that they have beenrepealed but only that it is not practical to make use of them.Sources for these doctrines come from several important scriptures. In additionto the Book of Mormon, there is the all-important Doctrine and Covenants(usually referred to as the D&C and containing many of Smith's revelations overtime), as well as the Pearl of Great Price which contains Smith's autobiographyand portions of the Biblical Books of Genesis and Matthew that Smith hadtranslated, as well as the Book of Abraham which Smith claimed to havetranslated from Egyptian hieroglyphics (a claim that was later shown to befalse), and the Articles of Faith. Also included among the Mormon scriptures isthe King James Version of the Holy Bible.The prominence given to the King James Bible should not fill any believingChristian with a sense of security, however. European alchemical texts of theeighteenth and nineteenth centuries routinely used biblical analogies for theirprocedures and often counseled the aspiring alchemist to pray regularly. Thesame is true for most of the medieval (and later) grimoires. The Bible wasconsidered a source of tremendous wisdom that had been encoded, a belief thathad been fostered by the development of Christian Kabbalah in the fifteenth andsixteenth centuries, particularly through the Florentine Academy. In addition,the most notorious of the sorcerers's workbooks were attributed to theauthorship of popes, bishops, and even King Solomon himself. The Biblical andecclesiastical pedigrees were considered essential selling-points for thesemanuals of spiritual and mundane improvement, in which the Bible was viewed moreas a magical instrument and guide to superhuman powers than it was a system ofethics or morals.This was consistent with the way in which Smith utilized the Bible. Since he hadwritten a new scripture—“correcting” the “errors” in previous scriptures andeven performing his own translations of Genesis and the Gospels, as we havementioned—he had to have viewed the King James Bible with something less thanthe reverence one would have normally regarded it if one were a minister ofChrist. Much in the same way Muslims regard the Bible as an imperfectscripture—a fallible form of the original word of God, which the Qur'an restoresto its original meaning—Smith's approach to the Bible acknowledged its primacyand its importance to his own schema, but rejected those aspects of it that didnot fit in with his new revelation. It was a jumpingoff point, rather than adestination. And just as Muslims regard anyone since Mohammed who claims to be aprophet as a blasphemer and heretic, so too do Christians regard anyone whoclaims an “additional” revelation, something that would make the Bible's messagesomehow “better” or “improved.”The revealed text is an object of veneration in the Abrahamic religions. To theJews, the Tanakh is the perfect text; it can be commented upon and interpreted,but not added to or subtracted from. To the Christians, the Tanakh is the “Old”Testament; it had to be expanded with the addition of the Gospels, the Acts, theEpistles, and the Book of Revelation, i.e. the “New” Testament. To Muslims, theOld and New Testaments tell the story of the prophets that preceded their own,Mohammed and the revelation that he received known as the Qur'an. To Muslims,Mohammed was the “Seal of the Prophets;” there can be no additional prophet.Anyone claiming to be one is either deluded or evil. Or both.But to Joseph Smith, it was indeed possible to add to the Bible, even to improveit. His approach to the idea of “the text” was in a way cynical and cunning: hecreated his own. Moreover, he created one that aped the original Bible even tothe extent of using the King James vernacular, references to the Temple, toJesus, and to the lost tribes of Israel. This would seem to indicate that heviewed the original Bible with something bordering on contempt. It was thisstratospheric arrogance more than anything else that attracted the animosity ofhis neighbors. Paradoxically it was also the quality that ensured that hismessage would survive and, even, prosper.Kabbalists, occultists and alchemists all pretend to decode the Biblical text.As the perfect document—the handwritten word of God—it contains the mysteries ofNature and of all creation, material and spiritual, if you just knew how to readit and where to look. Smith was aware of this, as were many of hiscontemporaries. In fact, one could say that the Book of Mormon and thesucceeding revelations represented decoded portions of the Bible. The theosophyrevealed in the ultimate Kabbalistic work—the thirteenth century Sepherha-Zohar—is certainly not to be discovered in a casual reading of the Torah,replete as the Zohar is with sexual metaphor and cosmological allusions whichare couched in Mosaic language and which use the Torah as a proof text but whichare nonetheless not representative of normative Judaism, popularly understood.While the Book of Mormon does not rise to the sublime intellectual andphilosophical level of the Zohar, many principles and ideas contained within itand the other related Mormon scriptures, can be associated with similar occultand hermetic principles. The perfectibility of the human being, the variouslevels of spiritual existence, the esoteric nature of marriage and of therelationship between the sexes, all have their counterparts in Kabbalistic andalchemical texts while they do not appear as such in normative Jewish orChristian scripture.Thus, while the position of Evangelical Christians vis-à-vis Mormonism as a cultmay seem harsh to outsiders, on the basis of theology and church doctrine itwill be seen that Mormonism is definitely not a part of mainstream Christianity.And while politicians such as former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney mayinsist that Mormonism is “as American as motherhood and apple pie,” that doesnot mean that it is representative of normative Christian beliefs and mostespecially not of mainstream Christian practice. One might as well claim thatScientology is Christian, or that it is “as American as motherhood and applepie.” Scientology also had its origins in the United States, and from the sameroot texts as Mormonism: the sorcerers's workbooks of the Middle Ages and theRenaissance.So let us take a few moments to look at some of the beliefs of Mormonism as theywere revealed to Joseph Smith and codified by the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints. It is not the author's intention to condemn these beliefs perse, but to demonstrate their antinomian nature for the benefit of those who haveheard a lot about Mormonism but who don't understand it.EXALTATIONThen shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be fromeverlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all,because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because theyhave all power, and the angels are subject unto them.Doctrine and Covenants, 132:20Abraham received concubines, and they bore him children; and it was accountedunto him for righteousness, because they were given unto him, and he abode in mylaw; as Isaac also and Jacob did none other things than that which they werecommanded; and because they did none other things than that which they werecommanded, they have entered into their exaltation, according to the promises,and sit upon thrones, and are not angels but are gods.Doctrine and Covenants, 132:37As the above two selections from the Doctrine and Covenants demonstrate, theconcept of apotheosis—or becoming god—is part of Mormon doctrine, as is thesuggestion that concubinage might also be acceptable so long as God gave theconcubines to his followers. In fact, according to the second citation, Abrahamand Isaac sit upon thrones in heaven and are gods. They are not “godlike” or“godly” or “akin to gods” but are actual gods.This refers to the Mormon concept of exaltation, which is virtually identical toapotheosis. According to this teaching, human beings have the ability—throughadherence to the law and obedience to the precepts of the Church—to becomeactual deities. This indicates further that there are those who have alreadyattained this status (such as Abraham and Isaac, above), which implies thatthere is not one God, but in fact many “Gods.” This abandonment of the centraltenet of the Abrahamic religions—monotheism—is perhaps the best way todemonstrate that Mormonism is not Christianity in any recognizable form.Exaltation has its analogues in many spiritual and mystical movements, however.The possibility of becoming a god lies at the heart of some Asian mysticism aswell as western ceremonial magic. It may have its origins in Gnosticism, some ofwhose texts characterize the Creator of this world as a Demi-Urge rather thanGod the Father. In this tradition, the Serpent in the Garden of Eden was God andhis promise to Eve that if she and Adam ate of the Tree of Knowledge they wouldbecome “as gods” (Genesis 3:5) was taken as an indication of the human potentialfor apotheosis.As we have noted before, alchemy sees humanity as raw material to be refinedthrough a series of psycho-chemical or psycho-sexual processes. The exaltationof lead, therefore, is gold. The exaltation of an average human being would be agod. This theme is reinforced by the idea of Jesus, who was incarnated as ahuman being, and who promised his disciples “He that believeth on me, the worksthat I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do; because Igo unto my Father” (John 14:12). That anyone would be able to perform “greaterworks” than Jesus could be taken as implying that a disciple could meet orexceed Jesus's divine status. In alchemy, this reference is taken a stepfurther.A famous line in the Psalms reads “The stone which the builders rejected hasbecome the chief corner stone” (Psalms 118:22). This line was taken up in Actsas a direct reference to Jesus: “He is the stone which was rejected by you, thebuilders, but which became the chief corner stone” (Acts 4:11). This is areference to the words of Jesus himself, who compared himself to the cornerstone mentioned in Psalms (Matthew 21:42, Luke 20:17). In alchemy, this wastaken to mean that a common substance—something that was found everywhere andgenerally ignored—was the basis for the entire art, for the Philosopher's Stone:the chemical agent that would transform lead into gold, or the spiritual agentthat would transform the common person into a god. It is on this line in Psalms(and the associated references by Jesus in the Gospels) that alchemy andFreemasonry meet. Both are concerned with the perfectability of the human raceand with material processes as analogues for spiritual progress. Alchemy usesthe language and the environment of the worker in Nature, and employs chemicalsymbolism; Freemasonry uses rituals of initiation that are based on the Biblicaltheme of Solomon's Temple and which incorporate architectural symbolism. Yet, inboth endeavors the symbols are more than icons or signs; they are the physicalproof of the truth of the process, just as the perfected human being is theproof of spiritual attainments.With exaltation, Joseph Smith was firmly in the camp of the mystics, alchemists,and occultists who held that humans are the raw material of spiritual gold. Inmainstream Christianity, obedience to the laws of the Church and repentance forone's sins are the essential elements of redemption. The fulness of redemptionis not to be seen in this life, but enjoyed after death in the company ofangels. The mysteries of life, death, human suffering, and the incarnation andexecution of Jesus are just that: mysteries that can't be known or understood inthis life.To the mystic, however, and especially to the alchemists and magicians, theseare mysteries to be solved in this life and redemption is earned and enjoyedwhile still alive. The western occultist is a kind of Prometheus, stealing firefrom the heavens; or perhaps Milton's Mammon in Paradise Lost who declares“Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.” This is a rejection of the ideaof God as the Chairman of the Board, God as the ultimate Boss who must beblindly obeyed in order to escape annihilation. Rather, this is an insistence onthe idea that human beings are co-creators of the universe and that there isnothing to fear from a God who understands everything and who created humanbeings with the innate desire to attain ever greater degrees of spiritual glory.While a western occultist or alchemist may find nothing wrong with thesesentiments, they are anathema (literally) to those who have a fundamentalistview of Christianity. To them, as to the Jewish mystics of old, there cannot be“two powers in heaven,” much less a few billion. To Christians there is a neatcosmological system which is based on ideas of monarchy and autocraticgovernment. There is a single king at the top of the hierarchy, whose word islaw and who must be obeyed immediately and without question. This, of course, isGod.Then there are successive layers of the hierarchy accommodating angels,archangels, cherubim, seraphim, etc. and eventually down to human beings, andfrom there to animals and plants. Creation, in this Christian cosmologicalsystem, is not a democracy. God is a leader who must be feared. One can loveJesus and the saints, and pray to them to intercede with God the Father on one'sbehalf, but one is still a powerless minion of the divine State and subject tothe unknowable whim of its leader.Joseph Smith, who was aware of the promises of the magician and the alchemist asa teenager, would come to doubt those of the preacher and the priest, especiallyas the occultists spoke of hidden things: secret knowledge and buried treasure,arcane wisdom and mysterious wealth. As we can see from the story of his life,it was not in his nature to accept the vaguely-defined “will of God” and hopefor the best, but to try to make things happen himself. For a young boy withlittle formal education and a family always on the verge of financial ruin at atime of tremendous economic uncertainty, there were few avenues available tohim. Religion promised succor and hope, but at some undefined “later.” Smithneeded “now.”The ceremonies of ritual magic place the operator—the magician—at the center ofa circle that symbolizes safety and completion. The magician is the god of hiscreation. He is able to order about the spiritual forces of good and evil, justas God does from his throne in heaven. He is a priest, but armed with thesymbols of political and military authority: the wand and the sword,respectively. He shouts, he orders, he commands…and the invisible flying thingsof the ether are compelled to respond and to obey.Joseph Smith, in his own process towards exaltation, was just such a magician.He used religion to pursue political and military ends. He was the general ofhis own army, and a candidate for American president; he was also the King ofthe Kingdom of God on earth. He ordered, he shouted, he commanded. He began byscratching a circle in the dirt in the Palmyra forest, and then ended bycommanding legions of armed men. The outward emblems of his spiritual authoritywere there: Church, State, Army.And he promised all of this to his followers. “Greater works than these…”THE THREE HEAVENSIn addition to a plurality of gods and, as we shall see, a plurality of spouses,there was a plurality of heavens in Smith's cosmology. Again, in this he was notso different from the magicians and Kabbalists that preceded him. The merkavahmystics of fifth and sixth century CE Judaism spoke of seven heavens. Thecosmological systems of Swedish mystic and philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg mayhave also influenced Smith, as historian D. Michael Quinn has suggested, sinceSwedenborg also discusses the idea of heavenly marriage which predates Smith'sown views on marriage in the afterlife.To Smith, there are three separate heavens, or “degrees of glory”: the lowest,or “telestial,” followed by the terrestial heaven and then the celestial—orhighest—heaven. The assignment to the appropriate degree or heaven depends onhow one conducted one's life while alive and while in an intermediary stateknown as the “spirit world.” The “telestial”—a word created by Smith—was theplace where most people would eventually find themselves. Since God does notconsign anyone to hell in Smith's theology, even compulsive sinners will one dayfind themselves in the telestial kingdom. Those who refuse God and refuse hisglory, however, become “Sons of Perdition” and find themselves in the “outerdarkness” along with those demons who revolted against God in the time beforeCreation. This is construed as a voluntary exile from God, and not as a judgmentfrom God. The vast majority of souls, however, will go to one of the threeheavens and the majority of those will be found in the first, or lowest,telestial heaven. Those who did not accept Christ while alive will have to waitin “spirit prison” for one thousand years, until the millenial period is over,before ascending to the telestial realm.The second level or degree of glory is the terrestial heaven. Most of those whoarrive here wavered in their acceptance of Jesus in their lifetime, buteventually accepted him.The third or highest degree of glory is the celestial heaven. This is for thosewho not only accepted Jesus completely in their lifetimes but who followed allthe Church's rules and regulations faithfully their entire lives. The fortunateinhabitants of this degree have become literal gods and goddesses; have attainedthe apotheosis or exaltation.The approach to the three degrees of glory is an indirect one, however. Afterdeath, according to Mormon theology, one enters the “spirit world.” In thespirit world are two possible waiting rooms. The first is Paradise, where soulswait in happiness for their bodily Resurrection. The second is Spirit Prison,where souls who have sinned against Jesus must suffer while they wait for theirown Resurrection. Resurrection is understood as the renewal of the physicalbody. At the time of death, spirit and body separate. The spirit goes to thespirit world, and the body waits for the Resurrection when it will be reunitedwith its spirit.At that point there is a Final Judgment as to which of the three heavens theresurrected will go. There is also the chance that the resurrected person willgo to the outer darkness, having been given the chance to accept Jesus andhaving rejected him anyway. That is the only way one can find oneself in eternaldamnation: by choosing it.There is one more realm to this complex Mormon cosmology, and that is the“Pre-Mortal World.” According to Mormonism, everyone has already existed beforephysical birth. They are sent to the world and pass through a “veil offorgetfulness” on their way to incarnation. The concept of a Pre-Mortal Worldhas its counterpart in the Post-Mortal World or the Afterlife. Mormons refer intheir writings to Pre-Mortal and Post-Mortal existences with elan:In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshipped God astheir Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain aphysical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection andultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life. Thedivine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyondthe grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make itpossible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to beunited eternally.—LDS President Gordon B. Hinckley,“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,”September 23, 1995.This single paragraph from a relatively recent proclamation by the fifteenthpresident of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encapsulates manyof the ways in which Mormons differ significantly from other Christians. Asidefrom the weird “spirit sons and daughters” terminology, the concept of thepremortal realm is front and center. We all, according to Mormon doctrine,pre-existed in our current genders. We incarnated as part of a process by whichwe will gain perfection. Our family relationships will continue after death, butonly if we have received the ordinances and covenants in the holy temples of theMormon church. Otherwise it seems that we are out of luck.The idea of perfectability is alien to normative Christian doctrine. All aChristian can hope for is to be “saved” from eternal damnation by livingaccording to God's laws and abstaining from sinful thoughts, words and deeds.This is not “progressing towards perfection”, but simply keeping your nose cleanand staying out of trouble.But perfectability is central to alchemical and occult belief and practice,otherwise there would be no alchemy, no secret rituals, no initiatory societies,no esoteric teachings. As we have been seeing all along—and contrary to officialMormon dogma—Joseph Smith's religion is an occult order, made even more so byhis adoption of Masonic ritual as an overlay to his treasure-seeking, ceremonialmagic origins.Another interesting aspect of the Mormon heaven system is the possibility ofmarriage in the afterlife. As mentioned previously, spouses on earth can be“sealed” for eternity in heaven, even after one of them has already died. Thistype of “spirit marriage” is not unique: some Chinese ethnicities practice thisform of marriage (minghun in Mandarin) when a person has died as a bachelor. Inorder to provide him a wife in the afterlife, his family arranges a marriagewith a suitable dead woman and the marriage rites are performed as if both arestill alive, after which the woman's corpse is moved to a grave next to her“husband”. In some cases, a living woman is married to a dead man. In thatinstance, the wife remains faithful to her dead husband (takes a vow of celibacyin this life), and visits his grave like a normal dutiful spouse every year,etc. The difference between the Asian concept of spirit marriage and the Mormonversion is that the former is a strategy for ensuring that the deceased is caredfor in the afterlife, and to avoid the return of the spirit of the dead bachelorto haunt his family. It is a prophylactic mechanism that serves a purpose. Inthe case of the Mormon “spirit marriages” there seems to be no such purposebeing served. The motivation for instituting such a practice must remainobscure, unless we look once again to occult sources.This is another instance in which Swedenborg and Smith agree, as Swedenborg feltthat marriage did, indeed, take place in heaven and that even the angels gotmarried. The use of terms like “spirit world” and even “spirit prison” imply adegree of familiarity with Swedenborg as well as with the nascent Spiritualistmovement which did not begin officially until after Smith's death but whichstarted in the same “Burned-Over” district of New York State as Smith'sreligion. The ideas of Swedenborg as well as Franz Mesmer (from whom we get theterm “mesmerism” as a form of hypnosis) were very much in the air at the timeand were part of the public discourse in the 1830s and 1840s. Is this once againevidence of Smith's deliberate incorporation into his doctrine of those ideasand themes that were prevalent in the time and place he lived, specificallythose alternative ideas and themes?If so, one would be hard-pressed to come up with a similar precedent for hisconcept of plural marriage.CHEMICAL WEDDINGSI am using the term “chemical wedding” to refer to the type of mysticalmarriages that Smith's doctrine supports and encourages because of thesimilarities between Mormon ideas on the one hand and alchemical conceptsrelating to the soror mystica, or “sister in the mysteries” on the other.Smith's early attempts to obtain the golden plates were stymied due to aninjunction by the Angel Moroni that he was to bring his oldest brother Alvinwith him on the attempt scheduled for September 22, 1824. However, Alvin diedsuddenly in November of 1823 and was thus unable to assist Joseph in the questfor the golden plates, so the visit to the Hill Cumorah the following September22 came to naught. He was told by the Angel Moroni to return to the hill on thesame night the following year with “the right person” although Moroni neveridentified who that person might be.In 1825, Joseph Smith met Emma Hale, the daughter of a man in Harmony,Pennsylvania whose brother had hired Smith to help him find buried treasureusing his seer stone. Smith fell in love with Emma Hale and proposed marriage,but her father refused the match on the grounds that Smith was a stranger andhad no visible means of support.Smith returned to the Hill Cumorah in 1826 with another diviner, but that alsocame to nothing.In January of 1827, Smith and Emma Hale eloped and were married. He took his newwife with him to the Hill Cumorah on September 22, 1827 and on that night (whileEmma waited in a wagon and prayed) the Angel Moroni finally allowed him toretrieve the golden plates. Emma Hale was “the right person” as Smith hadsuspected for more than a year.Not very much is made of this incident, yet it was a critical development inSmith's personal mythology. The Angel Moroni insisted that he bring the “rightperson” with him in order to retrieve the plates, but the “right person”—in thiscase, Emma Hale—had nothing directly to do with the finding or retrieving of theplates. She remained some distance away, where she could not view the event, andprayed.What, then, was the point of the exercise?We have to return to the original demand of the Angel that Joseph bring hisolder brother Alvin with him the following year. Alvin was Joseph's oldestbrother and an important member of the family whose work ethic was essential tothe family's survival. Alvin represented sobriety and capability. As his youngerbrother, Joseph probably looked up to him and wanted his approval andvalidation. He would have been a “right person”, someone Joseph could trust andsomeone with whom he had great affection. His death a few months after the firstvisit to the Hill Cumorah would have come as a terrible blow, and it is nowonder that it took Joseph three years before he could provide another “rightperson.” It is interesting that neither of his parents or his other siblingswould make the cut, even though both his father and his brother Hyrum wouldbecome Mormons.Smith claims he knew immediately upon meeting Emma Harris that she was the“right person” the Angel required. A skeptical response would be that Smith hadfallen for Emma and decided that she would be the person he would take to theHill Cumorah to retrieve the plates. A kinder response might be that he fell inlove with Emma after he realized that she was the “right person” mentioned bythe Angel. Regardless of how this came about, the fact that he took a woman—hiswife—to the Hill for this seminal event in American religious history issuggestive of how he related to women during the rest of his life. His views onmarriage, plural marriage, and sealing are the ideas that non-believers firstencounter in any discussion of Mormonism as they have become so scandalous.This is not the place to go into a deep analysis of Smith's psychological oremotional makeup, or his motives in marrying Emma Harris and—at last count—someforty or so other women. What will concern us now is the nature of his spiritualideas about women and especially of the relationship between men and women, andhow these ideas reflect profound alchemical themes about the power of sexualunion.It is entirely possible that western alchemy had its origins in the Tantricmysticism of India, which also influenced to a great degree the Daoistalchemical practices of ancient China. Simply put, alchemy in this context usesthe terminology of the chemical laboratory as a way of describing psycho-sexualprocesses that lead to spiritual transformation. In Chinese alchemy, therelationship is made obvious by the depiction of chemical apparatuses as organsof the human body.Any reference to popular European alchemical texts with their strangeillustrations of men and women—usually depicted as kings and queens—in variousstages of marital embrace will assure the reader that there is a sexualcomponent to alchemy or perhaps, an alchemical component to sexuality. In India,the practice of Tantra is a manifestation of ideas concerning thepsycho-spiritual relationship between males and females, either as human beingsor as gods and goddesses or in more abstract terms such as shakti, lingam andyoni, etc. The practitioners of Tantra, known as tantrikas, employ the languageof sexuality in both directions, i.e., using sexual allegories to describephysical or spiritual processes as well as using physical or spiritualallegories to describe sexual processes. The beauty of Tantra and its associated“twilight language” is that it is a discussion about the very basis of creation,matter, and energy and thus can be used to describe a laboratory process as wellas a temple ritual. Tantric concepts and terminology are to religion and thespiritual experience what mathematics is to science: a universal language.In this tradition, the role of the woman is paramount. She is the source ofenergy, of divine power, of shakti. While the male may seem to be the dominantplayer in this production, it is more in the style of a lion-tamer with thelioness. Without the lion, the tamer is nothing. Without the tamer, the lion isstill a lion.Sex in this context is a unity of more than the physical man with the physicalwoman. The human bodies are carriers of something divine, something ineffablewhich must be sensed and cultivated with great care. The sexual act mimics theact of Creation itself which, in the Tantric view, was the result of the unionbetween the god Shiva and his female consort, the goddess Uma or Parvati.In western alchemy, these concepts are given different names but they refer tothe same forces. There is much talk of a white eagle and a red lion, forinstance, representing the male and female elements respectively (in some texts;in others the gender identities are reversed). In other cases, there is simplytalk of a Bride and a Bridegroom, allusions perhaps to the Song of Solomon inthe Bible which may, itself, be a mystical text intended for decoding by an“enlightened” or “initiated” reader. In any event, what the alchemists call theconiunctio oppositorum or the “union of opposites” is a necessary step in theprocess. Known as the hieros gamos, or sacred wedding, this concept has a longtradition dating back to the earliest recorded rituals of the Middle East whenthe king of Babylon—for instance—would embrace a goddess once a year in aspecial chamber at the top of the sacred ziggurat.A few famous alchemists and occultists worked as married couples. Thomas Vaughanand his wife Rebecca are one such example, and their alchemical experiments inseventeenth century England probably had a heavy sexual (or at least biological)component, as one can see from Vaughan's published work.But perhaps the best-known text that discusses the alchemical process in termsof a wedding is the Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz, first publishedin German in 1616 and later in English by 1690. This work treats alchemy fromthe standpoint of a series of initiatory ordeals, all revolving around amarriage and a massacre. Christian Rosenkreutz is, of course, the hero of theRosicrucian Society: a secret order said to have announced itself a few yearsbefore the appearance of the Chymical Wedding in a series of mysteriousmanifestos.The Rosicrucian manifestos—the Fama Fraternitatis and the Confessio—createdtremendous excitement in Europe at the time. The story was that a seeker afterwisdom, Christian Rosenkreutz, traveled throughout Europe and the Middle East insearch of lost knowledge. He returned to Europe sometime in the fifteenthcentury and died there after living a long life and attracting to himself ahandful of companions whose identities would remain forever secret. They wereallowed to help people as doctors only, and to keep a low profile and not tocharge for their services. They were known as “Rosicrucians” after the familyname of their founder, but that in itself was a code. Christian Rosenkreuz—or“Christian Rosey Cross”—was an obvious reference not only to Christianity andthe Cross but also to a specific image of a rose superimposed on a cross, animage that some later occultists claimed was a reference to the “great secret”of western alchemy: the union of the male (the cross) with the female (therose). The fact that a rose and cross emblem could be found on the heraldicdevice of Martin Luther was another clue that the Rosicrucians were believers inthe Protestant Reformation and were therefore opposed to the excesses of theCatholic Church.The third “Rosicrucian” document, the Chymical Wedding, took these ideas muchfurther. There has been some scholarly analysis of this virtuallyincomprehensible work, representing attempts to discover political or historicalelements within it as well as the purely initiatory structure. Rather than delvetoo deeply into its story, it is enough for the present to recall that at heartit is about a royal wedding and the ensuing spiritual transformation of themarried couple. It is a “chemical” wedding, i.e., a union of elements thatproduces a third substance that is more than the sum of its parts.Since sexual reproduction results in the incarnation of a spirit in a physicalsheath or body—a human child—the implications for any sex act are enormous fromboth a religious and an occult point of view. The two partners are seen asdivine participants in the original yet ongoing act of Creation. The parents ofthe Prophet Muhammad were the unwitting agents of a new religion that wouldeventually count more than a billion adherents in the world. Yet the parents ofHitler were the unwitting agents of the destruction of more than 50 millionhuman beings and untold suffering, including nearly eradicating the Jewish andGypsy peoples. In both cases, the sexual act was the same in all its essentials:a man and a woman united in sexual embrace resulting in male ejaculation andfemale impregnation. But there was no anticipation of the actual outcome ofthese acts, no indication that one sexual act would produce a prophet and theother a monster.In alchemical terms, the end result—whether saint or sinner—is always in view.The process is controlled and the outcome is assured. The alchemist may failalong the way, and may never attain the desired goal of the Philosopher's Stoneor the Elixir of Life; but in any event the successful accomplishment of thequest would never produce a monstrous offspring but the spiritual “gold” that ispromised to the pure.In Joseph Smith's theology, the spiritual marriage that takes place under therubric of “sealing” will always result in a divine union. The couple will findeach other in heaven and will be paired forever. There is, however, noparticular emphasis on the reproduction of spiritual children in heaven. Sinceall mortals had a pre-mortal existence it stands to reason that in thepostmortal phase there would be no reproduction, no “additional” souls. Themarriage itself is the goal; children are products of the mortal phase and areimportant insofar as they represent God's “spirit children” incarnating in thisworld in order to proceed on towards the post-mortal phase. If children are notto be produced in the post-mortal existence then there is the implication thatthe role of women in heaven is somewhat reduced; it is certainly changed.Fertility is not a feature of the afterlife, even though marriage is revered assacred and eternal. The role of the exalted Mormon as a god or goddess istherefore not as a creator; as with most Abrahamic versions of heaven, the roleof human inhabitants of the celestial realm seems to be as observers rather thanactors in the cosmic drama. While the alchemical goal is usually limited to theattainment of the Philosopher's Stone and the implied perfection of the humanagent—the “exaltation” of Joseph Smith's theology—in the (original?) Tantriccontext the initiates become united with the god and goddess and become part ofthe ongoing cosmic dance.This is the essential difference between a linear form of spiritual time as itis understood in many western religions and a cyclical form of time as found inmany Asian cosmological systems. In the west, there is a beginning and an end tospiritual evolution. Thus, the idea of “children” becomes superfluous onceapotheosis is attained. Creation, in the west, will eventually come to a stop atthe End of Days. All scores will be settled; all debts paid, all ticketspunched. Regardless if one is a Mormon and believes in the perfectability ofhumans to the point that they become gods and goddesses, or if one believes inthe normative Judeao-Christian-Islamic sense that human beings are submissive toa single God and desire only to enter Paradise at the end of life, there is anend-point. There may be sex—viz. the famous legends of virgins awaiting thesoldier who dies in jihad—but there is no pregnancy. It is, in short, a male(or, perhaps, a human) fantasy of heaven.Which is not to say that heaven is without children in the Mormon framework.Those who die before the age of eight go directly to heaven, whether they havebeen baptized or not. Baptism in Mormon practice is reserved for those whowillingly and consciously make the decision to become baptized, and thuschildren are not baptized until they have reached the age where it is assumedthey can make a conscious choice. That particular idea, however, is not appliedin the case of proxy baptism, or baptism of the dead, in which case a familymember makes the choice on behalf of a deceased ancestor.In 2012 there was an ongoing scandal concerning the practice of proxy baptism.In this case, it was revealed that the deceased relatives of Holocaustsurvivors—including Anne Frank—had been baptized in the Mormon temple. There wasoutrage from some members of the Jewish community, and perhaps rightly so due tothe arrogance and insensitivity of the Mormon clergy involved, but it begged thequestion: is such a “baptism” valid in any meaningful sense of the word? Dopeople who object to having their dead relatives baptized this way only wind upacknowledging the efficacy of the rite? Does that make them de facto believersin the mechanisms of Mormon ritual, the so-called ordinances?ORDINANCES AND COVENANTSWhat to a Roman Catholic is a sacrament—baptism, penance, communion,confirmation, matrimony, ordination, extreme unction (last rites)—are to aMormon the “ordinances.” The most important of these (the “saving ordinances”)include baptism, confirmation, ordination into the priesthood of Melchizedek,the endowment, and the marriage sealing as well as the sealing of children totheir parents. (As in Roman Catholicism, only men may be ordained as priests.)To the Mormons, the ordinances must be applied to a human body; in other words,the ordinances can only take effect on a physical form. This is not quite thesame as the Catholic sacraments which are supposed to mark the soul and not thebody (a doctrine which has given rise to the movement to ordain women as priestsif gender is believed to be a feature of the physical body and not the soul).Thus, in order for a person to be baptized after death, there is a requirementthat there be a human stand-in for the baptism. Hence the term “proxy baptism.”The steps that need to take place to perform the proxy baptism collectively isknown as “temple work.”One does not have to baptize one's own family members only. There is a clearstatement in one of the Mormon manuals that states:You may do this work in behalf of your ancestors and others who have died.Acting for them, you can be baptized and confirmed, receive the endowment, andparticipate in the sealings of husband to wife and children to parents.—“Temples” in True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference, p. 172As you can see, all of these ordinances may be performed on behalf of those towhom one is not related at all. That is why it was possible for Mormon prieststo baptize Jews who had died in the Holocaust, such as Anne Frank, without beingasked to do so by a relative of the deceased.One of the most important of all the ordinances is the Temple Endowment. Itrepresents a full membership in the LDS Church and must be undertaken byeveryone prior to their 21st birthday and especially before one is permitted togo on the virtually compulsory mission assignments. Women should receive theEndowment before they are married.In order to receive the Endowment one must first obtain a “Temple recommend.”This is a document that attests that the potential candidate is spiritually fitto enter the temple and is basically in a state of grace. There are interviewsof the candidate before he or she is considered acceptable, and then therecommend is signed and is good for two years.The ceremony begins with the ordinance of ceremonial washing and anointing.After this, the candidate removes all clothing and puts on the famous “Mormonunderwear”, a ritual garment which from that point on is never taken off. As wesaw earlier, this garment has Masonic symbols embroidered on it. It is purewhite, as are all items of clothing worn in the temple. During the Endowmentceremony a white robe is worn over the undergarment.The participant is then introduced to a series of enactments of various scenesthat are believed essential to understanding the relationship of humans to God.This includes a re-enactment of Creation and of certain dialogue between Adamand Eve. If one keeps in mind all that has already been said about the “chemicalwedding”, one can see that Adam and Eve represent the first “married couple” inBiblical history and that they lived in Paradise, so the theme of a sealedmarriage in heaven is prefigured in the story from Genesis.This is accompanied by instruction in certain secret gestures and handshakes aswell as passwords, all in the style of Masonic ceremony. The candidate is thentested in his or her knowledge of these secrets and in their understanding ofthe meaning behind them (which is expected to change over time). They are thenbrought before a veil which separates them from God's presence as more questionsare asked. After they are satisfactorily answered, the veil is lifted and theyspend some time in the presence of God in heaven.This ritual is experienced many times in the life of a pious Mormon. The firsttime occurs, as mentioned, when the Mormon is still quite young. After that,however, he or she is expected to undergo the ritual again at a later date, onbehalf of someone who was not able to hear the Mormon teachings and receive theEndowment themselves. In other words, they will go through a ceremony identicalto their first but as proxy for an ancestor or for some other person. This willhappen again and again during an average Mormon's life.This is the ritual that was created by Joseph Smith at Nauvoo, Illinois after hehad been initiated into Freemasonry. The Temple Endowment ceremony represents a“restored” version of the Masonic initiation. Until recently, the instructionalportion of the initiation involving the creation of the world, Adam and Eve,etc, was performed by live actors in the manner of Masonic ritual. Lately,however, some of this instruction is given in a video format in the temple, butthe secret gestures, handshakes, and passwords are still taught live.During the Endowment ceremony certain “covenants” are given. A covenant inMormon parlance means an oath or a commitment to a certain course of action.Ordinances are accompanied by covenants, which is a way of saying that thesacraments are accompanied by vows. Normally, these covenants are promises tolive a spiritual life, conscious of one's actions, and to maintain a strongrelationship to the church, the community, and one's family. The sacredundergarment is a further reminder of these covenants and a protection againstthe temptations of the flesh.The Temple Endowment ceremony is secret. No outsider may witness and certainlynot participate in the Endowment (or even gain access to the Temple itself).This level of secrecy is unique, since it applies to every able-bodied member ofthe faith. Imagine secret rituals for Catholics or Presbyterians; for Muslims orJews. It is a survival of the Masonic lodge environment with which Smith becameentranced in the last years of his life. Masonic ceremonies are also performedin a temple; there is special clothing (the Masonic apron being the mostfamiliar); oaths are taken to keep the rituals secret; and secret passwords,handshakes and gestures are taught. One can safely say that none of this existsin normative Abrahamic practice. In a sense, every Mormon is a kind ofFreemason. The Temple Endowment is not reserved for a priesthood but isavailable to everyone and everyone is encouraged to undergo the rite many timesin their lives. Just as the Masonic initiations are a reworking of the story ofthe building of Solomon's Temple as it appears in the Bible, so too is theMormon Endowment ceremony a reworking of Genesis. Both Masons and Mormons take abasic theme from the Old Testament and re-imagine it.Religion, mysticism, magic and alchemy—plus history and archaeology—werecomponents of Joseph Smith's personal sandbox in which he played to his heart'scontent, oblivious of how he was kicking sand in the other kids' eyes; creatinga mountain of alternative versions of everything more like a sciencefiction orfantasy novelist than a spiritual leader. There is no doubt that the Book ofMormon was a tremendous accomplishment, especially considering the short periodof time in which it was created and by a young man who had little in the way offormal education. The ensuing “revelations” that codified such concepts as thebaptism of the dead and plural marriage, as well as the temple endowment, onlyincreased the antinomian aspect of his restoration project.The question we have to ask ourselves is: does any of this make Joseph Smith anyless of a prophet than, say, Moses who created a new religion based on bits andpieces of whatever was available at the time, fueled by inspiration andimagination? Moses was also a political leader and a military commander. Mosesalso had a hard time finding a home for his new movement. Moses also had pluralwives.And Moses also died before he could reach the Promised Land."},{"pageContent":"AGENDAS"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTHE PROMISED LAND, IN THIS WORLD AND THE NEXTAnd it came to pass that I beheld many multitudes of the Gentiles upon the landof promise; and I beheld the wrath of God, that it was upon the seed of mybrethren; and they were scattered before the Gentiles and were smitten.And I beheld the Spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles, and they didprosper and obtain the land for their inheritance; and I beheld that they werewhite, and exceedingly fair and beautiful, like unto my people before they wereslain.—1 Nephi13:14–15THE ASSASSINATION OF JOSEPH SMITH IN 1844 did not result in an eruption ofviolence against non-Mormons, as was feared. Instead, Brigham Young took overthe leadership role of the Church and became in the process the second-mostimportant Mormon in history after Smith himself. It was Young who led the Saintsinto the Promised Land, accomplishing what Smith in his lifetime tried and couldnot.Brigham Young (1801–1877) was born, like Smith, in Vermont. He also held avariety of jobs in his pre-Mormon career, such as blacksmith and craftsman. Butin 1830 he read the Book of Mormon and joined the denomination, becoming amissionary to Canada by 1832. He traveled to Kirtland, Ohio and became one ofthe original Twelve Apostles—the “Quorum of the Twelve”—in 1835, becoming itspresident in 1840.Young was energetic and devoted. He performed missionary work in England for theMormons and in 1838 he helped the beleagured Missouri Mormons escape toIllinois. His abilities as a leader were unquestioned, and when Smith wasassassinated he was the logical candidate as successor.There had been no clear-cut policy of succession in the Church. Most thought itlikely that Smith's brother Hyrum would be the successor except that Hyrum wasmurdered along with Smith. (It is interesting to note that Hyrum's name is thesame as that of the central personage in the Masonic initiations, Hiram Abiff,who according to Masonic lore was one of the architects of the Temple of Solomonand who was also slain.) Smith had other brothers, none of whom was consideredappropriate as the new leader. One of Smith's sons by Emma Harris Smith wasJoseph Smith III, but he was too young at the time of Smith's death. Eventuallythe Church elders agreed that Brigham Young would make the best successor toSmith and he was duly elected and appointed. (Joseph Smith III would go on torun the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1860: acompetitor of Young's group.)It was the role of Emma Harris Smith that caused the most immediate controversy,for she despised Brigham Young and would have nothing to do with the Churchafter the death of her husband. The reasons for this may have everything to dowith plural marriage.To the end of her life, Emma Smith insisted that her husband did not practiceany form of polygamy or plural marriage, even when presented with evidence thatwould disprove her position. Yet, the policy of plural marriage was in place asearly as 1831 when the Smiths had only been married for four years. It was asecret policy, to be sure, at least at the time. Smith had confided therevelation to Brigham Young among a few others (and conceivably not to Emma),and Young took it very much to heart.That Smith had plural wives is beyond doubt; the only controversy is theirnumber, with some estimates beginning around 20 to 25 wives, with others rangingup to the forties and even the eighties. The problem with the accounting isbased on the lack of marriage certificates or any form of actual documentation.Plural marriage was illegal in the United States and there would have been nocourthouse in the land that would have issued this type of paper (for the sakeof the trees, if nothing else). But Smith was always surrounded by a number ofvery young women—many of his wives were under twenty years of age—and in somecases they even lived with the Smith couple. Rumors abounded that one of thereasons Smith had to leave Kirtland was due to some difficulties over pluralmarriage, and he definitely had an affair with a servant girl at the time (whichhe defended, saying it was not adultery since he had married her according toMormon doctrines).It is entirely possible that Emma Harris's denial of her husband's pluralmarriages stemmed from a desire to disown the other women and to forbid them anypart of the Smith estate. Emma was also in a legal tussle with Brigham Youngover the issue of personal property versus Church property, and Young was astrong supporter of plural marriage.Another issue, however, may have been even more personal.On September 28, 1843 she and her husband Joseph Smith took part in the veryfirst “Second Anointing” at Nauvoo.The “First Anointing” takes place during the Temple Endowment ceremony in whichthe candidate is washed and anointed before proceeding to the rest of theritual. This anointing recognizes that the candidate is on his or her way tobecoming a priest or priestess, a king or queen, a god or a goddess…in otherwords, towards exaltation.The Second Anointing, however, is far more serious and the details of the ritualare a closely held secret. To this day, the LDS Church refuses to disclose howmany Mormons have received the Second Anointing, although the number is probablyquite small in comparison to the total membership. The reason for this is thatthe Second Anointing is equivalent to the hieros gamos or alchemical wedding. Inthis ritual, the husband and wife become a king and queen…they become gods onearth and are assured of—guaranteed—their exaltation in heaven.Emma Smith and Joseph experienced this ceremonial transformation only ninemonths before Smith's assassination. It is difficult to imagine a ritual withprofounder implications for the parties involved, and even more difficult toreconcile this experience with the concept of plural marriage. It could be thatEmma Smith took the ritual very seriously, interpreting this form of “celestialmarriage” as a stamp of eternal monogamy even though it is doubtful that JosephSmith saw it the same way.A more cynical analysis might be that Smith's multiple marriages with theirintimations of infidelity might have inspired Smith to create this ritual inorder to mollify his wife and allay any fears she might have had about theirmarital state. Regardless of his motivations, however, the Second Anointing isperfectly consistent with the way in which he was developing and improving uponhis original hermetic, alchemical and occult, project. He was designing a ritualform of the apotheosis of his spiritual revelations. It was an act of ceremonialmagic, an extension of Freemasonry's male-centered initiatory structure into asexual field that included women as partners in the highest attainable degree.He took the quiet intimations of human perfectability present in the Masonicdegree system and blatantly claimed the ability to confer male and femaledivinity in this lifetime.Nine months later almost to the day he would be murdered. In a sense, theexaltation he proclaimed in September resulted in his death and subsequentimmortality in June, after a period analogous to pregnancy. Smith gave birth tohimself as a god, just as previously he had given birth to himself as a prophet.In the end, Emma Harris Smith left Mormonism and married a non-Mormon. She wouldeventually return to the fold when her son Joseph Smith III began running theReorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but that might alsohave been as a slap to Brigham Young's operation which—by then—had succeeded infinding a home in the distant territory of Utah. It was there, far from theprying eyes of police, soldiers, and government agents that the Mormon doctrinecould find its fullest and freest expression.In 1845, the special charter of the city of Nauvoo (the one that guaranteed acertain autonomy) was revoked. In practical terms this meant that the Mormonscould no longer keep a militia under arms. Sporadic attacks on Mormons byindividuals and larger groups began in earnest, and Young began makingpreparations to leave Illinois and head west. Smith had once prophesized thattheir Kingdom would lay in the direction of the Rocky Mountains, so Young andhis followers decided it was as good a plan as any. There was no future forMormons in the eastern states.After rushing to finish building the Nauvoo Temple so that followers couldexperience the ordinances and the endowment ceremonies, Brigham Young scheduledhis exodus from Illinois in February of 1846, in deep winter and below-zerotemperatures. To have waited any longer would have been suicide. Arrest warrantshad been issued in December of 1845 for Young and many of the Mormon leadershipon charges of counterfeiting. It seems that some of the Mormons were mintingbogus coinage, referred to as “Nauvoo Bogus”, and the government was using thisas an excuse to level serious charges against the Mormons and close them downfor good. Attempts were made by both state and federal agents to arrest Youngand the others, but Nauvoo security was tight and they always managed to escape.The handwriting, however, was on the wall. Had Young waited much longer he mostcertainly would have wound up in prison along with most of the important Churchelders. The assassinations of Joseph and Hyrum Smith while in government custodywere fresh on everyone's mind. There was the additional danger that theauthorities would have sent militia to Nauvoo to effect the arrests, and thiscould have led to a violent reaction by the Nauvoo faithful. The only optionleft to Young was to take as many of the Mormons with him as he could and fleenot only the state of Illinois but the United States as well. He originally hadplanned to wait for the spring, when the weather would have been more agreableand made the traveling less arduous; however, he suddenly decided to leave inFebruary during a harsh winter. The only logical reason for this would have beento escape the indictments and the arrest warrants, a theory that does not appearin the official Mormon websites.So thus began what Mormons refer to as their version of the Exodus.“We would esteem a territorial government of our own as one of the richest boonsof earth, and while we appreciate the Constitution of the United States as themost precious among the nations, we feel that we had rather retreat to thedeserts, islands or mountain caves than consent to be ruled by governors andjudges whose hands are drenched in the blood of innocence and virtue, whodelight in injustice and oppression.”Brigham Young, in a letter addressed to US President James PolkThe trek to Utah was anything but pleasant. The first three hundred miles tookthe Saints through the Iowa Territory in bitter cold weather. They made littleprogress, and thousands of them were scattered along the trail from Illinois toNebraska. The last remnants of the Mormons in Nauvoo did not manage to leaveuntil September of 1846, due to financial inability or illness, at which timemobs forced them out at gunpoint. At the end of the year, the majority ofemigrants—some sixteen thousand all told—was still in Iowa while Youngestablished his camp at Winter Quarters (now Florence), Nebraska on the MissouriRiver while he waited for spring and the final push to the Rocky Mountains.The trek was not without its internal difficulties as well. Some of the Mormonsin the caravans were counterfeiters, and they were buying supplies with boguscoins. Others were bringing their coin-manufacturing equipment with them. Young,not wanting to be caught with such evidence of criminality, had the machinesburied along the way. The rumor was that one day he would send teams to find theburied machines and bring them to wherever the Mormons would eventually settleso that they could begin making their own currency once again as a sovereignnation (which, in fact, they did).It is interesting to note the degree to which making money—literally, by mintingit or printing it—was such an obsession with the Saints, beginning from JosephSmith's early treasure-seeking days to the Kirtland Anti-Bank, and then to Utah.The association of money with Mormonism is a strong one and has not dissipatedwith time. It may be one example of how the alchemical concerns of the earlyMormons influenced the character of the movement. Was their focus on the actualmanufacture of money a manifestation of their deeper, more esoteric beliefs inthe alchemical transformation?The Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches believe in the transubstantiaton ofbread and wine into the body and blood of Jesus; the alchemists in thetransmutation of lead into gold. While these ideas share some similarities—andno one can deny the wealth of the Catholic Church—the Mormons understood thespiritualization of the alchemical dream while at the same time viewing themanufacture of money pragmatically. Both the Catholic Church (for instance) andthe LDS Church create wealth out of nothing: while not producing tangible goodsof any value they nevertheless generate income from the “sale” of spiritual andsocial benefits. This could be viewed as an alchemical process reinterpreted fora lay, or non-specialized, audience. In the outer world, the LDS Church enrichesitself financially, transforming the desires and anxieties buried in the heartsof their followers into treasure; in the inner, or “spirit world” of the Mormondoctrines, the individual members transform the perishable lead of theircharacter into the gold of spiritual immortality.In both cases—the transubstantiaton of bread and wine into the flesh and bloodof Jesus, and the alchemical transformation of lead into gold—the processinvolves great sacrifice and the violent destruction of the original form of theprima materia or “first matter”: the body of Jesus crucified, or thepurification of the prima materia of the philosophers. In the case of theMormons on their journey to the Promised Land, the sacrifices were just assevere.By all accounts that first year on the road was a miserable one. Heavy rains hadturned much of the trail to mud and long stretches became nearly impassable.Adding to the difficulties was the fact that the trip began in a hurry withoutadequate preparation or provisions. Along the way, Mormon settlers werestationed at various spots in Iowa to plant crops and provide housing for theemigrants who would follow.By the spring of 1847, Young was ready to set out from Nebraska for the GreatBasin in the territory of Utah. At that time, Utah was still part of Mexico andbeyond the legal reach of the US government, which was what Young wanted forhimself and his followers. He wanted a place that no one else wanted, reasoningthat he would not have to fight other settlers or the government if he wanted toput down roots there, create his own government, issue his own currency, andpractice the Mormon doctrines to their fullest degree, including polygamy. Whilemost official Mormon and US government sources today will refer to the Mormonsunder Brigham Young as pioneers, they were in reality America's firstexpatriates. While the US Constitution guarantees a certain level of religiousfreedom, “religion” perhaps was too narrowly defined for the Mormons. (One hasthe more recent example of the flight of Jim Jones and his People's Templecongregation to the jungles of Guyana, in a move that was expressive of the samelevel of dissatisfaction concerning the US government as Brigham Young's.Unfortunately, a study of the parallels between Smith and Jones would requiretoo great a digression here.)By July 1847 the first group of Mormons entered the Great Basin, where Salt LakeCity would eventually be founded, after an arduous journey through Nebraska andWyoming. Mexico still claimed most of the territory of Texas, New Mexico andCalifornia along with Nevada, Arizona, and Utah, but there was no Mexicanmilitary or government presence in the Salt Lake City area and the 1848 war withMexico would result in the United States winning all the land north of the RioGrande including Utah. By that time, the first batch of Mormon settlers hadalready been living in Salt Lake City for a year.Young returned from Salt Lake City to Winter Quarters, Nebraska where thelargest contingent of Mormon followers still remained. On December 27, 1847Brigham Young was named First President of the Church. In April of 1848, Youngand a band of over three thousand Mormons headed for Salt Lake City to beginbuilding the New Zion. The wagon trains that had left Nauvoo, Illinois in 1846finally had a destination.When Young settled in what would become Salt Lake City, his first order ofbusiness was to erect housing for his multiple wives and children. Rather thanbe coy about plural marriage, Young was a strong advocate. Those early days ofthe LDS Church saw the Saints as fiercely loyal to the doctrines handed down byJoseph Smith. They had to be: they had suffered tremendous privations andgovernment and mob oppression due to them. They had fled across more than onethousand miles of hostile territory in wagon trains and horse-drawn carts to getto Utah, braving harsh winters, torrential rains, and sickness. To haveabandoned any of the Prophet's teachings would have made all that they sufferedmeaningless.So the plural marriages, the exaltations, the temple endowment and theordinances and covenants were all still in force. The endowment would requirethe building of an appropriate temple, and Brigham Young's expertise as acraftsman and carpenter was put to full use in Salt Lake City as it had been inNauvoo. His ability to lead and to organize are widely regarded as the two mostimportant traits that his followers needed to survive the circumstances thatfaced them.Other Mormons, however, were not so happy with Young's election as leader of theFirst Presidency. Sidney Rigdon, Joseph Smith's right-hand man for so much ofthe early church history, set up his own shop in Pennsylvania. Others would soonfollow. Mormon splinter groups sprang up in various states, each laying claim tothe Prophet's succession. The Prophet's own son—Joseph Smith III—would becomehead of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and hismother, Emma Harris Smith, would actually join her son's church.Brigham Young, however, had the benefit of being recognized as the prophet'slegitimate successor and as the only leader actually preserving Smith's originaldream and original doctrine. He also created a new city for his followers, onethat was out of reach of government interference. This was important becauseSmith's doctrines involved a rejection of US government authority. By creatinghis own currency, his own militia, and instituting plural marriage, Smith wassetting himself and his faithful outside the boundaries of American law andcustoms. He believed in creating a theocratic government, and his run for thepresidency was designed to put him in the White House where he could overturnthe Christian status quo in favor of his own spiritual vision. He would not be apresident in the normal sense of the term; he would be a king and a prophet.Young accepted these terms and installed himself as the king of his new kingdomin the desert. There would be no hiding of plural marriage: his wives andchildren were acknowledged and out in the open. He created his own army. Heminted his own currency. He built his own temples, and the endowment ceremoniesand anointings continued apace (the “second anointings” beginning again in 1866after the last six hundred or so at Nauvoo that took place by 1846). He evenpromulgated his own revelations, revealing—for instance—that Adam was the fatherof Jesus. And in the midst of all this frenetic activity came the CaliforniaGold Rush.On January 24, 1848 a discovery of gold was made at Sutter's Mill in Coloma,California. The discoverers at first tried to keep the discovery secret, butword leaked out to a group of Mormons working at a nearby mill. Thus, theMormons were among the earliest prospectors of the Gold Rush, establishingthemselves at what would become known as Mormon Island, where they dug for goldand in the end shipped roughly $80,000 in 1848 dollars back to Brigham Young inUtah. This gold became the basis for Young's new banking operations and helpedto finance the growth of Salt Lake City as the Mormon Mecca.Once again, we have the image of Mormons seeking treasure under the earth. Onlythis time, they succeeded. What more validation could there be for BrighamYoung's ascension to the throne of the Mormon kingdom?But while the situation was improving in Salt Lake City, there were stillthreats from outside the kingdom. The Mexican-American war left Utah as aterritory of the United States, which meant that Young and his followers had notmanaged to go far enough west to avoid increasing government interference intheir affairs and California would become a state in 1850, thus sealing off thatpotential exit. Basically, the Mormon kingdom was surrounded although that wouldnot become apparent for some time to come.In the meantime, Young had solidified his leadership position not only as apolitical and military commander but as a prophet as well. Along with the purelylogistical and mundane organizing and coordinating that was so necessary to thewell-being of his flock, there were also the ongoing revelations.In Mormonism, each president of the Church is also a prophet. This is a positionsimilar to that of the Catholic pope, who is believed to be infallible when heutters pronouncements ex cathedra. In the case of the LDS Church, thehighest-ranking official takes over the title of “prophet” from his successorand is believed to have a direct line to God (or the “gods” as the case may be).Thus, Joseph Smith's legacy of—and capacity for—revelation and spiritualleadership is passed down through each successive LDS leader in an unbrokenline, like apostolic succession in the Catholic and Orthodox churches. BrighamYoung was the first such successor, and he flourished in the role.It was this sense of hubris, of divine approbation, that possibly contributed toone of the church's most infamous episodes: the Mountain Meadows Massacre.BLOOD ATONEMENTMormons generally hate it when the subject of the Mountain Meadows Massacre isbrought up. They also hate it when polygamy, “magic underwear”, andtreasure-digging are brought up. That's understandable, but the historical dataargues for the unconventional, antinomian nature of Mormonism especially whenjudged against its more mainstream Christian competitors. While one can findsome justification for many of the Church's stranger deeds and doctrines, theone that cannot be excused so easily is the Massacre and its associated doctrineof blood atonement.This was a belief that certain sins were so evil that only the spilling of theperpetrator's blood could atone for them. In other words, certain crimes werebeyond even the power of the Blood of Jesus to expiate. This became afundamental part of the Temple Endowment ritual as it was modified by BrighamYoung after the murder of Joseph Smith, when the candidates were expected totake an oath to avenge his death.Generally, the Mormons believed in capital punishment. As a Restorationistmovement, they were concerned with bringing back the ancient Old Testament lawsand culture, in which blood atonement and polygamy were included. Of course,Joseph Smith went far beyond the theology of the Bible when he introducedhermetic and alchemical ideas, as well as the Masonic initiation ceremonies,into his new religion along with a plurality of gods and goddesses; this wasmore like restoring pre-Judaic paganism than it was restoring the Law of Moses.In the Masonic initiations that Smith adapted for his use, there were the usual“blood oaths.” These are vows taken by the initiate not to reveal the secrets ofthe order under penalty of a violent and painful death, having one's throat cutfrom ear to ear. It was a small step from there to advocating blood atonementfor a variety of crimes, even among the Mormon laypersons as well as non-Mormonswho were considered to have sinned against the Church. This was to involve theshedding of blood—hanging or being shot was not as acceptable—and decapitationwas approved as the method of capital punishment for thieves, adulterers andmurderers in the Mormon kingdom until the US government extended its authorityover the Utah territory.By 1857, news had reached Salt Lake City that President Buchanan had orderedtroops into Utah. The mission of these troops was not clear to the Mormons, andYoung suspected that they were intended to invade the Mormon kingdom and deposeYoung. In response, Brigham Young declared martial law.This was the situation in September of 1857 when a wagon train from Arkansaspassed through Salt Lake City on its way to California. These were people ontheir way to a better life, whole families in wagons bound for the promise ofnew land and new opportunities on the west coast. Salt Lake City was a regularstop for the wagon trains heading west, where they would stock up on suppliesand rest before setting out for their next bivouac at Mountain Meadows in thesouthern part of Utah. The Baker-Fancher wagon train was no different.While composed of mostly pioneers from Arkansas, it was rumored there were a fewMissourians among them. According to the story, these Missourians boasted thatthey possessed the actual gun that killed Joseph Smith. Of course, this rumorignited like a lit fuse all the way back to Salt Lake City as the Baker-Fanchertrain made its way to Mountain Meadows. It is alleged that Brigham Young did notknow in advance what was soon to take place; however, it was Young's ownincendiary teachings on vengeance for the murder of Joseph Smith and the needfor blood atonement that fueled this particular fire.On September 7, 1857 a band of Mormons attacked the wagon train. What wassinister about this attack—aside from the fact that the targets were men, womenand children—was the ruse used to fool the pioneers into thinking they werebeing attacked by Native Americans.The Mormons had built a working relationship with the local Paiute tribes. Theypromised them the goods that the train was carrying if they would assist theMormons in the slaughter. The Paiutes demurred. They had already promised not toattack white settlers and were not about to break that promise.That meant that the Mormons would have to follow Plan B. They would dress asIndians themselves.So for the next four days—from September 7 to September 10—the Utah TerritorialMilitia attacked the wagon train several times. The pioneers offered stiffresistance, but their ammunition was running low and so was their water. Inorder to make the destruction of the wagon train more efficient, and to solvethe problem that some of the pioneers may have noticed white men among the“Indians”, the Mormons decided to change it up.On September 11, 1857 they approached the train without their Indian disguises,pretending in this case to be rescuers. They met with the leaders of the trainand said that they would have to leave their belongings behind but that theywould take them back to Salt Lake City to regroup.The pioneers gratefully accepted.The Mormons then took the adult men a little way from the women and children andexecuted them in cold blood.The women were next.Men of the militia waited in the bushes beside the road and ambushed the womenand children as they passed by.Only the youngest children (considered too young to have made good witnessesagainst the Mormons) were spared, seventeen in total, and these were broughtback to Salt Lake City alive where they were adopted by local families untilsome were identified years later by government investigators and returned totheir relatives in Arkansas. The property of the slaughtered pioneers was seizedby the militia; some of it wound up with those few Paiutes who sided with themilitia, but the rest was picked over by the militia leaders and what was notwanted by either the Paiutes or the militia was auctioned off in Salt Lake City.Altogether more than one hundred pioneers were slaughtered at Mountain Meadows.Some estimates range as high as one-hundred-and-forty. Aside from the children,no prisoners were taken.The leaders of the massacre made their report to Brigham Young. He issued anofficial statement saying that the Native Americans had been responsible for theattack. As it was in the midst of what would become known as the Utah War—thearmed confrontation between Mormon militias and the US Army sent by Buchanan tosuppress an alleged rebellion by the Mormons and which lasted until July 1858—anofficial US government investigation did not take place at once. In fact, itwould be years after the end of the Civil War before anything resembling one wasallowed to continue. In the meantime another massacre took place, the one knownas the Aiken massacre in which six Californians were murdered.The US Army began a preliminary investigation in 1859, after the end of the UtahWar, and concluded that the Mormons had, indeed, been involved. An inspection ofthe Mountain Meadows site confirmed that the killings had been in the form ofexecutions rather than the result of an Indian raid. The Army inspector washorrified by the scene—already two years' old—that confronted him of theskeletons of women with the bones of their children in their arms. He orderedthat the bodies be collected and buried in a mass grave at the site, and a crosserected over it to commemorate the victims.US officials then issued arrest warrants for the leaders of the militia, butthey managed to evade capture until the start of the Civil War in 1861. Due tothe war, the Mountain Meadows investigation was postponed until 1871, whenauthorities granted immunity to a member of the militia who gave a swornaffidavit, naming once again the Mormon ringleaders.Although many of the perpetrators of the massacre were known, only one—John D.Lee—was ever arrested, tried and convicted of the crime. He was executed byfiring squad. Brigham Young's opinion on the matter is difficult to determineprecisely. Upon hearing of the massacre, he pronounced it God's judgement on theguilty. Later, in his dealings with the US government, Young began to change hisstory and proclaimed the massacre a “great crime”. There is no indication thatYoung felt any guilt for his actions and statements both prior to the massacre,and later during what can only be called a cover-up. By the mid-1870s, when Leehad been executed, Young was in the midst of negotiations with the United Stateson the future of Utah.MORMONISM'S BABYLONIAN EXILE BEGINSYoung had originally planned a huge nation, called Deseret, which wouldencompass most of the American West, down to the Rio Grande, across toCalifornia and nearly to the Canadian border. With the gradual erosion of thesepossibilities over time, Young was reduced to what is now the State of Utah, andhad to accept American sovereignty over his “kingdom.” His plans for atheocratic democracy were going by the wayside as well. The presence of UStroops in the vicinity and increasing pressure from the Americans meant that heeither had to risk an all-out war with the United States or arrive at some meansof accommodation. The dream of Joseph Smith for a country where the Mormonideals would be enshrined and practiced fully—a dream held dear by hissuccessor, Brigham Young—was coming to naught. While the Mormons would continueto support plural marriage, the blood atonement, and all the other doctrinalinnovations introduced by Smith and Young, they would eventually have tosurrender even their most fundamental beliefs to the laws and customs of theUnited States, their enemy of old. These mandated changes should have provided achallenge to the constitutional amendment giving American citizens freedom ofreligion, but even though there was a degree of editorializing about this veryissue there was no substantive dialogue about how any religion's doctrines andpractices might conflict with traditional Christian ideas and thereby cause botha legal and an ethical dislocation. While the United States was not constructedas a “Christian” nation—with so many of its founding fathers committed to theideals of the European Enlightenment, not to mention Freemasonry—the majority ofits citizens considered themselves Christians and were effectively a bufferagainst the practice of Mormonism as well as of other, more mainstream,religious denominations such as Islam, Hinduism, etc.The US Congress passed the Morrill Act in 1862 which outlawed plural marriage inthe territories and, at the same time, removed the LDS Church incorporationcharter. The Act was challenged on constitutional grounds, but was upheld in1879 in a Supreme Court decision that stated the separation of church and stateextended only to religious “belief and opinions” but not to practices. Thus, theUS government arrogated to itself the right to interfere in religious ritual andthe outward expression of religious belief. This is a case that has been testedat the local level many times since then, most recently concerning the practiceof animal sacrifice among the believers in Latin American and Caribbeanreligions such as Santeria and Voudoo.In 1890, then LDS president Willford Woodruff advised the faithful not to engagein marriages that were contrary to the law of the land. This decision did notadmit of any error in church doctrine, however, but was simply a practicalmeasure designed to reduce the tension between Utah and the LDS Church on theone hand and the US government and American public opinion on the other. Thiswas due to the attempt by the US government to seize Church property and closedown the Mormons once and for all in a law known as the Edmunds-Tucker Act of1887 which saw many Mormon leaders go underground to avoid arrest andprosecution. In order to survive—both as individuals and as a Church—the Mormonswere forced to accept legislation that went contrary to their beliefs. TheMormon manifesto banning plural marriage of 1890 was emphasized once again inanother manifesto of 1904 that banned plural marriage not only in the UnitedStates and its territories, but worldwide.With the end of (legal) plural marriage among the Mormon faithful came the endof the Second Anointing ceremony and the alchemical or “celestial” marriage thatguaranteed divinity. By 1920, this ritual had been all but abandoned. The ideathat one could attain divine status while alive, or obtain a guarantee that onewould live in heaven after death as a god or goddess, was allowed to fade fromorthodox Mormon doctrine.By the early twentieth century, Mormonism was becoming “watered-down” andbrought closer in line to American Protestantism. The emphasis on personaldivinization and a multiplicity of gods (and goddesses) was downplayed in favorof language more appropriate to a Jesus-centered faith. While the TempleEndowment ceremonies continued, they remained secret and some features ofmid-nineteenth century Mormonism—such as the “magic underwear” and the Masonicinitiations—remained in practice. Polygamy was officially discontinued, as wasthe blood atonement. Religious beliefs had buckled to political expediency. LikeJerusalem to the Babylonians before it, the Mormon kingdom had become a colonyof what they saw as an oppressive regime. Their temples were in danger ofclosing; their high priests scattered and in hiding; their assets about to beseized.But that did nothing to hinder the spectacular growth and financial success ofthe Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints far into the twentieth andtwenty-first centuries. The most enduring feature of the LDS Church and ofJoseph Smith's original visions would come to define the faith in the eyes ofits followers as well as of its detractors. The transmutation of base materialsinto fabulous wealth—most of it discovered “underground”—continued at a franticpace.Brigham Young would die in 1877, having served as head of the LDS Church forthirty-three years. Joseph Smith himself had served as its head for onlyfourteen. The next fifty years would see the character of Mormonism changeconsiderably, and when the dust settled it was obvious that if the faithfulcould not pile up treasures in the third, celestial heaven they would do so onthe earth.The era of the leveraged buyout had begun."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTTREASURE-DIGGING IN SALT LAKE CITY“If Joseph Smith were alive today,” says a prominent Mormon businessman, “hewouldn't start a religion, he would be a leverage buyout king on Wall Street.”—Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, The Mormon Murders, p. 30THE GRADUAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE LDS Church from a hermetically-oriented secretsociety to that bastion of conservative Republican politics (with the songstylings of Donny and Marie Osmond) that it is today is the result of bothexternal pressures and internal conflicts. While the early Christians wereforced underground for more than three centuries, and the Jews were hounded fromone end of the earth to the other in the twenty centuries since the destructionof the Second Temple, the Mormons surrendered in less than a hundred years andassimilated to the extent that their conscience as a spiritual movement allowed.There still were renegade groups that broke away from the main denomination andset up “fundamentalist” Mormon operations in remote areas where they couldpractice plural marriage, blood atonement, and all the other proscribedordinances and covenants that had made Mormonism a household word in thenineteenth century. Some of these groups descended into nightmares of bloodshed,child molestation, and arcane rituals. Arrests of fundamentalist Mormon leaderswith their plural wives occasionally make the evening news across America.Tabloid-style murder cases would shock and titillate readers with tales ofcrazed and introverted Mormon “fundamentalists” and their blood atonementrituals directed at religious enemies, such as the murder of Joel leBaron—thehead of the Church of the Firstborn, a Mormon sect—in 1972 ordered by the leaderof a rival Mormon sect.But by far the most chilling was the case of Jeffrey Lundgren (1950–2006), theself-proclaimed prophet and former member of the Reorganized Church of LatterDay Saints (RLDS), one of the many Mormon splinter sects. He began receivingvisions, and moved to a house next to the original Kirtland temple in Kirtland,Ohio: a spot sacred to the Mormons, Joseph Smith's first temple and the one hehad to abandon when he fled Kirtland for Nauvoo, Illinois. Lundgren had a smallgroup of devoted followers who believed him to be a prophet in the succession ofJoseph Smith, and when he ordered them to murder an entire family of five incold blood they complied. Lundgren had said that the father of thatfamily—Dennis Avery—was a false prophet and had to be sacrificed. He alsobelieved that they should seize the Kirtland Temple. After all, if Lundgren wasthe successor to Joseph Smith then the Temple was rightfully his.Lundgren was eventually captured in San Diego, California a few miles from theMexican border, was tried, convicted and executed for his crimes in 2006. Hiswife was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences for her role in themurders, and other members received various sentences depending on the degree towhich they cooperated with the authorities.The case had cast a strong light on the strange beliefs of the Mormons. Lundgrenat one point had decided he would find the fabled “Sword of Laban” mentioned inthe Book of Mormon, saying it was buried along with Joseph Smith's originalgolden plates. At another time, he demanded to have sexual relations with thewives of all his followers and those husbands who did not offer their spouses toLundgren would face the same fate as the Avery family. In a way, Jeff Lundgrenwas Joseph Smith on angel dust.There have been several famous serial killers who happened to be Mormons, mostnotably Ted Bundy and Glenn Taylor Helzer. Most recently, weird Mormon“prophets” were once again in the news with the Elizabeth Smart kidnapping case.Her captor, Brian David Mitchell, had been raised a Mormon but was eventuallyexcommunicated from the LDS Church.But the single most infamous of all the Mormon criminals—and the most importantone for this study, since it highlights all the insecurities of the present-dayLDS Church when it comes to magic, forged scriptures and treasure-digging—isMark Hofmann.THE SALAMANDER LETTERIt's possible that the core event of any religion determines its character forthe rest of its existence in ways that are unique to that faith. If we considerthe fact that the hideous torture and execution of a Jewish man in Palestine twothousand years ago is the foundational moment for Christianity, with itsassociated icon of that bleeding and tormented man nailed onto a cross, we mayunderstand the Inquisition, the Crusades, and centuries of sectarian wars.From that point of view, the association of Mormonism with forgery, the lustafter gold, and the occult seems the inevitable outcome of that foundationalmoment in the life and career of Joseph Smith: the appearance of the AngelMoroni and a box of sacred scriptures on a hill in New York in 1823 during anact of ceremonial magic designed to discover buried treasure.When the government forced Mormons to abandon plural marriage, the practice wentunderground. When the government forced Mormons to stop minting their owncurrency, other means were found to satisfy the craving. For decades during thetwentieth century the State of Utah (and Salt Lake City in particular) wasconsidered a major hub of investment fraud and Ponzi schemes. This was partlydue to the cohesive quality of the Mormon lifestyle, in which Mormonsautomatically trusted other Mormons.In 1974, the Wall Street Journal called Salt Lake City the “stock fraud center”of America. Ten years later, things had not improved. Newsweek magazine calledUtah the “stock fraud capital of the nation.” The publicity got so bad that thegovernor of the State of Utah in 1984 appointed a Securities Task Force tooversee the financial situation in an attempt to remove the stigma of fraud fromthe Mormon capital. Even investigative journalist Jack Anderson—himself aMormon—got roped into one of the schemes and lost twelve thousand dollars to aSalt Lake City swindler.In 1989, it was reported in the Ogden Standard-Examiner that more than tenthousand investors in the State of Utah had been fleeced of a total of over overtwo hundred million dollars in the previous ten years. To be fair, this was the1980s and the era of legalized theft. Leveraged buyouts were the rage, and itwas fashionable to buy up companies and loot them of their assets before firingthe employees and selling off what could not be converted into ready cash.It was also the era of the Savings and Loan crisis, in which—due to therelaxation of certain banking regulations—virtually anyone could create a “bank”under the rubric of a “savings and loan” association and obtain either a stateor even a federal charter. For an investment of as little as six milliondollars, one could charter a “thrift” or a “savings and loan” eligible for onehundred million dollars in federal insurance coverage. The potential for abuseis obvious. To simplify what is in reality an extremely complicated process, asthe president of the thrift one could make loans to one's friends or even tooneself without any intention of repaying those loans, and then when the loansdefaulted the government would cover the “losses”.While the S&L crisis is not directly related to the stock fraud situation inUtah, it demonstrates the kind of environment that was conducive to dreams ofmanipulating OPM: “other people's money.” Gordon Gecko's mantra in the film WallStreet—“Greed is good”—became the slogan for a generation of investment bankers,hedge fund managers, and stock speculators. The idea was not to actually producetangible goods, but to manipulate money in such a way that it multipliedmagically without having created anything of lasting value.To the Mormon elite this was perfectly consistent with their own doctrines.Economic success was equivalent to God's blessings, regardless of how thatsuccess was obtained. It is a peculiarly American characteristic: rather thanhaving church members devote themselves to prayer and prosyletizing alone, therewas a need for the outward trappings of religion, and these trappings had toexude the sweet smell of success. Joseph Smith needed a temple, and thereforehad to find money to build one. His followers—those who came first to Kirtlandand then to Illinois—were largely impoverished. He had difficulty in attractingwealthy individuals to the cause. While this was not a problem in the early daysof Christianity (for instance) when devotees could meet in secret, in privatehomes or, later, in cemeteries and catacombs, for Joseph Smith the requirementto appear as powerful as any other mainstream denomination was paramount. Thiswas one indication that Mormonism was not going to follow in the footsteps ofNew Testament religion but was instead modeled on the Old Testament model ofland grabs and nation- and temple-building. It was a mundane focus thatirritated many of his original flock who began to defect from Smith's brand ofMormonism—which was in constant flux with a flurry of new revelations—to theoriginal version that was based primarily on the Book of Mormon and the story ofthe innocent farmboy who discovered the golden plates. Some of his early membersand witnesses either left Mormonism altogether or joined one of the manysplinter groups that formed both during Smith's lifetime and after. Smith beganto seem as if he was suffering from delusions of grandeur and this alienatedthose who had stood by him in the early days.These delusions became official Church doctrine after his death. Brigham Youngwas as obsessed with money and with financial strength as his Prophet, so muchso that he began to see Mormonism as an economic enterprise and filled hispersonal coffers with Church funds. Later, after the Great Accommodation whenthe LDS Church was forced to surrender its most cherished principles in order tosatisfy the requirements of the American government, the one principle they didnot abandon was the earliest and most-formative, and most-characteristic of theearly Church: treasure-digging.Just as the money-seekers of early nineteenth century New York State werelargely frauds who exploited the hopes and desperation of poor farmers withpromises of buried gold and pirate booty, or the alchemical transformation ofcheap coins into gold doubloons, the modern money-seekers of Salt Lake City werecast from the same mold. They promised their investors—mostly other Mormons—hugereturns on their investments, and then disappeared into the desert night.One of the more creative entrepreneurs, however, was a young man who began hiscareer in almost the exact manner in which the pseudo-alchemists andmoney-diggers of 1820's New York began theirs: by counterfeiting coins. It wasthis initial foray into the world of bogus coins and false confidences thatwould eventually contribute to a major crisis among the leadership of the LDSChurch in the late twentieth century.Mark Hofmann was the product of a clandestine, early-twentieth-century Mormonplural marriage. His grandmother had been “married” in a secret ceremony,“behind a curtain” as the practice was called to keep the identities of both theman performing the marriage as well as the couple themselves a secret. Hismother was a product of this polygamous marriage. It was the discovery of thisfact that launched Mark on a campaign to understand what Mormonism was all aboutand what Mormonism valued. He felt tied to Mormonism on a social level, butalienated from it on historical and religious grounds. The core fact of hismother's questionable legitimacy would turn Mark cynical about the whole conceptof “legitimacy” in general.It began as the simple counterfeiting of American coins. As a high schoolstudent, Mark realized that the mint mark on a coin could determine its value.Some coins that were minted in a certain year in Denver might be worth more thana coin from the same year minted at a different location. So, using homeelectroplating equipment he would be able to change the mint mark—a tiny letterof the alphabet—from one letter to the desired one, and then sell it for muchmore than it was really worth.His success at this venture emboldened him to try other types of forgery. Hebegan to amass a collection of early Mormon memorabilia: letters, bank notesfrom the Kirtland Anti-Bank, old books and records, etc. He immersed himself inMormon history, becoming a virtual expert on the subject. At the same time, hewas in pre-med, studying to become a doctor. His medical plans, however, woulddisappear once he realized what a market there was in Mormon documents.Especially spurious ones.It was, in a sense, the perfect crime. Few people outside Mormonism would haveknown what buttons to push. Few people outside Mormonism would have had theautomatic credentials that a Mormon from a good family would have. But MarkHofmann had access to both insider knowledge, and credibility. His knowledge ofearly Mormon history was such that he could converse with Mormon historians withease. He knew the type of documents that would fetch the most money, if theyexisted. And since he had spent so much time absorbing early Mormonliterature—including diaries, letters and other written records—he couldduplicate the language and even the handwriting in such a way as to fool eventhe most experienced document expert.He began small, with documents purporting to be old records of Second Anointingceremonies or secret Temple Endowment passwords and signs. He went so far as tocreate a forged version of the Anthon document, the one in fake Egyptianhieroglyphics that Martin Harris brought to New York City to be authenticated.He even forged a letter from Martin Harris himself!He was able to pass all of these off as genuine documents and began to makeconsiderable profit in the process.Investigative journalists Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith have suggestedthat Hofmann was inspired by the novel and mini-series by Irving Wallaceentitled The Word. The story revolves around a disaffected priest who forges adocument designed to bring down the Catholic Church. If Hofmann harbored a deepantagonism against the LDS Church, then he succeeded in doing exactly what theantagonist of the Wallace novel intended, for in 1985 he landed both a virtualbombshell and a real-life bomb at the heart of the Church's leadership.The virtual bombshell was something called “the Salamander letter.” This was aletter whose contents were created entirely by Hofmann, a letter claiming to bewritten by Martin Harris concerning the experience of Joseph Smith on September22, 1823 in the Palmyra forest.Dated October 23, 1830 in Palmyra, “Harris” writes that the spirit guarding thegolden plates was in the form of a “white salamander”. This seems inocuousenough, considering all the other fantastic details of this episode in orthodoxMormon literature, except that the appearance of a salamander caused grave doubtto be cast on the official story.Mormons have always been eager to disassociate occultism from the early historyof the church. While much scholarship in recent years tends to support the ideathat Joseph Smith and his family were engaged in various pursuits that couldonly be called occult by modern standards, and that the successive visits to theHill Cumorah over the years by Smith were components of an extended occultoperation involving ritual magic, the official church approach to this materialis to discredit it as thoroughly as possible. They wish to characterize Smith'sactions in the forest as pious attempts at prayer rather than rituals culledfrom Barrett's The Magus or any one of the other popular books on magic thatwere available at the time. The “Salamander letter” seemed to throw thatposition into serious disarray, for the entire atmosphere of the document isdeeply occult. Further, the appearance of a salamander at the critical junctureof the experience would seem to indicate that dark occult forces were at workguarding the treasure rather than those of a beneficent Angel of the Lord.Salamanders have an intriguing pedigree in European occultism. They are oftenassociated with the element of fire—the other creatures being gnomes for earth,sylphs for air, and undines for water—and are the only one of the four elementalcreatures that can be identified with an actual living animal. Salamanders alsoappear frequently in alchemical literature as symbols of transformation, acentral focus of Mormon ritual and belief.But there are no salamanders in the religious literature of Christianity. It isa symbol that is at best hermetic or alchemical in nature, at worst emblematicof the darkest work of the sorcerers who were reputed to make use of reptiliansymbols and ingredients in their rites. The appearance of a shape-shiftingsalamander during Smith's first ritual in the forest was more reminiscent ofGoethe's Faust meeting Mephistopheles than it was of Jacob seeing the Ladderthat would take him to heaven, or Moses seeing the burning bush.By this time, Hofmann had already sold a number of spurious Mormon documents tothe leadership of the LDS Church. They had come to trust him as a valuablesource, someone with connections to document collectors all over America who hadaccess to these vital pieces of Mormon history. His income from these forgeriesamounted to thousands of dollars…each. By the time his spree had ended he hadforged the handwriting and signatures of more than 120 different individuals andforged nearly 450 Mormon documents. His main goal was to create the missing 116pages of the first transcription of the Book of Mormon, the pages that MartinHarris lost when he brought them to his wife. An audacious plan, it would havebeen a major coup for any forger, something on the level of the famed HitlerDiaries hoax which coincidentally was taking place the same time, in 1983, asHofmann's first Joseph Smith forgery: a letter showing that Smith was involvedin magical practices in 1825, a document that he sold to the LDS Church forfifteen thousand dollars.But the Salamander Letter was Hofmann's crowning achievement. It was alsocreated in 1983 and Hofmann made several attempts to sell it to the LDS Churchand to other collectors of Mormon memorabilia. There were doubts about itsauthenticity, however, and it is also possible that Hofmann went to thatparticular well too many times for people began asking questions about how thisyoung Mormon was able to source so many original documents that were critical toearly Mormon history.He finally managed to sell it to a financial manager, Steven F. Christensen, forforty thousand dollars. Christensen had intended to donate it to the LDS Churchafter he had it authenticated. But the doubts continued to multiply, making itdifficult for Hofmann to proceed with his forging operation. He had accumulatedserious debts due to a flamboyant lifestyle being financed by his forgeries andwas now forced to take drastic action to cover his tracks and to divertattention away from his own misdeeds.So in order to create a diversion he came up with a plan to deliver bombs tovarious individuals in the Salt Lake City area, starting with StevenChristensen.Christensen was a bishop in the LDS Church who had been the middle-man in thedonation of the Salamander Letter to the Church. He had worked for a real estateand financial services company—CFS Financial—that was going through somedifficult times. The founder of CFS was his partner, Gary Sheets, who was also abishop in the LDS Church. Sheets had taken out a life insurance policy onChristensen, which muddied the waters of what would eventually become Salt LakeCity's biggest murder investigation.For on October 15, 1985 a bomb exploded outside the sixth-floor office ofStephen Christensen in downtown Salt Lake. There had been a box propped upagainst the door to his office when he arrived around eight that morning. Theblast killed him instantly.No sooner had that bomb gone off than another bomb exploded in a suburb of thecity, this time at the home of Gary Sheets. In this case, it was Sheets's wifeKathleen who picked up the box that was lying in the driveway of their home. Shebecame the second fatality.Christensen had a meeting that morning with officials of the LDS Churchconcerning a cache of documents that were being offered for sale by MarkHofmann. The issue at hand was whether the documents were genuine and if theprice was reasonable if they were.In the case of Gary Sheets, his firm had gone under to the tune of millions ofdollars' worth of losses to more than three thousand investors. That gave policea substantial list of potential suspects. But were the two bombing cases linked?Sheets and Christensen knew each other and had been business partners. Theinsurance policy Sheets had on Christensen was worth five hundred thousanddollars. Thus Sheets had a financial motive for murdering Christensen. But therewas no equivalent policy on his wife, Kathleen. What would have been the motivebehind that attack?It might have been the Salamander Letter.Many Mormons were upset over the fact of the letter and the “proof” that JosephSmith had been little more than a sorcerer when he first came into contact withthe golden plates. There was every possibility that a disgruntled or angryreligious zealot had decided to kill those who were involved with the Letter. AsSheets and Christensen were both bishops and business partners, and asChristensen was known to be involved with the Salamander Letter, the assumptionwas that the bombs were the work of those who objected to this blatant attack ontheir faith.The next morning, however, things took a decidedly bizarre turn when a thirdbomb went off, this time in a parked car belonging to Mark Hofmann.He had been going to a meeting with church officials: the same meeting to whichChristensen had intended to go, but which had been postponed for a day so that areplacement could be found for him. The purpose of the meeting was, once again,the Hofmann documents. In this case it was a cache known as the McLellinCollection, which Hofmann claimed contained a lot of potentially explosiveinformation on the early Mormon movement. Thus, the virtual bombshell and thereal bomb met and exploded in Mark Hofmann's parked car.Hofmann survived the blast, only to find himself eventually arrested for murder.When the investigation was completed, it was understood that Hofmann had becomeworried over the impending meeting on the McLellin Collection. One of thepurposes of the bomb attacks was to delay the meeting for as long as possible,as Hofmann had not had enough time to forge the documents that would be sold asthe “collection.” The longer he postponed the meeting, the more suspicious thechurch officials would become. He could not afford to have them beginquestioning the provenance or authenticity of the documents he had already soldthem. There were already rumors that the Salamander Letter might have been afake. So, the purpose behind the bombs was to give everyone a legitimate reasonto delay inspection of the non-existent McLellin Collection and to consider thatthe attacks were the plan of Mormons who took the documents very seriously andwere willing to kill to suppress them. Unfortunately for him, the church decidedto go ahead with the meeting anyway and examine the documents.The third bomb was most likely designed to demolish his car with the “documents”in the trunk. This way, he could claim good faith in wanting to deliver theMcLellin Collection but that the Mormon fanatics had destroyed them before hehad a chance. Hofmann later claimed that the third bomb was meant for his ownsuicide, that once the church had decided to go forward with the meeting on theMcLellin Collection that there was no way out. He owed investors more thanhalf-a-million dollars; he owed the LDS Church about two hundred thousanddollars for a loan they had advanced to him for the McLellin Collection. He wasbroke, and his scheme was unraveling.He was eventually indicted on more than twenty felony counts, including the twomurders. He pled guilty, and at the time of this writing he is still in prisonand will probably never get parole.The importance of this episode to our study of Mormonism is the degree to whichthe LDS Church officials acknowledge their vulnerability to accusations ofsorcery and “black magic.” Their desperation—at the highest levels of thechurch—to cover up documents that could prove incriminating is an ironiccommentary on a history that is anything but ordinary. The Church is sensitiveto historical and archaeological research, which demonstrates that much of whatappears in the Book of Mormon cannot be “true” in any generally-accepted senseof the term. They are sensitive to accusations that Joseph Smith engaged inoccult practices and that these rituals—and not excessive piety—were the causeof the appearance of the Angel Moroni (if, in fact, such a vision did takeplace). There is a nagging suspicion among some Mormons—and a dead certaintyamong others—that the entire denomination is based on fraud. Mark Hofmann couldnot have succeeded otherwise. He would not have been able to extort—there is noother word—hundreds of thousands of dollars from Mormons for questionabledocuments had the LDS Church been secure in its beliefs and its identity as amainstream “Christian” denomination.But there was more at stake with the Salamander Letter and the McLellinCollection than simply the need to protect the Church. There was a war on,albeit a Cold War that was in its death throes, and with that Cold War there wasalso a culture war taking place in America. As the Gordon Geckos of Wall Street(and Salt Lake City) were telling the country that “greed is good”, and as thenation went on a wild and unrestrained spree of leveraged buyouts, stock fraud,and the looting of the savings and loan associations, the rest of the world wasgearing up for the impending fall of the Soviet Union and the formal defeat ofRussian-style Communism, even as Chinese unrest would lead to the TiananmenSquare massacre of 1989 and the resulting consolidation of power in the hands ofthe Central Committee that saw China become an economic powerhouse.But in the late 1980s, it would seem that America was living up to the promiseof Joseph Smith that the New Jerusalem and the New Zion would be found—not inthe Middle East of Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Mohammed, nor in the Old World ofthe Vatican, Martin Luther, or John Calvin—but in the New World, the world ofWashington, Jefferson, Adams…and Ronald Reagan. As the focus shifted from theSoviet Union it fell heavily on the United States: a country that had justbecome the world's only superpower.The LDS President who took charge of the Mormon faithful at the time of theaffair of the Salamander Letter and the Mormon Murders, and who led it duringthe destruction of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, wasEzra Taft Benson."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINEHOWARD HUGHES, BOB BENNETT AND THE MORMON SPOOKSTwo years ago when Benson was asked by an interviewer if a good Mormon could bea liberal Democrat, he replied, “I think it would be very hard if he was livingthe Gospel and understood it.”“Ezra Taft Benson: Will Mormons go political?” in The Modesto Bee, April 4, 1976I think it is much easier to be a good member of the Church and a Democrat thana good member of the Church and a Republican.”Senator Harry Reid, 2001AS THE 2012 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION heated up and Mormonism became anissue—especially for Christian evangelical voters—it was not usually remarkedthat the Democratic Senator from Nevada who was the majority leader of theSenate, Harry Reid, is himself a Mormon, thus proving that Mormons can occupyeither side of the aisle. (Indeed, the first female state senator in the historyof the United States was a Democrat and a Mormon plural wife, Martha HughesCannon of Utah, elected in 1896 after defeating her own husband for the slot.)Mormonism is a minority religion in the United States, with only about twopercent of the entire population (as of 2010) professing that faith. (Most ofits membership lives outside the country in places like Mexico and Brazil wherethe LDS Church is experiencing tremendous growth, as is evangelical Christianityin the same areas, replacing traditional Roman Catholicism.) However, Mormonpower and influence in various areas of American society is out of proportion toits size.As noted, Joseph Smith was the first Mormon to run for president of the UnitedStates and it was his agenda to become the chief executive and thenautocratically turn the country into the Mormon version of a New Zion. His dreamdid not materialize, for he was assassinated before the 1844 elections tookplace and in any event it is doubtful that he would have secured enough votes tocome in even third, much less won the presidency. But while Smith's dream didnot materialize in his lifetime, it did not die with his bullet-ridden body inCarthage, Illinois.Mormons have been involved in state and federal politics almost since thebeginning of the religion. Brigham Young—Smith's successor—became governor ofthe State of Utah. More Mormons were elected governors, senators and congressmenover the years, and in January 2012 two Mormons were running for the Republicannomination for President, John Huntsman and Mitt Romney.But while there are both Republican and Democrat Mormons, there is a strongperception that Mormonism equals cultural conservatism, which in turn impliespolitical conservatism especially in the heavily-partisan landscape of latetwentieth and early twenty-first century America. Mormons famously do not drinkalcohol or caffeinated beverages (such as coffee or tea) and do not smoke. Theyare expected to be faithful to their spouses, and the Temple garments—“Mormonunderwear”—are designed to maintain a state of asexuality except when the weareris in close proximity to his or her legal significant other. Although earlyMormon practices under Joseph Smith encouraged communal living and the sharingof wealth—i.e., a form of socialism—today's Mormons are expected to be staunchlyanti-Communist, and to the degree that Democrats are seen as “leftist” orpro-socialist by their detractors, Mormons tend to vote for Republicancandidates in national elections.Mormons initially voted Democrat in the nineteenth century, due to theiropposition to the type of conservatism represented by the Republican Party,which attacked Mormonism in 1856 because of the religion's practice of polygamy.Gradually, however, the cultural conservatism of Mormonism became allied to thepolitical conservatism represented by the GOP and recent years have seen Mormonsvoting overwhelmingly Republican. More than sixty percent of Mormons votedRepublican in the 1990s, for instance, compared to a national average of lessthan forty percent during the same time frame (the Clinton era). But exit pollsin the 2004 election showed that a whopping eighty-one percent of Mormons votedfor George W. Bush. (In the hotly-contested 2000 election, eighty-eight percentof Mormons voted for Bush.)Perhaps the most compelling case for the political conservatism of Mormonism inthe twentieth and twenty-first centuries, however, is the prominence of asubstantial number of former federal agents that comprise a security andintelligence force at the LDS Church headquarters in Salt Lake City, and whichwere very much involved in the affair of the Salamander Letter. This was aMormon tradition that was inherited and maintained by the Church's mostoutspoken political conservative, President Ezra Taft Benson.Benson (1899–1994) was the great-grandson of Ezra T. Benson who was a member ofthe Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and appointed as such by Brigham Young himselfin 1846, right at the start of the exodus from Illinois. He thus had animpeccable Mormon pedigree. He did his missionary work in England from 1921–1923before returning to the States and getting his bachelor's degree at BrighamYoung University in 1926. He became heavily involved in farmers' issues, havinghelped found a farmer's cooperative in his native Idaho.In 1943, Benson himself became a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, andthus one of the leaders of the LDS Church. In 1953, however, PresidentEisenhower selected him for the post of US Secretary of Agriculture. Benson'slong advocacy of farmers and farmer cooperatives made him an appropriate pickfor the Cabinet position but, ironically, Benson did not agree with Eisenhowerpolitically, believing that many of the President's economic policies smacked ofsocialism: a position he would maintain for the rest of his life as he flirtedwith extreme conservative groups such as the John Birch Society (his son becamea national spokesman for the group) and with extremists such as segregationistGovernor George Wallace of Alabama (Wallace had asked Benson to be his runningmate in the 1968 presidential election) and fellow Mormon and former FBI agentWillard Cleon Skousen.With Skousen (1913–2006) we arrive at an unusual destination. Skousen had beenwith the FBI in a largely administrative capacity (as opposed to being a fieldagent) from 1935–1951. A Canadian by birth to US citizens, Skousen also camefrom a solid Mormon background and did his missionary service in Great Britainin 1930, later obtaining a position with the Agricultural AdjustmentAdministration (part of FDR's New Deal program) in 1935 before joining the FBIas a clerk the same year. In 1940, he obtained his law degree and passed the barexam in Washington, DC, becoming a Special Agent with the FBI at that time. Hewould eventually go on to teach at Brigham Young University and for a whileserved as the police chief of Salt Lake City.The reasons are a little obscure as to why he was fired from that job in 1960.According to some sources, he had raided a poker game in which the mayor of SaltLake City was a player (“I'm shocked, shocked! to find that gambling is going onin here.” “Your winnings, sir.”) According to other sources, Skousen was intenton expanding the police department budget at a time of purse-tightening, aposition that put him at odds with the mayor. Whatever the reason, Skousen seemsto have become embittered against authority and after his dismissal threwhimself into creating the All-American Society: an ultra-right-wingorganization. He also was a member of the speakers' bureau of the John BirchSociety (although he never officially joined). His target was communism, and hebegan finding communists everywhere in society and government.He authored a number of books on politics and on Mormon theology. His politicalbooks are well-known today due to their promotion by television personalityGlenn Beck, himself a Mormon convert. Skousen's views seem to reflect a desireto “return” to the “original intent” of the founding fathers and a more pristineinterpretation of the Constitution. This is perfectly in line with Mormonsensibilities, which understand the Constitution as a divinely-inspireddocument, tantamount to scripture. Like most scripture, of course, theinterpretations of it can vary widely. In Joseph Smith's time, that meant thatthe Constitutional separation of church and state implied that Smith's ownantinomian practices (like polygamy) should have been permitted and protected.In the twentieth century, Skousen and his followers argued for a similarlynarrow interpretation while simultaneously warning everyone else that socialismand communism are rampant in the world today and most especially in the UnitedStates. Like Benson, with whom he enjoyed a long and cordial relationship,Skousen saw Eisenhower as a communist dupe and every president since WoodrowWilson as part of a worldwide Bolshevik conspiracy, this in spite of thelittle-known fact that Wilson had sent an army into Russia in 1918 in an attemptto defeat the Bolshevik revolution by force.Skousen's FBI credentials were often cited as evidence that what he wrote aboutwas true, or at least was informed by a long career investigating communism onbehalf of the Bureau. Internal FBI memos tell a different story, that of anagent who was assigned desk-duty for most of his career as an administrator andwho had virtually nothing to do with security matters. The FBI eventuallydistanced itself from him even as J. Edgar Hoover personally blasted the JohnBirch Society as just as dangerous to American freedoms and security as thecommunists they abhorred. Skousen's repeated insistence that he was Hoover'sassistant and that he was one of only two people at the FBI who could speak outagainst communism on behalf of the Bureau was denied in memo after FBI memo, butthat didn't stop Skousen's supporters from continuing to promote these spuriousrelationships.Ezra Taft Benson—who was powerful in the Church hierarchy long before heofficially became president of the LDS Church in 1985—admired the FBI andincluded many former agents among the personnel at the Church Security office:an organization that provided security for Church officials but which alsoconducted surveillance and intelligence operations within the Church, eventargeting prominent Mormons themselves if they appeared to deviate from Churchdoctrine or regulations. The leader of this group at the time of the SalamanderLetter affair and appointed to the post by Benson was J. Martell Bird, a careerFBI agent from 1942 to 1969 who became head of Church Security operationsworldwide from 1982 until his death in 1987.Bird had gained a certain amount of notoriety as the agent who bugged the hotelrooms of Martin Luther King in an attempt to record his dalliances withprostitutes. He also kept tabs on the anti-war movement of the 1960s, buggingthe dorms of college students he felt were part of the worldwide communistconspiracy.Bird's Church Security office was notorious among Mormons to the extent thatMark Hofmann could claim that Church Security officials had been tailing himaround Salt Lake City in the hours leading up to the explosion that wounded him:a claim that had tremendous cachet among those who were familiar with how thesecurity people operated. If the LDS Church had an “Office of the HolyInquisition” it would be Church Security.Another Mormon who ran interference for the Church at the time of the SalamanderLetter affair was Brent Ward. The US Attorney for the State of Utah during theReagan and George H.W. Bush administrations from 1981–1989, Ward was very closeto the Quorum of the Twelve inside the Church and did what he could to insulatethe Church leadership from any taint of wrongdoing in the affair of theSalamander Letter. Local law enforcement officials were frustrated in theirdealings with Ward, who stonewalled the prosecution of Mark Hofmann as long ashe could in order to keep Hofmann's dealings with the Quorum of the Twelve outof any legal proceedings, even going so far as to have some evidence transferredto FBI custody in order to keep it out of the hands of the police department.While Ward defended this move as necessary due to the advanced technology of theFBI laboratories, local law enforcement saw it as an effort to protect theChurch at the expense of the investigation. Although Ezra Benson was not yetPresident of the LDS Church at the time, he and fellow member of the FirstPresidency, Gordon Hinckley, had taken over much of the work of the institutionuntil Benson was installed upon the death of the ailing President Spencer W.Kimball in November of 1985 at the height of the Mark Hofmann-Salamander LetterAffair. (Ward would incidentally become a senior vice president of the HuntsmanCorporation, the company founded by the father of Jon Huntsman Jr., the Mormoncandidate who ran unsuccessfully against fellow Mormon Mitt Romney in the 2012Republican presidential primaries. Ward was also an outspoken critic ofpornography and led a well-publicized campaign against smut for many years.)Benson, like his colleague Skousen, was a Cold War ideologue. Communism was the“terrorism” of the 1950s through 1980s, until the fall of the Soviet Union. BothBenson and Skousen (and Martell Bird) saw Communists everywhere, at every levelof society. As noted in many other places—such as in Arthur Miller's famousplay, The Crucible—it was a mindset similar to the Catholic Church's fear ofwitchcraft during the Middle Ages, or Mormonism's own suspicion of “secretcombinations.” While Communists certainly did—and do—exist, the powers ascribedto them by true believers such as Benson and Skousen bordered on thesupernatural. It was the beginning of the phenomenon of the modern conspiracytheorist.Paranoia is a hallmark of conspiracy theory, popularly understood. It ispossible that paranoia has taken a bad rap of late for, as the New York Timesliterary critic, Anatole Broyard, once remarked, “Paranoids are the only oneswho notice anything anymore.” A healthy inclination towards suspicion isnecessary to the development of conspiracy theories; if one accepted the view ofthe world as presented by media outlets, government pamphlets, or ministers ofreligion then one could live blissfully in the present only, until such time inthe future as war breaks out, or the economy collapses, or when most needed,divine intervention fails to take place.The incredible destructive power of the atomic bomb did not manufacture paranoiaor suspicion, but it did consolidate them. Humans had taken upon themselves thepotency of gods; not since Biblical times (Sodom and Gomorrah, or the Flood) hadso much devastation been wrought—twice—on the planet. As long as thepowers-that-be were as mortal as we were, and as vulnerable to a sword point ora gunshot, we could complain about them or take arms against them; but with theadvent of atomic weaponry that suddenly was not possible. Warfare had been takenout of the hands of the individual soldier and made into an instrument ofcorporate entities. We lived on the edge of an abyss of sudden annihilation, andthis—more than any other single factor, in my view—contributed to the paranoiaabout secret societies controlling the destinies of the world. After all, no oneknew the atomic bomb existed until August of 1945. Its development had beenAmerica's best-kept secret for years. What other secrets were there? What otherpossible sources of devastation and control were under wraps?And when the Soviets began testing their own atomic weapons it seemed as if thefears of the paranoid had come true with a vengeance. There was some othercabal, some secret group, that controlled the flow of technology and which wasabove and beyond all notions of national borders and ideological boundaries. Asthe Cold War became progressively desperate, men like Robert Welch, the founderof the John Birch Society and friend of both Skousen and Benson, began to writeof the Illuminati.The problem with paranoia is that it is open-ended. There will always be onemore level of conspiracy, one further step to take to uncover the real enemy.Paranoia becomes a kind of religion, where faith in a divine ruler is replacedby fear of a satanic power. Love of God is transformed into horror of theAnti-Christ. The Bavarian Illuminati is the icon of this type of conspiracytheory, the umbrella organization for everything from the various Americanpolitical parties to the Ford Foundation, the Rockefellers, the Council onForeign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and the Bilderbergers, not tomention the Socialists, the Communists, the Fascists and the Nazis.Admittedly, the US government did not do much to ameliorate the situation. Whenit was bruited about that there were as many undercover FBI agents in the KuKlux Klan as there were genuine members, for instance, the take-away was thatthe existence or threat of radical extremism was a myth perpetrated byspin-doctors in government-sponsored think tanks. Secrecy and deception are thetwin pillars at the entrance to the Temple of Paranoia and, after all, “ifyou're not paranoid you don't have all the facts.”Joseph Smith was paranoid, as most successful leaders are. He was being huntedby a variety of government agents, the military, and local citizens who objectedto his lifestyle and his politics as well as his religion. At first he condemnedsecret societies, and then later he embraced Freemasonry. He had multiple wives,which fact he tried—with various levels of success—to keep from his legal wife,Emma Harris. He believed that the Bible as commonly understood was in error,that there were three gods present at the creation and that humans could becomegods (thus supporting the claim of the Serpent in the Garden of Eden). Heinstitutionalized secrecy in the LDS Church, particularly in the form of theEndowment ceremonies. This view of the world as being comprised of secretpowers, secret names, secret handshakes and secret knowledge, as well as secretspouses—and of the persecution of the LDS Church at the hands of the USgovernment—is a view that is reflected in the work of the intelligence agencieswho spy, and who conversely are fearful of spying. The bomb—and the associatedCold War that had as much to do with its destructive potential as it did withideology—raised these stakes to an incredible level. Men like Benson and Skousenare products of this complex environment: a world in which the political andmilitary reality of the Cold War is combined with the occultism and antinomianbeliefs and practices of the LDS Church.But Mormon politicians and Mormon theologians are the tip of an iceberg whosebulk lies below the surface of American politics. In those frigid depths anumber of loose ends in American culture are frozen together in that shadowyworld where private security services and covert intelligence operations meet.To illustrate this we can begin with the story of one of America's richest andmost controversial tycoons, the colorful hermit whose last years (and death)remain cloaked in mystery to this day, and whose fear of the government, of theatomic bomb and of atomic testing, caused him to surround himself with a Mormonbodyguard, a group of men who, it could be assumed, shared his view that thepowers-that-be were up to no good.HOWARD HUGHES.As many people know, Hughes was an inventor, a test pilot, an engineer, and amovie producer. For much of his life he was a celebrity who squired some of themost beautiful women in Hollywood. But in his last years he became a recluse,fearful of germs and afraid of spies.Like many corporate tycoons, he liked to employ former FBI agents. They have areputation for honesty and courage, and for loyalty. But unlike other tycoons,he also liked to hire Mormons.Pious Mormons famously do not drink or smoke. They cultivate a conservativelifestyle. The white shirts and dark suits of the Mormon missionaryinadvertently mimic the outfit of the traditional FBI agent. Both are respectfulto authority, and both respect the need for secrecy when required. While Hooverwas alive, it would have been difficult to tell a Mormon from a Special Agent,except perhaps for the gun and even then, not necessarily.But Mormons are answerable to God; the FBI agent is answerable to the USgovernment, even after retirement when the agent is expected to keep theBureau's secrets to himself. Hughes had a former FBI agent on staff, theinimitable Bob Maheu (1917-2008). Maheu had worked not only as an FBI agent butalso had the CIA as a client, most especially during the time when the USgovernment attempted to assassinate Fidel Castro of Cuba.But Maheu, a Democrat and close friend of both John F. Kennedy and Robert F.Kennedy, was eventually fired from the Hughes operation after more than a decadeof working for it. He lost the battle to Frank William “Bill” Gay, a Mormon whowas the man credited for having formed the “Mormon Mafia” at the Hughes empire.The Mormon Mafia was a group of six who formed an impenetrable phalanx aroundHughes, thus effectively taking control of his empire. No one could see Hughes;no one could communicate with Hughes except indirectly through the “Mafia.” Forthe head of one of America's most important defense contractors with the highestlevel security clearances, this was an absurd—if not exceedingly dangerous—stateof affairs. It meant that the Mormon bodyguard, under the command of Bill Gay,was running the Hughes empire under the umbrella organization known as the SummaCorporation (which critics cynically said stood for “Southern Utah MormonMissionary Association”).To make matters more interesting, the doctor who was supplying a constant flowof drugs to Hughes—who had become increasingly dependent on Valium, codeine, andother pharmaceuticals—was another Mormon, Dr. Wilbur Thain, Bill Gay'sbrother-in-law. As Hughes began failing and frantic phone calls were made toThain to fly down to Mexico and look after his patient, Thain postponed his tripfor several days and had to be hunted down and virtually forced onto a plane.When he finally arrived at the Hughes suite in Acapulco, he spent several hoursshredding documents. No one seems to know what documents they were, or why theyhad to be shredded, and why Thain had to do (or was allowed to do) theshredding. It might have had something to do with the over five thousandprescriptions Thain had written for Hughes over a four year period. Thain—likeAdolf Hitler's personal physician, the quack Dr. Morrell—kept his patient goingwith excessive medication, some of it injected intravenously and some of it inpill form.According to research by author Geoff Schumacher in Howard Hughes: Power,Paranoia and Palace Intrigue, Bill Gay and the Mormon Mafia had been adjustingHughes's medication in order to control his moods and therefore hisdecision-making. When Gay decided that it was time to get rid of Maheu, Hugheswas manipulated into giving the order. The Hughes estate itself, via a legalmemorandum filed in 1980 concurred in this characterization of the Mormon Mafiawhen it came to exercising control over the Old Man. Maheu himself, in aninterview given in 2007 (the year before he died) agreed that this is how thescenario played out, with the Mormons effectively taking complete control ofSumma Corp by drugging its founder.That the CIA had a special relationship with the Hughes organization during thelast years of Hughes's life when he was in the effective control of the Mormon“Mafia” can be seen in the celebrated episode of the Glomar Explorer. This was adeepsea drilling vessel that was commissioned by the CIA to serve in therecovery of a sunken Soviet submarine in 1974, a mission that was at leastpartially successful. The cover story was that the Glomar Explorer was drillingfor manganese on the ocean floor, but this legend was exploded shortly after therecovery of the sub. What is not known for certain is the degree to which HowardHughes himself was consciously aware of the project, or of his organization'sclose ties to the American intelligence community.Now, at the Princess Hotel in Acapulco, Mexico in 1976, the days of controllingHughes were coming to an end. Panicked, the Mormon guards demanded that Thaincome immediately to Mexico to revive the man whose wealth and power had ensuredtheir extravagant lifestyles and substantial bank accounts. Hughes's abhorrenceof the atomic testing taking place in the Nevada desert had driven him out ofthe country altogether; well, that and the numerous subpoenas that were floatingaround demanding his physical presence in one courtroom or another, somethingwhich the Mormon Mafia could not contemplate since as soon as Howard Hughesshowed up in his flowing hair, his long uncut fingernails, and overall filthyand unbathed condition, the jig would be, as they say, up. It could have beenargued that the mental state of Howard Hughes was a national security matter,since he controlled a vast empire of defense-related technology andmanufacturing, but that was the point: he didn't control it. Bill Gay did. AndBill Gay's brother-in-law was seconded to the project of keeping Hughes tame andgenerally stoned.One of the projects undertaken by Gay during the few years immediately beforeHughes's death was a planned break-in at the office of Republican HankGreenspun, (1909–1989), the rambunctious editor of the Las Vegas Sun. Greenspunhad been instrumental in helping Hughes buy the Desert Inn in Las Vegas and inother business dealings in the state. It was believed that Greenspun's officesafe had documents which would be incriminating to Democratic presidentialcandidate Ed Muskie, and James W. McCord—one of the Watergate“Plumbers”—admitted that plans were made to break into Greenspun's office andsteal the documents for later use by then President Richard Nixon in his 1972campaign for re-election. However, many others believe that these documents werein actuality evidence of business dealings between Howard Hughes and BebeRebozo, Richard Nixon's longtime friend and “fixer,” which, if revealed, wouldhurt Nixon's re-election chances. Regardless, the documents from Greenspun'ssafe never saw the light of day as the crusading editor managed to squash anattempt by the Watergate committee chaired by Sam Ervin to obtain them for theirinvestigation into criminal wrongdoing by Nixon and the Plumbers.But the Mormon connection to Watergate went even further than this. Mormonpolitician Robert Bennett had a role to play that was more deeply on the covertside of the scandal and which involved some of the most famous players in theaffair, including former CIA Bay of Pigs action officer and Watergate Plumber E.Howard Hunt.Robert Bennett (born in 1933) is the son of the late Senator Wallace FosterBennett (1898–1993), the head of a family with an excellent Mormon pedigree, asthe Bennetts were related by marriage to Heber J. Grant, the seventh presidentof the LDS Church and one of its most famous leaders. Robert Bennett served as aMormon chaplain with the Utah Army National Guard for twelve years beforebecoming the president and owner of the Robert Mullen Company in 1971.The Robert Mullen Company was a public relations firm that had been founded in1952 by Robert R. Mullen, a press secretary for Dwight Eisenhower in the 1952presidential campaign. Mullen did a lot of work for the LDS Church in the publicrelations arena, including introducing the Mormon Tabernacle Choir to audiencesin Europe and writing a pro-Mormon propaganda book, The Latter-day Saints: TheMormons Yesterday and Today. Mullen also worked for the Nixon-Agnew presidentialcampaign in 1968 and, as the Howard Baker Watergate Report affirmed (and wasreported in Newsweek in 1974), Mullen's company had been providing cover for CIAemployees from 1959 to 1972. When Mullen retired from the firm his former Nixoncampaign employee Bennett took it over and brought Hughes's Summa Corporation inas one of its clients. This was at the same time that E. Howard Hunt became anemployee of Mullen, using the PR firm as a cover for his other activities.That Mullen was used as a CIA front is common knowledge today, due to therevelations made during the Watergate investigations. The author had beenpersonally acquainted with the agent—a colleague of Hunt—who was sent toSingapore under Mullen cover, and who debriefed Chinese defectors there. (Inrecent years, I tried to obtain incorporation information from the SingaporeanCompanies House on the Mullen Company operation in that country, but was metwith stiff resistance even though the operation closed down about thirty-fiveyears ago.)That there was close cooperation between the Mullen Company and the CIA as wellas the LDS Church has been well-documented. Bennett's administration of thecompany came at a time when Cold War tensions were high, the Vietnam War wasstill in full swing, and the Glomar Explorer operation was up and running. TheHughes-Mormon-CIA nexus was as tight as ever. It remains a matter for laterhistorians to decide whether or not the Hughes empire would have been asamenable to CIA operations as it was if the “Mormon Mafia” was not the de factoruling elite of the corporation. With Bennett in charge of the Mullen frontcompany in Washington DC, and Bill Gay in charge in Las Vegas with SummaCorporation, we have a fascinating glimpse into the way the world worked in the1970s. Mormons, because of their sobriety, cultural and political conservatism,and respect for authority, became entrusted with some of the deepest secrets ofthe American intelligence community. Some also enabled the Watergate Plumbers intheir mission of playing “dirty tricks” on their political opponents. One ofthese—a student from Brigham Young University, Thomas Gregory—worked directlywith E. Howard Hunt, Gordon Liddy and the other Plumbers in collectinginformation from the Muskie and McGovern campaigns while posing as a volunteer.This young man quit the Plumbers only days before the famous Watergate break-inand thus managed not to become embroiled in that scandal. In fact, as the SenateWatergate Report demonstrates, the actual planning of the Watergate break-intook place at the Mullen Company offices at 1700 Pennsylvania Avenue, a locationconveniently across the street from Nixon's Committee to Re-Elect the President(otherwise known as CREEP) at 1701 Pennsylvania Avenue where Watergateco-defendant, G. Gordon Liddy, had his office.Further, as the Watergate documentation demonstrates, Robert Bennett himself hada CIA case officer to whom he reported, thus showing that the Mullen Company wasa creature of the Agency as well as of the Hughes empire, and was the propagandaarm of the LDS Church from whom Hunt would source suitable covert operatives inhis quest to undermine the democratic process.To be sure, not all Mormons were, or are, fanatic anti-communists, or spies, oreven registered Republicans. There have been, and continue to be, many Mormonswho are members of the Democratic Party (such as Sen. Harry Reid) and many whohave been staunch supporters of ethical political activism on both sides of theaisle. There have been many prominent Mormon Republicans who were and aremoderates, such as Michigan Governor George Romney (1907–1995), the father ofMitt Romney, who ran an unsuccessful campaign for the presidential nomination in1968 and who wound up as Nixon's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.7[part0015.html#fn7] A fair politician and former head of American Motors whodisagreed with Nixon on many issues—from the Vietnam War to housing for thepoor—he left the administration at the start of Nixon's second term and wentinto private life. His cousin Marion Romney (1897–1988) was also born in Mexicoand eventually became a member of the First Presidency of the LDS Churchalongside Ezra Taft Benson and Gordon Hinkley.The close cooperation of important church personalities such as Bill Gay, RobertBennett and others with the Hughes empire, the CIA, and the Watergate affair,indicates that a certain mindset existed within the Mormon community that sawthe end justifying the means. It also implies a close cooperation that existedbetween the LDS Church and American intelligence operations, at least during theheady days of the Cold War if not later. Robert Bennett provided cover for CIAagents E. Howard Hunt and Arthur Hochberg, and others whose names and functionswe do not know and probably will never know. Hunt interfaced with the Hughesempire via Bennett on several projects at the time when the Hughes-CIAcooperation was at its height…at a time when Hughes himself was beingmanipulated by the so-called “Mormon Mafia.”But that was then. This is now.Robert C. Gay—the son of Bill Gay, Hughes executive and leader of the “MormonMafia”—is not a well-known name to many Americans, but he is currently CEO andco-founder of Huntsman Gay Global Capital, a private equity firm with offices inCalifornia, Florida, Massachusetts and Utah. According to the Huntsman Gaywebsite, “Huntsman Gay Global Capital is a $1.1 billion private equity fundfocusing on leveraged buyout, recapitalizations and growth equity transactionsin the middle market.” It numbers among its directors Jon Huntsman (father ofJon Huntsman Jr., the erstwhile GOP candidate for president) as well as GregoryBenson, who previously had worked for a company known as Bain Capital. Prior toHuntsman Gay, however, Robert Gay was managing director for Bain Capital,working alongside his friend and colleague Mitt Romney for sixteen years.Business journalists have targeted Bain Capital as an example of the type ofleveraged buyout strategy that characterized the 1980s and 1990s. In an articleby Michael Barbaro in the New York Times of November 12, 2011 a test case citedis that of Dade International, a medical device manufacturer located inIllinois. Romney, who created Bain Capital, managed to double DadeInternational's sales. At the same time, however, Bain also quadrupled its debt.Nearly 1,700 employees lost their jobs by the time Bain was finished with thecompany and it filed for bankruptcy protection.This is how it worked: in 1994 Bain invested in Dade by borrowing $450 millionfrom investors, including Goldman Sachs, and only investing $30 million of itsown funds to buy the company. This strategy limited Bain's own risk and there isnothing illegal or unethical about that. Bain would then force the company tomake acquisitions, buying up competitors left and right. At first, it seemed tobe working.Dade's annual sales doubled; its assets tripled…and its debt nearly tripled, toa whopping $816 million by 1998 from $298 million in 1994.Romney's strategy was to force Dade to buy back its shares in Bain Capital,which it could do only by borrowing more money. Bain Capital and its investorsgot $353 million from the deal, while some Dade executives walked away with $55million. But Dade began cutting more jobs, owing creditors almost $2 billion andfinally filing for bankruptcy in 2002.However, after it emerged from bankruptcy protection Dade found itself bought bythe German firm Siemens for $7 billion in 2007. While those who were executivesat Dade thought that, overall, the experience with Bain Capital had beenpositive notwithstanding the bankruptcy, the actual employees of Dade thoughtotherwise, of course.I bring this up not to besmirch either Bain Capital or Mitt Romney. As someonewho has worked for multinational corporations and as an executive with twoAmerican manufacturers, I am not naive in the way the world works. While I don'tagree with the leveraged buyout technique of using companies as cash cows or ATMmachines at the expense of their employees, I realize that it is neverthelesslegal and part of doing business worldwide.Which, admittedly, may be part of the problem.The point I am trying to make is somewhat different. Joseph Smith began hiscareer as someone trying to locate buried treasure. This treasure was buriedeither by Native Americans, or by pirates, or by some other individuals.Regardless, it still was “other people's money.” Whether it had been gained bypiracy, or buried by people who had earned it honestly, Smith's focus—and thefocus of all those who were similarly engaged in treasure-digging pursuits atthe time—was to discover hidden wealth. Wealth that had been created by someoneelse.Smith's family was suffering through difficult economic times. Wealth was adream, a seduction. There seemed to be no way to make money “the old-fashionedway”—i.e., to earn it—so the only alternative was to steal, or to find someoneelse's lost and abandoned earnings. I am not blaming the seventeen-year-oldSmith for doing his best with bell, book and candle to locate money or valuablesthat would rescue his family from poverty. But the attitude that is nurturedthrough this occupation is questionable, at best. Bain Capital saw in Dade—andin more than one hundred other companies—a source of buried treasure. Thetechniques they used implied a higher respect for lucre than for labor. This isnot a problem that is unique to the financial “wizards”—I use the termadvisedly!—or to Mormons, but to an American preoccupation with material wealththat may be due more to some kind of Calvinism run amok than to capitalism theway it is normally understood, or practiced. But with Bain Capital in the1990s—as with Salt Lake City generally in the 1980s—the Mormon focus onobtaining wealth through almost “magical” means was everywhere in evidence.It was not for nothing that Joseph Smith was called “the first leveraged buyoutking”.That being said, what are the implications for a “Mormon presidency”?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------7 [part0015.html#ft7] George Romney was born in the state of Chihuahua inMexico, to American parents, and this fact has given rise to statements by MittRomney that he is the “son of Mexican immigrants.” The Mormon family was forcedto leave Mexico at the start of the 1910 Revolution whose targets includedMormon colonies."},{"pageContent":"IMPLICATIONS"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENIMPLICATIONSBelieving with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & hisGod, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that thelegitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, Icontemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people whichdeclared that their legislature should “make no law respecting an establishmentof religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof”, thus building a wall ofseparation between Church & State.Thomas Jefferson, 1802I believe in an America where the separation of church and state isabsolute—where no Catholic prelate would tell the President (should he beCatholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishoners forwhom to vote—where no church or church school is granted any public funds orpolitical preference—and where no man is denied public office merely because hisreligion differs from the President who might appoint him or the people whomight elect him. I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic,Protestant nor Jewish—where no public official either requests or acceptsinstructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches orany other ecclesiastical source—where no religious body seeks to impose its willdirectly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of itsofficials—and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against onechurch is treated as an act against all.John F. Kennedy, 1960I have written about Mormonism previously and have been fascinated by thereligion for reasons having nothing to do with politics. The history of the LDSChurch and most especially of its founder and prophet, Joseph Smith Jr., is atreasure-trove of occultism, hermetic beliefs, early Americana, and the OldWest. It is, as Mitt Romney has declared, an “American religion”, as “Americanas apple pie.” You will get no objection to that from me.But America is a complex country with a complicated and deeply-textured history.The plight of those fleeing religious persecution in Europe became mixed withthe inhuman crime of slavery. Religious sectarianism and political rivalrybecame the breeding ground for witchcraft accusations and charges of heresy. Thepersecution of the Native American population took place at the same time thatAmerica was fighting wars of independence, conquest, and the Civil War. Thenation has gone through many periods of economic boom and bust, manydepressions, much civil unrest.America has a Constitution of which it rightfully can be proud, yet there is noagreement as to what it really means. This is particularly the case when itcomes to the famous “separation of church and state,” a phrase that is foundnowhere in the Constitution itself but which finds its expression in the FirstAmendment to the Constitution which states “Congress shall make no lawrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercisethereof.”This “wall of separation” as Jefferson called it is a purely legal concept.Obviously, government officials, employees and politicians running for officehave religious convictions—or lack of convictions—that they either express orconceal. It is the degree to which these convictions may influence politicalaction that concerns us here. The degree to which a religious conviction issincerely held is also a measure of a politician's character.America has often been called a “Christian country,” but that is mostly wishfulthinking on behalf of Christians. The Founders were nominally Christian for themost part, but there can be no denying that Enlightenment ideals were part ofthe motivation for the separation of America and England in the eighteenthcentury. As most of us are aware, many of the Founders were Freemasons, men whobelieved in a One God and yet who were not sectarian in their outlook but ratherrespected all religions. If America was intended to be a Christian country thatconcept would have been enshrined in the Constitution. It was not. Instead, theFirst Amendment makes it clear that there would be no attempt by the USgovernment to impose any specific religious belief on the people.That statement would be sorely tested many times over the course of Americanhistory. One such test was the practice of polygamy. The government decided thatpolygamy was illegal and did not have the protection of the Constitutionregardless of whether or not it impacted the religious beliefs of the Mormons.The view was that the freedom of religion enshrined in the Constitution referredto beliefs and not to actions, i.e., that the government could not tell you whatto believe but it could tell you how to behave. This is an echo of the statementby Jefferson, above, in a letter to a Baptist community in Danbury, Connecticut,that the “legitimate powers of government reach actions only…”.Thus, one can believe in polygamy but not practice it.The Great Accommodation—as it was called—by the LDS Church to accept this rulingand outlaw polygamy among its followers was a step towards acknowledging thesupremacy of the American Constitution over the revelations of the prophet,Joseph Smith. To be sure, Mormons believe that the Constitution is a kind ofscripture and hold it in deep reverence. But what this has done is create a kindof religious and political paradox: it has made of Mormonism a truly “American”faith, more than any other. Does this mean that spiritual or religiousconvictions are identical to political beliefs, at least among the Mormons?Jack Kennedy, when running for president in 1960, was forced to defend hismembership in the Roman Catholic Church at a time when opponents believed thathaving a Catholic president meant that the Pope would have control overAmerica's government. Unique among major religions, Mormonism can claim thatthere is no foreign power that has any influence whatsoever over itsorganization, its doctrine, or its people. There is no foreign Pope, noArchbishop of Canterbury, no Grand Mufti to contend with; no Rome, no Jerusalem,no Mecca. While it acknowledges the importance of the King James Bible, it hasits own scripture—the Book of Mormon—written in America and discovered by anAmerican, which is concerned with (an admittedly spurious) American history. Ithas its own Vatican, in Salt Lake City. It has its own priesthood, and its ownAmerican Prophet.And it has accepted the American Constitution as over-ruling its revelations.This begs us to ask the question which is at the heart of the First Amendmentstatement concerning government and religion, but which is a question that hasnever been asked (to my knowledge). If government “can make no law respecting anestablishment of religion”, what if a religion makes a law respecting anestablishment of government? What if a religion—any religion—relinquishes itsbeliefs and practices to be more in line with government beliefs and practices?This may sound absurd, but it is exactly what happened with the LDS Church, andthe implications are serious.While the US government did not create a religion, a religion has aligned itselfwith what it perceives to be government doctrine and actions to the extent thatone could be forgiven for wondering if such a church can be an extension ofgovernment policy. And since we have an adversarial political situation in theUnited States, which gets more partisan by the day, one then is forced to wonderif such a church will then take sides with what it believes to be the “truegovernment.”While rank and file Mormons cover the entire spectrum of American politicalmembership—and while many previous Mormon leaders have been outspoken on bothsides of the Congressional aisle as well as at Church headquarters—thepolarization that has taken place in America since the Cold War years makes uswonder if the LDS Church (or a powerful cabal within the Church) has a politicalagenda. That there was such a cabal and such an agenda in the 1970s and 1980s isobvious from the public record. Mormons as Mormons were significant players atthe highest levels of the Nixon administration, for instance, with theinvolvement of the Mullen Company and Robert Bennett in the Watergate affair.And the voting statistics for Mormons in the past three or four election cyclesdemonstrates their overwhelming support for GOP candidates, outvoting evenevangelical Christians in the election, for instance, of George W. Bush.The causus belli of the Missouri War against the Mormons began with theperception that Mormons voted as a bloc. Missourians attempted to preventMormons by force from entering the voting booth due to this perception. While itmay be a myth that the entire membership of any religion votes as a bloc, thereis sufficient evidence to show that religion does matter when it comes toelections. It was an issue for Jack Kennedy; and when he successfully answeredthe Catholic question and squeaked to a narrow victory over Richard Nixon in1960, he was charged instead with being “soft on Communism” and a traitor to thecountry. It was an issue for George W. Bush, who famously claimed that he wasanswering a divine call to become president. It became an issue for BarackObama, who many claimed was either a closet Muslim or allied with anti-Americansentiments voiced by the Protestant minister Rev. Wright.Religion may once again become an issue in the 2012 election, and in succeedingelections. If Mitt Romney becomes the Republican nominee, Mormonism will becomean issue. If Rick Santorum had become the nominee, Roman Catholicism would haveonce again become an issue. As of this writing, it appears that evangelicalChristians—who turned out strongly for Bush in 2000—are supporting Santorum, theCatholic, against Romney. This is truly a strange state of affairs, for manyevangelicals have considered Roman Catholicism—“Popery”—to be one step removedfrom Satanism. But at least Roman Catholics are demonstrably Christian. The samecannot be said—by evangelical Christians—for Mormonism.The LDS Church has tried, with varying degrees of success, to distance itselffrom some of the more contentious views of its founders and to portray itself asmainstream Christian. As anyone who has read the preceding chapters will swiftlyrealize, Joseph Smith's form of Christianity was closer to Gnosticism than theGospels. There are many points of departure between Mormonism and Christianity,from a plurality of gods to the divinization of human beings, to post-mortembaptisms of unwitting dead people, to secret Temple ceremonies involvingpasswords and handshakes, to the famous “Mormon underwear”. While polygamy hasbeen officially prohibited by the LDS Church, it persists underground and in thepopular culture as television series such as HBO's Big Love demonstrate.What, then, are the implications for a Mormon presidency?On social issues, the LDS Church has come out against gay marriage, forinstance. It resisted allowing African-Americans full membership until the latetwentieth century, due to the belief that they had been “cursed” by their blackskin. The LDS Church has been culturally conservative for nearly one hundredyears, and reflects many of the mores of what is usually—disparagingly—called“middle America,” with all of the (generally unfair) allegations of racism,sexism, and homophobia that the term implies. These are the characteristics thatare generally known.What is not a matter of public discourse, however, are the secret beliefs andpractices that may influence a candidate's actions. When George W. Bush and JohnKerry were asked, for instance, about their membership in Skull & Bones—thefamous secret society with its headquarters at Yale University—neither gentlemanfelt it was incumbent upon them to respond to the question since they had takenoaths of secrecy to the Order. For a candidate for President of the UnitedStates, this evasion should be unacceptable. This was not a First Amendmentissue, for Skull & Bones is not a religion, nor were beliefs being questioned,only actions. But the questions remained unanswered.There are also secret ceremonies at the Temple. Polygamy, while prohibited bythe LDS Church, is still a Church doctrine. So is exaltation, or divinization.Celestial marriage. Baptism of the dead. The maintenance of huge genealogicaland now genetic databases at the Temple in Salt Lake City. There has been aninvasion of privacy by the LDS Church in a very unusual and unsettling way; itis entirely possible that my own ancestors have been baptized by proxy in someobscure rite in some distant Temple and while I may not believe in the conceptof proxy baptism, nor believe that the Mormons are actually capable of causingspiritual changes to occur in the souls of dead people, I am nonethelessdisturbed by the calm insistence of a powerful and wealthy denomination thatthey have the right to do so, and to people who are genetically andgenealogically connected to me.And, one day, long after I have shuffled off this mortal coil, there may be somewell-meaning but otherwise clueless Mormon who will stand in for my soul andpronounce me baptized in this most American of American religions.Will a Mormon president change America in any appreciable way? It is hard toimagine that this would be the case, but that may be the secret to Mormonsuccess in business as well as in politics. The Church has had to disguiseitself for so long—to conceal its strange and striking doctrines from all butthe most devoted scholars and paranoid conspiracy theorists—that dissembling hasbecome second-nature. They wear the secrets of their religion the way they weartheir Temple garments: under their street clothes, invisible to the naked eye,and never to be removed. Mormons in general benefit by being considered boringand traditional, when they are anything but.Scientology had its origins in the same arcane beliefs and practices asMormonism. L. Ron Hubbard began his “religious” career as a partner of AleisterCrowley-devotee Jack Parsons. Together, these two magicians used the rituals setdown by the same sorcerers as those who inspired Joseph Smith: Agrippa, Solomon,Moses, Francis Barrett. Hubbard, like Smith, saw angels in the Americanwilderness, summoned by ceremonial magic. Scientology, too, is aquintessentially “American” religion, dedicated to the pursuit of wealth andpolitical power.But while Mormonism is boring and traditional, Scientology is weird andcontroversial. One could say that Scientology may be closer to the antinomianpractices of magic than Mormonism seems to be, but that might be a serious errorof judgment.Did Joseph Smith really see golden plates on which were written the scripturesof his faith? Before we answer that question, we have to ask another one.Did Moses really see God write the Ten Commandments on stone tablets? Did Moseseven really exist as an identifiable human being?Or did Jesus really rise from the tomb?Wasn't Joseph Smith a real prophet in the line of Moses, if by prophet we meansomeone who created a religion and fabricated a scripture in order to shout downthe pragmatists, the realists, the atheists, and those who had lost their faithalong with their wealth and status? Wasn't Joseph Smith, in trying to givehimself and his impoverished family some hope, some belief in a better future,also encouraging others to see America as he saw it: a wild land populated bythe descendants of the Lost Tribes, a New Zion for the world to replace the onelost in Palestine? A land of tremendous promise and potential?If a Mormon becomes president, will he sincerely believe in Mormonism? And, ifso—or if not—would that be a good thing or a disaster for America?That would depend, of course, on your own understanding of what it means to bean American. Which is based, of course, on what you believe America to be. Andon how you view your own religion, and on how important its core beliefs—itscredo—is to you and your life.And how you see your religion and the American experiment working together, orworking apart.The question of a Mormon presidency is oddly removed from Republican or Democratallegiances. As we have noted, Mormons can be found in both political camps likemembers of Skull & Bones, or Freemasons. Thus it is not the purpose of this bookto attack Mormonism, but to reveal it…just the way I have written aboutFreemasons and secret societies in my other works. At the present time, however,it would appear that mainstream Mormonism and the GOP have become somewhatallied, especially in the prominence given to both Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsmanin the early primary battles of 2011 and 2012. So the question we really have toask is what implications are there for a Mormon Republican president?I wish I could answer that question with unequivocal statements about how thefaith of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young would color the decisions of the chiefexecutive of the United States. However, who could have predicted that a Quakerpresident would extend the war in Vietnam by another five years after hisinitial election? Predicting the behavior of any person based on their religionis a perilous course to take. Nixon was not the best of Quakers. Anyone whovoted for him on the basis of his religion was making a serious mistake. It iscertain that anyone voting for—or against—Mitt Romney or any other Mormoncandidate is making the same mistake. But if the atmosphere created by JosephSmith's focus on wealth, political power, and the godly exaltation of humanbeings is any indication of how a potential Mormon candidate would act, or whathis or her beliefs may be, then a Mormon presidency will at least beentertaining. A president who believes himself to be on the road to godhood, andwho believes that the accumulation of wealth is a sign of divine approval, mayreflect not only the presumed apotheosis of a man, but the apotheosis ofAmerica, and of all that Americans believe about themselves.It has often been said that America gets the presidents it deserves.Somebody say “Amen.”"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIXFAMOUS MORMONSIn order to demonstrate the influence that the LDS Church has had—directly orindirectly through its membership—it was felt appropriate to append here a listof Mormons who were influential in American politics and culture in the pastfifty years or so. As can be seen, Mormons can be found on either side of theCongressional aisle, although in the years since the fall of the Soviet Unionthere have been a disproportionate number of Mormon conservatives who voteoverwhelmingly for GOP candidates. In any event, the following roll call iseducational and reveals that any simplistic, “us versus them” equation when itcomes to understanding Mormon politics is doomed to fail.MORMON DYNASTIESThe most famous of the Mormon political dynasties in the past fifty years hasbeen the Romney clan. George Romney ran for the GOP presidential nomination in1968, and in 2012 Mitt Romney is running for the same. Romneys have been closeto the LDS First Presidency for many years, with Marion Romney holding an elderposition within the presidency at the time of the Salamander Letter affair. TheRomneys trace their lineage to Mormon missionaries who went to Mexico in thelate nineteenth century and who had to flee across the border to the UnitedStates at the time of the 1910 Mexican Revolution. The Romneys have been largelyRepublican, but rarely conservative. George Romney was considered too moderate,and some of the same charges have been leveled against Mitt Romney.But Mormon dynasties are not limited to Republicans. One of the most famous ofthe Democratic Mormon dynasties is that of the Udalls. Stewart Udall wasPresident Kennedy's Secretary of the Interior; later, Morris “Mo” Udall ran forthe Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, where he was defeated by JimmyCarter. His son Mark Udall is the US Senator from Colorado, and Mo Udall'snephew Tom Udall is the US Senator from the State of New Mexico. To make mattersmore interesting, the Udalls are cousins of former GOP Senator Gordon H. Smithof Oregon, and current (2012) GOP US Senator from Utah, Mike Lee, who has beenendorsed by the Tea Party and who replaced Hughes-linked and Mullen Companyowner Bob Bennett as Senator.MORMON WOMENThere have been influential women among the political Mormons, as well.Republican Paula Hawkins (1927–2009) was the first—and so far only—female USSenator who was also a member of the LDS Church. She was also the first womanelected to the US Senate (from Florida, in 1980) without having been the wife ordaughter of a politician.Then there is Angela “Bay” Buchanan. This sister of conservative lightning-rodPat Buchanan—former Nixon speechwriter and a conservative somewhere to the rightof Robert Welch—converted to Mormonism, and was the campaign manager for PatBuchanan's two runs for the GOP presidential nomination in 1992 and 1996.OTHER FAMOUS MORMONSWe cannot forget the senior US Senator of Utah, Orrin Hatch, who wieldstremendous power on Capitol Hill as ranking member of both the Senate JudiciaryCommittee and the Senate Finance Committee.And the Huntsmans have already been mentioned, but what has not been discussedis the philanthropic profile of Jon Huntsman Sr., once named as one of Fortunemagazine's twenty-five most generous Americans, who built a $100 million cancerinstitute at the University of Utah among his other generous endowments. Notalone among Mormon businessmen, Huntsman is joined by J.W. “Bill” Marriott Jr.,the head of the Marriott hotel chain, as well as many other businesses.Incidentally, there have been Mormons at the head of various iconic Americanenterprises throughout the last thirty years, such as Black & Decker, Ryder, andIomega. In addition, Stephen R. Covey—the author of the best-selling The SevenHabits of Highly Effective People—is a Mormon who publically has opposedsame-sex marriage. Other Mormon authors include science-fiction author OrsonScott Card and, of course, Jack Anderson.Among the spooky Mormons—alongside Robert Bennett and Bill Gay—we find BrentScowcroft, who was National Security Advisor to the Gerry Ford administration in1975, and who also served in similar—intelligence-linked—capacities withPresidents George H.W. Bush (National Security Advisor) and George W. Bush(Chairman of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board).This brief summary is only an indication of the extent to which Mormons havebeen visible and influential in American political and cultural life. While itmay be difficult to claim with any great degree of certainty the overall agendaof the LDS Church when it comes to America's political future, it seems safe tosay that Mormons will continue to exert an influence—both overt and covert—overAmerican life and experience, and that it will not deviate overmuch from thedoctrines contained in the Book of Mormon and in the occult and hermeticrevelations of Joseph Smith, Jr. The cultural conservatism with which Mormonsseem to be associated—their almost boring conformity, blandness, and lack ofpersonal idiosyncracy—may be only a protective coloration, designed to deflectattention away from a history of proxy baptisms, secret endowments, pluralmarriage, and human divinization that would make them more interesting. Afterall, as author William Henry has pointed out in his books and videotapes, thecentral feature of the US Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. is a painting ofGeorge Washington on the Capitol dome. It is called the “Apotheosis ofWashington” and thus insists that this talismanic American and ultimate FoundingFather, military leader, political leader and Freemason, had achieved his own“exaltation.” Is that, then, the American Way? Is that what we really believe,not only as Mormons—members of that quintessential American faith—but asAmerican citizens in general?In fact, this may be the real root of what has been called “Americanexceptionalism” and if it is, what does that mean for our future as a country?If we are alone among nations in this belief of human perfectibility—the goal,after all, of the Bavarian Illuminati who were first called“Perfectibilists”—then it stands to reason we will always endure the hostilityof those nations and peoples and faiths for which the notion of humandivinization—of Mormon “exaltation”—is anathema. Is the “clash of civilizations”to be waged between those who believe in a kind of individually-attainedspiritual evolution and those who believe that humans can only reach their fullpotential by surrendering their souls, as a community, to an unseen God?Mormons believe that they can attain exaltation only through submission to thedoctrines and covenants of their faith, thus bridging the gap between individualattainment and organized faith. It is a dangerous bridge to cross, for the pathis narrow and unforgiving. Like that between individual freedom, on the onehand, and responsibility to the community on the other. It is awork-in-progress, like that of America itself.In any case, it will be fun and informative to watch the ongoing tug of warbetween Mormon doctrines and secrecy, and the goal of American transparency andthe associated abridgement of individual freedoms and privacy. It is not only apolitical struggle, begun all those years ago with Joseph Smith's creation ofhis own army, his own currency, and his own laws and continuing through BrighamYoung's stewardship of the LDS Church and the Great Accommodation, but also acultural one. This tension between who we are as Americans and who we are asindividuals will continue to define us as a nation. And the struggle betweenreligion and politics—between the freedom of religious expression and action,and the freedom of political belief and action—will be the stage on which thisdramatic, cosmological drama will be enacted. There are deeper concepts at workhere, concepts that represent the unconscious material of the American mind and,by extension, of human experience in general. Religion and politics. God andpresidents. Exaltation and redemption.Spirituality versus materialism. Angels versus sorcerers.Go back to your seats. The curtain has just been raised on the second act."},{"pageContent":"RECOMMENDED READINGFor those who desire to examine the sources for themselves, there are a numberof excellent volumes that go into much further detail than have I in this book.The following is a suggestive and not exhaustive list of the sources I have usedto research the subject of Mormonism. For ease of reference, I have divided thesources by their respective chapters.CHAPTER ONEThe life of Joseph Smith, Jr. can be found in several biographies, most notableamong them Fawn Brodie's No Man Knows My History. That the biography is not aworshipful one can be judged by the sneering reaction of official Mormondom inan article “debunking” Ms. Brodie, entitled No Ma'am, That's Not History. You bethe judge.As for the occult environment in upstate New York at the time the Book of Mormonwas received and translated, pride of place must go to D. Michael Quinn'sencyclopedic Early Mormonism and the Magic World View. Originally written at thetime the Salamander Letter was thought to be genuine, it neverthelessexhaustively examines the occult milieu of the time and place of the Book ofMormon and is an excellent guide to the subject. Quinn was eventuallyexcommunicated from the LDS Church, and this book is perhaps the major reason.Also see Richard Godbeer's The Devil's Dominion: Magic and Religion in Early NewEngland, as well as the excellent work by John L. Brooke, The Refiner's Fire:The making of Mormon Cosmology. 1644–1844. These works have a lot to say notonly about Mormonism, but about America's spiritual heritage in the occult andhermetic works of England and the Continent. These may be read alongside JonButler's Awash in a Sea of Faith: Christianizing the American People.CHAPTER TWOMany of the books cited for Chapter One [part0005.html] will be useful as wellfor Chapter Two [part0006.html], with the possibleaddition of The Mormon Murders by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith. Alsothis story is told in more detail in Chapter Eight [part0014.html], the MarkHofmann scandal is mentioned here first.CHAPTER THREEA good source for some of the controversy surrounding the “origins” of theNative American population is America B.C. by Barry Fell. While not accepted bymost mainstream academics, it nevertheless provides a good overview of thethemes introduced by the diffusionists who claim that people from Europe andNorth Africa visited the east coast of the United States long before Columbusand made their way inland at least as far as the Midwest if not the Arizona andNew Mexico.CHAPTER FOURObviously the best source for the Book of Mormon is the Book of Mormon itself.Copies can be found in any library, bookstore, and second-hand bookstore ordirectly from the LDS Church itself (usually for free). Another resource is theChurch Handbook of Instructions, published by the LDS Church in 2006, andavailable online. The Handbook discusses many of the issues covered in thisbook, including the Endowment ceremonies and “Temple work.”CHAPTER FIVEHistories of the early years of Mormonism can be found in many places, includingon the LDS Church website. Fawn Brodie's biography of Smith, mentioned above, isanother good place to start. A great online resource is www.sidneyrigdon.com[http://www.sidneyrigdon.com] which boasts a huge collection of newspaperarticles from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries on Mormonism and relatedsubjects.CHAPTER SIXFor background on the alchemical ideas inherent in Mormonism, interested readersmay consult my own Stairway to Heaven as well as The Secret Temple, which alsobriefly discusses Mormonism. My Sinister Forces, volume one, discusses JosephSmith and Mormonism as well, and the other volumes in the series examine therole religious and occult ideas have had on American politics.Also, William Henry has written about apotheosis (the fancy Greek word for“divinization”) in a book on the US Capitol Building, Freedom's Gate: The LostSymbols in the US Capitol.CHAPTER SEVENThere has been much written concerning the Mountain Meadows Massacre, andattempts by various partisan groups to either whitewash the event or paint it asan official Mormon military action. Most recently, a series of articles inacademic publications have tried to analyze the massacre on scientific andarchaeological principles. Two of these are worth mentioning and they may befound online. The first is entitled “Mountain Meadows Massacre” and is byLuscinia Brown-Hovelt and Elizabeth J. Himelfarb and can be found atwww.archaeology.org/news/mormons.html[http://www.archaeology.org/news/mormons.html], and dated November 30, 1999. Theother is entitled “A Sight Which Can Never Be Forgotten,” by Alyssa Fisher,dated September 16, 2003, and can be found atwww.archaeology.org/online/features/massacre[http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/massacre]. These two articlescontain much new information on the Massacre.CHAPTER EIGHTResearch for this chapter included the book, The Mormon Murders, by StevenNaifeh and Gregory White Smith, as well as Mormon America: the Power and thePromise, by Richard N. Ostling and Joan K. Ostling.CHAPTER NINEUseful material here included Mormon America, mentioned above, as well asarticles by Michael Barbaro “After a Romney Deal, Profits and Then Layoffs” inthe New York Times, November 12, 2011, and Sean Wilentz, “Confounding Fathers:The Tea Party's Cold War Roots” in The New Yorker, October 18, 2010. There are anumber of useful books on the Howard Hughes empire and the machinations ofChester Davis, Bob Maheu, Bill Gay et al., including Citizen Hughes, by MichaelDrosnin, Next to Hughes by Robert Maheu and Richard Hack, The Money: the Battlefor Howard Hughes's Billions, by James R. Phelan and Lewis Chester, and evenHoax: The Inside Story of the Howard Hughes-Clifford Irving Affair, by StephenFay, Lewis Chester and Magnus Linklater, as well as Geoff Schumacher's HowardHughes: Power, Paranoia and Palace Intrigue. The problem with doing any kind ofserious research on Hughes is the requirement that one also be conversant with awhole host of related issues, such as the Watergate Affair, E. Howard Hunt, G.Gordon Liddy, Richard Nixon, and so on. Recourse can be had to publisheddocuments of the Watergate Hearings as well as the various reports such as theSenate Report on Watergate that the hearings spawned, as well as biographies andautobiographies of the persons involved, from E. Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy toHughes, Maheu, Davis, and Nixon (among so many others).A tremendous resource for researchers interested in everything Mormon is alwaysthe Utah Lighthouse Ministry, founded by Jerald and Sandra Tanner. The Tannerswere among those who distrusted Mark Hofmann and his forged Mormon documents; atthe same time the Utah Lighthouse Ministery is a clearing house for magazines,books, and newsletters on various aspects of Mormonism many of which are writtenand published by the Ministry itself. They can be found online at www.utlm.org[http://www.utlm.org].Information on Mormon voting patterns is available in several places, notablythe Gallup Poll (see the article by Frank Newport entitled “Protestant, CatholicGOP Vote Similar to National Average,” dated January 3, 2012, and available atthe www.gallup.com [http://www.gallup.com] website). Also see the forthcomingGeorgetown University Press book, From Pews to Polling Places: Faith andPolitics in the American Religious Mosaic, edited by J. Matthew Wilson andespecially Chapter 5 [part0010.html], “Dry Kindling: A Political Profile ofAmerican Mormons,” by David E. Campbell and J. Quin Monson.CHAPTER TENThis is the place to advertise my own work, most especially my trilogy onAmerican politics, crime and culture, Sinister Forces. The reflections andconjectures in this chapter are the result of decades of study of the Americanpolitical scene, particularly in its darker aspects, a study that began in the1970s and which became a series of books beginning with Unholy Alliance andextending through Sinister Forces.Some people call this “conspiracy” literature in an attempt to discredit realinvestigative journalism, which admittedly, has seen better days. Many readersrealize that there is something missing in the national dialogue: those intrepidreporters, investigators and journalists who brought us everything fromchallenges to the Warren Commission to exposure of the Watergate affair.Unfortunately, there are only a few people left who still specialize in thissort of thing (which is startling when one considers how much electronictechnology is available today that was not around in 1972). The rest of thefield has been surrendered to scare-mongers, red-baiters, and other assorted, ifcolorful, lunatics. Even what is called “conspiracy” literature has beenpolarized into left-wing and right-wing conspiracy theorists and even then theyare often subsumed under a general heading of “Trust No One,” a slogan which isroughly the same as “We Hate Everybody.”Part of the problem is that conspiracy theorists have become spiritualized. Allthat talk about Bavarian Illuminati and Masonic plots—the stuff of Nazipropaganda as well as of left-wing paranoia—drives the researcher, surrounded byboxes of declassified CIA and FBI documents, a trifle insane. It is so easy todrift from examining one of the Hughes letters from the Romaine Street warehouseheist into a paranoid trance populated by sinister cabals of governmentsorcerers plotting in Georgetown basements, summoning the Dark Lord. Once youdig beneath the surface of our shared experience of America—with all its madculture, assassinations, unbelievable political figures, and pounding,mind-numbing multimedia campaigns of pharmaceutical advertising andagit-prop—you come upon a large iron box guarded by some kind of weirdtransformative reptile. The treasure in that box is not mere filthy lucre; it isthe secret of our inheritance, buried there by an English pirate captain, or aJewish Algonquin rabbi, or a nervous American Freemason. The reptile—toad orsalamander, it matters little which—is the sign that we are stumbling in theright direction: down. We have to dig a little deeper, and get a little dirtier,in order to look up with any degree of clarity.Are there sinister spiritual forces at work in America? Of course, there are.America is a haunted house. Joseph Smith knew that, otherwise why would an Angelhave guided the young Sorcerer to a deserted drumlin in the wild Americanlandscape, a territory so many had considered virgin before the arrival of thePilgrims? Smith knew that the blood of millions of humans had already soakedthrough the loam and topsoil of upstate New York, that the virginity of thisland had been seized long before. He knew that stately pines and maple treesgrew from unmarked graves of the ancestors of the human race.He knew that if there was a truth to be found in the bedrock of America, it wasto be found in the susurrating chatter of its ghosts, demons, and angels: speechthat can only be heard in its forests, hills and valleys. The spellbooks of theEuropean magicians were written, not for the jaded occultists of France, Germanyor England already crowded beyond belief with religions, crusades, inquisitions,witches, and the burnt flesh of heretics, but for the innocent eyes of youngbelievers—heretics themselves—in the world's newest land. For a people who hadabandoned the safety of the old and familiar, in search of the new and thepossible. These were people who went into the unknown to mold a life fromwhatever raw material they could find.Is it any wonder that some went even further into the unknown, into dark templesguarded by unfamiliar watchers? Smith was one of these. For good or ill, as hoaxor divine revelation, Smith's foray into the world of spirit and angel wasambitious and pioneering. It was a truly American mission, an ancient drama ofgods and prophets and madmen and assassins played out in the New World. It wasthe insistence that this land, too, is promised. This land, too, is sacred.No matter what we think of it, no matter what we believe, it is something towatch. I have devoted the three volumes of Sinister Forces: A Grimoire ofAmerican Witchcraft to the cause of understanding this phenomenon, this purelyAmerican spirituality that is part-European, African and Asian on the one sideand part indigenous.…something…on the other. Most Americans have little directknowledge of Native American culture; most Native Americans have littleknowledge about the “Old Ones” who lived on the North and South Americancontinents before their own culture developed. Smith tried to answer thatomission by filling the gap with his own wonder, his own imagination, thewhisperings of a dead race, an unequalled lust for life…and a few, well-placed,deceptions.America. What a concept!"},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI will make this short. Not many people in this election year would want to beassociated with a book on Mormonism, especially a book that could be interpretedas either promoting the religion (it does not) or attacking it (it does not).The book could also be construed—from a distance—as a “hit piece” on GOPpresidential candidate Mitt Romney. It is not that, either. I would prefer ifreaders assumed that this book was the result of an alien visiting America inJanuary, 2012 and trying to make sense of it.I come to the study of Mormonism with a jaundiced view, certainly, but also witha sense of awe. The study of Mormonism is the study of religion in general. Ifthere is any point I would like readers to take away from this book, it is thatMormonism is no different from any other religion: it is as far-fetched,illogical, unreasonable, and unscientific as any mainstream faith. And that isas it should be. Who wants a religion based on scientific principles? Who wantsto go to their grave praying the Four Laws of Thermodynamics? Religion is aboutmeaning, something that science can never provide.That said, I would like to acknowledge those who thought that this book might bejust the thing to snuggle up to on a cold November evening in an election year.First, Stuart Weinberg of Seven Stars bookstore in Boston, Massachusetts, whowas thinking out loud one day and suggested that a book on Mormonism would beperfect this year, especially after he heard me talk about how both Mormonismand Scientology began with rituals of ceremonial magic based on precisely thesame occult texts.Then, there is Donald Weiser and Yvonne Paglia who supported this endeavor,morally and otherwise.Then, of course, James Wasserman. I wrote many lines with Jim's voice in theback of my head, warning me to remain non-partisan and un-biased. You don't wantJim's voice in the back of your head. For that reason, I hope that this booksatisfies the partisans of whichever stripe.Also Michael Kerber and Lisa Trudeau of Red Wheel/ Weiser. We walked togetherthrough the process of writing and crafting this book so that it would not be amere flash-in-the-pan for an election year but a book that would stand the testof time as an in-depth look at the history and doctrines (and practices) of oneof our most important American religions.There are others I can thank, and should thank, but they would probably not wanttheir names to be memorialized here in case their candidate loses! Thus, theycan be sure I am remembering them and acknowledging them, and that they willenjoy the fruits of my gratitude in Joseph Smith's celestial realm after theirprocess of divinization has become complete!Peter LevendaFlorida, 2012"},{"pageContent":"image [../images/00007.jpeg]"}]
