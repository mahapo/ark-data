In Book One: The Nine, youwere introduced to a thread of violence and bizarre belief – represented byviolent and bizarre people running, like Sherlock Holmes’ “scarlet thread ofmurder,” through American history up to and including the assassinations of thetwo Kennedy brothers. Strange priests, satanic rituals, political conspiracy,and the occult. Not the sort of thing one normally encounters during the courseof graduate work in political science … or during a walk down a dark alley in anAmerican city at night. That all of these things happened is a fact; that thesepeople committed these actions is a fact. That some very strange belief systemsare at the heart of American policy, foreign and domestic, is also a fact.That many Americans are not aware of this, or simply don’t care, is an- otherfact.In this, the second book of a trilogy concerning American “politicalwitchcraft,” we will examine some of the more modern manifestations of thisunsettling concourse of sinister forces. We will look at terrorism, true, but wewill also discover the coincidence stream in full flow in the lives of men asdisparate in social standing as Richard Nixon and Mark David Chapman, Jim Jonesand Richard Mellon Scaife, David Berkowitz and Donald Cam- mell. It is a studyof Washington … and Hollywood. Of serial murder and mysticism. Of the strainingof the American intelligence community towards a manipulation of the unconsciousmind and of their transgression into the realm of the occult and initiation. Wewill look at the stories we all think we already know, and see – maybe for thefirst time – what the Renaissance magician Giordano Bruno meant when he wrote of“the links”: the doctrine of correspondences that is not only the province ofceremonial magic but of ceremonial politics. That is why this trilogy is calleda “grimoire.”There are times when it appears that world history is nothing less than thestory of warring secret societies, with all of the rest of humanity mere pawnsin what historian Ladislas Farago called “the Game of the Foxes.”The Rosicrucians of the 17th Century gave us a prototype of the secret society:a band of brothers, bound together by mystical visions, which had probably neverexisted in reality but was the romantic invention of a English alchemist. It wasan otherwise anonymous manifesto – a printed broadside– that created the myth of the Rosicrucians and since then many individu- alshave sought to capitalize on the name and the glamour by proclaiming themselvesheirs to the Rosicrucian tradition.What is Al-Qaeda, then, but another secret society: a band of brothers, boundtogether by a mystical vision of the world, whose membership is largely secret,where betrayal of the group’s mysteries is punished by death, and which isprobably a very small organization with a larger-than-life profile whosereputation is made on websites and videotapes ... and mass murder. The same wassaid of the Illuminati and the Freemasons, upon whom the blame for centuries ofviolent revolution was laid. That Al-Qaeda – “the Base” – has more in commonwith the Assassins cult of Hassan i-Sabah only reinforces this idea of a secretsociety at war with the world … and with the West in general.Should it surprise us, then, that the putative opponents of Al-Qaeda should bemembers of a Western secret society?The secret society and occult affiliations of America’s political and intel-ligence leadership is something that is never discussed on the open airwaves,never investigated by the mainstream media. We have all heard of Skull & Bones,and know that somehow President George W. Bush was a member of this collegefraternity while a student at Yale University. The story seems to end there. Noone delves too deeply into this aspect of Bush’s life, even when it is revealedthat his father belonged to the same society, and that Democratic presidentialcandidate John F. Kerry also belonged to Skull & Bones. The very idea that, in2004, the presidential election was a choice between two Bones- men never seemedto make the headlines in America even when it was shown that Skull & Bonesmembership is quite small (only fifteen new members are initiated every year),very select, and depends upon a strenuous enforcement of the rules of secrecyand deception. That the two presidential candidates were both members of thissame small and elite group should have raised warning flags, and didn’t. Yet, ata time when America was embroiled in the Iraq war and in an ostensible “war onterror” – directed against Al-Qaeda – our only choices for president were twomembers of the same secret society.If that was all, it would be enough. But that’s not all.In 1833, the year after Skull & Bones was founded, another secret society wasformed, this time at Union College in New York. This one was called Psi Upsilon,and was formed by seven students who signed a pact stating, “We, theundersigned, having determined to form a secret society, and having someconversation on the subject, do now and hereby pledge our sacred honors that wewill keep all that has been done and said a most profound secret.”Psi Upsilon spread to many universities across America and even abroad. Itssecond, or Beta, chapter was founded at Yale University in 1840 and became knownas The Fence Club in 1934.In 1960, both Porter Goss, the George W. Bush-appointed Director of the CIA –and John Negroponte, the Bush-appointed Intelligence Chief– were members of TheFence Club at Yale. As was John Kerry, who wasalso, remember, a Bonesman.Porter Goss was also a member of the super-secret Order of Book & Snake, aseemingly associated society of Skull & Bones. The same year Goss joined Book &Snake he also joined yet another secret society: the CIA.And let us not forget still another member of the Bush dynasty, William HenryTrotter (Bucky) Bush, brother of former CIA Director and President, GeorgeHerbert Walker Bush. William Bush was also a member of The FenceClub in 1960, along with Porter Goss and John Negroponte.So, what do we have?We have George Herbert Walker Bush, George W. Bush, William Henry Bush, John F.Kerry, Porter Goss, and John Negroponte all members of secret societies at YaleUniversity. And let’s not forget Prescott Bush, who was oneof the directors of the Union Banking Corporation that was shut down by the USgovernment in 1942 when it was discovered that Bush and his partner, E RolandHarriman, were “trading with the enemy”: i.e., the Nazis. PrescottBush was another member of Skull & Bones.That’s two presidents, one presidential contender, two CIA directors, and anintelligence czar who are all fellow-travelers in the world of rituals and swornoaths, secrecy and deception, trained since their late adolescence and earlyadulthood in the environment of privilege and control. Dear reader, should Iburden you with revelations that Averell Harriman as well as Roland Harriman –partners with the Bush family in “trading with the enemy” before and duringWorld War II – were also Bonesmen? That the Psi Upsilon secret society abandonedits pretence of being a literary society early on and admitted its preferencefor members with a proven ancestry? That there is little to associate theseOrders with the popular conception of college fraternities represented by suchfilms as Animal House?As members of Skull & Bones, Psi Upsilon and Book & Snake consolidate theircontrol over America’s wealth, intelligence agencies, and military power, theyare also engaged in a war with Islamic secret societies that costs us thou-sands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars. Conservative Americans wereworried in 1960 that should a Catholic become President, then America wouldsomehow be controlled by the Pope. Instead, we have an America that is in thrallto a handful of initiates in a few small secret societies that share a hiddenagenda, a covert brotherhood, and a contempt for individual liberty… and no one is bothered by this at all except the crazies, the loonies, themilitiamen, the conspiracy theorists, the paranoid schizophrenics.As the eminent New York Times critic Anatole Broyard once said, “paranoids arethe only ones who notice anything anymore.”There are around 700 members of Skull & Bones alive today. That repre- sentsless than .00001 percent of America’s total population, or 1 per every 300,000persons. Yet, somehow, they occupy top positions of our government. The attitudeof our media, however, is to “pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.”The previous volume of Sinister Forces ended with a review of the strange worldof secret societies, wandering bishops, psychological warfare, and mind-controlprograms that culminated in the assassinations of President Kennedy and hisbrother, Senator Robert F. Kennedy. This volume picks up where the first leftoff: a discussion of these same influences around the Republican Party of Nixonand Reagan, Watergate, the assassination of John Lennon, the Son of Sam cult,the Manson Family, Jonestown. terrorism, and the “vast, right- wing conspiracy.”This is a look behind the curtain, an exposé of The Nine as they perpetuated theultimate secret society at work beneath the surface of America’s long politicalnightmare through children especially selected as carriers of their message.

There was also a focus on the Manson Family, as we walked withthem through desert and canyon. But not so far as the Tate and La Biancahouseholds. Not yet.Furthermore, those events took place in a larger context. The pursuit of eviland the tracking of evil through the political and scientific machinations ofintelligence agencies is ultimately unsatisfactory if we do not address anunspoken and normally unconscious assumption of our political leaders andparticularly of our intelligence chiefs, and that is that their mission is insome way a divine one: that they represent the will of God.The human assumption of divinity has been construed as evil—as a usur- pation ofthe status of divine beings—for thousands of years. No organized religion of anysize or amount of temporal power encourages or permits its followers directaccess to divinity; the privilege of communicating directly to God has beenreserved for the organized and socially approved priesthood. This is as true ofancient India as it is of modern Catholicism. Access to God is very tightlycontrolled, and is usually forbidden to certain elements of society,particularly women. Women may not become priests in the Roman Catholic Church,and are thus separated from the sacrament of ordination, a situation that callsinto question the very nature of the soul. For it presup- poses that the soulhas a gender, since sacraments do not affect the body but only the soul. This isperhaps understandable in view of the etymology of the word “sacrament,” whichcomes from the Latin and which originally meant a military oath, an oath of(male) soldiers. Women may not be ordained in the Eastern Orthodox churches,either.In Orthodox Judaism, women may not become rabbis. Menstruating women, in fact,are considered unclean and may not enter the synagogue during their period. Aman who touches a menstruating woman becomes unclean, and must bathe in theritual bath—the mikvah—before going to worship himself. In the East, women arenoticeably scarce in the lists of divine Hindu and Buddhist and Daoist figures.Yet, in the West, it has traditionally been women who were charged with thepractice of witchcraft, a phenomenon that has led some historians andanthropologists—such as Margaret Murray, Robert Graves and Erich Neu- mann—todevelop the theory that witchcraft is the survival of an ancientgoddess-oriented religion that was suppressed on a virtually global scale, fromEurope to the Middle East, and to the borders of India. If this is true, and itwas suppressed, then the reasons for the nearly perfect destruction of thisreligion had to be political.Our most ancient artwork as a people has been that associated with magic andreligion. The prehistoric cave paintings of Lescaux, for instance; the Venus ofWillendorf; the many thousands of different varieties of goddess statues foundall over the world. People did not venerate human leaders and etch theirlikenesses in stone and clay until civilization began to coalesce aroundvillages and towns and away from field and forest. When they did, they didbecause their leaders partook of the divine essence, the divine nature; theywere the representatives of the gods upon the earth.And when this occurred, when state religions were established and associ- atedwith city-cults such as those of ancient Sumeria, Babylon and Egypt, then theregrew up around them secret cults that worshipped older gods, the gods andgoddesses that had been usurped by the newer, royally-linked deities. Evenancient Sumeria—arguably the oldest western civilization that has left anywritten record of itself—had its cult of witches, and various texts (such as theMaqlu or “Burning” Text) contain chants and prayers against the practice ofwitchcraft, some three thousand years before the birth of Christ. These witcheswere independent practitioners of ritual; in other words, they did not belong tothe state cult, were not approved by the ruler (who was both secular and sacredruler), and they worshipped beings that were not approved by the state cult.Thus, the Biblical phrase cited above, that witchcraft and rebellion weresynonymous. Rebellion is a revolt against secular authority; the implication istherefore that witchcraft is a revolt against sacred author- ity. It puts accessto God in the hands of the Great Unwashed. It creates an anti-church, just asrebellion creates an anti-government.In a way, this is a logical extension of the Creation epics of all races. TheCre- ation of the world (or the universe, or the cosmos, or just one race ornation) is always divine in nature. The First Man and the First Woman werecreated by God or Gods. Thus, society itself owes its existence to a deity ofsome kind. Following this chain of logic, then, the king—as the ruler ofsociety—must have a special, sacred relationship with the divine. This isespecially true in the West, where God is perceived as a King on a throne. (Itmay be argued therefore that the secularization of cosmology brought about bymodern sci- ence could undercut any special claims to kingship, and render humanrulers about as “special” as servers or routers on a computer network.)The Cult of the Pharaoh in ancient Egypt was a religious as well as a secularcult. The Pharaoh was a representative of God; he was able to communicatedirectly with God, and after death he was guaranteed a continued existence as anOsiris, a resurrected god of the ancient Egyptians, after the performance of along and complicated ritual which included mummification. The an- cient Sumeriansecular leaders would ascend to the top of their ziggurats and commune withtheir gods directly at certain times of the year. The Chinese Emperor was the“Son of Heaven” as was (and is) the Japanese Emperor; China was the “MiddleKingdom,” at the center of the earth, and halfway between the earth and heaven.It is still called “Middle Kingdom”—Zhong Guo—to this day. The Dalai Lama is apolitical leader as well as a spiritual one; he is the incarnation of agod—Avalokitesvara, the God of Mercy—and when the Dalai Lama dies a search isundertaken to find his reincarnation. The lead- ers of the ancient Aztecs, Incasand Mayas had religious power. In Europe we had the Holy Roman Empire, and inEngland they talked of the “divine right of kings.” Yet, in all of these cases,the composite religious-secular cult replaced an earlier one.The older cults were buried, sometimes literally, and the new cults erected likeshiny edifices on the bones of the old. In many cases, old cult centers wererenovated and new cult centers built on their sites. This is true of Christianchurch construction in Europe, where many older sites of important pagansignificance were co-opted by the new Christian leaders and turned intoChristian shrines. The Gothic Cathedral at Chartres is a good example of this,but there are many more including St. Peter’s Basilica itself, which was builton the site of the old Tauroboleum, a Mithraic cult center where bulls weresacrificed in honor of the god, Mithra. In fact, the name of the ceremonialheaddress of Catholic bishops is still called a “mitre” seemingly in his honor,from the Latin mitra or “Mithra.” This retention of ancient sites and ancientgods in the structure of their replacements may simply be a social strategy—toensure greater and faster acceptance of the new cult by old cult members—or itmay have an additional purpose, which would be to retain the particular powersof the older cults, those powers which their worshippers cultivate in secretceremonies in the dead of night.The ruthlessness with which new religions persecuted old ones was ab- solute.There is so little documentation left with which to appreciate and understandthe older cults. Most of the documents we have on the ancient religions ofMexico and South America were written by Spanish Catholic priests and monks, forinstance, and are therefore not necessarily wholly reli- able. Tibetan Buddhismhas all but eradicated the earlier Bon religion that it replaced, subsumingremnants of that shamanistic cult under its “Black Hat” Lamaistic branch, alongwith the Dalai Lama’s “Yellow Hat” and the Gyalwa Karmapa’s “Red Hat” sects. Ofthe old cults of pre-Dynastic Egypt we still know very little; the godSet—considered evil, on a par with the Christian “Satan,” in Dynastic Egypt—wasa god in his own right before the coming of the Pharaohs, as were Keb, Hathorand many others. The “God of the Witches” according to Margaret Murray in hercontroversial research was an ancient, horned deity whose worship wasaggressively exterminated by the Church. Satan himself is an enigmatic figure,treated rather ambiguously in the Bible: sometimes as an adversary of God,sometimes as God’s lieutenant (as in the Book of Job).To worship the “old gods” was to commit heresy and, in the old days, treason.The political leadership and the religious leadership were one and the same. Togo outside the system was to be cast into the outer darkness, to lose one’ssoul; to become a worshipper of devils, a word that comes from deva, theSanskrit word for “god.”There is an interesting etymological puzzle that confronts the English speakerand the speaker of the Romance languages, and which compels us to draw someinteresting and sobering conclusions about what we know and what we think weknow. It is a puzzle that is at the heart of this study, and which will lead usinto the Tunnels of Set, into the very bowels of Evil itself. And it may help usto understand Evil for the very first time.REALITY, WHAT A CONCEPTThe word “real” and the word “royal” are inextricably linked. Indeed, in somelanguages the word for “real” and the word for “royal” is the same, such asSpanish real. Reality is, in this view, linked with Royalty; what is real iswhat is part of the kingdom, the “real estate.” What is outside the kingdom is,therefore, outside of reality. It is not “royal,” hence it is not “real.” Thisspeaks to Robert Anton Wilson’s concept of “consensus reality,” mentioned in theprevious volume. Reality is a shape-shifter, dependent as much on politicaldecisions as it is on scientific observations. And these decisions andobservations are usually not the prerogative of the individual citizen. Anessential part—a fundamental part—of the social contract, and imposed from thetop down, is a general agreement as to what constitutes reality. To deviate fromthat agreement is to deviate from society—the kingdom, the real estate, thestate religion—itself. It is to become, in a sense, a Satanist, a worshipper ofan adversary; or a witch, a worshipper of an unapproved God.We can take this analogy one step further, to the political arena, and say thathe who attacks the king is insane, i.e., out of touch with reality. That is whyour most famous assassins have all been pronounced “crazed” and “lone”: they areinsane and not part of a social group, at least not a social group recognized asvalid in the kingdom. An attack on the king cannot be seen to originate fromwithin the kingdom, from within the king’s “reality”: it has to come fromoutside, from the realm of the unreal, the unholy, for if it came from withinthe kingdom it would partake of the logic of the kingdom.The other social group that is both crazed and alone is the independent ascetic,the hermit, the yogin, the sorcerer, the shaman. While often provid- ing valueto the social group—divination, exorcism of demons, channeling of spiritualforces—this person lives outside the general social structure in isolation fromeveryday communication and social intercourse. It is necessary to do so, for theforces that are contacted are those from outside the kingdom. The hermit orascetic is a kind of probe into the Other World, the world outside the walls ofthe kingdom of reality. At times, the counsel is valued; usually, though, theperson is despised, even ridiculed. The independent as- cetic is one who breaksthe social tabus of the group and refrains from social contacts, from eatingsocially approved foods (or from eating at all), from sexual activity and thusfrom the gene pool. The non-sexual ascetic does not share in the transfer ofproperty—of real estate—that is so dependent upon marriage and the production ofheirs. Or the ascetic may use unconventional sexual practices to reach alteredstates of consciousness: forms of reality outside the social contract.Professor Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty—in her important study The Origins of Evil inHindu Mythology—describes how the ancient Sanskrit texts relate the history ofdemons.The belief is often expressed that the demons were not only the equals of thegods but their superiors—the older brothers, the original gods from whom thegods stole the throne of heaven.3This, of course, is exactly how the Sumerian creation epic describes it, showinghow Marduk and his Company of Heaven rebelled against the older gods, theirparents, and destroyed them. It is also related in this text that humanity wascreated from the blood of the slain older gods and the breath of the victoriousyounger gods. In fact, the Sumerian myth goes even further and describes thecreation of human beings a bit as if Marduk was building automata, destroyingthe first set as defective. This parallels a Qabalistic legend that all ofcreation as we know it is really only the second draft; the first draft wasdefective and broke, and the shells of that first draft became the demons—theqlippoth—of the second. The idea that demons represent a moral quantum—evil,which is supposed to be the opposite of good—does not develop until much laterand, in some cultures, not at all.The idea that we are living in a replacement universe is common among the mythsof the world which show an earlier civilization being destroyed, and theancestors of the present human race as the survivors of the former. The Biblicallegend of Noah and the Deluge is a good example of this, a legend that has itsparallels all over the world. Hindu mythology, of course, describes Ages of vastlength that repeat endlessly throughout time, witnesses to the rise and fall ofmany civilizations, many different forms of life and consciousness.To the Hindus, the demons and the gods are consanguineous; they come from thesame family, the same genetic stock. They both attempt to use humans to servethem, but they are really at war with each other. The gods have established anearthly priesthood to serve them, and society is obligated to support thispriesthood—this “ritual sphere”—and to pay for the sacrifices which keep thegods strong. To do otherwise, is to invoke disaster:…it was in the interest of the Brahmins to convince these patrons that the godsregarded powerful human beings of the nonritual sphere as demons and treatedthem accordingly.… Those mortals who aspired to religious power outside of theritual sphere inherited the role of demons in the cosmic masque.4and again:…a priest might legitimately emulate the gods, but an ascetic should not. Anambitious priest was like a god; an ambitious ascetic was like a demon.5The ascetics were those who interiorized the rituals and the myths of the Vedas,the sacred Hindu scriptures, and who sought unity with godhead through theirpractices. Professor O’Flaherty makes particular reference to this system—whichmany readers will recognize as Kundalini Yoga—in the following passage:…Sumeru (“good Meru”), the world-mountain at the center of the earth, was nowgiven a demonic counterpart, a mirror-image in the under- world—Kumeru (“badMeru”). The world-mountain, which had provided access upwards, now extends downas well—and the gods oppose human and demonic ascetics who, by interiorizingthese pillars within the spinal column, would mount to heaven.6This anatomization of the world-mountain as the spinal column is known to theJewish Qabalists as well. In fact, in Qabalism it is referred to as a “pillar,”of which there are three. On these three pillars is drawn the glyph of the Treeof Life, and contemporary occultists have shown a relation- ship between theIda, Pingala and Sushumna nadis or channels of the human body in Kundalini Yogaand the Right, Left and Middle Pillars of the Jewish Qabala and the body of AdamKadmon, its ideal human. The important line in this citation is that the gods donot want either human or demonic ascetics to climb the pillar or mountain and soreach heaven. It is perceived as an attack on divine authority—to show upwithout an invitation—and the rituals and other practices designed to activatethese powers in humans are prohibited by organized religion which is, certainly,the human representation of divine authority; organized religion becom- ing, ina sense, a colonial power on earth representing the home country on MountOlympus or on Sumeru.The interesting phonetic similarity of the world-mountain as “Sumeru” and thename of the ancient Mesopotamian culture “Sumeria” is, of course, noted. TheSumerians were famous for their stepped pyramids, the ziggurats, and many haveconjectured that the Biblical Tower of Babel was in reality a ziggurat beingbuilt at Babylon by the Sumerians or by their successors, the Akkadians orBabylonians. The ancient Egyptians also revered mounds, and believed that theworld was created when a Primeval Mound rose and separated the waters. Thisancient belief may be related to the prevalence of mound cultures in ancientEurope, the British Isles and the Americas, just as the Egyptian pyramids havetheir counterparts in Mesopotamian ziggurats and Aztec, Maya and Inca pyramidsin Latin America. While it is outside the scope of this book to go into furtherdetail, it is tantalizing to speculate that there might have been significantcommunication between ancient Indian and ancient Sumerian cultures, representinggeneral agreement on such things as a creation myth, a world-mountain myth, andthe existence of evil and of demonic beings. They do, however, obviously agreeon certain points whether they were ever in contact or not, and the abhorrenceof individuals practicing religious—i.e., mystical or magical—rituals alone,outside the “ritual sphere” of the approved priesthood, is evident in bothcultures.Since the relationship of the society with God was all-important andcommunication with God deemed appropriate only for the highest levels of society(for reasons of national security!), we have to look for a motive for this.Obviously, survival of the society was dependent on the good graces of apowerful spiritual being who was considered to be omniscient and omnipotent (or,at least, more knowing and more powerful than the king). There was believed tobe a channel of power or energy that emanated from that being and which wasbestowed on the king, who then bestowed it on his kingdom. Thus, power andsurvival, the king and the god, formed the mechanism by which a society wasidentified and prospered. In a time when natural disas- ters—drought, flood,disease—could spell life or death for the tribe or the city-state, it wasconsidered essential that someone in the kingdom have a direct line to theforces that controlled these disasters, since society itself could obviously notdo so on its own.Independent ritual-performers, therefore, must have been viewed with horror, forthey were going directly to these forces and enlisting their aid in projectsthat did not have the blessing or approbation of society, that is, the king. Itwas a usurpation of the king’s power, and it could spell catastrophe for thekingdom. Further, if the independent ritual-performers—let’s call themsorcerers—contacted supernatural forces that were allied against the king’s god,then a state of spiritual warfare existed in which sacrifices were being madeand resources of the kingdom exhausted in propitiation of the wrong gods, theolder gods, the spiritual adversaries of the king’s god. It is easy to see whysorcerers and witches would be considered traitors or rebels. We can also seethat the very fabric of reality itself was threatened when witches were allowedto practice their craft, since their successes with spells and potions and theshamanistic channeling of supernatural forces were more spectacular—and moreconvincing—than the elaborate ceremonial of the state religions that relied moreon the maintenance of the status quo than on the expansion of consciousness orthe direct apprehension of the Godhead by a normal citizen. The witch orsorcerer had access to a level of knowledge about the world that was notavailable to the general public and perhaps not even to the priesthood itself.This practice was especially attractive to women, as they were usually excludedfrom the state priesthood or from direct participation in their ritu- als,except perhaps for purely sexual purposes as ceremonial concubines or templeprostitutes.The author believes that the political implications of witchcraft are rarelyaddressed in the literature, and hopes that the present work stimulates morein-depth research on this subject, especially now when the relationship be-tween religion and politics is becoming more important, more pronounced in theworld arena. One of the problems in addressing these issues, however, is thelack of a vocabulary for expressing some basic concepts. The literature ofwitchcraft—i.e., of shamanism, sorcery, “black magic” and the like—is such thatit resists easy classification; but if we view witchcraft from both apsychological as well as an existential (perhaps an ontological) viewpoint, andpolitics from a psychological and religious viewpoint, we may be able to providea convincing and workable political metaphor.Why bother to concern ourselves with such an arcane task? Because modern sciencein the twenty-first century is on the verge of a major breakthrough in thephysics of consciousness as we will see in the final volume of this work, and weas a race have demonstrated that we do not understand consciousness itself; wedon’t understand the forces with which we are dealing. We have so far left thisresponsibility in the hands of politicians, generals … and sorcerers. And theyhave used their knowledge to commit murder and other outrages, and have coveredup their crimes by destroying evidence, shredding docu- ments, and vilifyingtheir accusers … or by couching their discoveries in such esoteric terms thatthe layman has no hope of ever understanding what they have accomplished, orwhat dark forces have been loosed upon the earth.THE HIDDEN FORCEIt is useful to look at contemporary beliefs and practices concerning witchcraftand the “black arts,” and the influence they have over the political lives ofthe people. In the West, such practices are, on the one hand, suppressed anddevalued by a kind of media assault aided and abetted by such professionalskeptics as the late Carl Sagan, James Kreskin, Martin Gardner and others,while, on the other hand, subliminally encouraged by Hollywood offerings such asThe Believers; Rosemary’s Baby; Charmed; Sabrina, the Teen-Aged Witch; Buffy,the Vampire Slayer; and Angel. In the East, these practices are tolerated andaccepted to a degree unheard of in modern Europe or North America. Asianreligions are—compared to their Western counterparts—a rich amalgam ofmainstream religious practice and theological discussion mixed with indigenousoccult practices and beliefs. Chinese Daoism (often spelled “Taoism”) is a verygood example of this. It had been suppressed in the People’s Republic of China,of course, and only lately have a few of the ancient Daoist temples beenrenovated and re-opened, including the famous White Cloud Monastery in Beijingwhile, at the same time, Falun Gong has been brutallyput down, its members imprisoned and dying during “questioning.”The practice of what is loosely called Daoism is a survival of very old paganpractices of the Han Chinese, mixed with elements of imported Indian Buddhismand yogic and Tantric practices. At its heyday, it was the state religionof China, much as Shinto is the state religion of Japan, where the Japaneseemperor is an embodiment of indigenous Japanese Shinto beliefs. A study ofDaoist occult literature—specifically in reference to what is known as “Daoistalchemy”—will show very clear correspondences with Tantric ritual as well aselements familiar to students of European alchemy; it is thus a valuable sourceof information on a very old system of beliefs and practices that predateChristianity, Buddhism and all the other monotheistic faiths in the world. Itmay have come from the same fountain of belief that provided the underpinning ofthe Vedic and pre-Vedic practices of India as well as of the religion of ancientMesopotamia, of which we have only the sketchiest background. As discussed inthe previous volume, the jury is still out on whether the “dif- fusionists” orthe “independent inventionists” have the better explanation for thesesimilarities, but let’s leave that discussion open for now.While Daoism has had its ups and downs in China, it has flourished within theChinese communities outside China: in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong,and in the Chinese communities of the West. What many non-Chinese do not know,however, is the prevalence of spirit possession as a divinatory practice in thetemples. It is common for a Chinese desirous of knowing about the future to goto a Daoist temple (or, perhaps, a Chinese Buddhist temple; it is sometimesdifficult to tell the difference between the two!) and ask for guidance from amedium. The medium goes into a trance, is possessed by a spiritual force, andgives answers to questions. This is all within the precincts of the temple andis supported by the temple, its monks and the people; thus, one would be hardput to categorize it as an “alterna- tive” practice. It is obviously, however, aclear survival of Asian shamanism, a practice that was already ancient when theBuddha was born.In Asian Muslim countries there is a corresponding cult of spirit pos- session,shamanism and what can only be called a type of “witchcraft.” In Malaysia andIndonesia particularly (and to a lesser extent in Singapore and thePhilippines), Islam has permitted the existence of a kind of witch doctor-cum-medicine man, known in Malaysia as a bomoh. This is a phenomenon thatpredates the arrival of Islam to these countries in the fifteenth century, andhas been sturdy enough to survive as a reliable occult entity alongside theusually theologically intolerant Muslim faith for almost five hundred years; andit has had tremendous influence on not only the grass-roots political structuresof the kampung (the Malay word from which we get the English “compound,” andusually used to refer to a village or a “neighborhood” of houses in a village)but also on politics at a national level.Indonesia is the largest Muslim nation in the world. Located in Southeast Asia,south of the Philippines, it includes a share (with Malaysia) of the largeisland known as Borneo; all of Sumatra, Java, and Sulawesi; West Timor; the partof New Guinea known as Irian Jaya; as well as the captivating paradise of Baliand literally thousands of other islands in the archipelago. Indonesia is hometo over 200 million people, most of whom are at least nomimal Muslims, but whichinclude some Hindus (principally on Bali), Chinese of various faiths, and peopleknown as orang asli or “original people”: animists and jungle-dwellers whoseancestors go back on these islands for thousands of years. Indonesia’s mostnotable ancient architecture is the temple at Borobudor on Java, which is aHindu masterpiece.An essential element of Indonesian culture and especially of the Javanese issomething known as kebatinan loosely translated as “inner dimensions of life.”It comes from the Malay root batin which means “inner feeling,” a kind ofmystical sense and sentiment wrapped up in one. (This concept of batin actuallycomes from Islamic mysticism, and is an Arabic word meaning “esoteric” or“hidden,” as we will see in a later chapter.)Anthropologist Dr. Neils Mulder, in his Mysticism in Java: Ideology inIndonesia, describes it this way:Things are not what they appear to be, but have a hidden core which fas- cinatesthem.… They speculate about hidden forces—whether spirits, or secretivepolitical manipulation.… They are fond of explaining the sym- bolism of theritual meal, of religious practice, of chance occurrences, of chronograms, andsuchlike. In brief, the symbolic—and the mystical—di- mensions of lifeconstitute an important field of interest.7In one paragraph, Mulder sums up the essential elements of this entire study:the hidden forces which are either (or both) spiritual forces and politicalones; the symbolism of chance occurrences, religious practice, and the mysticaldimensions of life. Western societies today do not consciously live in such aworld; but they do so unconsciously, as it is hoped this study goes far toprove. However, Eastern societies do live consciously in a world where the“hidden force”—to borrow a phrase from both Neils Mulder and Dutch novelistLouis Couperus—penetrates and permeates all existence, and is a component ofreality that cannot be ignored. Kebatinan is one way of describing this force.Couperus gives us another:Under all the appearance of tangible things the essence of that silent mysticismthreatens, like a smouldering fire underground, like hatred and mystery in theheart.8And:He would never know that, lurking under the simple life, there are all thoseforces which together make the omnipotent hidden force. He would have laughed atthe idea that there are nations that have a greater control over that force thanthe Western nations have. He would shrug his shoulders—and continue on hisway—at the mere supposition that among the nations there are a few individualsin whose hands that force loses its omnipotence and becomes an instrument.9Couperus lived in Indonesia for a while when it was a Dutch colony, and wasintimate with both the Dutch expatriate community there as well as the localpopulation. It is impossible to live in Southeast Asia for any length of timeand not become aware of this “hidden force” … or, at least, of the belief of thepeople in its existence, for they conduct their lives in accor- dance with itsmyriad manifestations. The longer one spends in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singaporeand environs the more one becomes accustomed to the operation of this force;this is especially true of those who spend time outside the major cities and inthe smaller towns, where the rule of the bomoh is stronger, and where kebatinanis thick in the atmosphere against the backdrop of the mosque and muezzin’s cry;the lavish Hindu temples with their colorful statues of thousands of deitiescrammed together like a cocktail party of the gods; the mysterious Chinesetemples in clouds of incense, strange heiroglyphic characters painted on scrollsrepresenting the signatures of invisible forces. It almost takes a novelist’ssensitivity to grasp the essential nature of this hidden force, as science hasprovided us with no intelligible language to describe it; or, perhaps, our verynature as Europe- ans and Westerners has imposed upon us a certain way oflooking at life that is somewhat at odds with those of the East, and as wellwith those of our own Native Americans, our orang asli. As ethnographer of theNavajo culture Sam Gill writes,As I have come to think of it, when the facts of history come together forsomeone in a way that reveals their meaning or in a way that enables theirfuller understanding to be sought, a story is born. History lacks meaningwithout story. Story lacks substance and relevance without history.… For theEuropean-American story tradition the authority is history, even though thestory is not strictly historical; for the Native American story tradition theauthority is religious and outside of history, even though the story reflectshistory.10Thus, for European-Americans, the facts are obvious—historical data—even thoughthey may be treated in a novelistic manner in order to extract as much meaningas possible. For Native Americans—according to Gill—the facts are notnecessarily obvious from a European-American perspective: the underlyingstructure, the “authority,” is “religious and outside of history,” which iscomparable to Mulder’s take on kebatinan, and which represents a forceessentially religious (or, at least, mystical) and outside of what we understandas history, outside the linear flow of time, as much Navajo tribal legend isexpressed.Mulder’s study of Javanese mysticism is simultaneously a study of Javanesepolitics. He begins by describing traditional Javanese concepts of kingship:Kings were thought to be among the most powerful mystical elements on earth, tobe receptacles of cosmic potency. Their worldly power reflected their charisma,that is, their receiving of a supernatural mandate to rule, known as their wahyu…. Such wahyu was a clear sign of their association with and concentration ofkasekten (cosmic potency), which was thought to radiate as a beneficial magicalforce from their persons to the populace …11As Mulder goes on to describe, even their palaces reflected this concept,designed as microcosms, pictures in miniature of the entire universe with theking as the center, or “axis mundi.” 12Thus, the spirituality of the kingrepresents an interplay between the visible and invisible worlds, and thusaffects the peace and prosperity of his kingdom.13 Although this seems likeperfect superstitious mumbo-jumbo to modern Western ears—especially in thepostwar era of atomic energy, space travel and the Internet—if we were tosuspend disbelief for a moment and apply this notion to a European or Americanruler, we might see that some of these same beliefs apply.No matter how good a president Bill Clinton may have been, for example, he waspilloried over his supposedly private sex life: something that has no relevanceto how well or how poorly he did his job. This suggests strongly that somesignificant portion of the American electorate feels that a President should bethe moral equivalent of a minister of religion, even though there is no suchprovision in the Constitution which, to the contrary, mandates a separation ofchurch and state. The viciousness of the attacks on Clinton over this issue—andthe maneuvering of his friends and Party members away from openly supporting himin light of the revelations concerning Monica Lewinsky—demonstrates a clear (ifsomewhat hypocritical) connection in the popular mind between the President’sbehavior as an individual and the state of the nation, much like the old legendsof King Arthur and the Holy Grail. This is so for a political leader who isdemocratically elected and who serves a maximum of two terms of four years each.How much more so for a leader who attains his or her position by virtue ofgenetics or marriage, such as a king or queen?In Malaysia the king was viewed as a kind of shaman, as Sir Richard Winstedtpoints out in The Malay Magician, in a way very similar to that of Indonesia.14Winstedt, in fact, sees a close association between Malay magic and that ofancient Babylon, going so far as to suggest that the creation myths of thepre-Hindu Malays—recited as part of ritual by Malay shamans—are an echo of theSumerian legends of Marduk and Tiamat.15 The facts may be somewhat the reverseof appearances, as Stephen Oppenheimer suggests in his Eden In The East.Oppenheimer, a doctor specialzing in tropical pediatrics and based out of HongKong, believes he has found genetic markers and other evidence in the tribes ofMalaysia and Indonesia to suggest that the peoples of the ancient Middle Eastoriginated in … the Malay archipelago. His arguments are persuasive for aSoutheast Asian “Garden of Eden,” from which civilization sprang at the time ofa great deluge eight thousand years ago. Winstedt waswriting in 1951; Oppenheimer in 1998. It is a strange theory, from the point ofview of traditional anthropology and archaeology, but the medical evidence inOppenheimer’s case and the internal evidence of Malay myth and ritual inWinstedt’s case make for a compelling story. The idea of the king as high priestis also consistent with ancient Sumeria, and it is still understood as such bysome contemporary Malays regardless of the influence of traditional Islam.For example,In the eighteenth century Perak had a state shaman, who was of descent fullyroyal and bore the title of Sultan Muda or Junior Sultan.… The holder of thisoffice (which still exists under the title of State Magician) is head of all themagicians in Perak and he is expected to keep alive the sacred weapons of theregalia, to conduct an annual feast and séance with liba- tions for the royaldrums and to make sacrificial offerings to the genies of the state. Suchofferings are still made as part of the ceremony of installing a Sultan ofPerak.16As mentioned above, Winstedt was writing in 1951, but these citations are from arevised 1960 edition, i.e., after Malaysian independence in 1957. Perak is aMalaysian state on the west coast of penninsular Malaysia, on the Straits ofMalacca (Melaka), north of Kuala Lumpur and south of Georgetown (Pulau Pinang).The point of this geography lesson is that the State of Perak is not a strange,isolated little community deep within the rain forest, but on the contrary is animportant part of Malaysian history and has seen Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims,Christians, Chinese, Indians, Dutch, English, Arabs and every sort of trader,missionary, soldier and politician along its coast.Again:The Malay shaman … and the Malay ruler both own familiar spirits. The familiarsof a sultan are the genies who protect his state.… At a famous sé- ance held in1874 to discover if Mr. Birch, the first British Resident, would be wrecked onthe bar of the Perak river, Sultan Abdullah himself was a medium and waspossessed by nine spirits in succession.17For the interested, the much-unloved Mr. J.W.W. Birch did not survive. A typicalexample of English colonial arrogance, he considered himself superior to theSultan and thus to everyone else in Malaya and conducted himself ac- cordingly;and accordingly, he was the victim of an assassination.More than merely a medium or shaman, the Malay ruler was also believed to be theincarnation of a god; something that is no longer discussed in polite Malaysiancompany, but which survives in some of the pomp and ceremony that attends theinstallation of a sultan. This belief is thought to have occurred among theMalay people via India and Tantric Hinduism.18 Hinduism has affected every layerof Malaysian society, even though it is often not recognized as such and itsevidence merely accepted as being “traditionally Malaysian.” The weddingceremony of the Malay people, for instance, is virtually a carbon-copy of theIndian wedding ceremony, in which the bride and groom sit on a throne or raiseddais and are told to look solemn.The installation of a sultan in some states, however, particularly in NegeriSembilan and Perak, is replete with even more Hindu and Buddhist cer- emonial,although much of it has been sanitized and Islamicized to be in accord with thestate religion. There is a limit to how much one can sanitize or Islamicize anancient ritual, however, and the procedures involving lustra- tion,circumambulation, the sacred weapons, the blessing of the four cardinaldirections, etc. remain as very strong and incontrovertible evidence of bothMalaysia’s Indian heritage as well as its native, animist, shamanistic culture.Even more, it is evidence of a global preoccupation with the identity of kingand magician, and the idea that a political ruler is also a kind of medium, achannel for the hidden force.In Malaysia today, kingship is a revolving door. The king or “agong” of Ma-laysia is chosen among the sultans. The sultans are, of course, hereditary rul-ers of their specific states, and as such are believed to have an equal claim tothe throne. The investiture of a king is ritualistic and involves (among otherthings) the bestowal of the ceremonial sword and the kriss, a wavy-bladed daggerthat is a mystical weapon similar to the athame of modern witchcraft(traditonally, a double-bladed knife with a black handle), or the magic wand ofEuropean ceremonial magic. Spiritual forces are believed to reside in the kriss,and there are a tiny handful of people in Southeast Asia whose specialty istheir manufacture, a process complicated by elaborate ritual requirements.The king serves for a limited period of time before he is replaced by an- otherof the thirteen sultans, making this a unique type of constitutional monarchy.The king in Malaysia has very little political power as such, this beinginvested in the Prime Minister (who is elected) and his Cabinet, after theBritish parliamentary fashion. Yet, the authority of the king is extremelyimportant and sacred to the Malay people. His position is a ritual one, yet thatdoes not diminish its power but rather enhances it. The king of Malaysia is therepository of its kebatinan, a tangent point between this world and the hiddenforce that underlies it. This is not seen as a philosophy antagonistic to Islam,for the sultans are all Muslims and hold a position of authority where thepractice of Islam is concerned in their respective states. It is viewed as aphilosophy that runs parallel to that of Islam, involving concepts of power,spiritual harmony and social integration that are deemed to co-exist with theteachings of the Prophet. There is the same co-existence, albeit with localvariations, in Indonesia as in Malaysia; and other Islamic nations are notimmune to flirtations with cosmic forces.Indeed, in devoutly Muslim Pakistan, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttoexpressed a belief that the trials and tribulations of her father’s regime werea re-enactment of the life of the Prophet, Muhammad. Blending religious imagerywith political realities, Bhutto exploited the supposed similarities between thetwo men in an effort to crystalize her own role in the affairs of her country,and to demonize her father’s opponents. 19Elsewhere in Southeast Asia,yellow-beribboned Corazon Aquino expressed a belief that the spirit of hermartyred husband, Ninoy Aquino (who was assassinated by men loyal tothen-dictator of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos) entered into her to help herwin the Philippine presidential elections on the “People Power” ticket.20Cory Aquino is a Catholic, and for a Catholic the idea that a spirit of the deadcould enter into you and help you win an election is pure and unadulteratedwitchcraft; but in Asia, it is politics as usual.Although mystical beliefs and their influence over politics in Indonesia go backfor more than a thousand years, and can be traced in the Hindu–Bud- dhistpantheism that is unique to the country (after all, the national art form ofthis largest of all Muslim nations is the famous shadow puppet theater in whichscenes of the Hindu epics the Ramayana and Mahabharata are enacted) as well asin local legends about the sanctity of various sites, trees, stones and soforth, the codification of these beliefs into a coherent system only began inthe days after the end of World War II. Nationalism in the wake of the Japaneseinvasion and liberation, the end of Dutch colonial rule, the rise of Javanesepolitical parties and a more orthodox approach to Islam as a result of greatercommunication with Arab countries all contributed to the creation of a nationalidentity. This artificial Indonesian man is a spiritual homun- culus born of aneed to create a homogeneous national character out of the thousands of islands,races, religions and tribes that compose the archipelago. Rather than emphasizeIslam as the unifying force, since many Indonesians were lukewarm Muslims atbest, it was necessary to dig deeper into the beliefs that form the bedrock ofconsciousness, not only for the Javanese but for all the peoples of the newcountry.It was against this background in 1945 that Indonesian strongman Sukarno came upwith a spiritual paradigm for citizenship, called pancasila or the “fiveprinciples”: belief in one God, a just humanity, Indonesian unity, democracy,and social justice. 21(This was copied virtually verbatim by the Malaysiangovernment as their Rukunegara: Articles of Faith of the State.) The develop-ment of these principles (which eventually became a full-fledged governmentprogram requiring acceptance by every citizen) took place only after warringmystical sects in Indonesia began to threaten national unity. It is perhaps notrealized by contemporary commentators on Indonesian affairs that the people ofthe country were by no means unified in their Muslim beliefs. Amidst the openhostility between traditional and modern Muslim factions there was, in fact, astrong and vocal anti-Islamic movement in Indonesia in the 1950s. Opposition toIslam did not come only from the Hindu island of Bali, but from mysticalsects—such as the Permai—that based their ideology on what they perceived to beindigenous religious and mystical practices that predated the arrival ofHinduism from India. Permai was both a mystic cult and a political party, andthus shared some features with other cults abroad in the land that were formingthemselves into action groups.22 These groups were a threat to politicalstability, and the relatively new government of Indonesia saw an urgentnecessity to codify religion and “approve” only certain faiths while proscribingthe rest. Thus, once again, political rebellion and religious divergence becamesynonymous.Indonesia provides us with a laboratory case of how nationalism is manu-factured in any society. The German experience with Nazism gave us one case, butas it was a European example it may, paradoxically, be difficult for Europeansto understand it fully. The Indonesian example has all of the ele- mentsnecessary to create the same type of nationalism, and the exotic nature ofIndonesia to Westerners may enable us to see the action in more relief.The country now known as Indonesia is in reality an amalgamation of manydifferent cultures, including the Javanese, which seems to be dominant at thistime, but also the Sumatran, Sulawesian, Balinese, etc. Once the Dutch left the“East Indies” at the end of World War II—and the British left Malaya andSingapore—the entire region went into a period of ideological self-discovery.Nationhood was a fragile thing; the territories that comprised the new countryof Malaysia fell apart into Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. The presence of alarge number of Chinese in Malaya helped to consolidate Malay identity as theMalays banded together to show a united front against the non-Muslim, non-MalayChinese. This resulted, however, in largely Chinese Singapore breaking away fromthe new Malaysia and forming its own, independent country while retaining BahasaMelayu as their official language. Indonesia had a much smaller Chinesepopulation, but itself has had trouble holding onto East Timor (which waspredominantly Portuguese-influenced and Christian), and as of this writing thattiny piece of real estate is now independent.In any nationalist state, language is supremely important and it is necessary toelevate one language above all others; it is also the most practical approachfor any country. The decision on which language to use, however, is fraught withpolitical consequences. In the case of Malaysia, it was easy to adopt BahasaMelayu as the official state language while also recognizing Chinese and Tamilas important local tongues. The Communist victory in China, however, galvanizedthe Malaysians in a struggle against what they perceived to be Chinese Communistinsurgents in their own country. The struggle against Chinese Communism became,unfortunately, a struggle against their own, indigenous Chinese and any Chineseopposition to Malaysian govern- ment policies was interpreted as evidence ofChinese Communist agitation, much as opposition to US government policy in theUnited States during the McCarthy Era was seen as evidence of Communist“sympathy” if not outright treason. The Chinese were deliberately isolated fromthe rest of society for a time—during the so-called “Malay Emergency”—and placedin what were euphemistically called “New Villages,” but which were only a stepaway from concentration camps. Thus, in Malaysia, race, religion and politicsbecame inextricable one from the other. This has led to increasing states oftension over the years, and the equally increasing measures taken by thegovernment to quell any outward signs of opposition, resulting in the famous“incident” in May of 1969, in which hundreds of Chinese were slain by riotingMalays.In Indonesia, which shares a basic language in common with Malaysia, languagewas not as large an issue as religion, especially in a land where nationalculture is so closely identified with religion. The ringing tones of the gamelanorchestra, the almost furtive shadow figures of the wayang puppet shows, themassive Hindu structure at Borobudur … these have nothing to do with Islam buteverything to do with Indonesia. This is why the Sukarno concept of pancasilawas so necessary for national unity, because it did not elevate any religion orculture above another but sought to create a new Indonesian citizen, tolerant ofall, as opposed to a primarily Javanese or a Balinese citizen. In this way,individual cultures were allowed to retain their special identities while stillcontributing to the nation as a whole. On paper, this seemed like a veryworkable concept; but in action it allowed the proliferation of occult beliefsand practices among both the educated classes as well as the relativelyuneducated mass of people who could not decide whether Islam—as a foreignimport—was inimical to their nation, or if it provided a healthy alternative tothe mystical belief in kebatinan. It was the pancasila program that, in itsattempt to incorporate the entire Indonesian cultural experience, managed toadopt the mystical attitudes of the people into a general cultural gestalt.Thus, to survive as a nation, Indonesia had to recognize the value of batin, theinner spiritual side of what it means to be human, that side of oneself that isin contact with the hidden force. Indonesia has had to legitimize the occultpower of kebatinan.Much the same has occurred in Malaysia. There is a concept there known as badiwhich is as resistant to translation as the Indonesian batin and which mayrepresent the same term (the differences between Indonesian and Malaysianlanguages are slight; they are virtually the same language but have developedsome local terminology), but which in Malaysia has a more sinister connotation.Badi is considered to be an “evil principle” by Skeats, who isone of the acknowledged authorities on Malay mysticism. 23The catalogue of whathas and does not have badi is very long, and seems to be much more specific innature than the relatively amorphous batin of the Indonesianshamans. The ability to control the badi of animate and inanimate objects is theprovince of the bomoh. The power of the bomoh, the local village shaman, isrecognized—albeit unofficially—by government and industry.Bomohs are widely believed to have power over the weather, for instance, andthey can be called upon to ensure a sunny day for important political andcultural events and for open-air speeches by the Prime Minister. Some bomohshave been accused of much worse, however, including rape, sexual abuse ofchildren, theft, and murder. In the year 2002, a bomoh—a woman accused ofmurdering a client—was executed in Malaysia. It is said she went smiling to herdeath.The practice of extreme forms of occultism occurs with astonishing regular- ityin Malaysia, although most of the reporting on them usually takes place inSingaporean newspapers. In one case, a group of occultists had been murderingCaucasians in rituals designed to give them winning numbers in the lottery. Theskulls of the murdered men and one woman were found in a hut in the forest,alongside ritual paraphernalia. Cases that would have made national news in theUnited States for months are treated with a kind of bland distance that is theresult of both a desire to suppress the uglier aspects of Malaysian society andthe contempt born of familiarity, and the cases are lost quickly from the mediaand never heard of again.24Religious deviance is punished in Malaysia. The country has embraced the Sunniform of Islam, which means they view Shi’ism as a heresy. Shi’ism is notpermitted in Malaysia, and its practitioners can be arrested by the Islamiccourts (which are not, strictly speaking, government or secular courts) andimprisoned. More than Shi’ism, however, any form of theological deviation fromstrict Sunnism is frowned upon and can result in arrest and imprisonment. As inIndonesia, religious deviation automatically implies political rebellion;fundamentalist Islamic sects in Malaysia have been known to accumulate weaponsand to call for an end to the domination of the main political alliance, UMNO(United Malays National Organization) and its creature, the Barisan Nasional.Strongest opposition to UMNO comes from PAS, which is a fundamentalist Islamicpolitical party and which has, in the Malaysian states where it has won themajority, instituted the shariyah—Islamic law, such as obtained in Afghanistanunder the Taliban and does yet in Saudi Arabia. Thus, supermarket check-outlines are divided into male and female; swimming pools at resort hotels are tobe equally separated by sex, as are movie theaters and any public place; thesale and consumption of alcohol is not allowed, nor is even the presence of apig much less the consumption of pork. PAS would like to see all ofMalaysia—especially the capitol, Kuala Lumpur—under therule of shariyah, creating, in essence, a theocracy. Fundamentalist forces inIndonesia and in the province of Mindanao in the Philippines are looking forwardto the same goals; in fact, a goal of the local terrorist organizationsallied to Al-Qaeda is the creation of a Muslim state that would encompassMalaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippine island of Mindanao. None of this wouldmatter to most Westerners, except that now the question of religion—andespecially the unholy alliance of religion and politics—has become a major issuewhose solution has profound implications for American and European nationalsecurity. While Americans like to think that their Constitution protects themfrom state sponsored religious bigotry and fundamentalism, the threat fromoutside their borders is very real.When Western intelligence services analyze the political, economic and culturalsituations in Asian countries for their leaders, they naturally do so from aperspective that is the end result of thousands of years of cultural con- ceit(much the same way Eastern intelligence services view Western politicaldevelopments). Much nuance is lost in the translation. Mistakes that were madein Vietnam are repeated endlessly in American foreign policy decisions, forinstance; no one has the time or the inclination to become expert in thedelicate cultural infrastructure of these societies and, anyway, we can always“bomb them into the Stone Age.” United States presidents have only four years tosucceed in their position and have to run for re-election a year be- fore eventhat term is complete. This means they look for easy solutions, fast solutionsto every problem. That is dangerous in any organization, but when the presidentis the leader of the most militarily and economically powerful nation on earth,such a fast fix invites catastrophe. Those citizens who op- pose Americanforeign policy towards the developing nations, however, tend to swing to anextreme position and often hold up the beliefs, practices and socialorganizations of these societies as something exemplary, something to emulate.Both are examples of a perverse kind of racism that does nothing to amelioratethe situation, and both are wrong.The psychological warfare experts of the 1950s came closest to under- standinghow to manipulate and exploit national weltanschauung. Their studies of Africanwitchcraft, discussed in Book One, for instance, should be taken out and dustedoff by their modern counterparts and improved upon with what is known now byacademics, field engineers, social workers, Peace Corps volunteers and anyoneelse who has spent years in develop- ing nations becoming accustomed to localbeliefs and practices. Much has been made of the FBI profilers who must trainthemselves to think like their prey in order to capture them; men like Resslerand Vorpagel and Douglas have all written books about this process. The sameapproach is necessary for those intelligence services who wish to understandtheir target countries and to predict political developments with any kind ofaccuracy. This type of information is not always easily quantifiable—the hiddenforces frustrate logical description. The United States has very few expertsavailable on the cultures, the languages, the histories and the native beliefsof the people living in developing countries; yet, these are the same people whohave become, in some instances, America’s greatest enemies. It is this type ofinstitutional racism that is causing a serious security problem in the UnitedStates. American political and military leaders have, in many cases, listenedtoo long to Sagan and Gardner and Kreskin; it is time they paid more attentionto Roscoe Hillenkoetter, Douglas MacArthur, Claiborne Pell, Carlos Castaneda,Jack Parsons … and the witches. Unfortunately, American foreign policy has beenlargely “anti-occult,” as can be seen by its vociferous campaign against voodooin Haiti.THE COMEDIANSAlthough there have been many examples of theocracies in ancient history (and afew in modern history, such as Tibet), there are perhaps even fewer“cultocracies” in the world, but when they do occur they offer evidence of theway cults operate even when they do not control an entire nation. In my previouswork, Unholy Alliance, I attempted to show how the Third Reich was just such acultocracy. Here, in North America, we have had another: the Republic of Haiti,under the dictatorships of Papa Doc and Baby Doc Duvalier. Haiti is perhaps aunique example of a nation that was created out of the houngans and hounforts ofthe Voudon religion, normally spelled “voodoo.”A survival of Dahomeyan, Nigerian, and religions from other parts of Africa’swest coast, within the outer façade of Roman Catholicism, Voudon is a dynamicand energetic faith that unites racial identity, spirituality and what may becalled “witchcraft” or “sorcery” into a single, all-encompassing practice.Voudon has always attracted other Americans and Europeans because of its exoticsensuality and aura of the mysterious, even the sinister. When the author was achild, his father had a “voodoo doll” in a box, imported from Haiti. The wordwas out to destroy the dolls because they contained poisonous berries for eyes.The doll was a black female, dressed in Haitian costume, and I was shown thedoll once, and never saw it again, presumably to ensure that I did not consumeone of the poisonous eyes ... or did not become possessed by the desire to knowmore about the Haitian cult and its numerous loa, or gods. Even Watergateco-conspirator and CIA agent E. Howard Hunt fell back on voodoo for his novelThe Coven, having a young woman go to Africa on a research scholarship and comeback as an initiate of the mysteries. She goes on to try to supplant anotherAfrican priestess since she has had more direct contact with the original faith,but is murdered instead. The other priestess is referred to as a mamaloi, whichis a Haitian term—and not an Africanone—for a priestess of the faith. Of course, practitioners of voudoun do notcollect themselves into “covens,” which is more appropriately a term used torefer to a gathering of European-style witches. Voudon (or voodoo) is also thesetting for a novel by another former intelligence officer, Ian Fleming, in Liveand Let Die, the James Bond book thatwas made into a movie starring Roger Moore as 007. This story also centers on abeautiful priestess, and a voodoo cult based in the Caribbean as well as in NewYork City. The mixture of magic and eroticism—particularly ofthe interracial kind—is a hallmark of popular fantasies about voodoo. Thecontroversial film Angel Heart also develops this idea, and once again we have abeautiful priestess (played by Lisa Bonet) who captivates a New York Citydetective (played by Mickey Rourke), and the voodoo cult is once again at thecenter of the action, along with a European-style Devil (played by RobertDeNiro). The action takes place in both New Orleans and New York City, andinvolves a ritual of European ceremonial magic in New York on the one hand, andvoodoo rites in the swamps outside New Orleans on the other. The incestuousrelationship between the Rourke and the Bonet characters, as well as the amnesiaand consequent identity confusion of the Rourke character is perhaps a metaphorfor something much deeper taking place, but this is thankfully beyond the scopeof the present study!What most audiences never realize, however, is that the relationship be- tweenmagic and politics in Haiti is very strong, virtually inextricable. Papa DocDuvalier was a powerful voudon practitioner, and bragged that it was his magicthat resulted in the assassination of his enemy, President John F. Ken- nedy.This is not as much of an anomaly as it may appear, since the Haitian republicitself was born out of both political revolt and voudon, rebellion andwitchcraft.On the night of August 14, 1791 at Bois Caiman in Haiti, near the town ofMorne-Rouge, a secret voudon ceremony was held in the midst of a storm ofthunder and lightning. Amid that theatrical setting the god of war, Ogun, wasinvoked in the presence of legendary leader Boukman Dutty. Slaves fromplantations all over the northern plain of Haiti were present, and sworeallegiance to Boukman and to his lieutenants, Biassou, Celestin, and Jean-Francois. A black pig was decapitated in the midst of the ritual, and the Revoltof the Slaves was baptized in its blood.From that moment on, Haiti was in the midst of terrible turmoil. Planta- tionswere burned to the ground, and thousands of white settlers and planta- tionowners were slaughtered. Towns fell to the rebels, known as Maroons to theFrench, and with the advance of a Spanish force from the neighboring DominicanRepublic and its alliance with the Maroon armies, the days of French colonialsupremacy on the island were numbered. France made sev- eral treaties with theslave leaders, some of whom betrayed their leadership and became almost as badas the white slavers themselves, but in the end France (and Napoleon) could notprevail against Haiti, losing some thirty- to sixty-thousand troops in a futileeffort to retain control over the colony and use it as a base to attack thesouthern part of the United States. Boukman became a national hero, a Haitianslave who, with the energy and passion of the voudon cult, organized a slaverevolt against the French and won, dying in the process. Voudon priestessesdanced in the streets of the towns they would capture, and the sound of theconch shell horns and the pounding of the drums drove terror into the hearts ofthe slave owners. These children of the Slave Coast had vanquished the strongestEuropean force in the world at that time, using a mixture of politics, militarystrategy, and African faith that had never before been seen.The revolt took twelve long years before the streets were finally peaceful andthe people returned to the land. Haiti has been betrayed by enemies bothinternal and external over the years since, but voudon itself has never died.When Harvard ethnobotanist Wade Davis went to Haiti in 1982 in search of thesecret of zombification, he found the voudon cult vibrant and alive under BabyDoc Duvalier’s regime. When the author himself visited a year later little hadchanged in Haiti: the politics were still the same, the violence had not abated,the poverty and sickness unsurpassed in the entire western hemisphere; but thepeople were still proud and beautiful, and the houngans and bokors still strongand still politically powerful.The grand old Hotel Oloffson was still there, made famous by Graham Greene inhis novel of Duvalier-era Haiti, The Comedians, and a favorite of celebritiesand movie stars such as Marlon Brando, who had one of the Olofsson’s privatecabanas named after him. White people were still trying to squeeze out of Haitiwhatever they could, and Haitian political leaders were squeezing back. One ofthese white, European post-colonialists in an ice-cream suit and Panama hat wasGeorge de Mohrenschildt, the friend of both Lee Harvey Oswald and JacquelineBouvier Kennedy, some-time spy, petroleum engineer, and world traveler, who wentto Haiti only months before the assas- sination of President Kennedy. DeMohrenschildt would know that Papa Doc Duvalier had bragged about his magicspells that killed the President. Papa Doc rode around in a black limousine withthe license plate “22,” a number of tremendous occult power in the voudon cult,and the number of the date when Kennedy was killed in November, the 11th month.To Duvalier—and to other priests and practitioners of voudon—the combination11/22 is a potent one, and seemed like mortal evidence of the vicious oldpolitician’s powers.Papa Doc was born Francois Duvalier, one of the sons of the elite, intel-lectual class of Haitian society, but with strong feelings of identity with theHaitian people as opposed to the French society to which the elite normallyswore cultural allegiance. At a time when an American occupation of Haiti was afestering sore of humiliation and shame, Dr. Duvalier—who had by this timebecome a medical doctor as well as an ethnologist specializing in Haitianculture—decided to do something about it. He gathered around himself a clique oflike-minded souls who saw in Haitian identity—as opposed to the imported Frenchvariety—a source of national pride, and this included the popular folk religionof voudon.In 1915, the United States had invaded Haiti. It was the start of World War Iand the US Government was concerned over the security of the Panama Canal.French and German interests were present in Haiti, and had the local governmentdecided to allow their country to be used as a base of operations against theCanal, it could have been disastrous for the newly-opened sea lanes. The USstayed in Haiti for long after the end of the war, however, which resulted inanti-American protests and an active resistance movement, aided and abetted byHaitian secret societies, all of them representing a mixture of mystical andpolitical agendas. The US military finally left Haiti in 1934, but during itsnearly twenty years in-country had attempted to suppress the practice of voudon,since it was perceived to be a factor in fomenting rebel- lion, and tried toreplace it with the more staunchly pro-American Roman Catholic Church. Booksthat were published abroad about Haiti around this time tended to paint theculture in satanic and depraved colors, thus legiti- mizing American militaryoccupation of the heathen nation. This strategy was supported by first oneHaitian political group and then another, as the culturally pro-French,mixed-race mulatto elite tried to suppress voudon in favor of the European stylereligion, Catholicism, embarrassed by the popular accounts of voudon that hadexploded in the world press.A former professor at the University of Pittsburgh—a zoologist and author of anumber of books on the fauna of North America—visited Haiti in the late 1940s,some ten years before the start of the Duvalier regime. Samuel H. Williams, inhis Voodoo Roads (oddly enough published in English by an Austrian firm in 1949)relates that “our American Marines had long been engaged in breaking up theirvoodoo practices in the length and breadth of the island under the mistaken ideathat these practices were responsible for the lack of law and order there.” 25Hefurther relates that the neighboring Dominican Republic took the opportunity ofthe departure of the Marines in 1934 to massacre some ten thousand Haitians onthe Dominician border, an atrocity that was not answered by the Haitiangovernment. Although Wil- liams’ work reflects the racial biases of its author,particularly in its lingering descriptions of nubile, naked young Haitian womenwherever he finds them, it is also politically sensitive, and the outrage of theacademic at the atrocities perpetrated by the Haitian government against its ownpeople is evident on many pages. He also states that Caucasians who fall underthe spell of the voodoo rituals are “emotionally abnormal,”26 although a fewpages later he writes, “Voodooism is more than a religion. It is the embodimentof all the activities and psychological manifestations of the people. Fewreligions can claim as much” (Williams’ emphasis).27 These two sentiments seemto con- tradict each other, but perhaps they don’t.In the 1950s, as voudon was still being actively suppressed by the governmentand the sacred drums and flags of the religion were still being burned, Duva-lier and his group represented a political, intellectual and culturalalternative, and Duvalier—seen as a “black” candidate as opposed to a supporterof the mulatto elite—won the presidential election in 1957. For the first timein over a hundred years, voudon priests, or houngans, were invited to the presi-dential palace and given government positions. On one particularly historicoccasion, Duvalier invited all of the houngans in Haiti to a special meeting inPort-au-Prince, the capitol of the country. His allegiance to voudon was nosecret, and the allegiance of voudon to Duvalier was cemented. The rumors inHaiti (and abroad) were that Duvalier was, himself, a houngan or perhaps even ablack magician, a bokor.Things were not easy for Duvalier, however. The first few years of hisadministration there were numerous attempts at military coups and assas-sinations, and in reaction he formed his own personal bodyguard, the dreadTontons Macoutes. With their sinister sunglasses and small arms, they wereeverywhere in Haiti for about thirty years. They wore no uniforms, but theirpresence was pervasive in every town, on every street corner. It was a hugeorganization, and the secret behind it was peculiarly Haitian: an occult societyknown as Bizango.The roots of Bizango are not a matter of historical documentation, but ofHaitian tradition and legend which places Bizango at the beginning of the slaverevolt, and even earlier. According to an informant of Wade Davis, the wordbizango was “of the Cannibal,”28 and therefore Arawakian, the language of theNative American people all but wiped out with the advent of Columbus toHispaniola in December of 1492—the same people that gave us Tituba, the “witch”of Salem, Massachusetts. The same informant also relates bizango to the name ofa spirit found in a famous medieval grimoire known as the Red Dragon (Le DragonRouge), which was the title of the first book in Thomas Harris’ Hannibal “theCannibal” Lecter series, and also the name of a tile in the Chinese game of MahJong. (The reader may also remember the Red Dragon video game parlor in WestVirginia encountered by the author on his way to Ashland, Kentucky, anddescribed in Book One.) Another medieval grimoire that is frequently mentionedin association with voudon is the French Le Petit Albert which, we are told, wasonce banned in Haiti in the pre-Duvalier era. This is hard to believe, for the“Little Albert” is hardly a work of demonic character but contains chapters onpalmistry, herbalism, and—of course—a bit on summoning spirits and spells forsuccess in love and money.Whatever the origin of Bizango, it has developed into a secret society thatexists in every part of Haiti, and with whom its followers claim the Haitiangovernment must cooperate if it wishes to stay in power. The Bizango cult hasmurdered its enemies, and has worked its voudon magic against them as well usinga mixture of herbal poisons and drugs as well as incantations and spells. It isbelieved that Duvalier’s Tontons Macoutes were soldiers of the Bizango society,or that, at least, their memberships overlapped considerably (as implied in theWes Craven film very loosely based on Wade Davis’ research in Haiti, The Serpentand the Rainbow). Upon coming to power, Duvalier relaxed the hold of theCatholic Church over the Haitian people and the practice of the native religioncame into greater flower than ever before. Duvalier himself was widely believedto be a channel for the typically and uniquely Haitian god, the dread BaronSamedi (“Baron Saturday”), and Papa Doc went out of his way to cultivate thisidentity, dressing in the Baron’s typical black suit, black hat and sporting acane. Baron Samedi is the Lord of the Crossroads, and thus is the Guardian ofthe path into the Other World. The Baron is usually invoked before most ritualsthat have to do with summoning power from beyond. His empire is in the cemetery,and for this reason he is sometimes also called the Baron of the Cemetery.Although there are many important deities in the Haitian religion, the Baron isthe one that Hollywood has fixated upon the most, as he is the most sinister inappearance. The Baron takes several bows in the James Bond filmaforementioned—Live and Let Die—replete in skull and skeleton costume and tophat, as well as Erzulie, who is the flirtatious goddess most associated withlove and sex (it is, of course, both Baron Samedi and Erzulie who also make anappearance in the Wes Craven film, mentioned above, evidence of Hollywood’sfascination with death and sex).Regardless of Hollywood’s interpretation, however, the story of Haitianindependence has much to tell us about the relationship between rebellion andwitchcraft. The Duvalier regimes, on the other hand, have much to teach us abouthow politics, religion and the occult can come together as a power- ful, andterrifying, force. When Duvalier dissolved the bicameral legislature of thegovernment in 1961, the US government under President Kennedy suspended aid toHaiti in disapproval, and from that point on Duvalier—the personification ofBaron Samedi, the Lord of Death, and at least the repository of the Baron’skebatinan—targeted Kennedy as an enemy of the state.Haitian voudon has much to teach us about such things as possession andtemporary madness, as well as about modern European ceremonial magic and thepractices of some of the more interesting—and dangerous—cults extant today, andwe will return to it later. For now, its strange syncretistic structure and itsidentification with the Haitian people and their nationalism are what compel us.Never in modern times has one nation been so identified with what we think of asthe “occult”; the exception possibly being the short-lived Third Reich, with SSchief Heinrich Himmler playing the role of Baron Samedi in his black uniformwith the death’s head insignia. Of all the Nazi leaders, probably Himmler comesclosest to being a “Baron of the Cemetery,” as the SS officers in charge of thedeath camps were under his command.In America, there is a specific division between the affairs of state and theaf- fairs of religion; freedom of religion is protected by the Constitution, andthe government may make no laws concerning the practice of religion. Thus, acolonel in the US Army, such as Temple of Set founder Michael Aquino, can havehis religion listed as “Satanist,” on a par with Catholic, Jew, Methodist,Buddhist, Muslim, etc. (God forbid anyone in the armed services should openlyproclaim his or her homosexuality, however!)Yet, this division is in a sense artificial. American coinage is minted with theslogan “In God We Trust,” and the Pledge of Allegiance states—since the1950s—that America is “one nation, under God.” The United States is largelyviewed as a Christian nation, and there have only been Christian presidents sofar. No provision is made for government funding for churches, however; andprayer in the public schools has been proscribed as violating the Constitutionalseparation of church and state. Individual presidents have been very open abouttheir religious affiliations, however, and many Americans are alternatelycharmed and relieved to see their elected officials attending Sunday services.The electorate may be forgiven if they are not aware of the depth of religiousfeeling of some of their officials; presidents rarely express these beliefsopenly for fear of alienating some voting bloc or another. However, some of themhave had … strange beliefs, and dangerous ones. One would not wish a man withapocalyptic visions formed by an idiosyncratic interpretation of the Bible tohave his proverbial finger on the proverbial button to ignite a nuclearholocaust, but that is just what America had in the 1980s; and he was married toa woman who consulted an astrologer on a regular basis, organizing her husband’sschedule on the basis of planetary transits.The author has covered the occult aspects of the Third Reich in some detail inhis previous work. Although he followed the progress of the Nazi ideologues andwar criminals to Latin America via the Vatican’s “rat lines” after the war, hedid not focus too much on the presence of Nazism in the United States and itsinfluence on post-war twentieth century American politics. While the presence ofNazi war criminals in the United States came to the attention of the public onlygradually in the 1970s and 1980s, they had, after all, been in the country since1945. The scientists of Peenemunde and Nordhausen were discussed in Book One;but the political influence of Nazism on the develop- ment of the post-warRepublican Party has remained virtually unexamined, except when someparticularly egregious blunder has exposed the presence of the Dark Lords in anembarrassing way. These cult leaders have wielded a disproportionate amount ofinfluence over the Party since the early post-war years, mostly as a reflectionof the Cold War mentality of the United States and its terrified reaction to therise of Communism in Eastern Europe and the Asian landmass. Protection andsupport of Nazis—including war crimi- nals—by the Republican Party has to remainas one of the biggest scandals of American politics, regardless of therealpolitik justifications and secret agendas of the intelligence agencies andthe New Right, and it is evidence of a moral stand that is at best debatable andat worst deplorable.These influences boiled over temporarily during the Watergate scandal andsubsequent investigations—perhaps epitomized by the “sinister force” behind theerasure of a crucial eighteen-and-a-half minutes of a secret Oval Office taperecording—and it is to this strange and paranoid episode of American historythat we now must turn.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 E.A.

We seem to see men half aware of theirhallucination, and proportionately angry with those who do not share it.—Allen Upward, The Divine Mystery1Neurosis and initiation are the same thing, except that neurosis stops short ofapotheosis, and the tremendous forces that mold all life are encysted—shortcircuited and turned poisonous.—Jack Parsons2L’amant dit a la belle: Ou est la verite?La verite, dit-elle,Qui donc s’en fut doute, La verite, dit-elle,Est morte et enteree.—Maurice Maeterlinck, The Cloud That Lifted, Act III,Scene 3Religion, like Watergate, is a scandal that will not go away.—Victor Turner, Revelation and Divination in Ndembu Ritual3In 1968, America turned a corner politically and, some would say, spiritually aswell. In January, the Tet Offensive showed America that the war in Vietnam wasnowhere near over. The author and millions of his fellow citizens sat in stunnedsilence in front of their television sets as Walter Cronkite, in a state ofshock over the dramatic attacks that occurred on the Vietnamese New Year, said,“I thought we were winning this thing.” By April, Martin Luther King had beenassassinated, and by June so had Robert F. Kennedy. It looked as if both thepeace movement and the civil rights movement had been dealt serious, mortalblows. The Days of Rage during the Democratic National Convention in Chicagorepresented the frustration and anger of the anti-war movement, as Mayor Daleycalled out the troops and had Lincoln Park cleared of demonstrators with WalterCronkite, again on television, visibly upset at what was happening to ourcountry.And in November, Richard M. Nixon was elected President of the United States.When dawn broke on the first day of January, 1969 seventeen-year-old Ma- rinaHabe’s lifeless body was lying at the bottom of a ravine off Mulholland Drive,like a human sacrifice on the first day of the first year of Nixon’s first termas president, a young victim whose father worked for US intelligence andpsychological warfare operations in Europe during the War; a young victim whowas slaughtered in Nixon’s home state, a few miles from the town where he wasborn, a few miles from the town where he was first nominated by his party.Nixon, a lawyer by profession, would later go on to proclaim the allegedperpetrator of this atrocity to be “guilty” while his trial for other murderswas still in progress, thus threatening a mistrial.And in March, less than two months after his inauguration, President Nixonordered the bombing of Cambodia.In the months that followed in that first year of Richard Nixon’s first term asPresident, the Manson Family gathered guns, vehicles, drugs and addi- tionalmembers and headed out to the Mojave Desert and Death Valley in preparation fora long-term siege. Manson’s dream of becoming a rock star was not materializing,but his nightmare of race war and armageddon was taking shape. There had beenrace riots in Los Angeles a few years earlier, and Freedom Riders in the South.George Wallace had stood in the doorway of that college, staring down theNational Guard that had been sent at Bobby Kennedy’s insistence to force thedesegregation of the University of Alabama. Nazis had been welcomed with openarms into the United States to help with the space program, and in July of1969—a bare two weeks before the Tate killings—American astronauts had set footon the Moon.Evil had an Asian face, not a European one. Korea. Vietnam, Laos, Cambo- dia.China. Even Russia was Asiatic, except of course for the “White Russians,” i.e.,“our” Russians, the aristocratic Russians with German blood. When the Romanovfamily had been led to its murder by the Soviets in 1917, one of them leftbehind a swastika swabbed on the wall, a last desperate plea to the Gods of thenoble White Europeans to protect them, to protect Holy Mother Russia. Is it anywonder, really, that Charles Manson—poor, white trash from Ashland, Kentucky;Moundsville, West Virginia, and various penitentiaries on both coasts and pointsin between—would have adopted Scientology, the Process, and eventually Nazism asa solution to his own problems as well as those of the world? He would notsupport the war in Vietnam, but he wasn’t a hippie, either. He believed inviolent action, in the use of force, in the disruption of society, in race war.The drugs and sex of the Sixties were only fringe benefits. And he would one daycarve a swastika into his forehead. Observers are mistaken if they believe thatManson was a creature of the Summer of Love, of Haight-Ashbury be-ins andGrateful Dead dope-and-grope concerts, although that is what com- mentators havedesperately tried to prove in order to discredit and devalue the anti-Warmovement and the sixties youth culture in general.Manson was a creature of the Right: raised by the State, formed by the State,brutalized by the State since he was a child, Manson was the Right Wing inAmerica, taken to its logical conclusion, in an environment in which Nazis wereprotected and coddled, in which the Church itself collaborated in some of theworst crimes that century had ever seen, and in which the American StateDepartment, the CIA, the military, and other institutions fought among eachother for the spoils. The cynicism of Manson was conceived as he watched thisduplicity unfold in his own life. In “brainwashing” his followers he was onlydoing to perfection what the men of MK-ULTRA were trying to do with a largerbudget and a lot of paperwork. The fact that he was convicted of the Tate/LaBianca murders and is still in prison to this day is testament to his success,since it is acknowledged that he did not pick up a knife or pull a trigger or inany way actually participate at the Sharon Tate crime scene. He was, as he said,“convicted of witchcraft in the twentieth century.”With the assassination of Dr. King in April, racial tensions were as high asthey had ever been. Bobby Kennedy had the credentials with the black communityas well as the anti-war community to make a difference, but he had been gunneddown as well. The Beatles had come out with the White Album in 1968 (on November22, the fifth anniversary of the assassination of President Kennedy), and Mansonthought they were speaking directly to him about Helter Skelter, Revolution 9(understood by Manson as a Biblical reference to “Revelations 9”), Piggies, andHappiness is a Warm Gun.This is a phenomenon that will be analyzed by academia one day: the replacementof traditional religious figures and texts by rock star celebrities, moviestars, and song lyrics. Anyone who has seen how young people reacted to thephysical presence of the Beatles—screaming, shaking, fainting, hyste- ria—musthave wondered if this was a kind of religious ecstasy taking place. Biblicalfigures never actually appear to the faithful, except in visions and then onlyto a few; but television and motion pictures made it possible to create newfigures of Biblical proportions and to give the masses direct access to theirevery move, glance, strut, pout, or moue. And when they appeared in person—at arock concert or movie premiere or book signing or supermarket opening—theimpossible would take place: the Biblical figure was in the very flesh,corporeal, present and breathing the same air, walking in the same space. Formany, this was as close to a mystical experience as they would ever get. In thecase of the Beatles, they came with their own sacred texts: their songs. Themusic, the lyrics, the beat of Ringo’s drums, the immediate reaction ofconservative Christianity against them resulting in the destruction of recordsand the burning of their albums by religious groups; and the origins of rock’n’roll itself in the black music of the South, the devilish blues of men likeRobert Johnson, provided white America with a kind of voodoo cult of its own,shrink-wrapped and hi-fi. The package was complete, and thus John Lennon couldbe forgiven for having said—albeit cynically—that the Beatles had become morepopular than Jesus Christ.The backlash to all of this was the election of a right-wing Republicanpresident to replace all those murdered or disgraced Democratic candidates. Thetension in the streets of America rose exponentially. For the first time in thepostwar era, America had become polarized into an Us and a Them. One could tellwho was whom by such simple matters as a haircut (or lack of one), a clothingstyle, or a method of employment. It was not so simple to deduce a person’sallegiance on the basis of age; many young Americans were also YoungRepublicans. Many older Americans had marched on Washington to protest the warin Vietnam. The polarization was cutting across all demographics.When the author was a high school senior in the Bronx in 1968, the Students fora Democratic Society were busy trying to engage and organize the student body,but all they managed to organize were tedious meetings full ofquasi-political discussions that did not advance the cause or stop the war inVietnam; enter the Weather Underground. The Weathermen believed in taking actionto “bring the war home.” They bombed Army recruiting stations, banks, and anyother targets that were understood to be supportive of the war effort. One dayin 1969, the author was on the telephone to the headquarters of the PresbyterianChurch which was, at that time, located on the edge of New York City’s GreenwichVillage. At one point during the phone conversation, there was a deafening blastand the sound of breaking glass. A terrified voice on the other end shouted, “Ihave to go! There’s been a bomb!” and hung up. The Weathermen had been makingbombs in the basement of a West Village brownstone across the street from thePresbyterian Church, and accidentally blew up the building and themselves.Several people died, and some Weathermen escaped, including one woman who wouldturn herself in twenty years later after a lifetime spent underground. Duringthat same period, the author had the opportunity to meet many Weathermen, BlackPanthers, members of the Irish Republican Army, NORAID, the Palestine LiberationOrganization, and other underground groups plotting all sorts of mayhem in theUnited States and abroad. He once shook the hand of Bernadette Devlin, the fieryyoung woman who was a Member of Parliament from Northern Ireland, the woman whowrote, “I was not born a Socialist; life has made me one.” He also met PeteSeeger, Oscar Brand, Milos Forman, and a host of other counter-culturecelebrities and activists. He visited the offices of the East Village Other (theEVO Eye) and, of course, the Village Voice, handing out press releases andplacing ads announcing meetings of various subversive groups at the basements ofradical churches throughout the City, including Judson Memorial in Manhattan andSpencer Memorial in Brooklyn Heights. He also became acquainted with thesurreptitious movement of young men to Canada to avoid the draft, via anunderground railroad that stretched from New York City anti-war churches andtemples to coffee shops like The Yellow Door in Montreal. And all of this to thesensory backbeat of marijuana fumes, acid trips, day-glo posters, lava lamps,Peter Max and black light; the music of Leonard Cohen, Janis Joplin, JoniMitchell, Joan Baez and the entire Forrest Gump soundtrack; rock groups like theGrateful Dead and Led Zepellin and the Rolling Stones; movies like TheStrawberry Statement, Joe, and The Revolutionary.

Laing and The Politics of Experience.This was the atmosphere in the United States of America in the late sixties.I had grown up in the 1950s thinking that at any moment the Russians or theChinese would bomb the bejesus out of us; I was taught how to protect myself inthe event of a nuclear strike, how to lean over with your head be- tween yourknees and—in the joke of the day—“kiss your ass goodbye,” as the air raid sirenswailed periodically over the South Side of Chicago where I first attendedschool. Then the Cuban Missile Crisis. Then the Kennedy assassination. Raceriots. Freedom marches.In 1968, this was followed by the horror of the Martin Luther King, Jr. as-sassination, only to be intensified by that of Bobby Kennedy. Many historianslook back on that period from a safe distance and try to explain it all in termsof dialectical materialism or some other force of history; we knew differently.We knew that there was a war between two opposing forces in America, and thatone side was winning.There were other forces at work in the world than those I learned of in my highschool physics classes. Forces of darkness, surely, but of tremendous power aswell. We had to identify them and, if possible, tame them, or at least protectourselves against them.Heady stuff for a high school student in 1968; but, after all, we were all of usinvolved in greater things. Marches on Washington, the Students for a DemocraticSociety, the Black Panthers, the Weathermen. Hippies, free love, pot and LSD.The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin. Hard rock, acid rock, folk rock.Beads and beards and peasant blouses and blue jeans. There was a war on, and atany moment any of us could be called up, and at that point we would have to makethe most important decision of our lives.By August 1969 I had not been drafted but was in need of money and took a jobwith a Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn Heights. That month, on August 9th,disciples of Charles Manson slaughtered Sharon Tate and her house guests, andthen went on to hack Leno and Rosemary La Bianca to death the following day.I worked for the Church for almost a year, and the following year got a job at alingerie company in New York’s Garment District. It was exactly a year after theManson killings, and on my first day at work I heard a disturbing story. The sonof one of the owners of the firm had committed suicide in a New York City hotelroom, fleeing from Los Angeles where he had worked as a gossip columnist. SteveBrandt killed himself because he was afraid the Manson Family was coming forhim. Because he knew too much. It was while working for this highly unlikelyfirm that I also heard—from another co-worker—of a plan to kidnap Howard Hughes.More of that later.If I needed any evidence that sinister forces were at work in the world, subtlymanipulating reality in ways we could not predict or defend against, then my twoyears of work at Stardust, Inc. provided all the reinforcement I required.Charles Manson was arrested on October 12, 1969 (the birthday of AleisterCrowley; Columbus Day; and the birthday of President Eisen- hower), and thetrial and its aftermath lasted through much of 1970 and into1971. During the trial, President Richard Nixon proclaimed that Manson wasguilty; as a lawyer he should have known better, and as a president he shouldhave kept his mouth shut. It threatened a mistrial if the jury had heard of it.Manson knew this, and brought a newspaper to the courtroom with him, waving itin front of the jury. Incredibly, the judge allowed the trial to continue afterbeing assured by the jury that they would not be swayed by the President’sremarks.Readers of Book One will find familiar the odd coincidence that one of the jurywas an employee of Ashland Oil.President Nixon would resign in the wake of the Watergate investigation onAugust 9, 1974: the fifth anniversary of the murder of Sharon Tate and,incredibly, the fifth anniversary of the day that Disneyland inaugurated their“Haunted House” ride. Walt Disney had once owned the house where Leno andRosemary La Bianca were slain.It is amusing to note that President Nixon was, after all, a Quaker. It is amus-ing for the very reason that Ruth Paine was also a Quaker, as was WhittakerChambers and even the wife of Alger Hiss: a tight little circle of plain speechand affirmations. If the Paines had something material to do with theassassination of President Kennedy, who was heartily and energetically despisedby Nixon, then we have the very rudiments of a Quaker conspiracy theory! Thereader may be grateful to learn that we will not go down that particular road.What we will discover, however, is something considerably more serious. It is atheme of this work that sinister forces were evoked by American politi- cal,military and intelligence leaders in the twentieth century, and that one of thetraces of this is the support of Nazism by prominent Americans, and theinvolvement in occult and extremely bizarre religious practices and beliefs bystill others. This support of a heinous political and mystical philosophy wasongoing from the very end of World War II and has continued—in one form oranother—through to the present day, thus contributing to a politico-occultmalaise that has manifested in such atrocities as the Manson murders, therevival of the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations, and the laying ofthe famous wreath at the SS cemetery at Bitburg.We will leave discussion of the author’s own life for a while, and continue thisinvestigation with the life of Richard Nixon himself.IT DIDN’T START WITH WATERGATESoviet penetration of the Nazi networks were not only a threat to Allen Dulles’reputa- tion, their exposure would have ruined the political career of RichardNixon, the Republican candidate for President in 1959. Nixon authorised Dulles’covert projects during Eisenhower’s illnesses in 1956 and 1957.-- Aarons and Loftus, Unholy Trinity: The Vatican, the Nazis, and SovietIntelligence4I am being the devil’s advocate …-- President Nixon, White House tapes, March 13, 1973Richard Nixon occupies a unique place in American history. It is probably safeto say that no political leader—certainly no president—attracted so muchvitriol, so much absolute disgust, in his opponents as did Nixon. He wasvilified not only by Democrats, such as Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Truman, EdmundBrown, and others but also by members of his own party, such as Eisenhower andeven Nixon’s own running mate, Henry Cabot Lodge, as well as his longtime staffmembers, such as Haldeman (who, of course, could be expected to have an axe togrind considering how he was treated during the Watergate crisis). Those who didsupport him and actually seemed to like him were mostly villains in their ownright, people like Murray Chotiner, Bebe Rebozo, and Howard Hughes, or peoplewith other secrets to hide, such as Allen Dulles, with whom Nixon had animprobable, lifelong friendship, and disgraced Attorney General John Mitchell.The forces of a contentious evil gathered around Nixon like blue-bottle flies ona day-old summertime corpse, and to this day there are still those who considerhim to be a great president, and one much maligned by the same evil forcesthemselves arrayed against him. To be sure, no one is moderate when it comes toRichard Nixon.Nixon’s career takes us into the very belly of the Beast; there is virtually noaspect of his adult life that is not tainted somehow by associations with thevilest of men, as if somewhere in his distant past this hungry, ignored,socially-uncomfortable small-town lawyer signed a pact with the Devil, and therest of his life was simply the logical conclusion of the contract. We look, invain, for signs of redemption; a signal that he found an escape clause in hisFaustian bargain and relaxed, finally, into the arms of his Quaker Savior.It was not to be.Nixon found his political legacy in his foreign policy successes, principallywith China; which is ironic for a man who led the charge against Communism fromhis earliest political days. His foreign policy disasters—Vietnam andChile come immediately to mind—are not regarded as such by his admirers. Acasual observer may be forgiven if it seems strange that a man who held the lineagainst Communist North Vietnam and the Socialist administration of Chile’sSalvador Allende with an almost hysterical zeal would then toast Communisthero Mao Ze Dong with mao tai in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, andwelcome him into the United Nations against staunchly loyal (if slightlyfascist) ally Taiwan. This is because Nixon’s political life—although polarizedin the extreme—did not depend on such mundane concepts as left-wing andright-wing, capitalism and Communism, democracy and totalitarianism, but ondeeper divisions in the human soul. Nixon had been making pacts withdevils since 1946 at least, and he was less a man in control of his own destinythan a creature of other powers, other forces; a kind of political homunculus, agolem that could not be destroyed except by its maker.The origins of Richard Milhous Nixon are not exactly shrouded in mystery likethose of a Marvel Comics character, but they might as well have been. Like highschool geek Peter Parker, who would become Spiderman, Nixon’s background wasmodest and unassuming, his personality nerdlike and awk- ward. There was no signthat he would evolve into a super-hero to some, a super-villain to others. Yet,there was one element—the crucial one, as it turns out—that molded his futureforever and it was mysterious. It was his selection as a Congressional candidateafter the end of World War II by a group of businessmen, businessmen withintelligence backgrounds and Mafia connections.Nixon was born on January 9, 1913 in southern California, not far from LosAngeles. He had four brothers, two of whom died while quite young, leavingRichard and his brothers Donald and Edward. (Readers will smile when they learnthat Richard himself was named after King Richard the Lionhearted, of Crusaderfame.) The Nixon family was by all accounts middle-class and relativelyprosperous, even though Nixon himself would later claim (for political spin)that he had a childhood full of suffering and hardship.As a student, Nixon applied himself diligently, and won a scholarship toWhittier College (not difficult, as it was the Milhous Scholarship and onlyawarded to members of the Milhous clan). While at Whittier, he was involved insetting up a fraternity to rival the existing—more prestigious—one. Theinitiation rituals devised by Nixon and his colleagues for this “anti-frat” in-volved going at night, naked, and digging up a dead animal and feasting on itsdecaying flesh. It is said that Nixon, as the one who created the fraternity,did not have to go through this repulsive, Jeffrey-Dahmer-like, hazing cer-emonial.5 Nixon would go on to create spurious orders throughout his career,such as the Order of the Hound’s Tooth (after the “Checkers speech” that savedhis political career amid allegations of financial wrong-doing). Interest insecret societies, espionage capers, and all the other hallmarks of a paranoidpersonality (or, simply, a suspicious one) would characterize Nixon as both aman and as a politician in the eyes of an increasingly nervous electorate.Nixon went on to Duke University for a time to get his law degree, andeventually wound up married to Pat Ryan. The woman who would become known as PatNixon was born Thelma Catherine Ryan on March 16, 1912; she acquired thenickname “Pat” because her father called her that, as her birthday was so closeto St. Patrick’s Day. Nixon did not even know his fiancee’s birth name untilalmost the time to fill out the marriage license; and Nixon would later makepolitical hay out of obscuring her real birth date so he could claim she was asIrish as Paddy’s pig, born on the one day possibly more sacred to the Irish thanChristmas or Easter Sunday (Easter Monday excepted). Pat Nixon had been asometime actress in Whittier, and Nixon met her when he was auditioning for arole there as well. It seems odd, somehow, that the next elected RepublicanPresident and First Lady after the Nixons—the Reagans—would also meet the sameway and would also have been (somewhat more successful) actors. Pat Nixon(before her marriage) had even worked as an extra in a few Hollywood films.She also spent some time in New York City in the 1930s before meeting Nixon,working in a hospital that treated patients suffering from tuberculosis. Butthree years after her return to California she was working as a teacher andacting on the side, and Nixon discovered her on the set of The Dark Tower byGeorge S. Kaufman and Alexander Woollcott, and began to pursue her with sullendetermination.The script of The Dark Tower contains references to a play by the same namethat—according to the storyline—is enjoying some success in Greenwich,Connecticut and sparking plans to take it to Broadway. (We must assume that thename of the play is a reference to that famous line, “To the dark tower theChilde Rolande came,” which has been such an influence on Stephen King, amongothers.) In the Whittier production, Pat played the role of Daphne, and Nixon ofBarry: a cynical, hardboiled actress and a boyish, idealistic playwright who areeventually thrown together and become lovers towards the end of the play. Theyare supporting roles rather than central characters, but the play still deservesanother look, as it deals with a man believed to be dead who returns, only to bekilled again (as apt a metaphor for Nixon’s career as any), and themes ofhypnosis and possession.The resurrected man, Stanley Vance, was a career criminal who had caused onewife to commit suicide through hypnosis, and thus inherited her estate. He is onhis way to doing the same with his current wife, when his brother- in-law killshim, first with chloryl hydrate and then finishing the job with a knife, whileimpersonating a Viennese investor in a room at the Waldorf Hotel. Thus, theyoung Nixon is introduced to the idea of hypnotic control of individuals tofurther criminal ends, pretty much what the CIA’s MK-UL- TRA was all about. Thedoctor who is examining the young woman under the influence of Stanley Vance’shypnotic powers claims that the only doc- tors who would be able to help her haddied during the Middle Ages: in his estimation, she is possessed by an evilspirit. Her brother, Damon, had been dating the Daphne character, but whenStanley Vance—who was believed to be dead—returns at the end of the first act,Damon loses interest in Daphne (whom he had been treating shabbily even earlierin the play, ordering her about like a recalcitrant schoolgirl) and Daphneeventually winds up in the arms of Barry, the worshipful, puppy-like playwright.Oddly, this is what happened in Pat Nixon’s own life, as she was dating othermen when Nixon was pursuing her with totally-focused determination after meetingher on the set of The Dark Tower.Psychohistorian Bruce Mazlish has studied Nixon’s personality from the point ofview that this brief association with the theater when young had influenced hispolitical life.6 Nixon as vice president and president is always talking aboutplaying a role, about acting, and criticizing those whose abil- ity to play arole (politically) are amateurish. Nixon clearly felt that he was a better actorthan most of his fellow politicos—including the Russians—and it is obvious thathe understood that an ability to act, to perform, to pretend was essential tothe success of every politician. In the course of the action in The Dark Tower,one character is certain that the hypnotized wife—who is an actress—is onlyacting and that she is not genuinely “possessed” or under hypnotic influence,but only pretending to be so to enable the murder plot against her hideoushusband to go forward. In the end, the “resurrected” husband is killed and hismurderer goes free; such is the moral of the tale. The Dark Tower originallyopened in New York City on November 25, 1933 at the Morosco Theater, almostthirty years to the day before the assassination of President Kennedy.Nixon, in his earnest, steadfast wooing of Pat even acted as her chauffeur whenshe went out on dates with other men. Imagine the silent resentment, theself-loathing Nixon must have felt during this time. Humiliation of one kind oranother would always dog his life and his career; self-abasement could be viewedas romantic idealism, though, with enough spin, and Nixon would get his own backin later years as he consistently humiliated Pat in public and, it is claimed,even beat her on occasion. For a long time Pat Ryan avoided Nixon, not findingherself particularly attracted to him, but by 1940 she finally relented to hisbarrage of love letters and constant attention, and they were married on June21, 1940 (the summer solstice) in a Quaker ceremony near Whittier, California,Nixon’s home town. (She would die almost exactly fifty-three years later, onJune 22, 1993 in New Jersey.) It’s an interesting fact that the Nixons’ youngestdaughter, Julie, married President Eisenhower’s grandson, Dwight DavidEisenhower II, on December 22, 1968, which happens to be the winter solstice.When war broke out in December 1941, Nixon took a job working in Wash- ington,D.C. for the Office of Emergency Management. Tiring of that, he enlisted in theNavy in 1942 and—after a short posting to Quonset, Rhode Island—was sent to thePacific theater, where he served the remainder of the war, becoming a LieutenantCommander in the process. This is where it gets interesting.In 1937, he had gone job-hunting in New York City at two firms that had strongintelligence connections: Donovan, Leisure, Newton and Lombard, of which GeneralWilliam “Wild Bill” Donovan was the founding partner, and Sullivan and Cromwell,which had John Foster Dulles as a senior partner. Donovan, of course, was thegenius behind the OSS; John Foster Dulles was a statesman of world renown andbrother, of course, to Allen Dulles, whowould one day become Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. At this time,Nixon also applied to the FBI but was turned down. The reasons are a littlevague.In 1945, at the war’s end, Nixon—still in uniform—was back on the East Coast,and this time we know even less of what he was doing and for whom. There is onetantalizing reference to the “Bureau of Aeronautics,” which is suggestive of aJack Parsons link, but alas there is nothing else there to work with. What we dohave, however, is evidence that Nixon had been involved—however briefly, howeverperipherally—with Operation Paperclip.Mark Aarons and John Loftus, in The Secret War Against the Jews, refer tointerviews with former Counter Intelligence Corps personnel as well as theCentral Intelligence Group (the forerunner of the CIA), who claim that Nixon hadseen documentation that Allen Dulles wanted kept secret, and that Dulles inreturn offered to help finance Nixon’s run against incumbent CaliforniaCongressman Jerry Voorhis in 1946. (This claim is repeated in their UnholyTrinity.) As Dulles had contacts and business associations with Nazis going backlong before the start of the war, it is possible that the documentation Nixonsaw implicated Dulles in some ugly relationships. However, it mighthave been even more complicated than that.As is discussed more fully in The Nine, Operation Paperclip was a US Governmentprogram to bring over as many Nazi scientists and medical per- sonnel aspossible to the United States to assist in the space program which was, at thattime, a purely military program. The Army and the Navy were both involved, bothfighting over the intellectual spoils (the Air Force at this time was still partof the Army). Allen Dulles was running OSS operations during the war fromSwitzerland, and was in a position to influence the se- lection process. At thesame time, Nazi spymasters such as Reinhard Gehlen were offering their servicesto the Americans in their new war against the Soviet Union. President Truman haddisbanded the OSS in October 1945, but had created the Central IntelligenceGroup in January 1946; the CIA was created in 1947. It was during thisinterregnum reshuffling of experienced intelligence personnel that Richard Nixonfound himself on the East Coast, in some mysterious capacity concerning a reviewof captured Nazi records and documents, ostensibly for the Navy. And it was thisexperience that gave Nixon some very valuable connections, for when it came timeto go after alleged Communist spy Alger Hiss, he had the Dulles family on hisside, providing him with sensitive intelligence information that would confirmHiss’ Communist sympathies.The Dulles family had long and extensive ties to the Nazi underground, and hadbeen laundering Nazi money for decades. They were not alone in this. As Aaronsand Loftus demonstrate, the Bush family was so heavily involved in “trading withthe enemy” that some of their company assets were seized by the US government in1942. Nixon had stumbled on to the Dulleses’ own dirty laundry, and Allen Dullestook Nixon under his wing, grooming him for a position of power in Washington.Somehow, this information never makes its way into the authorized biographies.This exposure to Nazism—Nixon’s war was, after all, in the Pacific against theJapanese—was not to be Nixon’s last. As the years went by, Nixon would findhimself involved in protecting known Nazis in the United States, and usingneo-Nazis in anti-Democrat “dirty tricks.” And when the axe fell on Chile onSeptember 11, 1973, it was once again Nixon calling the shots, with assistancefrom his Nazi admirers at Colonia Dignidad.In the meantime, however, he was being groomed (and financed) by a con- sortiumof businessmen, right-wing activists, intelligence agents, and Mafia dons, fromthe very beginning of his political career. It all started with a letter fromCalifornia, urging Nixon to run against Jerry Voorhis.In September 1945, the manager of the Whittier, California branch of the Bank ofAmerica—Herman Perry—contacted Nixon by mail and asked him if he would considerrunning against a five-term Democratic veteran, Congress- man Jerry Voorhis.Voorhis seemed unbeatable, a shoo-in for the Democrats in 1946 for a sixth term.The Republicans had no one with any serious chance against him in southernCalifornia, and Nixon—as a lawyer, and a veteran, someone well-known to Perryand the people of Whittier—seemed like a possible candidate to support. Atleast, that is the story.This author finds it difficult to believe that the Republican Party of Califor-nia would have reached so far, to an inexperienced young lawyer just returnedfrom the war, a political non-entity really, to run against such an overallpopular candidate like Voorhis. It’s true he had some political experiencebefore the war, making speeches in support of local Republican candidates andtrying to get a state assembly seat, but nothing came of his efforts and the warinterrupted everyone’s lives. If what Loftus and Aarons say is true in TheSecret War Against The Jews, that Nixon was privy to some unwholesome secretsabout Dulles as early as 1945, then the scenario becomes tighter, if moresinister. It also explains the friendship between Dulles and Nixon, which isotherwise inexplicable.Dulles was urbane, sophisticated, cosmopolitan, multilingual, the very type ofEastern Establishment figure that the socially-awkward Nixon despised. Dulles onhis part should have found very little to admire or find likeable in Nixon.According to Nixon biographer Anthony Summers, “they shared the same worldview,”7which evidently was enough to overcome their personality differences. In anyevent, Dulles seems to have pledged support to Nixon, and support did arrive:from companies such as Standard Oil and other big busi- ness interests who feltthreatened by Voorhis. Voorhis himself was aware that money was flowing intoNixon’s coffers from a “New York financial house” in an effort to remove himfrom office. 8Dulles would play further roles in Nixon’s career, giving him theintelligence information he would need to go after Alger Hiss. The partnershipbetween Allen Dulles and Richard Nixon was truly a Faustian bargain, but it ishard to tell just who is Faust and who is Mephistopheles in this scenario.Further investigation also revealed another twist to the mystery of Nixon’sanonymous backers, this from longtime mobster and associate of Meyer Lansky,Mickey Cohen. As early as the 1946 election, Nixon had been in the pocket oforganized crime. Cohen confessed during his incarceration at Alcatraz to whathad already come to the attention of US government officials as well as Demo-cratic party leaders, that he—on Mafia orders—had supplied funds for Nixon’sfirst campaign against Voorhis, in a meeting arranged by Nixon’s “campaignmanager,” Murray Chotiner. Then, for the 1950 Senate race, Cohen came up with anadditional $75,000 from a group of “associates” in the rackets. The sum of$75,000 in 1950 is equivalent to $660,000 today.9Mickey Cohen was Los Angeles’ answer to Bugsy Siegel in Las Vegas, and indeedthe two had worked together to consolidate the West Coast rackets for the Lanskyoperation, while Lansky busied himself with his casinos in Cuba. When Cohen waseventually convicted and sent to prison, he at first refused to confirm or denythe allegations about Nixon, Chotiner and the Mob, because that would be “likeratting,” but he eventually signed a statement full of details regarding names,dates, places and amounts that could have served as Nixon’s rapsheet. What iseven more worrisome, however, is Mickey Cohen’s relationship to anothercharacter who would figure prominently in American history: Jack Ruby.While Jack Ruby’s connections to organized crime are well known and be- yond anyreasonable doubt, what is perhaps not so well-known is his relation- ship to aformer girlfriend of Mickey Cohen’s, a stripper whose stage name was Candy Barrbut whose real name was Juanita Slusher Dale Phillips Sahakian. Candy Barr hadbeen the object of Mickey’s passionate attentions until she got sent up formarijuana possession, doing four years in a Texas prison and out on parole atthe time of the Kennedy assassination. Ruby was phoning her and visiting herfrom her release in April of 1963 right up to a week or so before Dallas. Itseems clear that this was not to get her to resume her career in one of Ruby’sclubs, since she was under strict orders by her parole board not to go back toher old job. We may never know the real reasons behind Candy Barr’s importanceto Ruby; the assumption is that he was interested in what underworld connectionsshe might have made while in prison,10 but that does not explain the many phonecalls, especially those leading up to the assassination. Ruby was chronicallyshort of cash, though, always on the verge of bankruptcy, so it is quitepossible that he was looking for a Mafia “loan” and was hoping Candy could leadhim to the right people; indeed, remarks he made to associates in the daysbefore the assassination led many to believe that he was on the verge of awindfall. He had met with various organized crime figures in the weeks precedingKennedy’s visit to Dallas, and spoke to many more by phone. None of thisexplains Candy’s role, since Ruby certainly had his own connections to organizedcrime including all manner of loan sharks. Candy’s importance to Ruby wasprobably due only to her long affair with Cohen, and it is possible Ruby wasusing Candy to communicate with Cohen. These circumstances may be totallyirrelevant to the assassination and its aftermath, but we will probably neverknow for sure. What Candy Barr, Mickey Cohen and Jack Ruby did eventually havein common, however, was the same lawyer: Melvin Belli. Beyond that, thedocumentation is slim; but if we put Mickey Cohen together with Murray Chotinerand Richard Nixon on the one hand, and with Candy Barr and Jack Ruby on theother, we have a personality who knew where the bodies were buried. Literally.When he confessed to financing Nixon’s early career, and when Warren Commissioninvestigators uncovered Ruby’s connections to Cohen, alarm bells should havegone off somewhere, but they didn’t.No matter the identity of the secret backers of Richard Nixon, he entered intothe Voorhis campaign with complete focus. He developed his patented form ofslanderous accusations and Red-baiting at this time, attacking Voorhis as a Com-munist when he knew that it was a completely unfounded allegation. According toNixon’s official platform, Voorhis was an instrument of the radical left; this,even though Voorhis was a member of the House Un-American Activities Com- mittee(HUAC) and had an anti-Communist act named after him! To be fair, however,Voorhis was viewed as an ultra-liberal by many; his involvement with HUACincluded hauling American Nazis such as George Moseley and George Deatherage (heof the reformed Knights of the White Camelia) before the Com- mittee as early as1939, criticizing their virulent anti-Semitism.11The other real problem Republicans had with Voorhis, and probably the singlemost important reason they had to take him out in 1946, was of a piece. Voorhishad called for an overhaul of the American monetary system and “the purchase ofthe Federal Reserve System.”12 To American conspiracy theorists, there isprobably nothing more sinister than the Federal Reserve System, which is viewedas a creature of the Illuminati, the Rothschilds, and mysterious foreigninterests that use the Federal Reserve—which is an inde- pendent institution andnot technically a part of the US government—to control America’s financialdestiny (and that of the rest of the world). For Voorhis to come out against theFederal Reserve was tantamount (in the eyes of the conspiriologists) to anattack on the Illuminati themselves. He had also attacked the oil industry aswell as the insurance industry, not to mention the liquor industry. After that,there wasn’t much left to go after except maybe your mother and her apple pie.It seemed as if Jerry Voorhis was going after all of business’ sacred cows, allat once. He had, in effect, signed his own political death warrant and it was upto Tricky Dick to deliver it.A combination of smears, lies, dirty tricks, anti-Communist hysteria and evenanti-Semitism took the day. Registered voters in California would get phonecalls from anonymous callers, asking, “Did you know Jerry Voorhis was aCommunist?”—the same tactic that was used in 2000 against Democratic candidatefor president, Al Gore in Florida (in Spanish this time). Leaflets were printedcharacterizing Voorhis as a tool of “subversive Jews” bent on destroying“Christian America.” This, in 1946: only a year after Nazism was crushed inEurope at a terrible cost of human life, including those of Americans. It isimportant to realize from this episode how many Americans still distrusted Jews,even with the newsreel footage of the death camps fresh in their minds. Perhapsespecially in face of the death camps. It was General Patton, after all, whoclaimed that during the war the Allies were aiming their guns in the wrongdirection and should have sided with the Nazis against the Soviets. It wasPatton who put captured SS officers back in charge of the temporary DP camps,filled with their former prisoners.Dr. Carl Goldberg, a psychiatrist and psychotherapist of some renown who hasheld posts at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine and at New York University,has discussed this phenomenon in his Speaking With The Devil: ExploringSenseless Acts of Evil. In Chapter Twelve of that work, he discusses the case of“Emil,” a Serbian man married to a prosecutor with the US District Attorney’soffice. Emil had participated in an atrocity in the former Yugoslavia before hisemigration to the United States. His father had witnessed the hor- rors of WorldWar II firsthand and had seen the selection process take place at one of thedeath camps. He watched as prisoners, hopeful to the end, were taken to beexecuted. The lesson he learned from this?“It is better to be a Nazi and survive than to be one of those people who are sohelpless and naïve that they have no choice but to pray to God that the Nazisare there to deliver them from harm!”13Emil was taught to hate Jews by his father, to hate what his father saw as theirweakness and victim mentality. As much as his father hated the Nazis who invadedtheir country, he hated their helpless and unresisting victims more. Emil wenton to emulate this attitude, murdering civilians during rag- ing ethnic strifein his own country. This may be a valuable perspective for understanding theflawed spirituality of people like Nixon, and of the party he represented for somany years.In the end, Nixon won the election against Voorhis and went on to greater gloryin the campaign against Helen Gahagan Douglas, who was the victim of even worseRed-baiting and racial slurs. The wife of actor Melvyn Douglas, a man whoseJewish father was born Hesselberg, Helen Douglas was attacked for the mere factthat she was married to a Jew. (Strictly speaking, Merlyn Douglas was notJewish; according to the rabbis, Jewish heritage is passed down through themother’s side.) Both she and Nixon were fighting over a US Senate seat in 1950.Douglas, a New Deal Democrat, was a former opera singer and had been an actresson Broadway. Douglas had also appeared at the National Conference on the GermanProblem, held at the Waldorf-As- toria Hotel in New York City in March 1946.This Conference—arranged by Eleanor Roosevelt—was attended by such anti-Naziluminaries as Albert Einstein and Henry Morgenthau, Jr. The Conference hadtargeted Operation Paperclip, demanding an end to Nazi immigration to the UnitedStates and a more aggressive prosecution of war criminals.14 But there was more to it.As Los Angeles Times political correspondent Ronald Brownstein points out in hisThe Power and the Glitter: The Hollywood-Washington Connection, Helen Douglashad first-hand experience of Nazism. Douglas came from aconservative, Republican background, but was changed by the idealism ofF.D. Roosevelt’s New Deal and switched parties as early as 1932. An operasinger and sometime film actor (she played the lead in the first film madeof the Ryder-Haggard novel, She), she was traveling through Europe for aconcert tour in 1937. In Salzburg, Prague and Vienna she saw anti-Semitism,Nazism, and fear of the Nazi ideology firsthand.The experience changed Helen Douglas’ life. Against the great upheavals wrackingEurope her passion for her career suddenly seemed shortsighted, insular,selfish.… She returned to the United States committed to finding ways to expressherself politically. Her husband, who had seen the same dangerous signs whileaccompanying her on part of the trip, followed suit. In the years leading to thewar, both Douglases would devote as much energy to politics as to the movies,becoming pivotal figures in the struggle between liberals and Communists todefine the agenda for the emerging Hollywood left.15In June, 1936 the Douglases—along with Gloria Stuart, Frederic March and manyothers—formed the Hollywood League Against Nazism which later became theAnti-Nazi League for Defense of American Democracy. In 1944, Helen Douglas waselected a Representative from the State of California, and she threw herselfwholeheartedly into the work of a political figure and one of the few women inthe House. A dedicated anti-Nazi, she could never have been legitimatelyconfused with a Communist or even having Communist sympathies. She frequentlyvoted against the “Hollywood left” in favor of the Marshall Plan, for instance,and against the candidacy of Henry Wallace. But she was an outspoken anti-Naziand was completely against the importation of Nazi war criminals under OperationPaperclip, and she made her position abundantly clear.This type of activity was an attack on the heart of the Dulles/Nixon agenda, ofcourse. Although she was as anti-Communist as Nixon, she also took a leaf fromthe Voorhis book on big business and especially oil business, attacking the oilcompanies for their rape of southern California. For this reason alone, theRepublicans knew she had to be stopped, as they had stopped Voorhis before her.Nixon could not effectively attack her on policy, but that was never his strongpoint anyway. Instead, he began a vicious smear campaign which portrayed Douglasas a Communist, and a whisper campaign—again by phone—reminding voters that shewas married to a Jew. This bugaboo combination of Communist and Jew wasprecisely that used by the Nazis in their hate campaigns against the rest of theworld; all that was missing to make a Heinrich Himmler proud would be areference to the threat of global Freemasonry.Nixon—and his anonymous backers—got their way, and he beat Douglas in the 1950election, thereby winning his seat in the US Senate. At thirty- seven, Nixon wasa Senator in Washington and within striking distance of the Presidency.Victor Lasky, a Nixon croney and political hack who worked for Nixon’s campaignand who was friendly with mob fixer Murray Chotiner, wrote a book entitled, withunintended irony, It Didn’t Start With Watergate, in which he defended Nixon atthe expense of the Kennedys and other Democrats. He had a long history of thissort of thing, and had written JFK: The Man and the Myth and the equallylugubrious Robert F. Kennedy: the Myth and the Man. The author has to agree withLasky on one point, and that is that “it” truly didn’t start with Watergate atall. Nixon’s low cunning did not only comprise the manipulation of theelectorate in 1946, 1950, 1952, 1960, 1962, 1968 and the bugging of DemocraticNational Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in 1972. In fact, itstarted in 1945 and continued throughout his career; but the crimes for which hewas not impeached or held accountable during his life were, if anything, moreheinous than even Lasky could imagine, and may have resulted in the loss ofthousands of American lives.UNHOLY TRINITYIn Rome itself, the transit point of the escape routes, a vast amount was done.With its own immense resources, the Church helped many of us to go overseas. Inthis manner, in quiet and secrecy, the demented victors’ mad craving for revengeand retribution could be effectively counteracted.—Nazi Ace Colonel Hans Ulrich Rudel, Kufstein 197016According to Charles Colson, the aide who later turned to God and became a layminister, Nixon had considered converting to Catholicism before the 1972election, having come to be convinced that Catholics represented “the realAmerica.”—Anthony Summers, The Arrogance of Power17While much of the story behind the Dulles-Nixon partnership has been sanitized,and sensitive material remains classified to this day, there is enough in thepublic record concerning Nixon’s support of Nazi war criminals to afford us anhonest gaze at this aspect of American history. Most Americans have had littleexposure to the Byzantine machinations of the postwar émigré community in theUnited States. Many would be scandalized to learn of American support for menwho caused death and atrocity during the war on the side of the Nazis; many morewould be outraged to realize that the Catholic Church was a major factor in theescape of fugitive Nazis to countries all over the world. Still others would beconfused by the plethora of Eastern Orthodox churches, idiosyncratic priests,spies and double agents, former SS officers, Republican Party flacks, SouthAmerican political movements, captains of industry, Middle Eastern intelligenceoperations, multinational corporations and unorthodox banking practices thatform the real structure of a network of resurgent fascism, a kind of Nazismnouveau, equal in everything but swastika armbands and Furtwaengler conductingThe Ring. It is impossible to go into all of this in any great detail here;there are a number of books, however, for the interested reader who wants topursue this story further, such as Christopher Simpson’s essential Blowback, hisThe Splendid Blond Beast, and the equally important Unholy Trinity by Aarons andLoftus. What we will do is give a brief outline of what was going on after thewar, and how Nixon and other Republican Party leaders became enmeshed in anunforgiving web of collaboration with the most despicable enemy the TwentiethCentury had to offer.The Nazi Party was a cult. Anyone who believes that the Nuremberg rallies, thespeeches by Hitler, Rosenberg, Himmler, Hess and the others, and the swastikaitself are all emblems of a traditional political party has not looked toocarefully or too deeply at the phenomenon. In fact, with the swastika—amystical, religious and occult glyph with ancient associations all over theglobe—the Nazis were telling the whole world what they were about; it is a sadfact that no one really listened. The nationalist policies of the Third Reichwere a manifestation in the mundane world of a philosophy that wastranscendent—incorporating race, religion, architecture, astronomy, medicine,war, and politics only as a continuation of war by other means. The Holocausthad no political purpose; the tremendous expense in terms of time, money andpersonnel to keep the ovens burning had no political or military advantage tothe Reich. It was a crusade against a race, a religion and a philosophy that theReich found abhorrent.Fascism is the elevation of one’s own country above all others, and theelevation of the state above the individual. It is, in essence, an assault onthe rest of the world and is more easily sustained if national policy assumes aracial superiority over all other races, coupled with a belief in its ownstructural superiority: i.e., its economic system, its system of government,perhaps even its geographical location. In countries which enjoy a mix of races,this idea of superiority is more difficult to sustain, since its own citizenshave come from other countries and have some—if only sentimental orcultural—allegiances there. In that case, it is important todisregard—officially—any hint of racial superiority and instead focus oneconomic and political (i.e., ideological) differences. In any event, theconcerns of one’s own state are of absolute importance on a cosmic level, andthe rights and concerns of the citizens of one’s own or other countries becomenegligible. Thus, a foreign policy which undermines the sovereignty of othernations is acceptable.In the days of Nazi Germany, race and nationalism went hand-in-hand. There wasno way to separate the two. All other races were deemed inferior to thepure-blooded German. Attacks on other countries were considered normal andjustified. In fact, Germans considered themselves spiritually su- perior to Jewsand members of other races. Judeao-Christianity was viewed as a spiritualaberration, a disease that had to be eradicated. If a woman slept with a Jewishman, as an example, she was considered tainted by some sort of mystical Jewishessence and was therefore lost to the race. The Nazis were thus in the midst ofa spiritual war of light against darkness, of the Aryan versus the Semite andthe Slav, of the German against the Jew, the Arab, the African, the Asian, theLatin. The war was elevated to that of an astral conflict, a cosmologicalstruggle for survival.With the defeat of Nazi Germany at the end of World War II, fascism did not goaway. How could it?It was strong enough in Italy and Germany (and Austria, and many othercountries) to cause tremendous physical dislocation, the murder of millions ofcivilians, the deaths of millions of combatants, and the redrawing of the map ofEurope. It was tantamount to a religious faith, a mystic belief in nationalsuperiority and racial purity. It took anti-Semitism to its logical conclusion,redrawing the spiritual and genetic map (in the eyes of the Nazis, the samething) of Europe as well. A military defeat was not enough to discredit thefaith in the eyes of its true believers. In fact, to some it made Nazism evenmore romantic. The Nuremberg trials were considered a sham and a hoax by theNazi war criminals fleeing along the rat lines into South America and otherhavens, a spiteful and vengeful exercise on behalf of the “demented victors,”with no moral or ethical message worth taking away, no lesson to be learned. TheAllies were preaching to their own choir; the sinners were still plotting in thebasement. It would take more than bullets to kill off Nazism and fascism. Afterall, Christianity itself lived underground for almost three hundred years beforeit became a state religion.Thus, in the damp and overheated postwar world, Nazism mutated, virus- like, andbecame confused with—one could say it “infected”—patriotism. What began as a warof Aryans versus Semites and sub-humans became the West versus the East,Capitalist versus Communist. The Communists were “godless” and therefore evil ina very real moral and spiritual sense. Stories were told of the persecution ofreligion in Communist nations, such as the Soviet Union and the People’sRepublic of China. The Catholic Church went underground in these countries;Masses were celebrated in secret. Priests were hunted down and imprisoned,tortured, executed. Membership in any religious organization was grounds forexpulsion from the Communist Party, and consequent penalties in terms ofhousing, wages, education, etc.The Vatican, therefore, was under attack in Eastern Europe and China. At thesame time, its underground network of priests was a potentially valuableintelligence asset. The Church found itself cooperating with Western intel-ligence services against Communist countries. This meant that, in order tocooperate with the United States Central Intelligence Agency, they had tocooperate with the Nazis. The Gehlen Organization became a creature of the CIAin Europe, and once again the Vatican and the Nazis were in agreement accordingto both philosophy and tactics. The Vatican ran interference for war criminalsescaping to less hostile nations on the one hand, and worked with resuscitatedNazi intelligence organs on the other. The Cold War had started, and everypolitical leader in the West made sure that it was painted in Manichaean termsof Light versus Darkness, of Good versus Evil. After all, the Soviet Union was,according to President Reagan, the “Evil Empire,” and not merely a sovereignnation with whom we disagreed on matters of economics, human rights and foreignpolicy. The Soviet Union was evil; it represented the forces of Satan on earthand had to be destroyed.To those who believe the author is indulging in hysterical hyperbole, it is onlynecessary to refer to the speeches made by a long line of postwar Republicanpresidents and presidential candidates on the issue. Since they can be construedas “spin,” however, the skeptical can review the record on support for Naziindividuals and political organizations in the United States by Republicanleadership as they girded their loins for battle with the Communists.(This is not an attack on the Republican Party itself; not every Republi- can isa closet Nazi, and it is not the intention of the author to suggest this.Probably very few Republicans are even aware of the extent to which their Partyhas embraced the politics of war criminals in their midst. However, as otherauthors have pointed out with mountains of documentation and rivers of primarysource material, the Republicans seem to have embraced the Nazi underground withmuch more zeal and commitment than the Democrats, both as individuals and as aParty. There is a reason for this, and as we delve more deeply into America’spolitical subconscious we may reveal it in all its ugliness and satanic glory.)To understand the degree to which resurgent fascism and refugee Nazism haveinfluenced the political direction of the United States (including its for- eignpolicy), it is necessary to examine the role that Eastern European ethnic groupshave played in the postwar years, forming voting blocs on the one hand, andmaking themselves essential to Western intelligence operations on the other. Itis also necessary to examine the political allegiances and philosophies of thesegroups before they came to the United States. In many cases, these werenationalist organizations that had actively resisted Soviet Communism and, inthe process, turned to fascist, extreme right-wing support, adoptinganti-Semitism and other racial ideologies from the Nazis. The fact that EasternOrthodox churches—the dominant religious group in Eastern Europe—are alsointensely nationalistic and to a certain extent anti-Semitic (at least, no lessthan the Catholic Church in that era) made the alliance between Nazism andOrthodoxy inevitable. The Nazis welcomed the political and military support ofthese militias, even though the Slavs were considered “sub-human” and theirreligions anathema, and ripe for the ovens one day once the war was over andNazi hegemony assured. This type of cynicism was identical to that of RichardNixon, for instance, whose anti-Semitism did not preclude him from supportingIsrael or hiring Henry Kissinger. Power, after all, has its own ideology.The split between the Eastern Orthodox churches and the Roman Catholic Churchtook place on July 16, 1054. The then Patriarch of Constantinople, Cerularius,rejected the claim of Pope Leo IX to universal leadership of Christendom. Untilthat time, all national Christian churches had been autocephalous, i.e., withtheir own head, or patriarch. There had been no universal ruler to whom allchurches owed their allegiance regardless of the country in which they werelocated. Leo, in an attempt to consolidate politi- cal power over all Christiancountries, was demanding allegiance from the Greek Patriarch, which would havegiven him the East. Instead, as a result of Cerularius’ refusal to kow-tow tothe Pope, he and his entire Church were excommunicated.Christianity at that time was already geographically and culturally divided. Thefirst important political leader who embraced the Christian faith was the RomanEmperor Constantine, who elevated Christianity to the status of a statereligion, while moving the capitol to the ancient city of Byzantium, renamedConstantinople (what is now Istanbul). It retained this status for well over amillennium, throughout the illustrious history of the Byzantine Empire. Aspolitical power in the West in the centuries after Constantine, however,switched from Constantinople back to Rome, so did the emphasis on purely“Western” interpretations of Christianity.Until the Catholic Church became dominant in the West, the religious services ofthe Church had always been held in local languages. Thus, the Greeks celebratedMass (called the “Divine Liturgy”) in Greek; in Eastern Europe, Greekmissionaries Cyril and Methodius developed the Slavonic al- phabet and alanguage called Church Slavonic: a brilliant attempt to provide a unifiedlanguage for the many disparate ethnicities to be found in what is now Russia,Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Serbia, etc. The alphabet ofthis language was based on the Greek alphabet and called “Kyrillic” after Cyrilwho invented it. The language itself was a kind of Slavic Esperanto, in whichmuch of the service could be understood by everyone, and all of it by no one!The emphasis on local language (vernacular) celebration of the Church servicesis a hallmark of Eastern Orthodoxy, and to this day one can experience thisspirituality in Greek, Arabic, Serbian, Russian, Ukrainian, and many otherlanguages. The local churches were also permitted to add cultural details oftheir own, such as the Easter eggs which are always red in Greece but which aremulti-colored and fantastically de- signed in the Eastern European countries,etc. In addition, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, for example, is aPatriarch. So also is the leader of the Greek Orthodox Church and all of thevarious national Orthodox Churches. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch is considered“first among equals” but the emphasis is on “equals.” Each national churchconducts its own af- fairs internally, without reference to the “spiritualheadquarters” in Greece. Thus, Eastern Orthodoxy was always nationalistic, fromthe very beginning, and this provided a potential recruiting ground for moreextreme forms of nationalistic political expression, such as Nazism.By contrast, Roman Catholicism was … well, just that. Roman Catholi- cism. Theofficial language was Latin, no matter in what country one found oneself. Andthe leader was the Pope, in Rome. Whereas Eastern Orthodoxy was a “distributedsystem” of leadership and ritual, Roman Catholicism was strictly hierarchical,with the Pope at the top, followed by cardinals and then bishops, down topriests and the faithful. In 800 A.d., when Charlemagne proclaimed himselfEmperor of the “Holy Roman Empire,” the handwriting was on the wall. And, assuccessive Muslim invasions of Turkey and Eastern Europe weakened the ByzantineEmpire, the political power of the Eastern Church in Europe also waned.The Byzantine Empire fell to Sultan Mohammed II in 1453. Oddly, though, theSultan made the Greek Orthodox patriarch the ethnarch of all the Greeks in theOttoman empire, in effect making him a civil authority as well as a religiousone. This enabled the survival—if not the flourishing growth—of Greek Orthodoxy.Possibly the Sultan thought of using the Eastern Orthodox churches as a toolagainst his ultimate enemy, the Holy Roman Empire. After all, the EasternOrthodox Churches had suffered from invad- ing Catholic armies during theCrusades, which had witnessed the sacking of Constantinople, the burning ofOrthodox churches and the murder of Orthodox priests: a campaign as ruthless asthat against the Muslim enemies in the Holy Land; and thus the Sultan could makea case that the sympathies of the Orthodox should rest with the Ottomans. Itwould not be the last time the Eastern Orthodox churches were politicallymanipulated this way.The Orthodox churches are called “Orthodox” because they follow the form ofChristianity as it was practiced since early times. The Divine Liturgy of St.John Chrysostom is about three hours in length, no matter in which language itis celebrated. The Catholic Mass is an abbreviated form of this same Lit- urgy,cut down to about forty-five minutes. There are many other differences,including the strange pre-Liturgy ritual in which the crucifixion of Christ isre-enacted with loaves of bread and wine, and a golden knife: a somewhat Gnosticsurvival perhaps reflective of the Church’s eastern origins.Catholicism, on the other hand, modified its rituals considerably through theyears. Whereas Eastern Orthodoxy seems frozen in time circa 1000 A.d., the RomanCatholic Church has undergone many transformations and has constantly evolvedsince the break with Orthodoxy. Ironically, however, the changes they havemade—and contemplated—would bring the Church back to where the Eastern Orthodoxalready exist. The Vatican II decision to permit local churches to celebrateMass in the local dialects—considered a major con- cession at the time—is merelywhat the Orthodox have been doing since the beginning. The Orthodox also have amarried priesthood (which the Catholics also had for hundreds of years), and aform of confession in which priest and penitent face each other rather than in aconfessional box, among many other practices that would be considered modern and“enlightened” today.The Catholic Church, in an effort to attract Orthodox laity to the Papal fold,accepted what is known as Uniate or Eastern Rite Catholics. In this hybrid formof Catholicism, the beliefs of the people—including the all-im- portantallegiance to the Roman Pope—are Catholic. The rituals, however, are EasternOrthodox. Thus, with the Uniates, the Church enjoys the allegiance of someEastern European and Middle Eastern Christians while the latter can keep therituals with which they are the most familiar. The Church extends its politicalpower into these otherwise impenetrable countries using this method. This becamean important issue during World War II, when the Uniates were utilized as a kindof Vatican intelligence network against the Reds.The groups most openly hostile to Communism and most open to Nazi support wereUkrainian, Croatian, Romanian, and Hungarian nationalists. The Hungarians andCroatians were, by and large, Roman Catholic and re- ceived tremendous supportfrom the Catholic Church both in their actions against Soviet Communism as wellas in intelligence operations and politi- cal action in support of Intermariumand other pan-Slavic cabals, support that would eventually earn these Nazi andpro-Nazi criminals safe haven in North and South America. The Ukrainians andRomanians were largely Eastern Orthodox or Eastern-Rite (Uniate) Catholics. TheRussian Orthodox churches themselves were divided between those who supportedthe Moscow Patriarchate (largely seen, and with reason, to be an instrument ofthe Soviet government) and those whose bishops fled Russia at the time of the1917 revolution and who wished to distance themselves from any dominance by theMoscow hierarchy (a group of bishops known, loosely, as the Synod or moreformally as the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia or ROCOR). Whereas thislatter policy seemed reasonable from a political perspective, it raised doubtsabout the canonicity (ecclesiastical legality) of these break-away groups, aproblem that need not concern us here at the moment, but which has caused manydislocations of those Eastern churches based in the United States and Canada,especially after the fall of Soviet Communism. In New York City, where the twoRussian churches have their American headquarters, the Moscow Patriarchate isknown to insiders as “Ninety-Eighth Street” and ROCOR is known as “Ninety-ThirdStreet,” due to the locations of their respective cathedrals.In addition, groups like the Serbian Orthodox churches were actively sup-pressed by the Croatian Catholics operating in what would become Yugoslavia,their parishioners forced to convert to Catholicism or be killed, and sometimesboth. Testimony has come down to us of entire Serbian Orthodox congre- gationsbeing forced through a conversion ceremony in a Croatian Catholic church, andthen machine-gunned outside the church’s walls moments later. Catholic priestsand monks were responsible for hideous atrocities in Serbia and Croatia duringthe war; in one case, a Franciscan priest was enthusiasti- cally in charge of aconcentration camp. Croatian Catholics also perpetrated gross atrocities againstthe indigenous Jewish populations of Croatia under the banner of the dreadUstasch, the rabidly pro-Nazi political and military organization of World WarII Croatia. It would be the Ustasch that would benefit greatly from Vaticansupport both during and after the war, as Father Draganovic ensured that hiscountrymen would never stand trial for the war crimes for which they had beenindicted, but would instead flee to the four corners of the earth, where theywould take up their banners again.Further, countries such as Slovakia—which were mostly Roman Catho- lic—activelysupported Hitler during the war. In Slovakia’s case, Hitler prom- ised thepeople independence from the Czechs, with whom they had been artificially matedafter the end of World War I. The Slovak leader during the war was MonsignorTiso, a pro-Nazi Catholic prelate who was responsible for pogroms against theJews in his own country.In the Ukraine, the situation was, if anything, even more complex. Two rivalreligious institutions vied for the loyalty of Ukrainian Christians: theUkrainian Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Uniates. In both cases, the Nazisused their hatred of Soviet Communism to enlist their aid as militia againstRussia: providing training, uniforms, weapons and leadership, just as they didfor the Croatian Ustasch and the Romanian Iron Guard. The Nazis effectivelyunleashed the violence and rage against the Russians that had been buildingsince the Revolution, when the Soviets had made every attempt to eradicate boththe religion and the culture of the indigenous peoples of the region. They alsounleashed Ukrainian anti-Semitism, and they did all this using the collaborationof the Vatican.…the debacle had been predominantly the responsibility of the tsar, his min-isters, the whole state apparatus, and their policies over many years, which hadRussia involved in a war for which it was not prepared and that it could notwin. And so the search got under way, as it did in Germany one year later, forthe “sinister forces,” the “hidden hand,” that had administered the “stab in theback” that had led to the catastrophe.Walter Laqueur, Black Hundred: The Rise of the Extreme Right in Russia18By early 1943, virtually every one of the 800,000 Ukrainian Jews had been killedby the Ukrainian Nazis. Members of the Ukrainian SS—largely com- posed of UniateChristians who owed their spiritual allegiance to Rome—were enthusiastic intheir support of the Final Solution; the Nazis had promised to overlook boththeir religion and their race in order to enlist their aid against their commonenemies: Communists and Jews. Under other circumstances, being both Christianand Slav was enough to be considered sub-human and unworthy of the SS uniform.Forty thousand Ukrainians volunteered for duty in the specially-created SSGalicia Division—twice the number required, overwhelming the SS leadership. Inthe end twenty thousand were accepted, trained, and armed. Then, as the troopspassed by in review, Archbishop Szepticky blessed the SS Division, urging themto glory.They would follow in the footsteps of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists(OUN) under Stephen Bandera and Janoslav Stetsko. The OUN organized the pogromof the Jews of Lvov, where six thousand were murdered in only three days andthree nights of savagery in 1941. Stetsko would later become president of theAnti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations (ABN), a merger of the OUN and White RussianNazis, with Mikolai Abramtchik (the Byelorussian Nazi Minister of Intelligence)as vice president, along with war criminal Stanislav Stankievich and many otherrenegade Nazi leaders. The ABN was being run by British Intelligence, under thesupervision of Kim Philby; Philby would later be revealed as a double agent,working in reality for Soviet intelligence, which had penetrated the ethnicanti-Communist émigré groups since the earliest days of the Revolution.And let us not forget the Croatians.Let us look at the example of Bishop Ivan Saric, known as the Hangman ofSarajevo, whose slaughter of Croatian Serbs was legendary; or Father JosipBujanovic, who—as the Ustaschi leader of Gospic—presided over the massacre ofSerbian Orthodox peasants, before escaping to Australia at the end of the war,courtesy of the Vatican rat lines. Or Father Vilim Cecelja, a lieutenant colonelin the Ustaschi militia who was named war criminal number 7103 by the Yugoslavgovernment, but who also emigrated to Australia, where he became important inthe creation of Nazi and Ustaschi cells. Or Father Dragutin Kamber, theconcentration camp commandant of Doboj, who slaughtered Serbian Orthodox priestsand incited the wholesale massacre of Serbs in Bosnia.Thus, the religious and political tapestries of these Eastern European countriesare varied and their histories complex and interrelated to a great degree. EvenUkraine’s status was always a matter for debate, since Ukraine was considered tobe part of Russia from early times, though large parts of Ukraine had beenannexed by Poland, thus causing some political wrestling over the issue of theUkrainian Waffen SS Division “Galicia.” Were the Ukrainians captured at the endof the war, serving in German uniforms under German officers with Germantraining really Ukrainians and therefore Russians to be deported back to themotherland, or were they in reality Polish citizens and therefore not part ofthe Yalta agreement which would have surrendered them to the Soviets?Regardless, the SS Galicia Division was responsible for pogroms and atrocitiesthe equal of any other SS division during the war, and it was only due to acomplicated arrangement between the Catholic Church on the one hand and Westernintelligence agencies on the other that they were given over to the protectionof the British via General Pavlo Shandruk, who had commanded the SS GaliciaDivision in its final months. Shandruk emigrated to the United States after thewar, and was buried in the cemetery adjacent to Ukrainian Orthodox Churchheadquarters in Bound Brook, New Jersey… as a war hero.Many fleeing Ukrainian Catholics had switched allegiance to the more fiercelynationalistic Ukrainian Orthodox Church, and it was this same church thatconsecrated renegade Romanian Iron Guard commandant and instigator of the 1941pogrom of Bucharest, Valerian Trifa, as a Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Churchin America in 1952—even though he had no qualifications whatsoever as a bishop,had never been a priest or even an altar boy, and had no theological training atall. Trifa went on to create cells of Romanian Nazi “priests” under church coverthroughout North America and in other countries, right up to his eventualdeportation from the US in 1984.When the Eisenhower-Nixon campaign of 1952 was successful in depict- ing theDemocrats as “soft on Communism,” it attracted the political and financialsupport of these émigré groups all across the country. A special “EthnicDivision” was created at campaign headquarters to ensure that the Ukrainian,Romanian, Slovak, Croatian, etc. vote was turned out in support of the formerWorld War II Commander-in-Chief of Allied forces in Europe and his Red-baiting,anti-Semitic vice-presidential candidate. The Republi- cans had cornered themarket on Eastern European hatred of Communism, and had promised a vigorouscampaign to win back the motherlands from Soviet domination.It is vitally important to understand that this was not a post-World War IIaberration. This was policy and had been in place since the first World War,which is when the Dulles brothers cut their eye teeth on foreign affairs andfound themselves agitating for a strong postwar Germany to stand as a buf- ferstate against the Bolshevik Revolution that had taken power in Moscow andassassinated the royal family of Nicholas and Alexandra, and which was thenstruggling with volkisch groups such as the Thule Gesellschaft for domi- nancein Germany. Allen Dulles was already in an intelligence position in Switzerlandduring the first World War, developing the contacts and networks he would needas the years went by. John Foster Dulles was already in the State Departmentduring World War I. Their uncle, Robert Lansing, was President Woodrow Wilson’sSecretary of State, an ultra-conservative when it came to assigning blame forwar crimes in World War I, who insisted that individual countries be responsiblefor prosecuting their own war crimes; from Lansing’s point of view, the rightpeople to judge what was and was not a war crime—what was and was not necessaryfor the preservation of the state—was the military leadership of each individualnation! In other words, the fox should guard the hen house. He objected to theidea of atrocities and “crimes against humanity”; it smacked too much ofinternationalism, which he opposed. Thus, if the German Army had committedatrocities then let the German Army prosecute their own troops. It should be aninternal matter, of no concern to other nations.Thus, Allen Dulles, John Foster Dulles, and their uncle Robert Lansing hadalready formulated a geopolitical strategy that they would implement not only atthe end of World War I, but consistently through the postwar years, throughWorld War II and beyond. It involved strengthening Germany as a guardian againstthe spread of European Bolshevism and Communism, and the creation of a cordonsanitaire composed of Eastern European countries to hold back Russianexpansionism. The Dulles brothers actively courted Nazi officials in the1930s—as did such American concerns as the Ford Motor Company and IBM—with noscruples about the type of institutionalized anti-Semitism that Hitler and hiscolleagues were planning for Germany and the Occupied Territories. While theDemocratic president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, saw Nazism as an evil that had tobe confronted and covertly plotted ways to bring America into the war againstHitler, the Republicans in Congress were talking about isolationism andappeasement: the continuing evolution of the Dulles strategy that had begun in1917.Thus, when, as we shall see, Nixon began taking bribes from the Greek militaryjunta and ran interference to get President Johnson’s peace initiative withVietnam scuttled in time for the 1968 election, it was business as usual for theRepublican Party. When he commanded that the socialist Allende regime in Chilebe overthrown, and provided the financial support to the truckers’ strikenecessary to cripple Chile’s economy and create instability that would pave theway for General Pinochet and his junta, it was business as usual once again.In the case of the Greek military junta, we can assume that the primary motivewas to get as much funding as possible for Nixon’s election campaign; in otherwords, perhaps it was not ideologically motivated. In the case of Vietnam, wecan assume that it was simply more important to Nixon to win the election thanto halt the bombing and save human life; in other words, his tactics were notmotivated by any desire to crush the North Vietnamese Communist forces but onceagain were purely to win an election. But when we discuss the overthrow ofAllende’s regime—in 1973 after Nixon had been twice-elected and thus could go nofurther politically—then we have to as- sume that ideology was the onlymotivating factor.It does no good to give the benefit of a doubt in one case or even two caseswhen the overwhelming majority of instances of support for right-wing dicta-torships had no other intrinsic value to Nixon or the Republicans in generalexcept to promote a way of life, a political philosophy that was more allied toa kind of misguided German Romanticism—the icily ethereal fascist and Naziideal—than it was to a purely economic or pragmatic political policy. Like theHolocaust itself, which had no military value to the Reich and which divertedvital resources unnecessarily during the height of the war, the Repub- licanpolicy of support for fascists, Nazis, war criminals, and neo-Nazis was (and is)a mission. When we embrace men who have committed unutterable atrocities andshake the hands of men that have been bloodied with the gore of Jews, of womenand children, of Muslims, of Orthodox Christians, of Slavs, of homosexuals, ofGypsies, then we have bartered the soul of the nation for a handful of votes, afew million dollars, and a dubious place in history.Was it worth it? Are we truly any safer now than we were at the end of World WarII?As for the public record, the following chronology may serve as evidence of theexistence of a pro-Nazi cabal lurking in America’s corridors of power.Item: 1945. Operation Overcast and Operation Paperclip bring hun- dreds—some saythousands—of Nazi scientists (many of them—such as General Walter Dornberger,the future boss of Michael Paine at Bell Aero- space—considered war criminals bythe Nuremberg Commission as well as by the rest of the world) to the UnitedStates to assist in the space program, much against the express wishes ofDemocratic President Harry Truman. Other Nazis, including an entire division ofUkrainian Waffen SS, are assisted out of Europe and into safe havens in NorthAmerica, South America, Australasia, and the Middle East by the US StateDepartment, British Intelligence, French Intelligence and the Vatican. Thisoperation will be aided, abetted and covered up by the CIA in the post-waryears, and especially beginning in 1953, when Allen Dulles becomes CIA Director.Dulles’ Chief of Counter Intelligence, James Jesus Angleton ( later the CIA’sVatican liaison), and Frank Wisner are particularly involved, along withthousands of former Nazi “freedom fighters.” What is variously known as DieSpinne, Die Kamaradenwerke, and ODESSA is born, but it is in reality even moreof a Vatican operation than an organization of former SS officers, who areprimarily its beneficiaries.In 1945, Dulles—along with his OSS agent Hans Bernd Gisevius, a former Gestapoofficer—was accused by the US Treasury Department of laundering Nazi funds fromHungary into Switzerland (where Dulles was based). The investigation was droppedwhen the US State Department claimed jurisdic- tion. Gisevius himself wasworking for the massive intelligence operation being run by a White Russian,General Turkul, and known as the Black Orchestra, a Vatican-linked Naziintelligence network that was in reality a miracle of Soviet penetration intothe Western intelligence services, something that Dulles would not have known atthe time. Gisevius, from his position with the Reichsbank, also had excellentconnections in the Nazi intelligence services and had been used by Dulles tocommunicate with Admiral Canaris of the Abwehr during the war.19Richard Nixon was brought in on the money laundering secret by Allen Dulles in1945 or early 1946, of which the Treasury Department investigation had onlyrevealed a small portion. Nixon, in examining captured German documents as aNavy officer after the war, is presumed to have come across evidence of thismoney laundering effort, and of other links between German industrial andbanking firms, OSS officers, and Dulles in particular. This was at the same timeas the US Treasury Department investigation, so it is reasonable to assume thatNixon uncovered elements of a paper trail that would implicate such firms asChase Bank, Morgan Bank, ITT and other companies that have since been revealedto have operated freely in Nazi territory, and often with Nazis on the localboard of directors (such as Nazi Intelligence chief Walter Schellenberg, whokept his board position with ITT throughout the war). Dulles, in return,promised to assist Nixon in his California congressional campaign if he buriedthe data. A life-long partnership was born.In this context, it is worthwhile to note the research of Charles Higham who, inhis American Swastika, speaks of captured SS documentation which clearly showsthat Dulles gave voice to extreme anti-Semitic views in several conversa- tionswith Max von Hohenlohe, a Nazi agent and intimate of Schellenberg, who himselfwas acting on instructions from SS leader Heinrich Himmler. (Higham’s researchwas further corroborated by Christopher Simpson in The Splendid Blond Beast.)Hohenlohe had first cleared Dulles’ credentials with the Spanish Ambassador tothe Vatican, who proclaimed Dulles reliable.20Dulles met with Hohenlohe in Geneva in January 1943 and is recorded—by the SS,remember, in their documents—as stating that in Europe “there must be notoleration of a return of the Jewish power positions” (Higham’s paraphrasing)and that “the Americans were only continuing the war to get rid of the Jews andthat there were people in America who were intending to send the Jews toAfrica.”21 We may choose to give Dulles the benefit of a doubt here and assumethat, if these remarks are correct, he was only trying to win the cooperation ofthe anti-Hitler Nazis with whom he was negotiating. This is basically whatSimpson is saying. Dulles told Hohenlohe that the Allies would not accept Hitleras a leader, but that he was more interested in creating a buffer zone betweenRussia and the rest of Europe, and that a reconstructed, postwar Germany wascentral to the scheme. The extermination of the Jews was a fringe benefit. Eventhe eventual resolution of Czechoslovakia was immaterial to the Allies. In otherwords, the key to this geopolitical problem was anti-Communism, which was codefor Russia. The Allies, according to Dulles, had no interest in the eventualdisposition of European Jewry, understanding that Europe would not tolerate a“return of the Jewish power positions.” The Nazis could do as they liked.But were such anti-Semitic remarks necessary in order to win the cooperation ofmen like intelligence chief Schellenberg and Himmler, on whose behalf Hohenlohewas meeting Dulles? By accepting Himmler as a future leader of Germany, Dulleshad already played any cards he needed. He could have saved countless lives ifhe had made it clear to the Nazis that the United States was firmly against theHolocaust, thus threatening Himmler’s future career if he persisted in genocide.He would have at least made Himmler and Schellenberg stop and think and perhapsslow down the ongoing mass murder, perhaps using it as a bargaining chip ifnothing else. By giving tacit approval to Himmler for the Holocaust—indeed, bysaying that America was only continuing the war to collaborate (there is noother word) in Hitler’s extinction of the Jews—he gave the green light to the SSto go ahead with the Final Solution.Dulles had a wide and deep circle of business contacts, friends, and personalallies in Europe long before the war began. His business interests includedSchroeders Bank, of which he was a director, and his law firm represented manyother German organizations both before and during the war. He had even metHohenlohe in the years before the war. Was it really necessary to give voice tosuch loathsome anti-Semitic sentiments? Or was it, perhaps, a reflection ofAllen Dulles’ genuine feelings in the matter, feelings that would influencedecades of American intelligence activity and possibly open up the CIA toforeign penetration?Further, were the records of these conversations with Dulles among the capturedGerman documents that fell under Nixon’s jaundiced eye during those sensitivepostwar months when Operation Paperclip was being openly condemned by theDemocrats? If so, it is clear why Dulles would have been desperate to have them“deep sixed” and to enlist Nixon’s aid in doing so. A few phone calls fromDulles to business partners on the East Coast would have been enough to get theyoung lawyer’s career off on the right track.Later, the World Commerce Corporation is formed, ostensibly to “rebuildGerman-South American trade networks.” 22The directors are Sir WilliamStephenson (“Intrepid” of British intelligence fame) and General WilliamDonovan, the creator and leader of the OSS. Allen Dulles served as counsel forthe corporation, along with Frank Wisner. Both of these men would, of course,become much better known in their positions at the CIA. It is only one of manyfronts for American intelligence activities that use former Na- zis—many of themaccused war criminals—in important leadership positions. These will include theAnti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations (ABN), the World Anti- Communist League (WACL),of which US Army General and self-professed “black” psychological warfare expertJohn Singlaub of Iran-Contra fame was director, and many others. The Republicanswere regrouping the Nazis: hiding them, recruiting them, using their networksand contacts, giving them visas and citizenship, hailing them as patriots. Andpointing them at Russia.Item: 1946. September 29. Nikolae Malaxa, Romanian Nazi financier andindustrialist, arrives in New York as part of an official Romanian trade mis-sion ... and doesn’t leave.Item: 1946. November. Nixon’s attack on Jerry Voorhis characterizes him as aCommunist and his campaign uses anti-Semitic smears, saying that Voorhis is atool of “subversive Jews.” Nixon is financed from a mysterious East Coast cabalof oil industry executives and industrial tycoons on the one hand (via Dulles),and by organized crime figures around Meyer Lansky and Mickey Cohen on the other(via Murray Chotiner). Nixon wins the election.For those mindful of events discussed in The Nine, this is the same year—and thesame place, Pasadena—where Jack Parsons and L. Ron Hubbard had conducted theoccult operation known as the Babalon Working. It was at the CaliforniaRepublican Assembly (CRA) in Pasadena in 1946 that Richard Nixon was selected torun against Voorhis. The President of the CRA at that time was Meyer Lansky’s“mouthpiece,” Murray Chotiner. For those really titillated by bizarre linkages,Pat Nixon’s birth name was Thelma. The FBI, in investigating the Parsons occultlodge in Pasadena, had mistakenly called it the “Order of Thelma.” (Was PatNixon … Babalon?;-)Item: 1947. The CIA is created, and organizes anti-Soviet intelligence networksin Western and Eastern Europe utilizing former Nazis under Third Reichintelligence chief General Reinhard Gehlen. This will become known as the GehlenOrg, and forms the backbone of anti-Soviet CIA operations in Europe,coordinating its efforts with Vatican officials friendly to the CIA. It will beyears before it is known how deeply this operation was penetrated by Sovietintelligence, due in part to the cabal of Soviet agents within BritishIntelligence, including Kim Philby (the “third man”), Guy Burgess, DonaldMacLean and Anthony Blunt. Nixon and Dulles tour Europe together, Dulles showingNixon the importance of holding the line against Communism using any meansnecessary, including the use of “Freedom Fighters” taken from the ranks ofpro-fascist organizations in Eastern and Central Europe, and led by former Nazisand SS officers.Item: 1948. Prior to the November elections, Dulles—in Operation Blood-stone—authorizes his deputy Frank Wisner to maintain the Vatican’s rat lines ofescaping Nazi fugitives and “freedom fighters” using false paperwork to hoodwinkImmigration officials.Item: 1948. There is an attack on Alger Hiss, a suspected Communist in the StateDepartment. Nixon, the youngest member of the House Un-American ActivitiesCommittee (HUAC) is given confidential information on Hiss by Dulles as well asby the FBI, via Republican presidential hopeful Thomas Dewey. A key figure isCatholic priest Father John Cronin, who had reported to the FBI on Communistpenetration of American labor unions during the War. Cronin receives informationon Hiss from the FBI and then leaks it to Nixon. One of the HUAC investigatorson the Hiss case is FBI agent Lou Russell, who would become involved in theWatergate break-in more than twenty years later. 23The CIA had known of Hiss foryears, and had once considered him for a position as general counsel with theAgency until they came up with information linking him to Communist activitiesin the United States. Dulles and former OSS chief William Donovan tradeinformation on Hiss, and then leak it to Congressman Nixon, thereby ensuringthat Nixon’s political star will rise.Item: 1948. November. Republican candidate Thomas Dewey does not win the USpresidential election, much to the dismay of Dulles and the other intelligenceofficers working the Nazi rat lines and building Nazi intelligence networks inEurope. Truman remains in power, and remains a problem, as he is not inagreement with covert efforts to save Nazi war criminals. Nixon also remains inpower, winning reelection as Congressman.Item: 1949. Cardinal Mindszenty’s show-trial is televised, in which the RomanCatholic prelate robotically confesses to the Hungarian Communist regime’soutlandish charges against him, leading the CIA to opine that “some unknownforce” is compelling him to act this way, the result of some mysteri- ousRussian interrogation technique.24Item: 1949. Wisner’s Nazis begin arriving in the United States. Some find workas broadcasters at Radio Liberty and the Voice of America, both fronts for CIAactivity and black propaganda.Item: 1950. February. Wheeling, West Virginia. Senator Joseph McCar- thy makeshis famous speech claiming Communist penetration of the State Department, usinglines lifted verbatim from a previous Nixon speech on Alger Hiss.Item: 1950. June. The Korean War begins. Nixon’s senatorial campaign againstHelen Gahagan Douglas uses the same Red-baiting and anti-Semitic tactics as inthe Voorhis race, and he keeps referring to her husband’s birth name ofHesselberg as an attempt to remind voters that she is married to a Jew. Nixonwins the election and enters the US Senate.Item: 1950. July 19. Viorel Trifa arrives in New York. Trifa had been com-mandant of the Romanian Iron Guard student movement and responsible for theJanuary 1941 attempted coup and resulting pogrom in the Jewish quarter ofBucharest, in which one thousand Jews were killed, including more than twohundred who were taken to a slaughterhouse and butchered in a grim parody ofkoshering. During the pogrom, Trifa himself visited the cells where Jews werebeing held and murdered them personally. He was a member of the Iron GuardGeneral Staff, along with only two others. He was tried and sentenced inabsentia by the Romanian government, but was living in protection at the GermanEmbassy in Bucharest. At war’s end, Trifa sought asylum in Italy and obtained aposition as a history teacher in a Catholic col- lege. In 1950, he manages toemigrate to the United States by disguising his Nazi past. 25He will take overthe Romanian Orthodox Church in the United States by force,26 become anArchbishop, and in 1955 open a session of the US Congress by invitation of VicePresident Richard Nixon.Item: 1951. Soviet moles in British intelligence, Burgess and MacLean, defect.Kim Philby, the “third man,” is recalled from his post in the United States.Soviet penetration of Dulles’ espionage network of former Nazis is in danger ofbeing exposed, but Dulles remains oblivious.Item: 1951. Nixon introduces a private bill to allow Nikolae Malaxa to stay inthe United States. Malaxa is a Romanian émigré and financier of the Iron Guard,and hence of Trifa’s pogroms against the Jews in which thousands had beentortured and murdered. Malaxa had been a business partner of Hermann Goering,the Nazi Reichsmarschall, and his factories “integrated” with Germany’s duringthe war. The arms supplied to the Iron Guard came from Malaxa’s factories.Malaxa then hired the Nixon law firm in Whittier, California to represent him,and funneled (illegally) $100,000 to the Nixon campaign fund.27Malaxa is allowed to remain in the United States. Other beneficiaries ofMalaxa’s business included the law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell (the law firmof the Dulles brothers), the law firm of Pehle and Loesser (John Pehle, of theTreasury Department, had frozen Malaxa’s assets during the war), and former USImmigration commissioner Ugo Carusi, whom Malaxa hired, as well as a former OSSofficer stationed in Romania, Grady McClaussen, with whom Malaxa had otherbusiness dealings and signed contracts.28Item: 1952. July 4. Viorel (now “Valerian”) Trifa takes the Romanian OrthodoxChurch by force, using a team of former Iron Guardists in a violent assault onchurch headquarters in Grass Lakes, Michigan. Trifa, now callinghimself a bishop, had never even been ordained a priest; he is thus the epitomeof the “wandering bishop,” and his consecration is performed by bishop of theUkrainian Orthodox Church, Ioan (“John”) Teodorovich, who himself fled Sovietsecret police in the Ukraine and came to the United States in 1924 to organizethe Ukrainian Orthodox Church. (While the history of the Ukrainian churches—aswell as Ukrainian history itself—is complex and beyond the scope of this work,it suffices to say that many pro-Nazi Ukrainian nationalists are consideredheroes to this church, and some are even buried in the Church’s cemetery in NewJersey, including one of the organizers of the rescue of the SS GalicianDivision, General Pavlo Shandruk.) In his career as Romanian Archbishop, Trifawill bring many more Iron Guardists into the United States and ordain them aspriests, even though they have had no theological or religious training at all.Instead, under Church “cover,” they establish Iron Guard operations in theUnited States, South America and Europe.Item: 1952. The Republican campaign against the Democrats in the presidentialelections includes a call for the liberation of Eastern Europe: those countriesthat had become “satellites” of the Soviet Union or which had beeninvaded and occupied by the Russians, such as the Baltic states of Latvia,Lithuania and Estonia, as well as Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania,Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia, in addition to the Ukraine and Belarus.The Republican Party at this time creates its “Ethnic Division” to handleconcerns of these minorities in the United States and to bring out the ethnic,i.e., Eastern and Central European, vote. It is also a way to earn campaigncontributions from wealthy donors who have a vested interest in keeping upAmerican pressure on the “captive nations.” Many of these émigrés had been Nazisin their native lands, members of the Romanian Iron Cross andthe Hungarian Arrow Sword, for instance. They go on to achieve leadershippositions within the Ethnic Division and in other groups formed in the 1950s inEurope and the United States to combat Communism. The Republican ticket ofEisenhower and Nixon wins the election, Nixon campaigning as well for JoeMcCarthy. John Foster Dulles is named Secretary of State; his brother AllenDulles becomes Director of the CIA.Item: 1954. Nikolae Malaxa meets with Otto Skorzeny and Juan Peron in BuenosAires, Argentina, according to CIA documents.29 Skorzeny—the famed Nazicommando—has eluded a Nuremberg indictment and, as an international arms dealer,is now running an informal worldwide SS under- ground operation. Juan Peron, ofcourse, is the President of Argentina and a supporter of Italian and Germanfascism. Most escaping Nazis wind up in Argentina at some point during theirexile, and Peron profits financially as well as politically from thearrangement. Skorzeny is based in Franco’s Madrid, where he oversees a resurgentNazi renaissance. The other Iron Guard leaders are still active at this time,soliciting funds from Romanian exiles worldwide and publishing Guardistnewspapers.Malaxa, Trifa and others are eventually implicated, but no action will be takenagainst them except for sporadic attempts to deport Malaxa and Trifa, which faildue to the interference of Vice President Nixon and other Repub- lican leaders.OCTOBER SURPRISEWe’ve just seen some very terrible forces unleashed. Something bad is going tocome of this.--Richard Nixon in 1968, speaking of Robert Kennedy’s declaration as aPresidential candidate 30Most people remember the term “October Surprise” as being linked to a purporteddeal between the Republican Party and the elements holding American hostages inIran. The year was 1980, and forces loyal to the Ayatollah Khomeini had takenthe American Embassy in Teheran the previous year and were holding fifty-twoAmericans prisoner. A deal with the Carter administration which would have hadthe hostages released before the end of the year suddenly went awry; somewitnesses came forward, stating that George Bush, Sr. had asked the Iranians tohold the hostages for a few more weeks until after the November election, toensure the victory at the polls of the Reagan-Bush ticket. This was in returnfor certain concessions. Carter, who believed he could have had a deal with theIranians, suddenly found himself without one. The American electorate, tired ofthe long ordeal and the humiliation of the first American rescue attempt whichfoundered in the desert, elected Reagan, and the rest is history. The hostageswere released on the day of Reagan’s inauguration.What most Americans do not know, however, is that this was not the first timeAmerican lives had been bartered for power. In an earlier October, it had costmany thousands of Vietnamese lives as well. As revealed in the Anthony Summerswork on Nixon mentioned previously, Richard Nixon had performed the samedeplorable maneuver in a desperate attempt to ruin upcoming peace talks,arranged by outgoing President Lyndon B. Johnson. It was in the final weeks ofthe 1968 election and could have been the template for the actions of 1980.Although confirmation of this event comes from various, well-informed andwell-placed sources, perhaps the most damning revelation comes from the womanwho helped arrange the deception: Anna Chennault, the Chinese-born wife (andwidow) of Claire Chennault, the commander of the famous Flying Tigers of WorldWar II. Mrs. Chennault was used as the go-between in a deal that involved Nixon,John Mitchell, South Vietnamese Ambassador to the United States Bui Dem and,ultimately, South Vietnamese President Thieu. The deal was simple: torpedoJohnson’s peace initiative and Nixon (once elected) would prop up Thieu’s regimewith guns and money and a more aggressive stance against the North. Had Thieugone to the peace table with Johnson, it is not certain that he would have leftwith anything more substantial than an uneasy truce and a Demilitarized Zone àla North and South Korea.It would have meant peace, it would have meant the end of war and atrocity andthe suffering of civilian and soldier alike, but that is obviously not whateither Nixon or Thieu had in mind. Thieu agreed, and in the eleventh hour, onlydays before the election, he announced that he would not be a party to the peaceinitiative for various reasons. Nixon beat Vice President Humphrey at the polls,and the war in Vietnam continued for American forces for five more years, withthe deaths of thousands of American troops and hundreds of thousands ofVietnamese casualties. Saigon finally fell over two years later, on April 30,1975: Walpurgisnacht, and the thirtieth anniversary of Hitler’s suicide; a dayheavy with sinister correspondences.That was not all, however.Once he had won the election, betraying America in the process, he thenproceeded to betray Thieu. President Johnson had discovered what Nixon was up toin the last hours of the campaign but was afraid of exposing it until hehad concrete proof in hand. When he did, it was after the election and Nixon’snarrow victory. He then forced Nixon to support a peace initiative in theremaining days of the Johnson administration, lest Johnson himself blow thewhistle on what Nixon had been doing. Nixon, fearing what the exposure of hismachinations would do, accepted the terms. He then asked Mrs. Chennault to goback to Thieu and press him to agree to Johnson’s peace initiative. Chen-nault was furious, of course, and the whole affair was in danger of fallingapart, but Chennault retired behind closed doors and refused to speak to thepress or to expose her role in the affair until many years later; relevant FBIdocuments became declassified in 1999, and the story slowly leaked out anyway.31Nixon’s program in Vietnam did go on, however, regardless of the empty posturingfor peace. Hundreds of American soldiers died while Nixon was runninginterference in October and November of 1968; tens of thousands more would diebefore America’s role in the war was over. Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamesesoldiers and civilians would also die. All of this was defended by HenryKissinger, who believed that Nixon’s “constituency” supported the war and wouldabandon him if Nixon worked too hard for peace. In other words, Nixon’s domesticpolitical future outweighed any consideration of the cost of life. Nixon knewthe war was not winnable; Kissinger knew it. Like something out of The SeventhSeal, they coldly decided to use it as a chess piece in a cynical gambit thathad nothing to do with the war, but everything to do with winning. Yet, theVietnam affair was only one element of the Nixon “game plan” in 1968. The secondphase involved supporting yet another corrupt military government.At the same time as Nixon was jockeying for position against Johnson on Vietnam,he was also cutting a deal with the Greek military junta, and illegallyaccepting huge cash contributions from the generals. This is also covered indetail in Summers’ book, and it deserves summarizing here.32Only the year before, in 1967, the generals took over Greece and turned it intoa police state overnight. Their reign was dramatized in the Costa-Gavras film Z,which boasted a memorable score by Mikis Theodorakis, who had to compose themusic in secret to avoid being arrested … or worse. One of the strangestepisodes of the Nixon campaign was the selection of Maryland Governor SpiroAgnew as his running mate; George Bush had been put forth as a logical vicepresident, but Nixon stunned the convention by choosing the Greek-American Agnewinstead (much, one imagines, to Mr. Bush’s great relief years later!). This isnow believed to be directly linked with events in Greece and Nixon’s friendshipwith the enigmatic Thomas Pappas, who is mentioned in the Oval Office tapes as“good old Tom Pappas,” a guy who was raising hush money for the Watergateburglars. Pappas was a self-made mil-lionaire who started in the grocery business and later wound up with a smallempire of his own in oil and chemicals. He funneled large cash contributionsinto the Nixon war chest, and when Agnew was selected as candidate for vicepresident it appeared to be due to Pappas’ influence.More than that, however, was the willingness of the Greek military junta tofinance the man they saw as their ally in Washington: Richard Nixon. TheDemocrats, who traditionally made human-rights issues a campaign platform,could be expected to give the generals a hard time. They knew they would getsupport from a right-wing Republican … particularly if that Republican had beenpaid off. According to Summers, the sum of $549,000 had beentransferred to Nixon’s campaign in three separate payments between July andOctober of 1968, an amount equivalent to millions of dollars today. The moneyoriginated not with rank-and-file Greek citizens—illegal as thatwould be in any case—but from the Greek Central Intelligence Service, KYP. Thecash would go to Thomas Pappas in Greece, who would then carry the funds himselfto the United States.In other words, the Greek military junta added their very healthy contri- butionto the Nixon war chest to ensure a victory over Hubert Humphrey. Naturally, thiswas a gross violation of American law. It turned Nixon into an unregisteredlobbyist for a foreign power, and it violated US campaign contributionregulations, which forbid any American politician from receiving any kind offinancial contribution from foreign governments or their agents. This did notfaze the candidate, however, since he had been receiving contri- butions fromarms dealer Adnan Khashoggi for years. It would seem that in 1968 the Greekmilitary government bought themselves a Vice President of the United States,with an option to buy the President. They had to stand in line, though, becauseVietnamese President Thieu had the same idea.It seemed as if Nixon could not get enough of dictators and mafia bag men. Asthe years went by, we saw time and again how the Nixon White House supportedmilitary governments and coups all over the world, in every hemisphere, fromVietnam to Chile to Greece. The list of secret financial contributors to Nixon’spolitical career was maintained by his longtime sec- retary, Rose Mary Woods,and was known informally as “Rose Mary’s Baby,” certainly a characterizationmore apt than they realized. As Nixon added a second term after his first, thebodies continued to pile up. The line stretched back through the days he spentas vice president under Eisenhower, when he began work to assassinate FidelCastro and return Cuba to the control of the Lansky mob, and at least as farback as the time he worked with Dulles on the Nazi spy networks that had been“seconded” to the CIA, covering up Soviet penetration of western intelligenceservices in Europe that dated back to the earliest days of the RussianRevolution.As information has come to light in recent years, we now know that the Sovietswere well aware of anti-Communist agitation among the White Rus- sians, as wellas among the various disenfranchised ethnic groups living in the West. Theybegan penetration of these groups shortly after the Revolution, and neverabandoned their intelligence networks in the West. By the time that Dulles andhis British counterparts began using Ukrainian, Hungarian, and White Russianémigré groups to go up against the Soviet Union, they had been so compromised byRussian intelligence as to be virtually useless. Worse, they acted as agentsagainst the West and did untold damage to the Western intelligence services.Dulles and his men, in their hubris, did not suspect that the White Russians ontheir team were agents for the KGB and Soviet military intelligence. By the timethey did, the damage had been done.THE COVENAlthough we have come to know E. Howard Hunt, G. Gordon Liddy, Donald Segretti,James McCord, Chuck Colson and the entire mixed media collage of anti-CastroCubans, CIA officers, FBI agents, White House aides, Mafia bagmen, andNazis-on-the run as “the Plumbers,” or “the President’s Men,” or even “thefinest public servants it has been my privilege to know,” perhaps anotherdesignation is in order, one that is suggested by the title (and subject matter)of one of Howard Hunt’s occult novels: The Coven.Hunt himself lived in a white, wood frame house in suburban Montgom- ery County,where a sign near his mail box read, “Witches Island,” and he wrote severaloccult novels as well as a number of spy-type thrillers under variouspseudonyms. His background with the CIA was extensive, going back nearly to thebeginning of the Agency’s existence; he began his career with the OSS during theWar and was very fond of Allen Dulles, whom he met at that time. His admirationof Richard Nixon also went back to the earliest days of Nixon’s career. He metNixon sometime in 1952 at a restaurant in Washington, D.C. He spoke with himawhile, and gave him a calling card on which he wrote, “My wife and I want tothank you for the magnificent job you are doing for our country.”33 The cardnamed Hunt as an attaché at the US Embassy in Mexico City, where he had beenstationed since 1949, taking up for the CIA where the FBI left off after theCIA’s creation in 1947; Nixon at that time was running for Senator. Twenty yearslater, Nixon was President and Hunt—retired from the Agency—was mastermindingthe break-in at the Watergate Hotel on his behalf.E. Howard Hunt was the inspiration for the Cigarette Man on Chris Carter’stelevision series, The X-Files. According to Carter’s mythology, the CGM wasresponsible for everything from the Bay of Pigs invasion, to the Kennedyassassination, and just about every dirty trick and dirty deed in Americanhistory of the past fifty years. He was also a failed novelist, and thebitterness of a frustrated career behind the typewriter led the CGM to ahard-bitten, cynical approach to life. This very nearly parallels Hunt’s owncareer. Hunt—in his “Eduardo” persona—had been involved deeply with the Bay ofPigs operation, as was then-Vice President Nixon. He was suspected ofinvolvement in the Kennedy assassination, and for years photographs of aderelict who had been arrested close to the assassination site was believed tohave been a photo of Hunt in disguise.Hunt later retired from the CIA during Nixon’s tenure as president—on April 30,1970, the most infamous day on the European witches’ calendar: Walpurgisnacht inGermany or Beltane in the British Isles, something the occult-oriented Hunt(resident of Witches Island) would have known—and took a job at Robert Mullen &Company, a public relations firm that did extensive work for the Howard Hughesempire, on the very next day. One of his colleagues—Douglas Caddy—was the firstlawyer called when the Wa- tergate burglars were arrested. He is depicted in thebook (and film) All The President’s Men as the man who sat in quietly at theburglars’ arraignment and refused to answer any of Woodward’s questions, sayingsimply, “I’m not here. I have nothing to say.”Another colleague at Mullen was Arthur Hochberg, a mysterious individual whovirtually disappeared after Watergate. Hochberg was a CIA action officer who wasstationed variously in Brazil and the Far East, and who was based in Singaporein the early 1970s, setting up and running an overseas office for Mullen. Notmuch PR work was done at the Singapore Mullen or at another Mullen operationcalled Interprogress, as Hochberg’s job had more to do with debriefing Chinesedefectors and running agents against the People’s Republic of China. (HisMandarin Chinese was fluent, as was his Brazilian Portuguese.) The author hastried in vain to obtain corporate records of Hochberg’s opera- tion inSingapore, visiting government offices there and discovering that the files havebeen sanitized: no record was kept of corporate officers or anything else,beyond the dates of the opening and closing of the offices. Attempts to learnmore were firmly discouraged; this, thirty years after the offices were closed.Thus, after all this time, there is still sensitive information connected tothis obscure, Vietnam-era CIA operation in Singapore.Hochberg later went on to work for a company in Queens, New York that soldtransmission systems for trucks and buses, and wound up traveling extensively toAfrica on various business deals, principally to Mauritania: not exactly onone’s list of prime export markets. When the author met him, as a co-worker in1980, Hochberg seemed a little wistful about the good old days at the CIA andwas disappointed in the action taken by Admiral Turner, who was Director of theCIA for a short time, in firing all the old hands in a post-Watergatehouse-cleaning maneuver. Experienced intelligence personnel were suddenlywithout work all over the country; one wonders what they got up to in the yearssince Watergate.G. Gordon Liddy is also an obvious member of the Watergate Coven. A lifelongadmirer of German culture, who was smitten by hearing Hitler’s speeches over aradio when he was a child, he is known to start singing the Horst Wessel song atthe drop of a microphone. While known to the media as the Plumbers, Liddy hadnamed his team for stopping leaks and disrupting the Democratic presidentialcampaign “ODESSA,” after the fabled organiza- tion of former SS officers:It appealed to me because when I organize, I am inclined to think in Ger- manterms and the acronym was also used by a World War II German veteransorganization belonged to by some friends of mine, Organisation Der EmerlingenSchutz Staffel Angehoerigen: ODESSA.34Liddy had inured himself to pain since he was a young man, even going so far asto hold his arm over a flame and gritting his teeth against the intense hurt,giving a whole new meaning to the concept of “burn.” He would turn this into akind of parlor trick in the Watergate era, holding his hand over a flame, andwhen people asked him what the trick was, he would reply, “The trick is notminding.” Few seem to remember that this is a direct reference to the filmLawrence of Arabia, in which Peter O’Toole, playing Lawrence, extinguishes litmatches with his fingertips. He is asked, “What’s the trick, then?” and hereplies, “The trick is in not minding that it hurts.” Lawrence of Arabia was afavorite film of the author’s youth, and I believe I could easily tradequotations from the movie with Liddy, who obviously watched it about as manytimes as I did.He also grew up a Roman Catholic, attending schools in New Jersey run by GermanBenedictines and then by Jesuits, both of whom he admired. It was perhapslogical that Liddy would eventually wind up at the FBI, and in1958 getting posted to Gary, Indiana: the Chicago suburb and center of the steelindustry. The author’s father, brother and sister were all born in Gary,Indiana, and the author’s father went on to some notoriety in Gary in theimmediate postwar period. I cannot help but wonder if Liddy had reviewed myfather’s files.Gary was considered to be a target of Soviet espionage in the 1950s, when bothLiddy and the author and his family lived in the area. My father had beenprominent in something called the Gary School Strike in the fall of 1945, andhad been investigated by the FBI as a possible shill for the Communists. Thisstory is referenced in The Sinatra Files, edited by Tom Kuntz and Phil Kuntz,which is a summary of FBI files on Frank Sinatra throughout his career. Myfather’s name comes up in this collection because of an incident in thecrooner’s life, in which he visited Gary in an attempt to calm the racist feverthat was threatening to erupt into something even uglier.High school students in Gary—including those at my father’s alma mater, FroebelHigh—were boycotting classes over a plan to desegregate the schools. I am notproud to say that my father was considered the leader of the boycott and, thus,a segregationist. His parents had come to America from small min- ing towns ineastern Slovakia, escaping the Austro-Hungarian Empire and coming to the promiseof a better life in the United States. My grandfather truly disliked no oneexcept the Poles. (Polish gangs would raid Slovak towns along the border,stealing and raping, with numbing regularity.) His youngest son, however, foundhimself involved in a high school debate over the question of segregation,and—winning the debate—became an overnight celebrity and an ad hocsegregationist. I never knew if my father had truly been a segrega- tionist atthe age of seventeen, or if he had just found it irresistible to be the centerof attention. Whatever the case, he remained politically conservative andright-wing for the rest of his life.The Gary School Strike became national news. Other schools were follow- ingFroebel’s lead, and it threatened to become a test case for desgregationlegislation. Frank Sinatra—at that time enormously popular with youngpeople—decided he would do what he could to defuse the situation, although noone had actually asked him to do so. He arrived in Gary on November 1,1945 (theCatholic “Holy Day of Obligation”: All Saint’s Day) and addressed a meeting thatnight in the school auditorium. In his address, he claimed that my father,Leonard Levenda, had refused to meet with him, but my father said otherwise,saying that he met briefly with Sinatra before the singer’s ad- dress, when heinformed Sinatra that two men the latter had singled out as instigators of thestrike—men who had attempted to form an all-white PTA and who were active insegregationist circles—had nothing to do with the strike, which was aspontaneous action of the students themselves. One of the men singled out forSinatra’s attack was Julius Danch, characterized by a Gary police captain as astaunch anti-Communist.These were Eastern Europeans, for the most part. Danch was the president of theHungarian Political Club in Gary. (And the reader will remember that Hitler hadmade Slovakia an independent country during the war, and that Catholic MonsignorTiso had been put in charge.) Put anti-Communism and racism together in a singlepackage and it is easy to believe that Nazi sympathies were close at hand. TheFBI, however, believed that Sinatra’s appearance had been arranged by Communistsources, at least in part; indeed, after his appear- ance at Froebel HighSchool, Sinatra became an idol to the Left and was forever afterwards identifiedwith liberal forces in American politics. My grandparents, however, once proudlyshowed me a clipping of the front page of a local Gary newspaper from thatperiod which reported that my father had thrown Sinatra out of his house formaking disparaging comments about their ethnicity.It was my father’s fifteen minutes of fame. From there, he went on to New YorkCity to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts with classmates JackPalance and Grace Kelly. He once acted on the stage with Palance, in A SilverTassie and also performed in Rope (the stage play, not the film). But his actingdays were over by 1950 when I was born and the young family moved back to Garybefore eventually winding up in Chicago. But that is another tale.Liddy, in 1958, would have been familiar with the Gary School Strike, and withthe FBI’s concern that Gary was a target of Soviet espionage. The FBI maintainedan S.I., or Security Index: a list of those individuals believed to be a threatin the event of war with Russia. Did the Bureau believe my father was a threat,or an ally?Liddy went on to greater glory. It is well known that he raided Timothy Leary’sestate at Millbrook in New York, when Liddy was an assistant District Attorney.Liddy and Leary years later put together a kind of comedy routine, in whichLiddy debated Leary on drugs, altered consciousness, alternative politics, andthe like. It was popular for a short time on the college circuit. Liddy is farbetter known, however, for the role he played in the Watergate affair.Another member of the Coven would have been E. Howard Hunt’s boss at Mullen,Robert Bennett. A Mormon, Bennett had lucrative contracts with the Howard Hughesempire. The Mullen Company itself had been a front for the CIA since itsinception in 1959, and Bennett—who later bought the company—was close friendswith such Watergate luminaries as Chuck Col- son. In fact, a close look atRobert Mullen & Company reveals a rich lode of CIA (and Mormon) involvement inthe Watergate affair, and it has become apparent to many that Bennett’s role wasto divert attention away from the CIA and over to the White House. The Mullenoperation also had very close ties to the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency,which was itself a source of many Watergate personalities, as we will see.Bennett personally handled campaign contributions for Nixon and set up dozens ofphony committees to collect funds for the President. He had also worked onNixon’s election campaign in 1968. In fact, much of the plotting of theWatergate break-in took place at Mullen’s offices, which were across the streetfrom Nixon’s CRP: The Committee to Re-Elect the President, more commonly knownas “CREEP.” E. Howard Hunt would meet Gordon Liddy there, as well as JamesMcCord and other conspirators. Although Hunt’s os- tensible role at Mullen wasas a writer—he held the title of vice president at Mullen—he seems to have spentmore time on White House and CIA business than anything else, which isappropriate when you review Mullen’s long history as a CIA front both at homeand abroad. When the Watergate story broke, Bennett spent a lot of timecriss-crossing the United States, giving interviews to the press thateffectively pointed them in the direction of the White House and away from theCIA. We may believe he did the same with Woodward, as he was undoubtedly asource for many of Woodward’s stories—that they were acquainted and metfrequently is not denied by either man.Howard Hughes was surrounded by Mormons as bodyguards and servants. Heapparently trusted the Mormons because they did not drink or smoke; theirclean-cut appearance was appealing to the decrepit billionaire who had a horrorof germs and contagion, and whose personal appearance was—if we are to believepress reports after his death—quite horrifying itself. The lank, unkempt hairand the long, yellowing, fingernails; the gaunt physique and ghostly pallor.… Itseemed unbelievable that a man with so much wealth and so much power could havelived for years in total isolation from the outside world, except for his Mormonbodyguard. That is, until the Clifford Irving affair, when either Howard Hughesor someone pretending to be Howard Hughes made an historic phone call to a groupof reporters telling them that the Irving book—The Autobiography of HowardHughes—was a hoax and making other accusations that rattled the Hughes empire.Strangely, the author himself was peripherally involved in the Irving/Hughesaffair. In the summer of 1970, I joined a firm in Manhattan’s garment districtthat supplied budget-conscious housewives shopping at Woolworth’s, Kresge’s, andAlexanders with knock-offs of designer lingerie. A co-worker—a tall, slenderformer model with an offbeat sense of humor—and I became fast friends. She wasliving with a singer/songwriter on the Upper West Side, a pretty commoncombination in New York City at any time, but especially in those days. As webecame better acquainted, and I spent some evenings at their apartment listeningto music and discussing everything under the sun—her companion was a Vietnamveteran with post-traumatic stress disorder to the extent that he would awakenin the middle of the night and throw his girl- friend to the floor, shouting“Incoming!”—she eventually came to confide in me concerning her past.She had worked for the J. Walter Thompson agency in some capacity as a fashionmodel. (That same agency gave us Dwight Chapin, Ken Cole, Ron Ziegler, LarryHigby and Bob Haldeman: all of Watergate notoriety.) She only got out of thebusiness due to their increasing demands for her to lose even more weight andthe consequent beginning of a dependence on diet medication. They were alsorather secretive, keeping her isolated in hotel rooms in New York and plying herwith drugs to keep her weight down to Twiggy levels. She finally had enough andmanaged to leave; but not before attending a strange meeting with a client of J.Walter Thompson.This meeting took place—if memory serves—at the offices of the agency, andseveral mysterious individuals were in attendance. One she knew only as “theCowboy,” and he indeed did wear a Stetson and dressed in Western attire; anotherwas an aloof, quiet sort that was never identified by name, but who had anintelligence background; still another was a man who would stay friendly withher long after she left the agency, a man known to me only by the name Ackerman.The model was there evidently as some kind of window dressing, and she was keptbusy refilling glasses and looking attractive. Not much of significance wasdiscussed at the meeting, which was conducted with a lot of code words and otherjargon, but the importance of the event was summarized for her later byAckerman.As she related it to me, Howard Hughes had been kidnapped.My mind raced through different scenarios of what might have taken place. Thetheory that made the most sense to me was that Gay and Davis had taken the Managainst his will.-- Robert Maheu35The gist of the story was that CIA had kidnapped Hughes. This was due to thefact that Hughes was enormously wealthy, enormously powerful, but apsychological basket case. He was believed to be a national security risk; hewas involved heavily in politics and had contributed huge sums to both Demo-crats and Republicans, mostly to ensure that his personal projects would beapproved with a minimum of fuss and red tape; but he saw no one, took nomeetings, and had not been seen in public—or even by his own second-in- command,former FBI agent and Castro assassination co-conspirator Robert Maheu—at all.With the exposure of the Glomar Explorer affair and the revelation of a “specialrelationship” between the CIA and the Hughes empire, the intelligence agency haddecided that Howard Hughes was a threat, a loose cannon that had to beneutralized in the interests of national security.According to the story, Hughes had been kidnapped and was being held offshore,in the Bahamas. The Mormons were essential to this operation, as Hughes trustedthem, and made the “snatch” even easier. Watergate had not taken place yet (thatwas two years in the future) and the main players were largely unknown to thepublic. The Clifford Irving episode was also unknown, it having been put intoaction no earlier than January 1971, and had not been announced until December7, 1971 in a press release by publisher McGraw- Hill. Having the Mormonsinvolved, however, became more significant to me as the Watergate affairunfolded and we learned of the existence of the Robert Mullen agency, for whomboth CIA agents E. Howard Hunt and Arthur Hochberg worked and which hadcontracts with the Hughes organization … specifically regarding damage controlover the Clifford Irving affair. Hunt’s boss at Robert Mullen was RobertBennett, a Mormon with important con- nections back in Salt Lake City, whobecame a United States Senator, as was his father before him.No one knew any of this back in 1970 or 1971, unless they were involved. Ibegged the model to go public with her information, or to let me report thestory somehow. She adamantly refused, fearing for her life. When she real- izedthat my reaction was to tell the story to the press, she suddenly would notdiscuss the story with me any further. Although we remained friends, the subjectof Hughes and Ackerman was off limits.Then, the Clifford Irving affair broke in late 1971 and early 1972. TheWatergate break-in was in June 1972. I have often wondered if the Nixonadministration—and especially E. Howard Hunt, one of the Watergate bur-glars—was interested in knowing how much the Democrats knew about the Hugheskidnapping, if in fact such did take place. We have Hunt working for both theCIA and the Mormon Robert Bennett; we have Mormon bodyguards around Hughes inthe last years of his life; we have the Clifford Irving affair, which may havebeen intended to publicize the fact that Howard Hughes was well, at large, andcompos mentis at a time when he was very probably none of those things, orperhaps not even alive. In fact, when Clifford Irving and his collaborator,Richard Susskind began work on a tell-all book about the hoaxed autobiography ofHoward Hughes, the Mullen firm was on top of it. They had been approached for aquote on what it would cost to put Irving and Susskind under surveillance;Watergate burglar James McCord provided the quotation, which was judged to betoo high. Instead Intertel, the private intelligence agency and security firm,was hired to spy on Irving and Susskind and keep them on around-the-clocksurveillance to determine what informa- tion they were planning to reveal intheir book. This seems unusual, to say the least. The Irving book had alreadybeen exposed as a hoax, and Irving a fraud. What value was there to the Hughesorganization in maintaining a very expensive surveillance on Irving after thefact? What could they possibly reveal in their own story of the hoax that couldbe damaging to Hughes?During the series of revelations about Irving and Hughes, several otherinteresting names came up. One was Ackerman. In this case, it was MartyAckerman, Clifford Irving’s lawyer (in civil, not criminal, matters), and Iwondered if this was the Ackerman mentioned by my model friend. Ackerman actedas a kind of literary agent for Irving, and I could not help theorizing thatAckerman would have been perfectly placed to suggest the hoax autobi- ography toIrving at the request of other, interested parties, if Ackerman was working forone or another contingent in the Maheu-Hughes conflagration. Another name thatwould come up was that of Jim Phelan.Phelan’s name was familiar to anyone who had followed the Jim Garrison trial inNew Orleans. Phelan had an agenda where Garrison was concerned, and was part ofthe effort by the media to discredit him entirely. He then turned his sights onClifford Irving and McGraw-Hill in an aggressive maneuver to prove the Irvingbook a hoax. Although Phelan is a journal- ist and reporter—a “freelanceinvestigative reporter” is how he is usually described—he always seems to have asecret agenda of his own. The Irving case was no exception, since he had alreadycollaborated on a book about Hughes by longtime Hughes associate Noah Dietrich.When the Irving book was announced, Phelan smelled a rat and took it uponhimself to dig a little deeper. In so doing, he discovered that the Irving bookwas based largely on his own, unpublished manuscript of the Noah Dietrichmemoirs. It was the final nail in the coffin, as Phelan rushed to McGraw-Hilland proved the truth of his allegations.Recently declassified material on Phelan raises some other, more distress- ing,questions however. It is now known that Phelan was an FBI informant of longstanding, and that during the Garrison investigation into the Ken- nedyassassination, Phelan was taking files from the District Attorney’s office andgiving them to the Bureau.36 It has been further revealed that Phelan was afriend of Bob Maheu, which certainly puts a different wrinkle on the Hughesaffair, especially as there is no mention of Jim Phelan in Maheu’s ownautobiography.At the end of one investigation of the Clifford Irving affair—Hoax, by StephenFay, Lewis Chester and Magnus Linklater—these journalists reveal an interestingfact which has never been explained. They say that at a dinner in November 1970in New York, Edith Irving (Clifford’s wife at the time) revealed to her gueststhat her husband was considering a proposition “that could be worth upward of$500,000. It would, she said, be a dangerous one to undertake, since itconcerned people ‘who would stop at nothing to achieve their own ends—evenmurder.’”37 The authors go on to state that the phrase she used about men whowould stop at nothing was identical to the way in which she would later“describe the Hughes organization.” Of course, Marty Ackerman’s offices were inNew York City; the Irvings had been living in Ibiza, Spain for years. Accordingto Irving’s own account, published in his The Hoax, he came up with the idea towrite a fraudulent Hughes autobiography in Spain in December of 1970, one monthand three thousand miles away from New York City, an idea prompted by an articlein Newsweek. There is no mention of going to New York the previous month.But it was November of 1970 when the model was telling me about the purportedHughes kidnapping by the CIA.Was the Irving/Susskind book—the “tell all” story of the Howard Hughes hoaxedautobiography—suspected of revealing this piece of information, information thatwould have led back either to the CIA or to the Hughes organization itself … orboth? In any case, it didn’t. When Irving’s book finally hit the stands, itcontained little that was not already known.Hughes disappeared from his Las Vegas Desert Inn eagle’s nest in November 1970,on Thanksgiving weekend. This, in spite of the fact that he was quite ill,suffering from anemia complicated by pneumonia, and “on the verge of heartfailure.”38 It became obvious in later years that Hughes had been forced to signthe proxy which eventually resulted in the firing of Robert Maheu, and did sowhile under the influence of painkillers and other drugs. In fact, Hughes’doctors forced him to approve all sorts of deals by threatening to withhold thecodeine on which he had become increasingly dependent. This included the hiringof the Mormon bodyguard, among other things. When Maheu became a problem, hishandlers then forced Hughes to leave the country so that Maheu could notpersonally confront him, and so that Hughes would not have to appear in court todefend his actions. Thus Hughes had, in effect, been kidnapped indeed.That same month, the Irvings were approached by a sinister cabal that offeredthem “upwards of $500,000” for an important and dangerous project. The hoaxedHoward Hughes autobiography was in the works the following month. The MormonRobert Bennett then supposedly took charge of anti-Irving strategy in the monthsthat followed, which eventually resulted in the famous phone call on January 7,1972 from Hughes in the Bahamas to a group of reporters in California, in whichhe “proved” he was alive and well, and that Maheu was evil and had beendeliberately fired by Hughes. One feels that Irving knew all along what he wasgetting himself into, and that the entire scenario had played out just as it wassupposed to have done. To complicate matters even further, it appears as ifPresident Nixon ordered the IRS to attack Robert Maheu with a full audit goingback three years (as mentioned in Maheu’s autobiography). If so, it would appearthat Maheu was a threat to more than just the Hughes “palace guard.” Maheucertainly knew where the bodies were buried in the Hughes/Nixon relationship,and would later testify to the Watergate Committee that he had personallyhandled the illegal campaign contributions between Hughes and Nixon’s sidekick,Bebe Rebozo.The Hughes affair is important to an understanding of the sinister forcessurrounding American politics in the late twentieth century. Howard Hughesinherited a great deal of money from his father, who had invented a special typeof drill bit that was heavily used by the oil industry and thereby made hisfortune. Hughes himself was something of a playboy in his earlier years. He wasa pilot, and was always trying to improve the airplane, acting as his own testpilot and nearly getting himself killed in the process. He also dabbled inHollywood, and squired a number of famous actresses, such as Ava Gardner, GingerRogers and Ida Lupino, and even marrying Jean Peters. He discovered thecurvaceous Jane Russell, and had a hand in creating a special brassiere tosupport and display her most obvious qualities.Money, the military, oil, and Hollywood.The ceremonial magician, self-proclaimed AntiChrist and invoker of Babalon, JackParsons, once worked for the Hughes empire; but then so did Wilford Brimley, theplump and grizzly character actor who would later appear in such films asHeaven’s Gate, Cocoon, Death Valley, and The China Syndrome (as well as a seriesof commercials for Quaker Oatmeal). I guess it was the “right thing to do.”After all, the Hughes organization was a dominant player in California—both inthe film industry and in the military-aviation industry—as well as in Texas inthe oil industry, and in Nevada casinos, Hughes buying up hotel after hotel in abid to consolidate his power there and run the entire state. He was active intrying to halt atomic testing (at least in Nevada) and threw money around in anattempt to buy off whatever politican he had to in order to get the job done. Healso enlisted the services of Intertel, a private security andintelligence-gathering operation so well-documented in Jim Hougan’s Spooks. Itwas Intertel which would eventually go after Clifford Irving, and eventuallyafter Bob Maheu when he was “fired” by Hughes ... or perhaps fired by ChesterDavis and Bill Gay, the men who created a Berlin Wall of Mormons and medicinearound the eremitical billionaire.Another, perhaps honorary, member of the Coven would have been the psychic JeaneDixon.A GIFT OF PROPHECYJeane Dixon was familiar to many in the 1960s as a psychic who was said to havepredicted the assassination of President Kennedy. The American-born daughter ofGerman immigrants, she also made some startling predictions about a world warthat was supposed to take place in the final decades of the twentieth century,as well as the birth of a Savior somewhere in the Middle East in the early1960s. Most of this was included in the book about her, A Gift of Prophecy: ablue and white bound paperback that was ubiquitous in bookstores and magazineracks throughout the United States for years. What most people did not know,however, and which would have horrified them if they did know, was that JeaneDixon was actively working on behalf of the FBI, tailoring her predictions toemphasize the danger of the Soviet Union!It is a phenomenon which seems particular to the right wing, this depen- denceon soothsayers, astrologers, entrail-readers and the like. The adminis- trationof Republican President Reagan would surprise everyone with revela- tions thathis wife, Nancy, consulted an astrologer regularly and arranged the President’sschedule according to transiting planetary positions. In fact, Jeane Dixon alsoprovided consultation to the Reagan White House. This was a president whobelieved firmly in an apocalyptic interpretation of Christian- ity and the “endtimes,” and who viewed foreign relations and foreign policy through a scrim ofthe Book of Revelations, sharing this at least in common with Charles Manson.Yet, in Nixon’s case, the soothsayer was also as much of a political front asRadio Free Europe.Nixon believed in the prophecies of Jeane Dixon, according to John Ehrlich- man.Nixon’s psychotherapist, Dr. Arnold Hutschneker, was also a believer.39According to Ehrlichman, Nixon was getting premonitions from both Billy Grahamand Jeane Dixon that his life was in danger in late 1972. Recently declassifiedFBI files—released after the psychic’s death in 1997—show a comfortablerelationship between Ms. Dixon and the FBI, to the extent that the Bureausupplied her with information on groups they considered sub- versive so that shehad ammunition for her speeches around the country. She volunteered to help theFBI erode popular support for the Left, by making speeches with material thatcould not be traced to the Bureau.In 1969, she accused the Soviet leadership of instigating and controlling raceriots and student revolt in the United States; in 1971 she went so far as to saythat there was a high-level spy in the US government who was reporting back tothe Soviets. Her fear of the Left in general and of the Soviet Union inparticular was consistent, and was exploited by the FBI for its own purposes.One angry correspondent wrote to Hoover demanding an investigation of thepsychic, accusing her of trying to create an environment in which DemocraticParty leaders would be assassinated, in particular Teddy Kennedy, about whomDixon had always had dire things to predict. The accusation was that Dixon wasconsciously using her prestige as a diviner to suggest that Ted Kennedy ought tobe killed. Her staunch support of Republican politicians, the FBI, andanti-Communism lends some credence to this point of view.Nixon was not totally unaware of occult forces in any case. His own law firm,Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie and Alexander, based in New York City, had handled avolatile labor dispute in Puerto Rico in the 1960s. This dispute involved thepractice of witchcraft—probably santeria, the Hispanic version of Haitianvoudon—and the law firm wrote a brief discussing the practice of Puerto Ricanoccultism in some depth. The brief was, appropriately enough, thirteen pageslong. Finally, the presidency of Richard Nixon came to an ignominious end. Theexistence of an Oval Office taping system was revealed, and Nixon stonewalled aslong as possible to avoid giving sensitive conversations over to the inves-tigating committees. In one case, one particularly important tape recording wasfound to have eighteen-and-a-half minutes missing, that section of the tapeeither erased or recorded over. The buzzing sound could not be identi- fied.According to Al Haig, it seemed as if the tape had been altered by some“sinister force.” And thus the germ of an idea for this book was born.As members of his staff all went off to prison on various counts of burglary,conspiracy, perjury, etc., many eventually becoming born-again Christians in theprocess, Nixon himself resigned from office on August 9, 1974. The previousyear, he had warned the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the evil machinations of the“Eastern Establishment,” and, according to Admiral Zumwalt, “It was clear thathe perceived himself as a fighter for all that was right in the United States,involved in mortal battle with the forces of evil.”40But it was to no avail. As Nixon left the White House with his family for thelast time that day—standing in the entrance to Air Force One raising his armsabove his head in his familiar gesture and giving what the Golden Dawn wouldhave understood as the sign of Typhon, the Destroyer—a crowd outside the fencewas singing “Ding Dong, the Witch is Dead.”Evangelist Billy Graham, with whom Richard Nixon had prayed and agonized sooften throughout the Presidency, once said, “I think there was definitely demonpower involved. He took all those sleeping pills, and through history, drugs anddemons have gone together.” 41According to Graham, the drugs opened a door inNixon’s soul and the demons flew in. This author believes that Nixon’s pact withthe demons had been signed much earlier, when he agreed to cover for Dulles, forthe Nazis, and for the Mafia in return for the most powerful position in themost powerful country in the world.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Allen Upward, The Divine Mystery, Ross-Erikson, Santa Barbara, 1976, ISBN0-915520-01-x, p.xxxii 2 Letter from Parsons to Marjorie Cameron, dated 27 January 1950 3 Victor Turner, Revelation and Divination in Ndembu Ritual, Cornell UniversityPress, Ithaca, 1975, 0-8014-9151-7, p. 32 4 Mark Aarons & John Loftus, Unholy Trinity: the Vatican, the Nazis, and SovietIntelligence, St Martin’s Press, NY, 1991, ISBN 0-312-09407-8, p. 270 5 Anthony Summers, The Arrogance of Power: The Secret World of Richard Nixon,Penguin Books, NY, 2000, ISBN 0-14-0267078-1, p.166 Bruce Mazlish, The Leader, the Led, and the Psyche, Wesleyan University Press,Hanover, 1990, ISBN 0-8195-5220-8, p. 198ff 7 Summers, op. cit., p. 63 8 Ibid., p. 63 9 Ibid., p. 63 10 Seth Kantor, Who Was Jack Ruby?, Everest House, NY, 1978, p. 54-55 11 Charles Higham, American Swastika, Doubleday, NY, 1985, ISBN 0-385-17874-3,p. 85 12 Summers, op. cit., p.46 13 Carl Goldberg, Speaking with the Devil: Exploring Senseless Acts of Evil,Penguin, NY, 1997, ISBN 0-14-023739-9, p. 214 14 Higham, op. cit., p. 250 15 Ronald Brownstein, The Power and the Glitter: The Hollywood-WashingtonConnection, Pantheon, NY, 1990, ISBN 0-394-56938-5, p. 57 16 Simpson, op. cit., p. 179 17 Summers, op. cit., p. 12 18 Walter Laqueur, Black Hundred: The Rise of the Extreme Right in Russia,HarperCollins, NY, 1993, ISBN 0-06-018336-5, p. 15 19 Aarons & Loftus, op. cit., p. 277-278 20 Higham, op. cit., p. 190 21 Ibid., p. 191 22 Aarons & Loftus, op. cit., p. 278 23 Summers, op. cit., p. 62-66 24 John Marks, The Search for the Manchurian Candidate, Times Books, NY, 1979,ISBN 0-8129-0773-6, p. 21 25 Howard Blum, Wanted!

Wald, Religion and Politics in the United States1When I begin I try to follow the money, as they say in All The President’s Men,up the evil ladder, past the businessmen, past the Mafia, past the leaders inthe state, I ask, “Who is doing the stuff, who is pulling the cords?” It looksan awful lot like God. It’s the big fascist in the sky. But all of thisreligion, government, and civilization bending towards God is dangerous.—Ken Kesey2No, men were afraid of murder, but not from a terror of justice so much as theknowledge that a killer attracted the attention of the gods; then your mind wasnot your own, your anxiety ceased to be neurotic, your dread was real.—Norman Mailer3Sharon Tate was eight months pregnant when she was stabbed to death by membersof the Manson Family on August 9, 1969 at her home at 10050 Cielo Drive in LosAngeles. Cielo is Spanish for “heaven” or “sky.” It is the domain of theEgyptian goddess Nuit, to whom one of the three sections of Aleister Crowley’sBook of the Law is dedicated. Nuit is a form of Babalon, the Scarlet Woman ofthe Apocalypse, the mystical bride of the Great Beast, whom Jack Parsons hadinvoked in the Mojave Desert. It is she who gives birth to the Magickal Child,the promise of the New Age.In Sharon Tate’s case, the child—her perfectly-formed unborn son—was killedalong with his mother.The ancient Egyptian analogue may appear gratuitous, but there are grounds forlooking that deeply at the matter. In Book One, we discussed the seances ofAndrija Pujarich, Arthur Young, Ruth Paine Young, etc. which resulted in contactwith something called “The Nine.” (These were the same individuals that werelinked to the Kennedy assassination, and specifically to accused assas- sin LeeHarvey Oswald, as well as to American military and intelligence circles and, viaArthur Young and Michael Paine, to Operation Paperclip.) According to ancientEgyptian religion, there was such a Council of Nine—known as the Ennead ofHeliopolis, called by Egyptologist R. T. Rundle Clark the “Divine Company”—whichwas made up of the major deities of that time, including Atum, Geb, Tefnut, Nut(or Nuit), Shu, Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, and Set (or Seth). Probably their mostfamous function was to act as intermediaries be- tween the battling Horus andSet. Horus, the son of the slain god Osiris, was out to avenge his father’sdeath; Set, as the murderer and as the embodiment of “blind force andunregulated violence,”4 was Horus’ target.The war between the two—as recounted in the Contendings of Horus and Set—goes onso long and is so wasteful that the Council decides it must be stopped. Theydecide in favor of Horus; the powers of Set are thus curtailed; and the kingdomof Egypt is at peace at last. Egypt was divided into two kingdoms in ancienttimes, Upper Egypt (in the south) and Lower Egypt (in the north). Upper Egyptwas said to be the realm of Set, and Lower Egypt the realm of Horus. The Pharaohwas king of both Upper and Lower Egypt, and wore two crowns to symbolize thisfact, thus acting as representative of both Horus and Set. Of both Order andChaos. Of both Peace and mindless Bloodshed.This duality was also an important—if not central—feature of the Process Churchof the Final Judgment, which preached the unity of both Jehovah and Lucifer, ofboth good and evil, with Satan thrown in for good measure alittle later in the cult’s development. This was also, of course, the main “rap”of Charles Manson: that he was both Jesus and the Devil, and that good was evil,and evil, good. The possibility that the Process may have strayed a bit tooenthusiastically over to the Dark Side is evidenced by the Fear and Death themesof their publications, as well perhaps by their adoption of a stylized swastikaand the German shepherd as cultic symbols. A dog-like creature wasthe emblem of Set, and dogs have been associated with the dark side of humanconsciousness for thousands of years. The dog is considered an unclean animal inIslam, for instance, for it is coprophagic: it eats the dead. The associationof dog sacrifice—specifically of German shepherds—with satanic cults in theUnited States cannot be ignored, with numerous cases from coast tocoast,especially in relation to the presumed Son of Sam cult (which incorporatedthe Manson Family). In addition, Jeffrey Dahmer, one of the twentieth century’smost horrific serial killers, began his career by sacrificing dogs and puttingtheir skulls on stakes around a ceremonial area behind his home in Ohio.According to Rundle Clark, writing in 1959, “Seth is the essential enemy. He isthe personification of blind force and unregulated violence.… Wherever there isa manifestation of blind force, Seth is in his element.… He is the desert wind,dryness and death.”5 There is perhaps no better description of the spirit of theManson Family, born as it was in the Mojave Desert and reaching its apotheosisin “blind force and unregulated violence.” Manson was perceived as the“essential enemy,” and he reinforced this concept by carving a swastika into hisforehead and by preaching race war and Armageddon.In January 1969, shortly after the discovery of Marina Habe’s body in a gulleyoff Mulholland Drive, several events occurred which are relevant to our study.CIA Operation OFTEN was initialized by Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, based partly ondocuments which came into his possession after CIA agent William Buckley (whowould later be tortured and murdered by Arab terrorists) tossed the premises ofthe late Dr. Ewen Cameron, he of the “sleep room” and “psychic driving”experiments in Canada. Initially, Operation OFTEN was a joint CIA/Army ChemicalCorps drug project, based out of Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland and using inmatesof the Holmesburg State Prison in Philadelphia as test subjects. It came underthe aegis of the CIA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD), which wasconcerned with parapsychology and the application of supernatural powers formilitary purposes. 6Later, OFTEN would become a kind of grab bag of CIAinvestigations into the paranormal, and would include everything from séancesand witchcraft to remote viewing and exotic drugs. Agents of Operation OFTENwould consult with such occult luminaries as Sybil Leek, the famous Englishwitch who was interviewed constantly in the late 1960s on radio and televisiontalk shows, and who had published a few books on the occult, astrology andassociated themes. Although the CIA had been investigating ESP and theparanormal, and infiltrating occult groups, since 1952,7 when Andrija Puharichbegan contact with The Nine, someone at the CIA evidently felt that the occultunderground in 1969 might have access to special techniques for the manipulationof consciousness and memory, and they took to their study with renewed vigor. Insome cases, university students who had been part of special controlledexperiments in occultism later became occultists themselves; just as an earliercrop of drug experimenters became passionate advocates of LSD, mescaline andpsylocibin. The CIA had opened the door, and all sorts of things were flying inand out.When the powers that be had allowed the Nazi spy and science networks into theUnited States, it was with the understanding that they would control them, andnot vice versa. As it happened, American hubris probably led to So- vietpenetration of American intelligence systems, as Nazi/Soviet double agents foundthey had unfettered access to US government channels. In addition, by bringingover so many Nazis—many of whom were war criminals—they had unknowinglyreinstated a Nazi underground in the United States, South America and Australia,not to mention the Middle East. The same was now happening with the CIAinvestigation of the paranormal and the occult: it was a two-edged sword, andthe occultists were starting to develop under CIA tutelage and create their ownnetworks. We will see evidence of this—especially with regard to the StanfordResearch Institute, remote viewing, Uri Geller, and Andrija Puharich of TheNine—a little later on.Also in January 1969, the Condon Report on UFOs was released, and im- mediatelyattacked as biased and basically worthless. The Condon Report had beencontracted to the University of Colorado by the Air Force; its project leader,Dr. Richard Condon, proclaimed himself an agnostic on the issue of UFOs, butlater documentation by Condon committee members—includ- ing the controversialLow memorandum—would prove otherwise, showing Condon to have been antagonistictowards the whole idea of UFOs and to have used the project as a forum todiscredit the theories about space aliens, secret government aircraft, etc.According to a CIA article on the subject, published in the agency’s Studies inIntelligence, the Condon report had been contracted as a means of showing thepublic that the Air Force had nothing to hide concerning UFOs; it was not anattempt to prove or disprove the existence of flying saucers, etc. Regardless ofthe ultimate purpose of the Report, it was embraced by those who were alreadyskeptics and denounced by those who believed in the existence of flying saucers.A few months earlier, Jim Garrison had subpoenaed Fred Crisman to tes- tifybefore the grand jury he had convened in New Orleans in the matter of thePresident Kennedy assassination. Crisman, as was related in Book One, had beenpresent at the birth of the twentieth century’s UFO phenomenon, along withKenneth Arnold and a number of FBI agents, including another assassinationsuspect, Guy Banister. Crisman was interesting to Garrison for a number ofreasons, not the least of which was that Clay Shaw is said to have phonedCrisman immediately upon learning he had been arrested. Garrison’s otherinterest in Crisman stemed from the latter’s knowledge of right-wing militiamovements; the New Orleans District Attorney was evidently wonder- ing whatcertain individuals in these movements had been doing in and out of New Orleansaround the time of the assassination.By the time the Clay Shaw trial was over, however, it was all moot. He had beendeclared “not guilty” on March 1, 1969. That same month, Nixon ordered thebombing of Cambodia, which began in earnest on March 18. The film Goodbye,Columbus was released, and Roman Polanski, Sharon Tate, and Jane Fonda attendedthe Directors Guild screening.Shortly thereafter, Bruce Davis returned to California from London, where he hadbeen staying for some months with the local Scientologists and, as some(including LAPD homicide detectives) insist, meeting with the Process Church ofthe Final Judgment.Bruce Davis had been sent to London by Charles Manson in November 1968, shortlyafter the murders of Clida Delaney and Nancy Warren (the latter, like SharonTate, eight months pregnant) near Ukiah, California. They had been beaten, andthen strangled to death “with thirty-six leather thongs,” 8on the evening ofOctober 13. Nancy Warren was married to a Highway Patrol of- ficer, ClidaDelaney was her grandmother. The Manson group was quickly suspected of havingcommitted these murders when they were arrested the following year and moreinformation about their criminal history came to light. Several members of theManson clan were known to have been in the area on the day of the murders, andManson moved his base of operations from the Spahn Ranch (near Chatsworth, justoutside of Los Angeles proper) to the Barker Ranch (in Death Valley, on theother side of the Mojave Desert, many more miles away from Ukiah) about two daysafter they occurred.Davis returned from London on April 25, 1969, and then flew to London again inNovember that same year, after the murder of a pair of Scientolo- gists inCalifornia in which he was later considered a suspect, and in time for themurder of Manson Family associate Joel Pugh in London. (Joel Pugh was thehusband of Sandy Good, who later teamed with Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme to createthe Manson cult ATWA.) According to British Immigration officials, Davis hadgiven as his address in the UK the address of Scientology headquarters.9Since Davis was regarded by California investigators as “Manson’ssecond-in-command,” this constant traveling back and forth between Californiaand London—specifically to either Scientology or Process headquarters, orboth—is evidence of a larger plot. Davis was later convicted for his role in themurders of Gary Hinman and Donny Shea, the two “bookend’ murders that took placebefore (Hinman) and after (Shea) the seven Tate/La Bianca killings,during the period July 26–August 26, 1969. He reappeared in February 1970 at theSpahn Ranch and then disappeared again when he was indicted for the Gary Hinmanmurder, only to reappear in Los Angeles in December 1970, when he turned himselfin to authorities. He has since become a born-again Christian (like so many ofthe former Manson family members, as well as “Son of Sam” killer DavidBerkowitz) and a minister, although still in prison.The Gary Hinman murder was as savage as the Tate and La Bianca killings. Hinmanwas a jazz musician with a master’s degree in sociology who was friendly to theManson clan, but when Manson needed money, he sent some of his followers tovisit Hinman and extort cash from him. Hinman was making mescaline in his house,and Manson claimed that one batch of the drug was bad. The story has it that thebikers to whom Manson sold the hallucinogen had become ill and blamed Manson’smescaline, and Manson in turn blamed Hinman. Hinman was due to fly to Japan intwo weeks on a religious pilgrimage (he was a follower of the Nichiren Shoshusect of Japanese Buddhism); it seemed he also had come into some kind of aninheritance, or at least that is what the Family had heard.Hinman did not have any cash in hand beyond about twenty dollars, but underthreats of violence—including being pistol-whipped by Bobby Beauso- leil—hesigned over two of his cars. That still did not satisfy the Mansonites. Phonecalls back and forth to Manson, giving updates on the ongoing cash extortion,resulted in Hinman’s death at the hands of Bobby Beausoleil, Mary Brunner, andSusan Atkins, with Davis and Manson as co-conspirators. He was stabbedrepeatedly by Beausoleil, after his ear had been chopped in half by a swordbrandished by Manson, who had left the Hinman residence before the actualmurder, but who is said to have ordered it by phone when Hinman was still notcoming across with the money. Hinman is said to have died with the chant “NamMyoho Renge Kyo” on his lips, the famous prayer of the Nichiren Shoshu sect.His death occurred on July 27th, Beausoleil writing “Political Piggy” and makinga crude drawing of a cat’s paw on the walls in Hinman’s blood, in an attempt toput the blame on the Black Panthers. This was a tactic that would be repeated inthe Tate and La Bianca killings, as one of the purported motives for thekillings was to instigate a race war between blacks and whites.In another eerie chain of coincidence, as the reader of The Nine will recall,Aldous Huxley had his first hallucinogenic experience with mescaline and inHollywood, after which he wrote The Doors of Perception. Jim Morrison named hisrock band—the Doors—after this book, and became initiated into witch- craft in1970, shortly before his death in July 1971. His 1968 release “Five to One”seemed like an eldritch prediction of the Manson slaughters with its tag line,“No one gets out of here alive,” and his reference to “five to one and one tofive”: the address of the Tate residence on Cielo Drive was 10050.)A YEN FOR MAGICThe same day that Hinman was being tortured and killed, an occult lodge wasbeing raided in southern California in an effort to rescue six-year-old AnthonyGibbons, who had been imprisoned inside a packing crate on May 23 and had yet tobe released a full two months later, except when he was allowed outside the boxto work. He had been accused of burning down a building (accidentally) and thiswas his punishment. Local police received reports of child abuse, and thus theraid on this supposed lodge of the Ordo Templi Orientis. It is not clear at thistime whether the police informants in the case were telling the truth or, as onecommentator and apologist for the OTO insists, were embellishing a story for itssensationalistic value and to inflate their importance to the local police. Thata young boy was kept chained in a wooden building by himself at the Brayton“ranch” is beyond dispute, however; what is controversial is the length of timehe was kept there and under what condi- tions. The FBI report of August 15, 1969is detailed and contains much cor- roborating information that does not appearin the OTO apologist’s summary of the events, making a clear case for felonychild abuse. In the final analysis, however, it didn’t matter. The Solar Lodgeof the OTO was raided, and its leaders scattered over the desert to avoid arrestand prosecution, some winding up in Mexico as fugitives from justice: a strangereaction from a supposedly benign organization that was not guilty of seriouscriminal activities.The so-called Solar Lodge of the OTO was primarily the creation of one GeorginaBrayton, and its story is rife with rumor, innuendo, false leads, anddisinformation. The American branch of the OTO that was run by the late ex-Armyofficer Grady McMurtry has consistently disavowed any connection with theBrayton lodge, but information recently available in the wake of numerousMcMurtry-OTO lawsuits against all and sundry suggests other- wise. Predictably,the author himself has been attacked by various individuals claiming OTOaffiliation for references he made in his previous work, Unholy Alliance, whichlinked the Solar Lodge with the McMurtry OTO and with Charles Manson.Unfortunately for the Order, the link between Georgina Brayton’s OTO and theMcMurtry OTO is definite.Ray and Mildred Burlingame were members of the Agape Lodge of the OTO, the onein Pasadena that was being run for a while by Jack Parsons, and had been indirect communication with Alistair Crowley in the 1940s when Parsons was beingconsidered for a leadership position with the Lodge. After Parsons’ death, theBurlingames—who were friends of Georgina Brayton and her husband, a lecturer atthe University of California, Richard Montgomery Brayton—began working therituals of the OTO in an informal way; they were unaffiliated with the main bodyof the OTO, which was in disarray anyway after the death of Crowley in 1947, theclosure of the lodge in 1953, and the subsequent death of Crowley’s nominatedsuccessor, Karl Germer, in 1962. The Burlingames were veteran initiates of theOTO, and there is some controversy over whether or not Georgina Brayton could beconsidered initi- ated. The Burlingames did not possess the requisite authorityfrom an OTO hierarch to start their own lodge or to initiate new members; but,then, neither did Grady McMurtry, the Army officer who had been initiated atAgape Lodge in the days before America entered World War II, having beenintroduced to Crowley’s religion of Thelema by Jack Parsons himself. AlthoughMcMurtry had attained the highest operative degree of the Order, the NinthDegree, he was not an Outer Head of the Order, or OHO (although he would claimthis distinction in later years). What is certain is that Georgina Brayton wasinitiated into the OTO by the Burlingames; what is in dispute is the “validity”of that initiation, given the lack of an OTO charter.The author does not want to spend a lot of time going over what is a te- diousexample of how occult lodges fight among themselves, especially where legitimacyand “apostolic succession” are concerned. Suffice it to say that both theBrayton “Solar Lodge of the OTO” and the subsequent McMurtry variation—the“Caliphate”—seemed equally legitimate or equally illegitimate as the case maybe. There was nothing intrinsically different about either or- ganization toguarantee that it had legal standing from the point of view of the OTO’soriginal charters and by-laws. Obviously, when the Solar Lodge got into troubleover the case of the “boy in the box,” it was up to McMur- try and those loyalto his faction to distance themselves as much as possible from the Solar Lodge,and McMurtry did this … especially with respect to correspondence he had withthe FBI and the police in the wake of the Solar Lodge revelations.The Solar Lodge had become somewhat notorious in Southern California in the late1960s, and it was in the process of building a power center of its own in theMojave Desert, near the towns of Blythe and Vidal. The reader may recall thatthe Manson Family was also relocating to the Mojave, but Blythe is far to thesoutheast of where Manson was setting up his operation, being roughly on theArizona border. Regardless, the rumors of Manson’s knowledge of the Solar Lodgeand his attendance at some of its recruiting parties are quite persistent. Itwas this association, as well as the scandal over the “boy in the box,” that,according to published accounts, brought Grady McMurtry out of occultretirement, and he traveled from Washington, D.C. to California to salvage whathe could of the OTO (the Agape Lodge had been dissolved in 1953, but it had hadthe most active and serious members in the United States).However, evidence shows that McMurtry arrived in California in April of 1969,which meant that he was in place months before either the “boy in the box”incident or the Manson killings. It is McMurtry’s long military background(service in both World War II and Korea as an officer), coupled with hisposition at George Washington University (where he seems to have taughtpolitical science), that has raised the possibility that he went to Cali-fornia—leaving a paying job and security in Washington—to conduct anintelligence operation on behalf of … someone. If the Scientology people arecorrect in insisting that their founder, L. Ron Hubbard, a former Naval officerin World War II, was involved with the OTO on behalf of either the FBI or ONI inan effort to break up a “black magic ring” that had attracted scientists withhigh level security clearances, then it seems equally valid to put forward theidea that a former Army officer in World War II and Korea was involved withsomething similar.For those readers who find it frankly incredible that the US government wouldhave attempted to infiltrate occult organizations, I add the following piece ofevidence to the published documentation showing a CIA interest in occultphenomena already referenced. On November 21, 1968 an FBI Spe- cial Agent inCharge in Philadelphia wrote a memo to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover under theinfamous COINTELPRO program. COINTELPRO was the domestic intelligence,surveillance, infiltration and disruption program of the FBI designed to attackthe anti-War movement in general, and the Communist, socialist, Black Panther,Native American and other domestic US political groups in particular.The memo states,“The emergence of the New Left on the American Scene [sic] has produced a newphenomenon—a yen for magic.… Self-proclaimed yogis have es- tablished afollowing in the New Left movement. Their incantations are a reminder of thechant of the witch doctor.… Philadelphia believes the above-described conditionsoffer an opportunity for use in the counter- intelligence field. Specifically,it is suggested that a few select top-echelon leaders of the New Left besubjected to harassment by a series of anonymous messages with a mysticalconnotation.”10A few days later, on December 4, 1968, Hoover approved the strategy, with thecaveat that specific individuals be chosen for this treatment, based onrecommendations of FBI informants close to them, and the symbolism of themessages carefully selected and interpretations made available to the targets bythe informants, thus reinforcing the “sinister” messages.11 Thus, we havedocumentary evidence based on declassified COINTELPRO files that dem- onstratethe Bureau’s attitude towards cults and their presumed involvement withpolitical subversion. McMurtry’s correspondence with the FBI in the Solar Lodgecase (see below) would have only served to reinforce the Bureau’s suspicion andparanoia of occult groups. This identification of occultism with politicaldissent—the New Age with the New Left—is fascinating. The fact that manymainstream churches and religious organizations were active in the anti-Warmovement—one thinks of all the religious leaders who marched on Washington, forinstance—did not figure into this equation. The Bureau was concerned with theinfluence of cults over the rise of American political opposition to the VietnamWar. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft.In April of 1969, Bruce Davis had just returned to California and the stickyembrace of the Manson Family after having spent more than five months witheither the Scientologists, the Process, or both. His lengthy mission in Englandis still a mystery, as is the funding for this junket. Documents seized by theUS Government after a raid on Scientology headquarters in 1977 show considerableanxiety over the alleged connection between the Manson Family and Scientology;the Scientologists sent emissaries to try to find Steve Grogan (who was laterconvicted of the murder of Donny Shea), a Family member who had informationconcerning Manson’s Scientology background (they were unsuccessful). Then, aninformant came to them with information on Manson’s 150 hours of Scientologyauditing sessions in prison. The picture painted is frightening, for it shows aManson at turns extremely enthusiastic about his training… and terrified to thepoint of demanding to be put into solitary confinement so he could escape hisauditor. It was after the Scientol- ogy cell was broken up at the prison by thewarden that another inmate after his release began sending Manson books onhypnotism and “black magic.”Beginning in January of 1969, the CIA’s Operation OFTEN quickly ex- pands toinclude occult research and interviews with occult leaders and cult members.Several months after OFTEN becomes operational, McMurtry leaves the D.C. areaand reheats his occult career with the same organization (the OTO) and the samelodge (Agape) that L. Ron Hubbard had allegedly been trying to infiltrate anddestroy. At this point, McMurtry had not been active with the OTO since theearly 1950s at the latest. According to official OTO sources, he did this latterturn at the instigation or request of Phyllis Seckler, an OTO member inCalifornia who was trying to contact all the old Agape Lodge members in theaftermath of a series of robberies of OTO books and documents, including two atthe home of Mildred Burlingame (her husband had died a few years previously),robberies that were at first laid at the door of the Solar Lodge. Crowleyfollower and Mary Ferrell friend Israel Regardie had been burglarized as well,as had Karl Germer’s widow, Sascha. It appeared to be a well-organized campaignthat lasted from 1965 to 1967, and which was believed to be the work of GeorginaBrayton who, having been rebuffed by Mildred Burlingame in her plan to start upa new OTO lodge, decided to obtain as much “classified” Crowley material aspossible to enable her to start up a lodge on her own. McMurtry—who was recentlydivorced—decided to move to California and assist Phyllis Seckler withrevitalizing the Order; we do not know what contact, if any, he had withGeorgina Brayton. His contact with Ms. Seckler, however, resulted in theirmarriage a short time after.A few months later all Hell broke loose, with revelations about the Solar Lodgeof the OTO and then, in the wake of the Manson killings, rumors that Manson mayhave visited the Solar Lodge on at least one occasion, adding the OTO to hislist of occult connections (Scientology, the Process, the Church of Satan, theFountain of the World sect, etc.). McMurtry cooperated with the police and theFBI in an effort to create legal distance between the OTO and the Solar Lodge;this obfuscation has had repercussions down to the present day. Truly, it is oflittle importance whether or not Manson visited the Solar Lodge; there is noevidence at all that he was a member, or that his actions in any way reflectedthe philosophy of the Solar Lodge. However, the involvement of both Manson andBruce Davis with the Scientology and Process organizations, which have apedigree that goes back to the OTO, is suggestive of something more thansixties-style religious eclecticism. Further, the Solar Lodge had degeneratedinto an apocalyptic, end-of-the-world sect that practiced a subtle form ofracism with a thin veneer of Thelema and Crowleyism as window-dressing forsomething that was turning more sinis- ter. The philosophical similaritiesbetween Manson’s occult vision and that of the Solar Lodge (as well as theProcess) bear consideration; they are not, however, equivalent to the officialOTO philosophy, and it is this more than anything else that justifies McMurtry’sdistancing of the Crowley cult from that of Georgina Brayton.Another OTO offshoot that was active in the United States and in south- ernCalifornia especially at the time was the Gardnerian Wicca movement. Althoughlargely underground, it was growing in numbers and in visibility due to themissionary work of Raymond and Rosemary Buckland, a Gardnerian high priest andpriestess who were active in the New York City area. Raymond Buckland hadappeared on several talk shows—one with CIA consultant Sybil Leek—in the latesixties. Gerald Gardner had received an OTO charter from Aleister Crowley, andGardner’s Book of Shadows contains much that was derived from Crowley, theGolden Dawn, and the OTO.Both Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca were popular in the United King- dom andthe United States, and we have seen the influence of Alexandrian Wicca on thecareer of doomed actress Sharon Tate. Like Scientology—and the Process Churchwhich derived from Scientology—the Wicca movement was a direct descendant of theOTO. Thus, we had witches, satanists, Thelemites, and an entire ragtag band ofmagicians and occultists whose origins all go back—in one form or another—toAleister Crowley and the occult Order he “inherited” from German Masons andmagicians in the early days of the twentieth century. At the same time, we hadalleged American intelligence agency involvement in the penetration and controlof these groups, particu- larly in the 1960s, when the objectives of both theCIA’s MK-ULTRA mind control programs and the FBI’s domestic intelligencegathering programs on potentially subversive secret societies dovetailed; bothof these programs were motivated by fear of Communism.And in that climate of fear and paranoia, Richard Nixon and Henry Kiss- inger—inMay of 1969—authorized FBI domestic wiretapping of American reporters andgovernment officials. At this time, Richard Nixon had been President of theUnited States for less than four months. (That same month, Manson’s uncle—DarwinScott—was savagely hacked to death in Ashland, Kentucky. Like the murders ofDelaney and Warren in April, it is a case tied to Manson that has never beensolved.)It is worth noting in this context that, in one lawsuit against Nixon con-cerning the wiretapping of Morton Halperin (a National Security Council staffmember), the Federal Court of Appeals in 1977 stated, “The President is theelected chief executive of our government, not an omniscient leader cloaked inmystical powers.” 12An interesting choice of words, considering our theme.THE OMENThere is no past. There is only now in this infinite time.… We are all onemember—one force.—Charles Manson to his Family13With the premiere of Rosemary’s Baby in 1968, America was on the way to a spateof films dealing with the subject of the incarnation of evil. In Rosemary’sBaby, of course, an innocent young woman is impregnated by Satan in order tobring about the birth of Satan’s child on earth, in a blasphemous recreation ofthe virgin birth of Christianity. Rosemary brings the baby to term, but it istaken from her at birth, and she is told that the baby died; she later hearschanting and the baby crying through the thin apartment walls and discovers thetruth for herself. This idea—of a satanically-engendered orsatanically-possessed child—is reprised in The Exorcist, in which the youngRegan is possessed by an evil spirit, an emanation of the ancient Sumerian demonPazuzu. Again, a child is the focus of evil; again, evil has became incarnatedin human flesh rather than remaining merely a phantom or ghastly illusion. Evenmore frightening, this film was based on events that had actually occurred. Afew years later, and the American public would be presented with yet anotherdemonic presence, this time in The Omen, in which a young boy has the mark of666 on his scalp: he is the Devil incarnate, again (and, like Crowley, inEngland again!). The 1990s film Lost Souls—starring Winona Ryder as a formerlypossessed young woman on the trail of Satan—is another attempt to show theimpending incarnation of Evil, although this time the vessel is a grown man(appropriately enough, a lawyer). Perhaps one day we will address this issue ofwhy—from the late 1960s through the 1970s—we feared our children so much that weidentified them with Lucifer himself; what concerns us here at this time howeveris the idea that Evil could be incarnated, could be “made flesh” and “dwellamongst us.”Charles Manson has become the ultimate example of the belief that a person—ahuman being born of woman—could be wholly, irredeemably, evil. Rightly orwrongly, we have characterized Manson this way. Some of the objections to Mansonare quite valid, of course. Others are based on Manson’s personality and style,an image that he cultivates that seems focused entirely on scaring the livingdaylights out of people. We know he was present during part of the time thatGary Hinman was being tortured to death, and that he ordered Hinman’s murder; weknow that he brought the ropes to the La Bianca house and tied up the victims;we know—at least we think weknow—from the testimony of members of his “family” that he ordered the killingsat the Tate household on Cielo Drive. We also know that he shot a drug dealernamed Bernard Crowe in the stomach, leaving him for dead. All of that is badenough, of course; but Manson was convicted for something darker, more sinister.He was convicted of murder in the case of the Tate and La Bianca kill- ingsbecause of his psychological power over the men and women he sent to performmurder. The viciousness of the attacks on Sharon Tate, Jay Sebring, AbigailFolger, Voytek Frykowski, Steven Parent, Leno La Bianca and Rose- mary La Biancawas not the work of Manson himself. He wasn’t there when the victims werekilled. Some of the victims were shot, but most did not die of the gunshotwounds. All were stabbed repeatedly, over and over again in a violent frenzy ofhomicidal passion, by two women and a man, a man—Tex Watson—who proclaimed uponentering the Tate home, “I am the Devil, and I’m here to do the Devil’sbusiness.” These were young people who had never fired a shot in anger in theirlives, nor stabbed helpless victims to death, nor written slogans on the wallsof the abattoirs in the victims’ blood. But Manson made it all possible, evenprobable.As the events of that summer of 1969 began to percolate, Manson became more andmore manic. Death was in the air. Everyone at his headquarters, the Spahn Ranch,was talking about death. Spahn Ranch had been a movie set for a slew of westernsthat came out of Hollywood over the years, and now served as a horse ranch forweekend riders. Oddly enough, it was used as the set of The Outlaw, the JaneRussell vehicle that was produced by Howard Hughes. Hughes had even spent sometime on the set at Spahn Ranch, but it was not used for filmmaking much anymore. Now it was the headquarters for Helter Skelter.Many observers (including Maury Terry in his controversial best-seller TheUltimate Evil) have proposed that Manson was a contract killer, tak- ingcontracts in exchange for drugs or money, or some other consideration. Indeed,the La Bianca killings were the most anomalous of all the murders; both Mansonand Tex Watson knew the Tate residence since they knew its previous occupant,Terry Melcher, the son of actress Doris Day, and Manson had visited the Tateresidence on Cielo Drive a few months before the murders, ostensibly looking forMelcher who had promised to help him land a record- ing contract. Yet no casecould be made for the La Biancas, except that there was a Mafia connection andthe rumor of bad blood between Leno La Bianca and the Mob. The La Biancakillings could have been a Mafia hit, contracted to the Family. The Tatekillings, on the other hand, seemed motivated by something entirely different.Some authors have wondered if the La Bianca killings were the real focus of thehorror that week and that the Tate killings were designed to confuse the issueand throw the police off the scent, or vice versa. A motiveless crime is themost difficult to solve and, indeed, it might never have been solved had not oneof the Manson women confessed to the crime to another inmate while she was inprison on an unrelated offense.Satanism and Nazism were very much part of the Manson philosophy. He avoidedSpahn Ranch employee Donny Shea because he was married to a black woman; Sheawould eventually wind up dead and buried in the desert. He planted the stolen LaBianca identification and credit cards in a gas station in a black neighborhood,hoping that someone would find them and use them, and thus pin the murders onthe Black Panthers. Convicted murderer Bobby Beausoleil had actually played theDevil in a Kenneth Anger film, opposite Church of Satan creator Anton SzandorLaVey; he also played a homicidal Indian in the soft-porn flick Ramrodder,killing a helpless man the way he killed Gary Hinman a few years later.Convicted murderer Susan Atkins belonged to the Church of Satan before she evermet Charles Manson, and played the part of a vampire in a publicly staged BlackMass at LaVey’s church. Convicted murderer Tex Watson claimed he was the Devil,to frighten the Tate residents. Convicted murderer Charles Manson claimed to beboth Jesus and Satan. Convicted murderer Patricia Krenwinkle doodled satanicglyphs and the Church of Satan’s Goat of Mendes during her trial.The barter America made for its protection and defense in the 1940s and1950s—selling its soul to the Nazis; creating a program to open the Pandora’sBox of human consciousness to develop the perfect weapon: the mindlessassassin—was a bill that had to be paid. The sacrament of choice was LSD, thatgolem of the CIA mind-control program: it provided the “material basis” for theevocation of sinister forces. The Manson Family—according to eyewitnesstestimony, published in many sources but most noticeably in The GarbagePeople—were constantly strung out on acid in the weeks and months leading up tothe Tate and La Bianca killings. Tex Watson was said to be so deranged fromconstant use of the drug that he forgot his own mother’s address and phonenumber. Manson consciously used the drug as a tool in his arsenal, along withsex. In one instance, he told an interviewer that he would make a womanexhausted with physical work before he would have sex with her, so that she wasin no mood to have sex at all. Then he would approach her and gradually work onher until the point where she began to respond to his sexual ministrations; atthat point, Manson believed he had control of her mind and could convince her todo anything. That combination of sex and drugs and a kind of perverse operantconditioning are the basic working partsof what Ed Sanders calls “The Manson Secret.” It was what CIA psychiatrist EwenCameron was working on until virtually the day he died, except that Manson wasmuch more successful. As documented in The Nine, Cameroncreated zombies; Manson created assassins.Another aspect of the Satanic and Nazi elements of Manson’s philosophy was theapocalyptic. Manson was seen carrying a Bible and constantly referring to theBook of Revelations, also known in the Catholic Douay Rheims translation asApocalypse, where he pointed to messages and omens that he felt were referringto him, his mission, and the general state of the world. Just as FundamentalistChristians are concerned with the “End Times” and are only in debate as to whenand how the End Times begin, so was Manson. Manson believed that he would be theengine of Armageddon, the last battle that would usher in a Golden Age. Hebelieved that the End was imminent. In this, he was no different fromFundamentalist Christians, but also had a lot in common with his otherpredecessors: the Thelemites.Those who follow the scriptures of Aleister Crowley agree that a New Age dawnedin April of 1904, when Crowley received The Book of the Law in Cairo. It was thebeginning of the Age of Horus, the Crowned and Con- quering Child, the New Aeonthat would replace Christianity. Crowley perceived himself to be the engine ofthat transformation, and called himself To Mega Therion, a Greek phrase thatmeans “the Great Beast,” the Beast of the Apocalypse known by his infamousnumber, 666. Crowley believed that he, himself, was the Beast prophesied in theBible, and that the women he took as consorts were all “Scarlet Women,” Whoresof Babylon as mentioned in the Apocalypse.Crowley’s take on all of this was not that he was the personification of Evil,but that new Gods—when replacing old Gods—are rejected or resisted at first,until gradually they assume global acceptance, and the old Gods then becomedemons. Crowley identified the New Age with Horus, the Lord of Lower Egypt whoavenged the murder of his father, Osiris, by Set. Jack Parsons, in pursuing hisown spiritual path in the Mojave Desert, began to identify with the Antichrist,inasmuch as he was invoking the presence of the Whore of Babylon herself,spelled in Crowley’s system “Babalon.” Thus, the initial impetus of Thelema wasas apocalyptic and millenial as that of Fundamentalist Christianity. The “EndTimes” were upon us, for Thelemites and Christians alike.It was basically a time to choose sides and may the best God win. While Mansonlooked forward as eagerly to the Apocalypse as later President Ronald Reaganwould do, he saw his own role differently. As both God and Devil, he was unitingthe opposing forces within himself (thus being assured that he would remainvictorious regardless of which side won the Final Battle). Like the pharaohs ofancient Egypt, he was both Horus and Set. Thus, whatever he did was permissible.There was no evil, no good. There was only Manson.And murder.The events that led up to the slaughter on Cielo Drive are still very much indispute. The only witnesses to the gradual build-up of violence among themembers of Charles Manson’s entourage in 1969 are the killers themselves andtheir accomplices: in most cases young renegades so strung out on dope, sex,mystical vibes and California dreams that their testimony reads like OldTestament prophets on angel dust, and with bad cases of tinnitus from sitting alittle too close to the speakers.Part of the problem with Manson was that he found himself suddenly in the midstof all of these “beautiful people,” and he had a hard time dealing with thereality they lived with, and the reality he lived with. He was walking betweentwo worlds, one filled with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys, John Phillips ofthe Mamas and the Papas, Deana Martin (daughter of Dean Mar- tin), TerryMelcher, Peter Falk, Nancy Sinatra, Jane Fonda (whom he despised for her “racemixing”), even little DiDi Lansbury, daughter of actress Angela Lansbury, whogave her daughter a note to carry saying it was all right for her to be hangingout with the Manson Family! In fact, Manson even had one of his songs recordedby the Beach Boys. Pretty heady stuff for an illiterate, fatherless drifter whohad spent most of his life institutionalized in reform schools and prisons.But rather than making him grateful for the turn his life was taking, it madehim bitter and angry. Lists of famous people—show business celebritiesmostly—were drawn up as a Family “hit list” that included Frank Sinatra,Elizabeth Taylor, Tom Jones and many others. No one knows exactly why theresidence of Sharon Tate was picked for the first night of “Helter Skelter,”except that Manson possibly still held a grudge over the way he was treated byTate’s housekeeper on his previous visit. Or perhaps it was as a kind of messageto Melcher, the man who had disappointed him in his quest for fame and fortuneas a rock star: an unveiled threat? (Manson had threatened Dennis Wilson,sending messages to Wilson that he would harm Wilson’s young son, when Wilsondid not come across with cash that fateful weekend.) Or perhaps there wasanother aspect to it, a connection with drugs that has bothered investigatorsfor some time.A few nights before the Tate slaughter there was a strange event at the house onCielo Drive. A dope dealer from Canada was punished for selling Jay Sebring baddope. According to actor Dennis Hopper, twenty-five people were invited to watchthe dealer get whipped and to participate in the whip- ping. They videotaped theevent, as they had other events involving—again, according to Hopper—“sadism,masochism and bestiality.”14 Hopper claims that LA police informed him aboutsome of this information. The tapes have never surfaced, but rumors in theHollywood underground have always insisted that they exist. Some say that theLAPD has them in a safe place, much like J. Edgar Hoover’s famous “secretfiles,” to be used when necessary to coerce or persuade a celebrity tocooperate.This event cannot be considered in isolation from the Tate killings. Ac- cordingto Hopper, the public humiliation of the dealer took place three days before themurders at Cielo Drive, which would make it on or about August5th. Manson had complained to Gary Hinman about a bad batch of mesca- line onJuly 26th. The burn was worth two thousand dollars. Hinman was killed.Hairstylist to the stars (and former lover of Sharon Tate) Jay Sebring hadcomplained about getting burned to the tune of the same two thousand dollars. Hewould die in the Tate house. Only the type of drug is in question: was Sebringtalking about cocaine or mescaline? According to Ed Sanders, Sebring’s burn—andthe subsequent whipping of the drug dealer—involved cocaine.15 That there weretwo dope burns for the same amount of money in each case, less than two weeksapart, is probably coincidence; but it got Gary Hinman murdered, got a dopedealer whipped on Cielo Drive in front of twenty-five eyewitnesses includingmany celebrities, and led up to the horrific murders in the same house onlythree days later.Police and prosecution officials are naturally reluctant to discuss this case’speculiarities even now, more than thirty years after the events in question. Onone side, this is because—as Vincent Bugliosi has admitted in his own book onthe Manson murders, Helter Skelter—the police investigation of the Tate and LaBianca killings was shoddy, to say the least; but it is also because theperpetrators are still alive, still behind bars, and no one wants to jeopardizethat. New evidence could be used in a new trial, or at least to get some of theconvicted murderers out on parole. It could also embarrass a lot of people inHollywood. Thus, we are forced to rely on informants, independent investi-gative journalism, police snitches, and the like.Or, when more murders take place that have a ring of similarity to the Mansonkillings, we can begin to see connections where there were none before. MauryTerry has been criticized for his book, The Ultimate Evil, because it discussesthe existence of a nearly unbelievable nationwide Satanic conspiracy in theUnited States involving drugs, Hollywood, and murder. However, Terry’s bookmanaged to get the Son of Sam case reopened in the State of New York due to theevidence he presented showing that more than one person was involved in the Sammurders …something of which many of us who lived in New York City at the timewere convinced. In addition, Terry’s information on the occult scene in BrooklynHeights and Manhattan in the 1970s is detailed and accurate, as the authorhimself can attest from personal experience. Terry’s information regarding thedrug dealer punishment on Cielo Drive is therefore important.According to Terry,16 the pistol-whipping of the Canadian drug dealer—who islikewise named “Billy Doyle” in the first edition of Ed Sanders’ book TheFamily—took place on the same night as a party for French film producer RogerVadim, who was married at the time to actress and anti-War activist Jane Fonda.Billy Doyle was well-known to the Cielo Drive crowd, since Abigail Folger andVoyteck Frykowski (both Manson murder victims) had lived on Cielo Drive beforeTate and Polanski moved in, and Frykowski was heavily involved in the drugtrade, being largely financed by his girlfriend who was the Folger Coffeeheiress. Frykowski was running LSD and MDA, along with whatever else was goingdown. Doyle and several of Frykowski’s friends had crashed Roman Polanski’shouse-warming party on Cielo Drive in March 1969 and were thrown out, much totheir irritation. After the Polanskis left for England in April, however,Frykowski moved back into Cielo Drive with Abigail Folger, and the visits byDoyle, et al. resumed.17 Jay Sebring, who would become a murder victim a fewdays later, brought some film that had been shot that night at Vadim’s party toa developer for processing; it is suggested that the whipping of Billy Doyle wason that film.It is important to note that Roman Polanski himself, in his autobiography,disputes this characterization of his friend Frykowski very strenuously, as hedisputes other stories that have made the run of the press.18 Whether this wasout of loyalty to his friend, or a simple statement of fact, is impossible todiscern at this remove. Polanski also implies that there was no cult activity ofany sort at Cielo Drive19 without ever specifically denying it, blaming it on areporter’s discovery of a Ouija board in his home; a conclusion that isdifficult to accept. Instead, he says that the police “gave no credencewhatsoever to tales of stray pickups, orgies, drug excesses, and black magic.”20His explanation of the “hood on Jay Sebring” is that a police officer draped acloth over Sebring’s head because the victim’s wounds were so grisly.21 We knowfrom other sources that Manson himself placed the towel around Sebring’s head,just to throw off the investigation; much in the same way he planted an old pairof eyeglasses at the scene that had investigators running around for monthstrying to identify their owner. One of the strangest omissions from Polanski’sautobiography is any mention of the poor doomed gossip columnist Steve Brandt,who was, after all, one of the witnesses to his wedding to Sharon Tate. Brandtdoes ap- pear, however, in John Phillips’ autobiography, and his accountreflects what everyone else has said about Brandt’s relationship to Sharon Tate.Informants close to the case have insisted that the Tate killings had a motivethat went beyond Manson’s Helter Skelter philosophy. They insist that the targetof the killings was Frykowski, and not Sharon Tate. That the killings werecontracted to Manson. As were the La Bianca slayings the next night. Polanskibelieves that Manson chose the Tate household as a target because he believedthat Terry Melcher still lived there and blamed Melcher for his failure tosucceed as a rock star. 22The La Bianca murders, according to Polanski’s theory,were only to throw off the investigation. Using a kind of circular logic,Polanski implies that since no one has ever accused the La Biancas of orgies,drugs, and black masses that these could not have been factors in the Tatekillings, either. And so it goes.Maury Terry raises an important point in his observation of the killings, onewhich cannot be easily ignored: if Helter Skelter was the true motive, then whydid the killings stop after La Bianca? There was no evidence linking the Mansonclan to any of the killings; they were still in the clear on Tate and La Bianca,although Bobby Beausoleil had been picked up for the Hinman murder. They couldhave continued their Helter Skelter murder spree much longer before beingstopped. Why only that one weekend in August? Why only the five victims at theTate house (six, if you count Sharon Tate’s unborn son) and two at La Bianca?The only reason that makes sense is that both murders were contract hits, andthat Manson dressed it up in Helter Skelter for the benefit of his young femaleassassins. (It is presumed that Tex Watson knew of the real motive, or had asuspicion anyway, as it was he who drove the car to the Tate residencespecifically; it was not a random selection.)Helter Skelter was Manson’s “program” for the brainwashed murderers; it provideda context, and it also influenced their choice of bloody graffiti at each scene,thus laying the crimes off on the Black Panthers. For Manson, it was two birdswith one stone, so to speak. He could spread the evil message of Helter Skelterwhile meanwhile getting paid—in some form, since money seemed to be in shortsupply in the days immediately preceding and succeed- ing the murders—by thedrug dealing establishment to rid them of some problems. Once Frykowski’s drugconnections were known, then a motive for his killing could be understood. Andonce Leno La Bianca’s indebtedness to the Mafia was known, another motivepresented itself.The brilliance behind these crimes had nothing to do with Manson himself. Thebrilliance was in selecting Manson and his assassins as the hit team, for itobscured the real motives and thus the real powers behind them. Further, due tothe sensitive nature of the victims involved and their incestuous relationshipswith Hollywood, occultism, drugs, and “alternative” sexual practices—much of itcaptured on videotape—there was very little danger of their friends run- ning tothe police with information that could get the real masterminds into trouble.The Tate killings spread tentacles into the very highest reaches of Hollywood.Beginning with Terry Melcher and Dennis Wilson, and extend- ing outward to theMamas and the Papas, Jane Fonda, Roger Vadim, Jack Nicholson, Dennis Hopper, andso many others whose names were household words, the blood had splattered allover Benedict Canyon in an aerial spray that reached Mulholland Drive, BeverlyHills, Bel Air, North Hollywood, Malibu, and the back lots of studios all overtown. Drugs, murder for hire, sadomasochistic sex on videotape involvingcelebrities, and satanic rituals … is it any wonder LAPD had a hell of a timetrying to extricate one strand of nastiness from another? The “scarlet thread ofmurder” never ran so red as it did on August 9, 1969 at 10050 Cielo Drive.Since the trial, more information has come to light concerning the Manson Familyand its connections to the murder victims. There are witnesses who insist thatManson knew Abigail Folger from the “Summer of Love” days in San Francisco in1967, shortly after Manson was released from prison. Ac- cording to thesesources, Folger had invested in the Straight Theater in the Haight-Ashburysection of the city, only blocks from where both Manson and the Process set upshop. The Straight Theater, on September 21, 1967, had staged a performance byThe Magick Powerhouse of Oz in honor of the “Equinox of the Gods,” and KennethAnger was in attendance filming the event, as was Bobby Beausoleil, Manson,Folger, and many others includ- ing—according to sources close to theevents—former members of the OTO Agape Lodge of Pasadena and the Process. It wasa virtual occult convention, and Manson was able to “network” with a lot ofpeople who would become notorious in the years to follow.Information that became available to Maury Terry long after the killings showsthat Manson had become involved with the Process after the Straight Theaterperformance in 1967, and through early 1968, at the famous Spiral Staircasehouse in Topanga Canyon (not far from where Bobby Beausoleil and Catherine Sharewere filming Ramrodder), which was a kind of occult headquarters and sex clubcombined; this information came from one of the convicted Manson killers, andwas confirmed by Manson in his “au- tobiography.”23 In a further development,Manson—in a letter written in 1989—claimed to have met with Process leaders(naming names) at the Tate residence! 24Clearly, the relationship betweenManson, Abigail Folger, Terry Melcher, Dean Moorehouse, Dennis Wilson, JohnPhillips, the Process, Sci- entology and 10050 Cielo Drive is much moreconvoluted and involved than the trial ever revealed. While Manson had becomeinvolved with occultism and “black magic” while in prison, this interest waskicked into high gear during the Summer of Love and beyond.Another startling piece of information concerns Donald “Shorty” Shea, the Spahnranch hand and would-be actor who was murdered a few weeks after the Tatekillings, allegedly because he “knew too much.” In this scenario, attested byinformants to Terry and Sanders, Shea had known both Manson and Folger in thosehalcyon days in San Francisco. Shea had later come down to the Spahn Ranch whenManson and his group moved in. Something went awry between the two diminutivepersons and Shea was eventually murdered, his body found in the desert longafter the trial, homicide detectives led there by Steve “Clem” Grogan, who wasalso a putative source for Scientol- ogy officials concerning Manson’sinvolvement with the Hubbard cult. Thus the attack on the Tate residence andsome of the murders that would follow seem linked to events that transpired andconnections that were made in San Francisco two years earlier, with the somberdrapery of ceremonial occultism drooping menacingly over the mis-en-scene. Inthat case, perhaps Donny Shea knew too much after all.What follows is a brief description of what we know transpired that night ofAugust 9, 1969. It is necessary to demonstrate to the reader the sheer savageryof the attack as compared with the mental and emotional state of theperpetrators. It goes to motive, as they say in murder trials. The authorapologizes in advance for the graphic recreation of the event.Susan Atkins (age 21), Linda Kasabian (age 20), Tex Watson (age 23) and PatriciaKrenwinkle (age 21) left in an old white and yellow ’59 Ford for the Tateresidence, Watson driving. Manson had been at the Tate residence at least twicebefore, once when Terry Melcher was dropped off after a meeting and again on hisown, a few months after Melcher moved out, when he was supposedly looking forMelcher. The last time he actually saw Sharon Tate was through a doorway whenher housekeeper answered the door. Melcher, the son of Doris Day, had beenliving at the house with his girlfriend, the actress Candace Bergen, beforeSharon Tate and Roman Polanski moved in. (Additional information emerging sincethe trial indicates that Manson may actually have spent much more time at theTate residence with Melcher and company in the days before the Tates moved in,and thus knew the layout of the house quite well, data which he may havecommunicated to Tex Watson who, among all the killers, would have been the onethat Manson entrusted with sensitive information.)Watson was armed with a handgun, and two of the women carried knives. Theybrought a change of clothes with them, so that they could switch to theirdark-colored “creepy crawley” outfits on the way to the death house. This wasalso in order to rid themselves of what would become clothing drenched in bloodby the time the holocaust was over.They parked down the street from the Tate residence. Tex Watson cut thetelephone lines to the house, and the four of them crawled over the fencesurrounding the lot and made their way to the house.There is a rumor that Manson thought that Sharon Tate would not be there thatnight. She actually had plans to visit a friend, but changed these plans at thelast moment. Her husband, Polish film director Roman Polanski, was in London atthe time working on The Day of the Dolphin, a film inspired by the true story ofthe Navy’s training of dolphins for military purposes. (When the film wasfinally released, the trailer described the plot as involving a nefarious schemeusing dolphins to assassinate the President of the United States. When theauthor saw the trailer in a Manhattan movie theater, the audience laughed andapplauded. Well, it was New York. And Nixon was President.)But that month Polanski was frustrated with the way the screenplay was going,and was making plans to return to California early. His friend, the brilliantand quirky novelist Jerzy Kozinski, was also on his way to California. Hisluggage had been lost, though, so he decided to wait in New York City until theyfound it. It was the luckiest decision of his life. Had he arrived on time, hewould have been at the Tate residence that night.Voytek Frykowski was there, of course, along with his girlfriend Abigail Folger.Sharon Tate, eight months pregnant, was sitting in her bedroom talk- ing to JaySebring. Sebring had been Sharon’s lover before Roman Polanski arrived on thescene and broke that up. Friends in Hollywood claimed that Sebring still carrieda torch for Ms. Tate, and he had remained good friends of her family. WhenSebring opened his new salon that summer, the Tates were in attendance: DorisTate, Sharon’s mother who later started a fund for crime victims, and Sharon’sfather, Colonel Paul Tate, an intelligence officer with the US Army who had beenserving in Vietnam. Colonel Tate would go underground in California after themurders, hunting for his daughter’s killers.A young man, Steven Parent, was just leaving the Tate residence by car. As hewas going down the driveway, a man stood in front of the car and waved it tostop. He told Parent to get out of the car, but the boy refused. His body wouldlater show defensive knife wounds, but it was the bullets that killed him. TexWatson fired four times into the car, killing the eighteen-year-old and leavinghim there.The killers then proceeded to the house.Linda Kasabian, recently arrived in California from her home in Milford, NewHampshire, pregnant and with an infant daughter, stayed behind at the fence towatch for unwelcome visitors. She says she had no stomach for thekilling, and was horrified by the shooting of Parent. Things were spiralling outof control. The women went up to the house with Watson, knives at the ready.Watson also carried a length of rope with him. The idea was to hang the victimsfrom the rafters of the living room, and then gut them.Susan Atkins was known to the Family as “Sadie” or “Sexy Sadie” (after theBeatles song on the White Album) or “Sadie Mae Glutz.” Patricia Krenwinkle wasknown as “Katie.” Virtually all of the Manson Family members had aliases, butthese were not aliases in the criminal sense of the word (although they wouldoften be used that way); these were names they adopted upon joining the Family.This action suggests a process that Robert Jay Lifton calls “doubling,” or thecreation of an alter ego or dissociated identity to enable he individual tobecome a killer responsible for acts of unbelievable savagery, and then re-entersociety as if there had been no effect on the individual’s personality, psyche,or soul.Manson, meanwhile, remained behind at Spahn Ranch. Before the killers left ontheir mission, he told them, “Now is the time for Helter Skelter.” He gaveWatson some specific instructions, directing them straight to the Tatehouse with the ostensible reason that they were going to steal whatever moneywas there to bail some Family members—Mary Brunner (the mother of one ofManson’s children) and Sandy Good—out of jail, having been arrested that dayafter trying to use some stolen credit cards. According to Watson’s latertestimony, Charlie had told them to go to the next house if they didn’t getenough money there, and the one after that if necessary, until they had amassedthe six hundred dollars bail money they would need. That was the cover story,anyway.Manson, who was no stranger to crime, knew the risks of ripping off people whoknew him. There were a lot of houses in Los Angeles to rob that night; theycould have picked one with no one home, where no one could identify them later.Instead, he chose the one house in LA, outside of Dennis Wilson’s home, wherehis merry band would be familiar to the residents. That theft was not theprinciple motive for the murders is clear from the overkill at the Tatehousehold, and the elaborate preparations, including the rope and Manson’sinstructions to the girls to “Leave a sign. You girls know what to do. Somethingwitchy.”25 In the Tate homicides, as in the La Biancas, nothing of any value wasstolen, even though—especially in the case of the La Biancas—there was a lot ofjewelry, a coin collection, etc. that would have been easy for Manson to fence.In any case, they did not follow these alleged instructions and would return toSpahn Ranch immediately following the carnage.The girls had gone to a common arsenal and selected the knives they were goingto use. Watson carried a nine-shot .22 revolver, and took a few hits ofamphetamine for the road. Susan Atkins had been snorting amphetamine for daysbefore the murders, and was on a perpetual high from the speed. PatriciaKrenwinkle was just coming down from an LSD trip, and was groggy from lackofsleep. Linda Kasabian had a valid driver’s license, so she was elected to goalong with them as the designated driver in case they were stopped by police,even though Watson would be doing all the driving that night. Squeaky Fromme,who would later attempt to assassinate a President, helped her find the license,which was kept in a communal cache under the close supervision of the pixie-ishFromme.When they entered the house, slashing through a mesh screen with their knives,it was Frykowski who saw them first. The stereo blaring, and Frykowski him- selfin the midst of a ten-day “mescaline experiment” (once again, echoes of AldousHuxley and the Doors) he struggled to get up from the couch where he was lying,to focus on the strange-looking man suddenly standing in the living room.“Who are you?” he asked.“I am the Devil, and I’m here to do the Devil’s business,” Tex Watsonreplied.Susan Atkins was ordered to look in the other rooms and find out how many peoplewere in the house. She saw Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring in one room, talking, andAbigail Folger in another, reading, bringing the total to four people in thehouse. The body of Steven Parent was still in his car in the driveway outside,shot in the upper chest, left forearm, left cheek, lower chest. Abigail Folgerlooked up and saw Susan Atkins smile at her; she smiled back,a little uncertain. Strangers were always coming and going at Cielo Drive,friends of Sharon’s, friends of Jay’s or Voytek’s. Drug connections, actors,musicians, mystics … who knew? On the piano’s music stand in the living room,two compositions were open: one, Elgar’s “Pomp and Circumstance,” the standardfor high school graduation classes everywhere, and a melody used to ironicpurpose in Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece, A Clockwork Orange; the second, moreominously, by John Phillips, from the first album of The Mamas and The Papas:“Straight Shooter.” 26In another building on the estate, caretaker WilliamGarretson was oblivious to the shooting and other sounds coming from the Tateresidence; he was listening to The Mamas and The Papas and the Doors.It was about half-past midnight in Los Angeles on August 9, 1969. The fol-lowing day would be the thirty-fourth anniversary of Robert DeGrimston’s birthin Shanghai. One wonders how the Process Church of the Final Judg- mentcelebrated their founder’s birthday. Devil’s food cake? Black candles? Doggiebag?That same day, Disneyland opened their Haunted House ride.That night, Steve Brandt—former press agent for Sharon Tate, legal witness ather wedding to Roman Polanski, and columnist for Photoplay magazine—washaving dinner at a Japanese restaurant in Los Angeles with John Phillips of TheMamas and The Papas.27 For a brief time he would be a suspect in the murderseven though he cooperated with police, and gave them “voluminous” informationon Tate, Polanski, Frykowski, and the LA drug scene, before committing suicidein New York City after several other failed attempts. He was afraid he was on ahit list. Why?Many more thousands of miles to the west, across the Pacific Ocean in Japan,it was four-thirty in the afternoon of the same day, the twenty-fourthanniversaryof the atomic bomb attack on Nagasaki. There had been peace demonstrationsthroughout Japan but especially in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the two townsdevastated by the blasts of “Little Boy” and “Fat Man,” respectively, while inVietnam in the summer of 1969 the war went on without a break: more soldiersdied, more civilians died, flames and chemicals and bombs destroying thelandscapeand maiming its inhabitants, and Nixon—who cut the deal with President Thieuto sabotage the peace process and prolong the war until after his election—saweverything that he had made and, behold, it was good. And the evening and themorning of the first day.And no one got out of there alive.Susan Atkins herded Sharon Tate, Jay Sebring and Abigail Folger into the liv-ing room, where Frykowski—a survivor of the Nazi invasion of Poland—was alreadybound with towels. Patricia Krenwinkle did not have a weapon, and rushed outsideto where Linda Kasabian was waiting, took her knife, and then rushed back to thehouse.Although Tex Watson had brought a long length of rope, Frykowski was tied upvery inefficiently with towels they found at the Tate home. This was obviously avery poorly-planned robbery. In the end, they took less than eighty dollars fromthe scene, leaving jewelry, electronic equipment, and credit cards behind.Again, robbery as a motive doesn’t play.Tex ordered the three newcomers to lie on their stomachs on the floor. Sebringobjected, saying that Sharon Tate was pregnant and that she should be allowed tosit. Tex ignored him and ordered them all on the floor again, at which pointSebring lunged for the gun in Watson’s hand. Watson fired, and Sebring was down.The women screamed. Watson then kicked Sebring in the face. He demanded moneyonce again; this time Abigail Folger said she had some cash in her bedroom.Susan Atkins led her there at the point of a knife. The take was seventy-twodollars. Total. For the night.Tex then ordered that all of the victims be tied together with the length ofnylon rope that he brought with him, tied around their necks. Abigail Folger andSharon Tate had the rope tied around their necks, and then one end was tossedover a ceiling beam and down to where Jay Sebring lay, unconscious from thegunshot wound, and tied around his neck. Tex ordered that the lights be turnedout, and the rest of what transpired took place in relative darkness. He toldthe assembled victims that he was the Devil once again, and then he told themthat he was going to kill all of them. The women began screaming again; Sebringwas still unconscious; Frykowski was struggling to free himself of the towels.Watson ordered Susan Atkins to kill Frykowski. She came up on him with herknife. The towels did not hold him. He got loose and jumped at Susan, pullingher down by her hair as they struggled over the knife. Getting her arm free, shebegan stabbing Frykowski over and over again. The slaughter had begun.Susan stabbed Frykowski in the legs and then aimed for his chest, hitting hislung, but he still struggled, and she lost her knife in the chaos. It would turnup later, long after the killers had returned to the Spahn Ranch, stuck in achair cushion. Susan jumped on his back, yelling, as Frykowski crawled to thedoor. Tex Watson aimed his .22 at the escaping man and shot him several times,but to no immediate avail. Finally, Watson began clubbing him to death with thebutt of the gun, breaking it in the process.During the attack on Frykowski, Abigail Folger managed to break free and ran forthe rear of the house. Patricia Krenwinkle gave chase, and the two fought, asWatson turned to see that Jay Sebring was regaining consciousness. Watson thenbegan stabbing Sebring repeatedly. Krenwinkle screamed she was having problemswith Abigail Folger, who by this time had been stabbed in the arms as she triedto defend herself against Krenwinkle’s blade. Finally, though, Abigail gave up,exhausted and bleeding. Watson slit her neck, and then stabbed her repeatedly inher abdomen after smashing her head in with the gun butt.Frykowski, meanwhile, had managed to escape outside the house to the front lawn,where he began screaming for help. The Tate house was in Benedict Canyon, andthe echoes carried far. No one responded to his desperate plea for life. WilliamGarretson in his caretaker’s cottage was listening to the Doors and ignoringwhatever was going on outside his four walls. “This is the end…” Watson ran outof the house and jumped on Frykowski, dragging him to the ground and stabbinghim a total of fifty-one times.At the same moment, Abigail Folger—still alive after having been stabbed andhaving her throat slit—made her way, step by bloody step, to the rear of thehouse and freedom. Krenwinkle gave chase, leaving a bloody fingerprint on thedoor in the process, but Abigail had managed to almost reach the fence in therear of the house past the swimming pool when she collapsed onto the ground anddied.Sharon Tate was alone in the house, with the body of Jay Sebring. She started towalk towards the front door when Krenwinkle entered the house through the backat a run. She stopped Sharon’s escape, and held her in a headlock. Sharon begancrying, begging to be left alive so she could have her baby. It wasn’t tohappen. Watson and Atkins entered the house, Susan Atkins holding Sharon’s armsand Patricia Krenwinkle her legs. Sharon turned to Susan and begged for her lifeonce again, or at least the life of her baby.Tex told Susan to kill her. Susan declined. He told Patricia to kill her. Shealso declined. Then Tex began to stab Sharon Tate, and eventually all threestabbed her a total of sixteen times. Her baby died a few minutes after hismother. Susan Atkins, in recalling the murder to another prison inmate, said,“It felt so good, the first time I stabbed her.”Tex ordered the women out, and then he went around to all the corpses in afrenzy, stabbing them all again for good measure and kicking their heads. Theythen ran down to where they parked their car, looking for Linda Kasa- bian.Their clothing was drenched in blood.Linda had tried, a little ineffectually, to get Atkins and Krenwinkle to stop.Still horrified by the corpse of Steven Parent, she wanted nothing more to dowith killing. When the screams and the shots resounded all over the Canyon shehid, terrified, in some bushes and later made her way to the car. The killersbegan looking for her, but couldn’t find her on the estate; so they made theirway back to the Ford, where they found Linda at the wheel, starting the car.They jumped in, Tex taking over the driving, and they changed their clothes,making a bloody bundle for Linda to toss over a cliff. This bundle would befound later, as well as the broken gun Watson had used to kill Par- ent, Sebringand Frykowski.(There were a total of 102 stab wounds over the five victims. When the SpahnRanch was raided—seven days later on August 16, 1969—and Manson arrested onauto-theft charges unrelated to the Tate and LaBianca killings, there would be atotal of 102 law enforcement personnel involved.28 Three days later, themurderers would all be freed).The killers returned to Spahn Ranch, to find Manson sitting outside, wait- ingfor them. When he got the story of what happened, he shook his head and demandedto be taken to the scene of the crime, where he would add a few touches of hisown, such as draping a towel over Jay Sebring’s head. The important point toremember is that Manson did not go to any other houses that night; he did notrob anyone else, and there was no further attempt that day to raise any moneyfor Mary Brunner’s bail. In fact, he let Brunner stay in jail for quite sometime, when it would have been easy enough for him and his crew to raise the bailmoney through their usual methods. Once again, money was not the issue, androbbery was not the motive.Manson knew the house well. He had been there with Terry Melcher. He saw SharonTate on one visit to the house after Melcher left. He knew Abigail Folger fromhis days in San Francisco. It’s possible he knew Frykowski as well, sinceFrykowski was Abigail Folger’s lover and also because Frykowski was runningdrugs in Los Angeles, much to the discomfort of some long- standing dealers. Hewould have been the perfect person to use to take care of Frykowski, since thedealers would have known of Manson’s relationships to the house and itsinhabitants.But other things went on at the Tate house, any of which could have pro- vided amotive for murder. Witnesses have come forward to say that hokey satanic ritualstook place there, some of which were filmed. Was this only some HollywoodHalloween kinkiness, a bunch of people dressing up in robes and chantingnonsense for fun? Or was there actual cult influence on Cielo Drive? As forfilm, police did confiscate one film from Cielo Drive showing Sharon Tate andRoman Polanski making love, which they then returned. Another witness hasinsisted that group sex was a feature of the Tate residence, sex that involvednumerous celebrities, but which would also include strang- ers picked up in theclubs or along Sunset Strip or Santa Monica Boulevard. Jay Sebring was known tohave a predilection for kinky sex, and was found to be in possession of bondageequipment. Dennis Hopper, as noted above, claimed LAPD told him of the existenceof bondage, sado-masochism and bestialty films connected with the case. And, ofcourse, they were all doing all sorts of drugs.None of this is grounds for slaughter, certainly. Today, much of what was justdescribed could be found in thousands of homes across America; but in thepre-VCR days, average citizens did not videotape each other having sex. Therewas no such equipment available to the general public. What did ex- ist wasextremely expensive and hard to come by, and required at least some training inits use. Further, the films taken would have to be developed at a film lab, soone needed pretty good connections to get “questionable” material processed,although that was usually not a problem for those already in the film industry(as this author can himself attest). Once the VCR and the video camera becameubiquitous in America, however, people began filming each other in varioussexual states with reckless abandon, even selling the product on the open marketas “amateur” films; this has only increased with the easy availability of basicdesktop computer equipment, digital video cameras and multimedia software.Imagine, however, the heady intensity of those days in 1969 when only a handfulof people had the capability to film each other, people associated with the filmindustry itself. The temptation to do so was overwhelming.The author has no doubt that numerous “private” films were made in those days,films of sex, certainly, and possibly of torture and murder as well. The FBI hasconsistently reported that there is no evidence for the existence of “snufffilms,” that it is an urban legend, and we have to respect their state- ments onthis. If anyone should know, the FBI should know. However, it is simply untruethat no one to date has filmed a murder.The Son of Sam investigation has revealed—according to Maury Terry— that somefilms were made of specific killings. We also know for a certainty that serialkillers Leonard Lake and Charlie Ng of northern California in the1980s did videotape the torture and death of their victims, of which twenty werefound buried around their cabin in Calaveras County. Leonard Lake—a formerMarine who had served in Vietnam—considered himself a pagan, a worshipper ofOdin, and was involved in creating the famous “unicorn” ex- hibit at the Barnumand Bailey Circus in 1984. With sexual tastes that were exclusively sadistic, hewas involved in the pornography business, making films of women who were tied upand tortured. Later, he turned his pornographic fantasies into reality, andwound up killing his victims on camera and tak- ing still photos of theircorpses before burial. (He committed suicide with a cyanide capsule while in thecustody of the San Francisco Police Department in 1985, before the police evenknew his real name.)Thus, “snuff ” films do exist; whether they exist in the marketplace as acommodity is, of course, highly doubtful. Whatever does exist may be held eitheras blackmail material (real or potential) or for viewing by selectedindividuals. With the advent of the video camera, everyone can share in themagic of Hollywood; horror has become democratized, and the only ques- tion iswhether your filmmaker neighbor is the future Wes Craven, John Carpenter… orLeonard Lake.News of the Tate homicides broke later that day when housekeeper WinifredChapman arrived and found the bodies. The story of the hideous crime madeinstant headlines all over the United States and the rest of the world. Manyindividuals with guilty consciences immediately went into hiding, believingthemselves next on the hit list even though the police had no leads and did notknow the motive for the crime. The drug trade in Hollywood and the rest of LosAngeles was severely affected, as drugs were the first thing on everyone’s mind,and homicide detectives began leaning on their informants all over town. Cultmurder was not ruled out, either, nor were starlets, studio executives, andmovie stars with connections to Polanski, Tate, Frykowski, and Folger. Due toSharon Tate’s husband, some people were of the opinion that the murders weresomehow related to Polanski’s film Rosemary’s Baby, perhaps in reprisal by someoffended coven or secret lodge. There was also the possibility that JohnPhillips of The Mamas and The Papas was involved; Polanski had once slept withPhillips’ wife, the singer and now actress Mi- chelle Phillips, and Phillips wasangry over that. Polanski actually considered John Phillips the prime suspectand investigated him on his own, coming up empty. Then there was a substantialrumor pointing to what Ed Sanders calls a “voodoo cult” operating from Jamaica.Polanski went down to Jamaica to check it out, and again came up empty.The Jamaican angle is interesting because Canadian drug dealer Billy Doyle, whowas beaten at the Tate house only days before the killings, was known to haveflown drugs into the United States from Jamaica specifi- cally. The idea wasthat Doyle had arranged the killings as retribution for the treatment hereceived on Cielo Drive, and contracted a cult of killers from Jamaica to do thedeed. This only fits what we know of the crime if we maintain that the Jamaicancult then sub-contracted the hit to a known lo- cal cult, the Manson Family.There is no evidence to support this, of course, and one suspects it would havebeen easier for Doyle to go direct to Manson with the contract.Manson himself has said that the real motive behind the Tate killings wouldnever be revealed (by him), but that it was so explosive it would rock theestablishment. One tends to believe Manson in this instance, perhaps because ofhis personal code of honor which stipulates that one never rats or informs onanother criminal, and perhaps because he has never tried to use this informationto get himself better treatment in prison. Of course, the reverse may also betrue: that Manson has no information to trade;. But Manson’s own publicself-identification with Robert Moore deGrimston of the Process Church of theFinal Judgment—and the Church’s subsequent visit to Manson,after which Manson no longer said a word about the Process—has opened a can ofworms, a deep and unsettling suspicion that just won’t go away.More murders were committed in the coming weeks and months, as the policeinvestigation went nowhere. The day after the Tate killings, Leno and RosemaryLaBianca were killed in their home after being tied up by Manson, who then leftand ordered his minions to perform the actual homicides. Again, if robbery wasthe motive then they were pretty poor thieves, since they left jewelry andvaluables worth many thousands of dollars all over the house, including a coincollection. Leno LaBianca’s phone had been tapped, as it was later discovered bypolice, and the supposition is that the wiretap was federal and somehowconnected to a famous bookie—known as The Phantom—who lived on the same streetas the LaBiancas. Were the LaBiancas killed because the mob believed they weregiving information to the Feds, when actually the information came from awiretap? This doesn’t seem likely, as the Phantom did not move from his homeuntil after the LaBianca killings, indicating he did not have foreknowledge.Yet, he did move, and soon after the murders, indicating he at least knew theLaBiancas and was afraid of being dragged into the investigation, or that he hada snitch inside the police department who told him of the phone tap and itsimplications.The LaBianca killings were the most cultic. It was at LaBianca that the po- licefirst came across the term “Helter Skelter” used in connection with the murderspree, as this phrase was written on the wall in blood, along with the word“Rise.” The word “War” was carved into Leno LaBianca’s stomach; and a servingfork was stuck into it as a final touch. Leno was killed first, within range ofhis wife; when they found him later, the police noticed a knife stuck in hisneck along with the serving fork in his stomach.That night, August 9th to August 10th, Manson, Tex Watson, Linda Kasa- bian,Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkle and Steve Grogan had all piled into the car.Manson was going to show the murder crew how it was done. This time, they droveaimlessly through Pasadena for a long time, up and down streets, until finallyManson stopped in front of one house, got out of the car, and then returned afew minutes later having decided not to “do” that house, making the whole thinglook random. (One wonders if they passed the house where Sirhan’s family lived;or Jack Parsons’ old neighborhood.) He next stopped at a church, which waslocked.Then, they drove directly to the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles, to a house onWaverly Drive. Incredibly, Linda Kasabian had been to the house next door backin June of 1968 for a “peyote party.”29 She panicked, thinking that Manson wasgoing to break into that house. Instead, Manson said “No, the house next door.”The one at 3267 Waverly Drive.This was the real target.Manson went into the house first, armed with a sword. He tied up Leno and hiswife with leather thongs, took Mrs. LaBianca’s wallet, and then left the house.He went back to the car, and ordered Tex Watson, Patricia Krenwinkle and LeslieVan Houten into the house to kill the two people; kill them, but don’t frightenthem.He would leave in the car with Susan Atkins and Linda Kasabian; the others, whenthey were through with the slaughter, would hitchhike back to Spahn Ranch.The three killers went into the house, saw the terrified couple tied up in theliving room, and then went into the kitchen to select a long serving fork and aserrated knife. They separated the two people, and the girls took RosemaryLaBianca into a bedroom while Tex Watson kept Leno LaBianca in the living room.The girls placed a pillow case over her head and tied her neck with a lamp cord,shoving her face down on the bed. Then her husband began to scream.Tex Watson had ripped off Leno LaBianca’s pajama top and began stab- bing himrepeatedly. Leno’s hands were still tied behind him, and he couldn’t maneuverhimself away from the berserk killer. He was stabbed four times in the throatand four times in the abdomen with the serrated knife from the kitchen, with apillow over his face to muffle the screams. The kitchen knife was stuck in hisneck in a brutal recreation of the murder of Manson’s uncle, Darwin Orell Scott,a few months earlier in Ashland, Kentucky. Blood was everywhere in the livingroom.Rosemary LaBianca heard the screams and struggled with the two women, droppingto the floor and crawling to the living room. The women stopped her, and beganstabbing her, severing her spinal cord. She bore forty-two stab wounds when itwas all over, mostly from Patricia Krenwinkle at first and later from Tex andLeslie Van Houten.Tex then returned to the body of Leno LaBianca and carved the word “War” intohis abdomen. Patricia Krenwinkle took the serving fork and stabbed both bodieswith it, leaving it finally in the stomach of Leno LaBianca. Then, in his blood,they wrote “DEATH TO PIGS” on one wall, and “RISE” on another. In the kitchen,on the refrigerator, they wrote “HEALTER SKELTER,” a rather strange misspelling.They wiped down the house for fingerprints, took a communal shower to wash offthe blood, then they went back to the kitchen to get something to eat. They werehungry.Meanwhile, Manson, Steve Grogan, Susan Atkins and Linda Kasabian drove to a gasstation to place Rosemary LaBianca’s wallet in the rest room, hoping that ablack person would find it and use the credit cards, thus placing the blamesquarely on the Black Panthers. It would be months before the wallet was everdiscovered, however.In the meantime, there was a spontaneous plan to kill someone else that night,an actor living in Venice who had portrayed the role of Lebanese poet KahlilGibran in a movie, a person known to Linda Kasabian. They stopped in front ofhis apartment house, and Manson handed her a pocket knife after showing her howto use it to kill someone. Then he left in the car.Kasabian, not willing to kill anyone, pretended to knock on his door, but sheknew it was the wrong apartment. When the actor did not show up, she went backto Atkins and Grogan with the news and they continued on theirway, hitchiking back to the Spahn Ranch.Watson, Krenwinkle and Van Houten also hitchhiked back to the Ranch. Their onlyspoils from the murders: a handful of foreign coins not worth more than a fewdollars they found in a small bag. Once again, robbery was not the motive. MaryBrunner in jail for stolen credit cards was not the motive. Bobby Beausoleil injail for the murder of Gary Hinman was not the motive. These were eithercontract hits, taken on by Manson for reasons undisclosed to this time, or wehave to believe that they were the opening salvos in Manson’s dream of ignitinga race war.If the latter, then why did the high-profile murders suddenly stop? While manymore murders were committed in the days and weeks to follow, they werelow-profile attacks on members of the Family who knew too much… or onScientologists for some strange reason also yet to be divulged. Steve Grogan,who had been to the LaBianca residence with Manson, was pursued by theScientologists, who believed he had information on Manson of value to them,according to an internal Scientology memo dated 22 June 1970, just after thestart of the trial. The memo does not state why the Church was interested inManson, but it does go on to report on the conversion of Man- son to Scientologywhile in prison with Lanier Raimer (called in the memo “Lafayette Raimer”) atMcNeil Island. The memo confirms that Raimer’s wife was “in training here at theL.A. Org in 1965-66; she had disconnected from Raimer.” Obviously, if Manson wasinvolved with Scientology, then the Church of Scientology was very eager to findout how, and to what extent, so that they could perform some damage control.But was Manson—through his famous “Family”—behind the series of kill- ings ofScientology members and others close to the investigation that began in 1969 andwhich extended to the deaths around the Son of Sam killings in the late 1970s,murders that were variously described as “retaliation” killings or even asdamage control?Item: October 31, 1969. Halloween. Sharon Tate friend Steve Brandt attemptssuicide in Los Angeles, over fear of a hit list with him on it. He survives,only to succeed a month later in New York City.30Item: November 16, 1969. At almost the same location where the body of MarinaHabe was discovered on January 1, 1969, the body of another young woman wasfound. She had been stabbed 157 times. She was identified as “Sherry” by RubyPearl, a horse wrangler who worked at the Spahn Ranch. Nothing else is knownabout her, or who killed her so brutally, leaving her roughly where Marina Habe,similarly stabbed, had been left.Item: November 21, 1969. Los Angeles. The bodies of two teenagers were found inan alley; they had each been stabbed more than fifty times. The eldest, DoreenGaul (19) was a Scientology “clear” who had been living at the Church ofScientology. The boy, James Sharp, was only fifteen, but also a Scientologymember. They had been killed with a long knife or bayonet (or sword) somewhereelse and dumped in the alley. The crime has not been solved. It was claimed thatDoreen Gaul was a former girlfriend of Scientologist and convicted Manson Familykiller Bruce Davis, but this has never been confirmed. It is known that Davisflew to London that month and did not surface again until the following year.Item: December 1, 1969. The anniversary of Aleister Crowley’s death. CharlesManson—captured by police on the anniversary of Crowley’s birth, October 12,1969—has now been publicly associated with the Tate/La Bianca murders in a pressconference given on this day in Los Angeles. On the same day, in London, SandyGood’s former husband—Joel Pugh—is found naked and dead in a hotel room where hehad been living since that October. His wrists had been slashed, as had hisneck. He was living on the ground floor, with window access to the street. Thepolice cleared the incident as suicide and did not investigate further, eventhough there was writing on the mir- ror and other written materials in theroom. They didn’t even bother taking fingerprints. The possibility that this wasmurder cannot be ruled out. Bruce Davis was in England at this time, and wasnaturally acquainted with both eminent Family member Sandy Good and her husband.Was Joel Pugh another man who knew too much?As we will see later, more murdered Scientologists turn up in the Son ofSam investigation.These killings took place in an atmosphere of reprisal and damage con-trol—murders committed by Family members or on Family members—after the Tate andLaBianca killings. One of these was of Donny Shea, who was murdered and buriedat the Spahn Ranch on or about August 25, 1969; it was Steve Grogan (aka “Clem”)who eventually led police to the site. Shea is believed to have known Manson andAbigail Folger as early as 1967, when Manson was first released and living inSan Francisco. It is believed he was killed simply because he knew too much ofManson’s past and his links to the Tate residence. The murder was made easierbecause Shea had been agitating to get the Family moved from Spahn Ranch, asthey were bad for the Ranch’s business of renting horses.On November 5, 1969 Family member John Philip Haught (aka “Zero”) was killedplaying Russian roulette with a loaded gun in a house in Venice, California.When the gun was examined by police, it was discovered that it had nofingerprints. Bruce Davis was present at the time, but an informer stated thatone of the women had killed Haught. No one believed that Haught killed himselfwhile playing Russian roulette with the loaded revolver, but the case wascarried as a suicide as there were many witnesses—all Family members—whoinsisted that this was the case.Without going further into all the minutiae of the case, it is enough to reportthat the Manson Family was raided on October 12, 1969 for reasons unrelated tothe Tate and LaBianca killings. As noted, this is Aleister Crowley’s birthday, aday celebrated by many of the cults that adhere to his teachings. It is also, ofcourse, Columbus Day. Yet, it would not be until December 1, 1969—theanniversary of Crowley’s death—that the Los Angeles police would come to theconclusion that the people they had in custody were responsible for the Tate andLaBianca killings, a conclusion based largely on jailhouse talk by Susan Atkinsto another inmate, as well as corroborating testimony by people close to theFamily …and by Linda Kasabian, who turned state’s evidence and told in detailabout both the Tate and La Bianca killings.One interesting detail—noted almost in passing in Polanski’s autobiog- raphy—isthat someone at LAPD suspected the Manson Family in the Tate killings longbefore any such suspicions were made known, and had indeed connected them to theHinman killing. Lieutenant Bob Helder had made it known to Polanski (soon afterSharon Tate’s funeral, and therefore sometime in August) that they were lookingat “a possible lead involving a bunch of hippies living in the Chatsworth areaunder a commune leader, ‘a crazy guy who calls himself Jesus Christ.’”31 Hadthis lead been followed up immediately, they might have saved Donny Shea. As itwas, Manson was rousted again and again that month on unrelated charges and letgo every time.The trial would begin June 15, 1970 and would last until January 25, 1971, withthe penalty phase not over until March 29th of that year. During that time thetrial itself would become a microcosm of insanity, as lawyers were hired andfired, as the antics of the accused and their supporters disrupted the courtroomconstantly, and as Richard Nixon would proclaim Manson guilty, on August 9,1970: the first anniversary of the Tate killings and four years to the daybefore he would resign as President in the wake of the Watergate investigation.No matter. When the trial was over, all defendants—Manson, Krenwinkle, Atkins,Leslie van Houten—were found guilty and sentenced to death; fortunately forthem, the death penalty was repealed in California and they wound up with lifeimprisonment instead.More trials would take place, however: for Bruce Davis, Bobby Beausoleil, StevenGrogan, Charles “Tex” Watson. All would be found guilty. Bruce Davis turnedhimself in to authorities on December 2, 1970, a few days after thedisappearance of Manson Family trial lawyer Ronald Hughes (to be discussedbelow), after spending the anniversary of Crowley’s death in the sewers beneathLos Angeles. Charles “Tex” Watson—who led the killers in sheer viciousness andrage—was found guilty on October 12, 1971: again, Crowley’s birthday. Mansonhimself was held in a special jail cell on the thirteenth floor at thecourthouse, the one that had been specially built the previous year for SirhanSirhan.Manson’s lawyer, Irving Kanarek, was a flamboyant attorney with a knack forconstant objections, frivolous motions and generally wasting everyone’s time.One of the best—possibly apocryphal—stories about him tells of his objectionwhen a witness was asked to state his name. “Objection!” yelled Kanarek.“Hearsay! His mother told him his name.” He was, however, an effective triallawyer in spite of the opprobrium in which he was held by fel- low attorneys andjudges. Yet, in Manson’s case, he had virtually nothing to work with. Manson atone point even attacked the judge, leaping up to the bench, and had to bedragged down and put in chains. Kanarek himself had an odd and suggestivebackground, for this lawyer of many years practice in the State of Californiahad begun his career as a chemical engineer. A rocket engineer. Specializing inpropulsion systems.It was Kanarek who addressed the court one day during the Easter holiday and,after reading aloud from the New Testament, asked the court if they really knewfor certain that Charles Manson was not Jesus Christ?Kanarek eventually had some sort of nervous breakdown years later, and wound upin a mental institution for a short time even as he was being sued. And eventhough his opponents knew where he was at the time, they didn’t inform the judgeas to Kanarek’s whereabouts. Even so, he was one of the lucky ones. AnotherManson attorney was not so lucky.Ronald Hughes became Leslie Van Houten’s attorney, even though he had no trialexperience.32 Manson’s approach to litigation was unusual, to say the least. Hewas not particularly interested in going free or in getting a vigor- ous—or evena barely effective—defense. He was more interested in making his message known,in converting the judge, the lawyers, the jury and the rest of the world to hisway of thinking. He was also insistent on the “Family” staying together andproviding a united front. To these ends, the lawyers he chose were morerepresentative of his personal, mystical agenda than they were of an attempt tobeat the system. The selection of Irving Kanarek and Ronald Hughes wasreflective of this. Kanarek could be counted upon to say the most amazing thingsduring the trial, even going so far as to openly wonder if perhaps Manson reallywas Jesus Christ. Ronald Hughes, as a man totally unprepared for a murder trial,was the perfect choice—to Manson’s way of thinking—to defend Leslie Van Houten,who was on trial for the La Bianca murders only. Initially, there was an attemptto separate Van Houten’s defense from the rest of the Manson Family, but thatwas shot down even though it may have given her a better chance. The importantthing was to keep the Family together, both in the courtroom and outside. Whatthey did not need was a savvy trial attorney pulling all sorts of tricks thatwould get some of them off and leave the rest behind. If Manson was going down,they were all going down.Outside the courtroom, Lynette Fromme was doing her best to hold the Familytogether. She became the nucleus of what was left of the Manson cult, andostensibly the one who transmitted Charlie’s orders to the rest of the clan,orders that resulted in the deaths of several more people. Orders thatresulted—according to Sandy Good—in the death of attorney Ronald Hughes, the“first of the retaliation murders.”33At a break in the trial on the weekend of November 27, 1970 Ronald Hughesdecided to go camping at Sespe Hot Springs, something he did quite often. Thesprings are about two hours drive northwest of Los Angeles. Hughes would go upthere on a Friday night and stay until Sunday. That weekend, the weekend beforehe was to begin his portion of the trial involving Leslie van Houten, hedisappeared.He was last seen alive on Saturday, apparently in good health and good spirits.There had been a flash flood that weekend, and speculation was that he wasstranded. The people who had driven him up that weekend were found, and theyclaimed that they left early because of the rain but that Hughes wanted to staylonger. They themselves became stranded when their car got caught in the mud,and they had to hitchhike back to Los Angeles.This was something of a problem for the trial, of course, with Miss Van Houteninsisting she wanted no other attorney than Hughes. Eventually, the court ap-pointed another attorney for her and the trial proceeded. The new lawyer wasdetermined to do what he could to save Van Houten, which sent Manson into arage. His plan was to have Van Houten testify against herself and in favor ofManson, to exonerate him, and her new lawyer was having none of it. The judgeinsisted that new counsel be found for Leslie Van Houten in spite of everyone’sobjections. That was on December 2, 1970. That same day, Bruce Davis and hiscurrent girlfriend and Manson Family member Brenda McCann (Nancy Pitman)surrendered to authorities. This raised a great deal of suspicion in the mindsof defense and prosecution attorneys alike. Vincent Bugliosi, the leadprosecutor, felt sure that the events were related. Why would Bruce Davis—whowas wanted for two murders (Hinman and Shea)—turn himself in when the police hadno idea where he was? And surrender only a few days after the equally suspiciousdisap- pearance of Leslie Van Houten’s defense attorney? And on the same daythat the judge decided that she needed a new lawyer? It seemed obvious to manypeople that Manson was behind the strategy, possibly designed to create amistrial.Hughes had become increasingly independent over the course of the trial. Itseemed certain that he would call Leslie Van Houten to the stand with the intentto crucify Manson, when Manson wanted the reverse to take place. Inaddition, Hughes feared Manson, and Manson knew this. Everyone knew it. Hughesmade no secret of the fact that Manson scared him, but he was going to do whathe had to do as an attorney to provide the best possible defense for his client.His client was not Charles Manson; it was Leslie Van Houten.His body was reported discovered on the last day of the trial, badly decomposedand face down in a pool of water. The decomposition was so bad that an autopsyrevealed very little. It was believed at first that he had simply been caught bythe flash flood and drowned. Although many had their suspicions, they had noevidence and no eyewitnesses to work with.Yet, when filmmaker Laurence Merrick was making his own documentary film on theManson Family, Sandra Good told him—in front of a witness—that Ronald Hughes wasmurdered. The timing of the murder was, of course, highly suggestive of amotive: to keep him from doing his duty before the jury that coming Monday anddefending Van Houten at the expense of Manson. This is essentially what SandraGood confirmed.Merrick’s film, Manson, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1973. Merrick hadbeen an acting coach for Sharon Tate, and had easy access to the Family memberswho were still at large. He was shot to death at his studio in Hollywood in1977.Family members were still involved in murder and attempted murder. BrendaMcCann, aka Nancy Pitman, was arrested on November 11, 1972 in Stock- ton,California. Brenda had been Bruce Davis’ girlfriend, with whom she had been onthe lam in the Los Angeles sewers for months before they turned themselves induring December 1970. This time, she was found in a house which contained a bodyburied in the basement, that of Lauren Willett (19), who had been shot in thehead. Along with McCann were two members of the Aryan Brotherhood, as well asanother woman named Priscilla Cooper (21). Both women had X’s carved into theirforeheads, identifying them as Manson Family members. What alerted police to thehouse was the fact that a car parked outside belonged to a man who had beenmurdered a few days earlier in Northern California. James T. Willett was aformer Marine, and had been found in his Marine uniform: killed with a shotgunand decapitated. As the police were busy arresting the four people in thehouse—which contained a small arsenal of weapons—Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme calledand asked to be picked up, evidently in the slain Mr. Willett’s car. The policewere only too happy to oblige.The motive for the murders remains unknown to this day. It is known that theWilletts had been associates of the Family for some time, at least a year if notlonger according to Bugliosi. 34Bugliosi also wondered if James and LaurenWillett were the same James and Lauren who had driven Ronald Hughes to hiscampsite; if so, their deaths would be in accord with the Family’s tradition ofmurder-as-cover-up. Bugliosi was unable to find the original James and Lauren,who had long since moved from their last known address. Eventu- ally, the twomen of the Aryan Brotherhood confessed to the crimes and were sentenced, as wereNancy Pitman and Priscilla Cooper. There was nothing to hold Lynette Fromme, soshe was set free.And in September 1975, she attempted the assassination of President Ger- aldFord in Sacramento, California. She was convicted and has spent all her lifesince then in prison, except for an escape attempt from the Federal Cor-rectional Institute at Alderson, West Virginia during the Christmas holidays of1987, when she heard a rumor that Manson had contracted cancer. She was found inthe woods a few days later, and brought back to the prison. In1989, Lynette Fromme was transferred to Marianna, Florida.Ruth Ann Morehouse, a young native of Minot, North Dakota, whose father tried torescue her from Manson but who later became a devotee was involved in a bizarreattempt to murder a witness, one Barbara Hoyt, in Hawaii.Barbara Hoyt (17) had been with the Family since April of 1969. She was presentat Spahn Ranch when Donny Shea was murdered, and heard his screams. She was toldby Ruth Morehouse (known as “Ouisch”) of ten ad- ditional murders they hadcommitted besides the Tate and LaBianca killings. She had heard so much at theranch—and also at other Manson hideouts such as the Barker Ranch in DeathValley—that she was an important material witness and could tie together names,dates and places.Barbara Hoyt agreed to cooperate with the authorities and act as a witness inthe trial against Manson and company, even though she was afraid for her life.However, before she could testify, Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme, Ruth Ann “Ouisch”Morehouse, Catherine “Gypsy” Share and Steve “Clem” Grogan convinced her to goto Hawaii instead. Barbara agreed to leave California jurisdiction and hide outin Hawaii until the trial was over. It seemed like the line of least resistance.That was on September 6, 1970.She flew to Honolulu with Morehouse and stayed in the penthouse suite at theHilton Hawaiin Village Hotel.35 Like so many assassins who figure in Americanhistory over the past hundred years, they had first class travel accommodationsand no indication exists of where the money came from. The same time everymorning, Ouisch would leave the hotel and make a call to the Family from a payphone. On the morning of September 9th, she was summoned back to California andgiven certain other instructions. She made arrangements to fly back thatafternoon, but Barbara Hoyt was to remain behind in Hawaii.They went to the airport together, and Ouisch suggested to Hoyt that she eatsomething, even though Ouisch herself wasn’t hungry. Barbara ordered ahamburger, and Ouisch carried the tray to a table while Barbara stood in line atthe cash register to pay for it.By the time Barbara had returned to the table, Ouisch had laced the burger witha lethal dose of LSD.Ouisch—Ruth Ann Morehouse—then boarded her flight, leaving the now disorientedBarbara Hoyt alone in the airport. Hoyt began to feel very strange, and startedwandering around and then running into the street. She was found sprawledoutside in traffic, and rushed to the emergency room where her life was saved.After that incident, she was eager to testify against the Family.Catherine “Gypsy” Share was not to be outdone. Her parents had been mem- bers ofthe French resistance against the Nazis during the Second World War, and hadbeen executed. She was raised by a foster father in the United States, and hadbecome an accomplished violinist… as well as a dedicated Com- munist. When shefinally met the Manson Family, her Communist beliefs became muted, as sheadopted more and more of the Manson philosophy and actually found herselfmarrying one of the pro-Nazi Aryan Brotherhood. It was Catherine Share whoappeared in the soft-porn film Ramrodder with fellow Mansonite Bobby Beausoleil,both appearing as Indians and Bobby as a murdering warrior with a knife.As the trial against Manson progressed, Share and the other members of theFamily began developing practical relationships with members of the AryanBrotherhood, a racist prison gang that has been implicated in all sorts ofviolence both inside and outside prison walls. In this case, it was an at- temptto spring Manson from jail by first robbing a store that sold weapons. On August21, 1971, Catherine Share and Mary Brunner—along with four men who were alsoFamily members and in at least once instance (Kenneth Como) a member of theAryan Brotherhood—robbed the Western Surplus Store in the Hawthorne section ofLos Angeles of roughly 140 guns, stor- ing them in a van parked in the alleybehind the shop. The LAPD had been called to the scene by a silent alarm, and agunfight ensued in which seventy rounds were fired. No one was injured, and thesix Manson Family members were arrested.It was later discovered that the attempted theft of the surplus store was partof a larger plot to free Manson by hijacking a 747 and killing hostages until hewas freed. During the trial, one of the accused—Kenneth Como—managed to escapeby sawing through the bars on his cell on the thirteenth floor. He was picked upby Sandy Good, but Sandy smashed up the van and Como fled on foot. He wasapprehended a few hours later.Eventually, Catherine Share would get ten years to life, Mary Brunner would gettwenty to life, Kenneth Como fifteen to life, and the others various sentences.Catherine Share would later marry Kenneth Como. Mary Brun- ner—the very firstFamily member and the father of Manson’s son Valentine Michael—served six andhalf years, and is now living under an assumed name in the Midwest. ValentineMichael—named after a character in the famous Heinlein novel Stranger in aStrange Land—is alive and well and wants nothing to do with his father. (He wasthe subject of a series of articles and interviews in Nerve magazine.) CatherineShare eventually divorced Como, and has turned a new leaf, distancing herselfcompletely from Manson and the rest of the Family. One of the other Hawthornerobbery culprits, Family member Dennis Rice, is now an ordained Christianminister, as are two of his sons, who were “Manson children” at Spahn Ranch.THE MANSON-NIXON LINE (WITH COMPLIMENTS TO ROBIN WILLIAMS)Readers may wonder why I took so much space to outline the history of the MansonFamily. Readers of Book One know I have focused on it since the beginning ofthis study, which concerns, after all, the identification of the sinister forcesthat have influenced American life, culture and politics since the earliest daysof our history. I trust that my purpose will become more clear as the chaptersprogress and my thesis becomes more compelling. This is difficult terrain. Thisis about evil. Standard appraisals and explanations of evil will not suffice ifwe are to truly confront it, and vanquish it. As Americans, we have trusted ourleaders who have always pointed in another direction every time we werethreatened. The American Revolution. The War of 1812. The Mexican War. TheSpanish-American War. World War I. World War II. Korea. Vietnam. Grenada.Panama. The Persian Gulf. Afghanistan, Iraq.The only war fought on our soil in nearly two hundred years was the Civil War,and the fight was over slavery and the right of states to secede from the Union.That war was costly, bloody, and hard fought; but, in a sense, it was too easilywon, for when it was over, and the South defeated and the slaves emancipated, wethought we had solved our internal problems. We thought we had solved theproblem of slavery. We thought we understood the rights of our citizenry. Wethought we were all on the same page in our hymnals. We did not attack rootcauses. We had treated a symptom of evil, and thank God for it; but we did notbanish the sickness from our shores.Now, in the wake of a horrific attack on the United States—specifically on NewYork City and the Pentagon—we are faced with another threat, and once again ourleaders are pointing abroad. Yet the technology of terror was designed, built,and delivered from the United States, and Charles Manson was—and still is—theepitome of this technology. We have not studied the phenomenon closely; like allgood Americans, we have fought the war, cap- tured the enemy, put him behindbars and forgotten all about him. But the demon in the smoke that crawled out ofthe God Struck Tower on September11, 2001 bore the face of Charles Milles Manson, the bastard son of America andproduct of its institutions and—even more importantly—scion of its barteredSoul. This is not easy to understand now; it will become easier and more certainas we proceed a little longer, for what we are disecting are the limbs, organsand nervous system of the Manson Secret.Two major strands of American history meet in 1969: Hollywood, with all that theidea of Hollywood implies, and another strand that is much more elusive, moredifficult to define with a single word, but which represents the dark nightmareside of politics. We may think of it as Watergate, as long as we remember itincludes everything from what Nixon termed “the whole Bay of Pigs thing” topolitical assassinations, support for Nazi war criminals, right wing militarydictatorships, and bags of dirty money. We like to think of these twostrands—Hollywood and Watergate—as opposing forces, as Us and Them, but in thestrange non-Euclidean geometry of the American psyche, these parallel lines meetin a tight little knot in August 1969.The technology that had been researched, developed and fine-tuned by our ownintelligence services since the end of World War II found its apotheosis inmurder and madness. Americans, more than any other people in the world, lovetheir illusions, their dreams, their flowery phrases and idealistic declara-tions. They have created an entire industry based on illusion: Hollywood. Thedeep effect that film has had on the human psyche has yet to be analyzed or evensufficiently addressed. We err if we believe that film is only stagecraft mademore brilliant, more accessible. Stagecraft itself is a form of occultism, asteachers such as Stanislavsky realized at once; cinema is occultism plus light.It is powerful, and it is one of the reasons why so many foreigners hate Americawith an abiding passion; hate America enough to kill it. The only nation thatcomes close to America in the intensity of its film industry is India, and Indiarecognizes the power of cinema to the extent that certain types of film arenever made in that country: x-rated pornography (even kissing is rare) andoccult-oriented films. Sex and magic.American intelligence, on the other hand, plumbed the depths of sex and magic(and drugs) to understand illusion, and to manipulate it and make it a weapon.They used the prisons as testing grounds, violent criminals and psychopaths assubjects. They broke through. The seal was broken. And demons were unleashed.American filmmakers did the same thing. The manipulation of illusion, thechallenge to reality that takes place in a movie theater, may only be momentary,an hour or two in a darkened temple before the icon screen of transmitted light;but its effects are long-lasting. Hence, the propaganda film.Maybe all films are propaganda films. Our enemies certainly see it that way; andmaybe we don’t know our own strength. We never learned how to use this medium inthe most efficient way. Like the mad scientists of MK- ULTRA, we play with thetechnology, test it, write it up in reports; people like Charles Manson take itand sharpen it.Richard Nixon was born and raised within spitting distance of Hollywood and theback lots. He spoke in terms of theater, of acting. He met his wife on thestage. His policies paved the way for another actor to become President. Heconsulted psychics and preachers, and toyed with converting to Catholi- cism. Heprotected Nazis who pretended to be priests. He understood the power ofillusion, and the manipulation of reality. He was open about it. He counseledothers in the philosophy of deceit; because lies and truth are all relative whenit comes to power.Power, to people like Manson and Nixon, is the only reality, the only abso-lute. Nixon had to proclaim Manson guilty to the press; he had to address theone other man in the country who understood power, and truth, and evil, andmurder the way he did. On the plane of the real world as understood by the mediaand the public at large, Manson was an insignificant crook compared to Nixon,the President of the United States, undeserving of the President’s atten- tionor comment; but on another plane, Manson and Nixon were warring black magicians,fighting over airtime and the fifteen-second sound bite. Manson was manipulatingillusion, and that was supposed to be Nixon’s forte.Manson may be virtually illiterate, but no one doubts his intelligence. He was anatural at what he did; his followers are now more numerous—more than thirtyyears after the Tate and La Bianca killings—than they ever were before. He hasattracted support from racist, right-wing, and neo-Nazi or- ganizations all overthe world. It is not the intention of this author to state unequivocally thatManson was created in prison labs by the G-scale engineers of MK-ULTRA; but hecould be the Mind-Control Poster Boy of 1969.The “Manson-Nixon line” is a term coined by Robin Williams, the ac- tor andcomedian, as a pun on the Mason-Dixon Line, which separated the Northern andSouthern states in nineteenth century America, with the newer version separatingtwo different states of mind. Yet I sense something more profound in Williams’turn of phrase: Manson and Nixon as the Alpha and Omega of a scarlet threadrunning through the American soul, a Great Divide separating Americans from eachother, and from the rest of the world, and from what they know to be good,honest and virtuous. A thread of expedi- ency, cynicism, pragmatic choices andrealpolitik where the end justifies the means … and sometimes, not even that.When, as detailed in The Nine, Frank Olsen was pushed out the window of theStatler Hotel in New York City in 1953 and fell ten stories to his death, he wasthe first of those who fell from the doomed World Trade Center almost fiftyyears later. The technology that destroyed him created the terrorists of AbuNidal, Hamas, Hizbolleh, and Al-Qaida. He—and they and so many others—werevictims of the Manson Secret.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Kenneth D.

This wasparticularly the case when they were led by Rashid al-Din Sinan, their mostfamous leader and the original ‘Old Man of the Mountain.’—Farhad Daftary, The Assassin Legends1Seest thou not that We have set the devils on the disbelievers to confound themwith confusion?—Qu’ran, 19:83Nothing is true; everything is permitted.—saying attributed to Rashid al-Din SinanIn early 1947—the same year as Aleister Crowley’s death in England, the infamousUFO sighting by Kenneth Arnold, the Roswell crash, and the creation of theCIA—some scrolls were found in the caves of Qumran in what is now Israel. Theramifications of this discovery have yet to be felt by the average man and womanliving in the twenty-first century, two thousand years after the scrolls inquestion were written and hidden in the clay jars of Qumran. More discoveriestook place over the intervening years, not only in Qumran but also in NagHammadi, a site in Egypt where the first of the “Gnostic Gospels” werediscovered in 1945. Taken together, the finds represent the single mostimportant challenge to the accepted belief and dogma of Christianity, and to thehistorical record of Judaism and even of Islam, which is largely based on Jewishand Christian scripture and tradition. Along another line, the find alsorepresents the accidental revelation of the existence of one of the oldestsecret societies in Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia: a society so old,and with secrets so well-kept, we don’t even know what to call it. The pieces ofthose secrets—like a handful of pottery shards on an archaeologist’s table—areslowly being assembled into something recognizable, but it may still be yearsbefore the whole story is understood, even by scholars. What has been discoveredso far, however, has caused eminent historians of Christian, Jewish and Islamicorigins to completely reevaluate their thinking.Barbara Thiering, Elaine Pagels, Hugh Schonfield, J. M. Allegro and Rob- ertEisenman are some of the mainstream Biblical scholars whose books on the subjectof the identity of Jesus, of his brother James, of Simon Magus, of JudasIscariot, of all of the original apostles, of the gospels (of which there aresomewhat more than the usual four), and of various sects, cults, heresies andtraditions have formed a kind of “anti-history” that calls into question thelast two thousand years of European belief systems, political affairs, andecclesiastical developments. Allegro, one of the early Dead Sea Scrolls schol-ars along with Schonfield and Eisenman, also saw a drug connection which hepopularized in The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross (Doubleday, 1970), a thesisconsidered scandalous in its time.These discoveries have made it possible for other studies to be under-taken—usually by popular journalists—that question every facet of acceptedknowledge and wisdom concerning the Bible, Church history, medieval his- tory,the Crusades, the religious wars of Europe, and the blood-lines of kings andmystics alike. Books by authors like Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, HenryLincoln, Graham Hancock, Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas, Lynn Picknett,Clive Prince, and many others have all followed in the wake of thesediscoveries, popularizing some of the more arcane data, and sometimes imaginingor speculating on the rest. The books by these other authors are usually strongon sources, regardless of how outlandish their conclusions may seem. Obviouslyserious about their research, they want their theories to be taken seriously.Though what results, quite often, is a great deal of infighting and criticism ofeach others’ work, this does little to dampen the enthusiasm of the readingpublic for this type of scholarship. It cracks open a door to the inner sanctumof academia, and finally allows the rest of us a glimpse at what our own historymay really be like. One such opening began in 1966, when the standard history ofthe last two thousand years of western civiliza- tion was seriously challengedby a renowned scholar—who would eventually be nominated for the Nobel PeacePrize—and the world has not been quite the same since.I am referring, of course, to the publication of The Passover Plot by Dr. HughJ. Schonfield.In 1966, America was in the midst of the Johnson Administration and anescalating war in Vietnam. The hippie movement was in flower, and would reachits apotheosis in the Summer of Love in 1967. Martin Luther King and Robert F.Kennedy were still alive. In that year, Dr. Schonfield—an impor- tant Biblicalscholar and one of the first to examine the Dead Sea Scrolls of Qumran—publisheda book designed for the general public on what the Dead Sea Scrolls (and otherrecent research) had to say about the life and death of Jesus. His conclusionswere so controversial that even Dr. Schonfield himself characterizes his subjectas “the strangest human enterprise in all recorded his- tory.”2 Yet, hisconclusions were perfectly in accord with what Middle Eastern and Europeansecret societies have always insisted, even as long ago as the first centuryA.d., which is that Jesus never died on the cross, but was still alive when hewas taken down a bare three hours after having been crucified; or, as some otherscholars insist, that he survived the events narrated in the New Testament, andlived to a ripe old age. Naturally, if it could be proved that such was thecase, then the entire Christian edifice comes tumbling down, for nothing is ascentral to Christianity as the item of faith that Christ died on the cross andwas resurrected—came back to life, rose from the dead—forty hours later.Schonfield later expanded his findings in a number of other books and papers,including one—The Essene Odyssey—which addresses some of the issues concerningthe relationship of this Biblical scholarship to later investiga- tions of theKnights Templar and the Freemasons, as developed in The Holy Blood and the HolyGrail by Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln.This latter work (published in the United States in 1982 as Holy Blood, HolyGrail) was as controversial in its time as The Passover Plot fifteen yearsearlier. Again, we are told that Jesus did not die on the cross, but that hisbloodline survived, even though his descendants were often pursued andpersecuted by a Church which could not allow this obvious challenge to or-thodoxy to become public knowledge. We are told of Jesus’ heirs manifesting asthe Merovingian kings, and that the Knights Templar were repositories of thesacred secret of the Holy Blood, the “Sang Real,” a secret that was passed downto the Rosicrucians, the Freemasons, etc.Thus, according to this theory, a political and religious dynasty has existed inhiding for two thousand years and has had an inordinate amount of influ- enceover the progression of world events, as certain select leaders—in politics,religion, science, culture—were brought in on the secret and made members ofthis intellectual elite, and given the key to understanding the codifiedmysteries of millenia. While Schonfield did not wholeheartedly support theconclusions of Holy Blood, Holy Grail, he did offer his own speculation that theBiblical Jesus wound up far from home. Schonfield tended towards the idea thatJesus wandered out of Palestine, across the Afghan frontier and into the heartof Kashmir, and was buried in a tomb built in accordance with Jewish traditionin the fabled city of Srinagar, where it can be seen today.That the world—at the time of this writing, in the first decade of the twenty-first century—is on the verge of a horrible world war that could germinateeither in Palestine or in Kashmir is satanic testament to the force of religiousand political events that transpired in these two regions two thousand yearsago, events that have been shrouded in mystery, in propaganda, in fantasy, butwhose truths have been carefully preserved by a brotherhood of initiates, passeddown in codified form for millenia.All of the theories of the existence of a secret society of enlightened men, asociety that has existed down through the ages, have as their origin either aband of geometers and architects based around the creation of the Egyptianpyramids or a similar guild of craftsmen who were involved in the erection ofthe Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem … and sometimes both (as in the case of theFreemasons). The technology of architecture and construction was once believedto be sacred, and geometry was held to be a powerful art. The Freemasons stilluse the square and the compass as their universal symbol of God as the GreatGeometer, a reference to their alleged involvement in the creation of some ofthe world’s most enigmatic and compelling monuments including everything fromthe pyramids to the Temple of Solomon to Chartres Cathedral and the layout ofWashington, D.C.This combination of science and magic, of geometry and goetia—at the service ofa lawful King—is what makes the idea of an ageless secret society of wise mentimeless and still relevant today. In ancient times, this society was probablynot secret, since it was in the employ of the State; but as il- legitimaterulers became the crowned heads of Europe, the society that once supported theState went (or was driven) underground, and their arcane knowledge went withthem. Such is the belief today held by many. When we consider how many Americanpolitical leaders throughout the past two hundred years were Freemasons—andhence were exposed to these ideas, whether they embraced them or not—then wemust ask ourselves if any of these ideas have received confirmation orcorroboration from scientific and academic sectors, confirmation that wasrevealed only at the highest levels of government. One feature of this “lostscience” was obviously an item on the agenda of the Central Intelligence Agency,that of occult control of the human mind, consciousness, memory and will.The Egyptian Pharaohs were at once religious and political leaders; the powerthey held over their people was absolute. King Solomon is also associated withoccult power. The grimoires that falsely bear his name—The Greater Key ofSolomon, The Lesser Key of Solomon—are evidence that the association of the nameof Solomon with ceremonial magic and the control over demonic forces was takenfor granted by centuries of magicians and sorcerers. Solomon was a Jewish king,and the surmise is that this occult power was passed down to generations of holyJewish leaders, down to the time of Jesus. Some sources attribute the idea of a“genie in a bottle” to the time of Solomon and the building of the Temple: thatthe spirits he conjured to build the Temple were imprisoned in a jar that hadSolomon’s Seal upon it, and thus were unable to escape, until at one point thebottle washed up on shore and it was opened by a curious passerby, causing thedemons to fly to the four corners of the world. The Keys of Solomon are said tobe the means whereby these demons may be forced to obey the will of themagician, since they include Solomon’s Seal, which is a reminder to them oftheir time in spiritual “durance vile.”It is further insisted by many that the Knights Templar discovered some of thispower during their sojourn on the Temple Mount in the early days of the twelfthcentury. The precise nature of this discovery is not known. The Ark of theCovenant? The Rod of Aaron? The secret of the Passover Plot? But it seems theydid discover something.It would explain a great deal if they had.THE HASHISH EATERSNearly a thousand years ago, the Western world was enthralled by tales ofIslamic terrorism, espionage, sabotage and assassination. It was believed thatreligious fanatics, devotees of a mysterious Islamic leader who lived in animpregnable mountain fortress, had ordered his men to infiltrate enemy citiesand assassinate their leaders, Christian and Muslim alike. There was no defenseagainst this secret network of killers. They could show up at any time,anywhere, to carry out their murderous agenda. Even worse, they were not afraidto die, and would gladly undertake suicide missions where their chance ofsurvival was nil. This organization came to be known as the hashishiyya, anArabic word that means “hashish eaters.” It was from this word that the Europeanlanguages derived their word assassin, demonstrating a conscious equivalencebetween this obscure (to the West) religious sect, drugs, and thepractice of political murder.Much of what has been written about the Assassin cult was based on hearsay,rumor, propaganda and innuendo. In reality, the Assassins were an Ismaili sectof Shi’ite Islam, the Nizaris (named after their loyalty to Nizar, an IsmailiImam they supported against the Fatimid Caliphs), and their penchant for secrecyand disinformation was due in large part to the fact that their faith wasproscribed by the predominantly Sunni authorities, as well as by other Shi’ites.While much has been made of stories that the cult used hashish as a means ofbrainwashing their trained killers, there seems to be very little evidence thatthis was so. Farhad Daftary, quoted above, is scornful of Western attempts topaint the Nizaris as hashish-gobbling programmed assassins with secret ritualsand a hierarchy of degrees. However, even Daftary has a problem explaining whythey were specifically referred to as hashishiyya by fellow Muslims. Hedescribes a world in the centuries after the death of the Prophet as one inwhich two main branches of Islam—the Sunni and the Shia—fought for hegemony inthe region. The Sunni—as the more orthodox, conservative branch—found the Shiato be heretical in some matters of faith, and treasonous in matters of politics.The Shi’ites believe that Muslims should owe their spiritual allegiance to theblood descendants of the Prophet’s family, through his cousin Ali; the Sunnifollowed the leadership of the Prophet’s friend, Abu Bakr. The term “caliph”means “successor,” and the Shi’ites believe that the descendants of Ali are therightful Caliphs, successors to the Prophet, branding the Sunni Caliphatestherefore illegitimate.We may note here that when Grady McMurtry declared himself head of the OTO—asopposed to other contenders abroad in the land—he chose the term “Caliph.” For aGerman-born quasi-Masonic secret society, this doesn’t appear to make a greatdeal of sense, especially when one looks at a blasphemous reference to Mohammedin the Book of the Law that would certainly incite a thundering fatwa from thethroats of the Ayatollahs, if not an outright jihad; however, a look at therituals of the OTO will demonstrate how closely the Order believes itself to bethe repository of Middle Eastern secrets. Sadly, the Francis King publication ofthose rituals has disappeared due to a concerted effort by the OTO to removethem from library and bookstore shelves; a bit like locking the barn door afterthe horse has been taken out and shot.In addition to the rightful Caliphs, Shi’ites believe that there are secretteachers, or Imams, who guide the faithful in this world and are the representa-tives of the Prophet on earth. The mainstream Shi’ites await the return of thelast—the twelfth or “hidden”—Imam, which they believe could be imminent, and themore fanatic (or devout, take your pick) will do whatever it takes to ensurethat the Imam is incarnated into a world made clean of disbelievers. TheShi’ites of the Ismaili sect—to which belonged the Assassins—had a morecomplicated millenial belief, which will be discussed below.Until the return of the Imam, however, the Shi’ite leadership of the day— andspecifically the more mystically-inclined Ismailis, from which the Nizari weredescended—understood the value of keeping a low profile. The theologi- caldifferences between Shia and Sunni are not great, but as usual the slightest ofdifferences makes for tremendous internecine violence and bloodshed. It was thearrival of the Crusaders in the eleventh century that exacerbated what wasalready a bloody conflict, and the Shi’ites (today a minority compared with therest of Islam, representing about ten percent of the whole) lost no time infiguring out a way to capitalize on the problem and to set Christian and Sunniat each others’ throats, playing one side against the other.The Sunnis had already characterized the Nizaris as “hashish eaters” in theirown writings. Daftary suggests that this was due to the use of the term as apejorative against people of low class: the ignorant rabble. PrincetonUniversity Professor Emeritus Bernard Lewis—in a tightly-focused accountentitled The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam—concurs on this importantpoint.3 Yet, the term seems to be used specifically in reference to the sect ofthe Nizaris and not in general use as a term to describe other sects or faiths.Thus, while the jury is still out on the real history of the Assassins (thereare very few historical documents available, even in Arabic or Farsi, on thedevelopment of the sect), we can view what has come down to us over thecenturies as the West’s perception of this cult and how it may have influencednot only Western intelligence agencies but also the popular imagination of thedisaffected Muslim populations of the Middle East. We can also see how rumors offraternization with the Shi’ites came to condemn those Christian Crusaders whodid have secret rituals and a hierarchy of degrees: Crusader knights whoselegacy—real or imagined—resulted in the creation of such occult lodges andsecret societies as the Freemasons and the OTO.And, as we shall see, we come full circle in the present day when we exam- inethe case of an American intelligence officer who fell victim to the torture andinterrogation practices of a new cult of fedayeen, who learned the hated sciencefrom the same sources as the West.Muslims in general find the very concept of Crusader to be offensive. WhenPresident George W. Bush referred to the war on terrorism in the wake of theSeptember 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, he called it a “crusade,”and immediately evoked the ire of Islamic groups who charged him with a lack ofsensitivity on this issue; Islamic militants pointed to the expression asindicative of what they perceived to be Bush’s real intention: a holy waragainst Islam. Thus can a single, simple word so quickly lead to horror.In fact, the Islamic elements that complained the loudest about Bush’s quitenatural and unconscious use of the word “crusade”—a word in common English andAmerican use that has referred to all sorts of projects, campaigns, andundertakings—should have known better. The word has been used in the Englishlanguage for years without any religious connotation, and cer- tainly not in thecontext of a holy war against anyone or anything. Be that as it may, Muslimsthemselves use the term jihad with reckless abandon, and insist to non-Muslimsthat it is a neutral term which refers to any type of “extreme effort,” orstruggle, including a moral or spiritual struggle within oneself. Thus, shouldthe term “crusade” be similarly understood, as any type of all-out effort.What is worse, however, is the sanctimonious position of Islamic apolo- gistswho castigate American political leaders for their use of the term, as if theactual Crusades happened only a few years ago—and not more than six hundred—andwere a brutal attack on a peaceful people with no hostile inten- tions towardsthe West. Gleeful that Americans—and especially their elected officials—have solittle knowledge of history and so little understanding of its importance(notably President Bush, who, as we have often seen, has little awareness offoreign geography or the niceties of foreign policy), they spin stories aboutsupposed Western imperialism against the East and rely upon guilt and sympathyto promote the idea that Islam is a much-maligned and misunderstood faith.In this day and age of mass communication, video cassette recorders and DVDplayers, home computers and the Internet, one wonders why Islam is stillmisunderstood? Is it because Muslim leaders still misunderstand the West? To besure, it is quite likely that Buddhism, Daoism, Hinduism, Shintoism and otherfaiths are also misunderstood … but Islamic leaders themselves have done nothingto ameliorate the negative image of Islam in the “West,” whereas Buddhist,Daoist, etc. leaders have been successful in attracting Westerners to theirfaiths, as well as in projecting a positive image to those who come acrossEastern religions in the news or on their street corners. The Dalai Lama comesto mind. Yet, at the moment, the only coherent image the West has of Islam is asan intolerant, inflexible, anti-feminist, anti-Zionist, anti-American cult offanatics, whether they are terrorists from the Middle East or followers of LouisFarrakhan in America.That the first shot was fired against the West by Muslim armies marching onEurope in the eighth century A.d. has been conveniently forgotten. The Prophetwas barely cold in his grave before his followers fought, first amongthemselves, and then against everyone else, as they cut a path through NorthAfrica all the way to Gibraltar and across the Straits into what is now Portugaland Spain, and up to France before being blocked by the armies of Charles Martelin the eighth century A.d. But they did not leave Europe entirely, remainingbehind in Iberia and taking Sicily for a while. There were Muslim kingdoms inEurope until 1492, when the Alhambra was liberated from Mohammed XI by thecombined armies of Ferdinand and Isabella. Thus, Muslims held sway in Iberia fornearly seven hundred years. The glories of Cordoba and other Muslim cities onthe Iberian Peninsula are a matter of historical record.The progressive attitude towards science and art that contributed so greatly tothe Renaissance is what the West should know of the flower of Islam. Yet, due toinfighting and squabbling among the members of the ummah—the Muslimcommunity—there has been no unified effort to promote Islam as a religion ofprogress, scientific curiosity, and peace. Various Arab nations compete witheach other rather than cooperate. The plight of the Palestin- ians is used as atool and a weapon to prop up first one Arab regime and then another. Arabintellectualism and Islamic theology is suborned to various national politicalagendas to the point that there is no unified voice of Islam, and the West onlyhears from those Muslim spin doctors they fear the most: the terrorists.During the height of the Moorish kingdoms of Europe, at the very end of theeleventh century A.d., the first Crusades were mounted from France. Troops weresent overland to the Middle East, first to protect Constantinople and theByzantine Empire from attack by the Seljuk Turks, and then to attack the city ofJerusalem and bring it into Christian hands. The invasion and sack of Jerusalemwas brutal, and savage. Thousands of Muslims and Jews were needlesslyslaughtered by Christian armies on July 15, 1099. Of this, there can be nodoubt, as all records—Christian and Muslim—agree on the details. There followeda see-saw conflict that had the Christians in charge one day, the Muslims thenext, for hundreds of years, until the Christians were finally ejected once andfor all in the thirteenth century, and Muslim armies were on the march onceagain into the Balkans under the banner of the Ottoman Empire, an empire thatwould last until World War I reorganized everyone’s priorities.Thus, the history of Christian-Islamic hostilities is long and complex. Neitherside has a monopoly on righteousness where the Crusades—and all theyrepresent—are concerned. At the same time, however, historians agree thatIslamic rulers were much more tolerant towards Jews than any Chris- tian empirein Europe ever was, before or since. Christians and Jews were considered “peopleof the Book,” i.e., they were mentioned in the Qu’ran as predecessors ofMohammed and were considered “protected” until they could come to their sensesand convert to Islam. After all, Islam itself was a religion of conversion,beginning with the Prophet himself and extending to the rest of the ArabianPeninsula before going on the warpath everywhere else. It was not an indigenousfaith, growing out of the paganism of Arabia, Mesopotamia and Egypt. It was asyncretist creation of the Prophet, who blended elements of Christianity,Judaism and native Arab practices and beliefs, taking what he liked and ignoringthe rest.The Ka’aba, for instance, is an example of this. This holy shrine in Mecca whichall Muslims are required (if possible) to visit at least once in their lives onthe special pilgrimage known as the Haj contains a lump of meteoric stone thatwas worshipped by the pagan Arab population for centuries before the birth ofMohammed. In fact, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca was a feature of Arab lifelong before the birth of the Prophet. When Mohammed captured Mecca and made itthe holy city of Islam that it is today, he removed the 360 pagan idols from thestone’s shrine and transformed it into the central icon of the faith. This acthas not been studied extensively in the West, and it is hoped that scholarshipone day will examine the importance of this artifact and what it reallyrepresented to the pagan Arabs and then to Mohammed, and what it means today tohis followers.The fighting between two factions of Islam began after the death of the Propheton June 8, 632. The Shi’ites, as mentioned, owed their allegiance to theProphet’s cousin, Ali. The vast majority of Mohammed’s followers, however,decided to follow his best friend and father-in-law, Abu Bakr. While bothfactions revere Mohammed and the Qu’ran and, to a large extent, the shari’a(Islamic law) equally, the differences between the two factions are such thatopen hostilities have never entirely disappeared in the nearly 1400 years sincethe Prophet’s death. This has been exacerbated by nationalist and tribalfighting among members of the same factions. The conflict was subdued somewhatduring the five hundred years of the Ottoman Empire when a large part of theMuslim world was under the political control of the Turks, but of course itdidn’t go away. With the end of Turkish hegemony in the region in1918, the Balkanization of the Middle East began, made more problematic by theBalfour Declaration, which eventually led to the creation of the State of Israelin the middle of the newly-liberated Arab territories.All of these difficulties have as their common origin the history of the ancientMiddle East. To understand the Arabs, one must understand Islam. To under- standIslam, one must understand the Arabs. Most people do not have sufficient time toundertake the kind of study necessary to bring the Middle East into a focussharper than that of the cameras of CNN or the dispatches from various desertbattlegrounds. They tend, instead, to interpret events through a Christian orJewish filter, and this plays into the hands of those who would foment discord,hatred and bloodshed. By setting up a Christian–Muslim polarity (or a Jew-ish–Muslim polarity) they can expect to temporarily unite Muslims of differingbackgrounds, culture and traditions against the common enemy. While Muslimleaders have been slow to exploit Western media in an attempt to clarify Islamand Arabism to the non-Muslims of the world, Western leaders have been equallyslow to understand and exploit the differences—national, historical, cultural,traditional, sectarian—between the Arab countries and their neighbors, such asIran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Most Americans, for instance, don’t know wherethe Kurds come into the equation. They don’t know who the Druze are, or whattheir relationship is to Islam. They don’t realize that Iranians (for instance)are not Arabs. They don’t understand what Muslims are doing in Bosnia. Theydon’t know the difference between a Shi’ite and a Sunni.When the Crusaders invaded Jerusalem in 1099, they wasted little time inexpanding their base further inland and along the Mediterranean coast. OnceJerusalem had become “secured” by Christian forces, a curious band of brothersset off from France to take up residence in Solomon’s stables, near the site ofSolomon’s Temple, urged by the famous Catholic cleric, St. Bernard of Clairvaux.These were the famous Knights Templar, the Knights of Solomon’s Temple,spiritual progenitors of the Freemasons and the OTO, and thereby hangs a tale.As noted above, the Shia split with the Sunnis over the question of legitimatesuccessors to the Prophet. The Shia believed legitimacy lay with Ali and hisblood descendants. Thereafter, the Shia split still again; in fact, many times.The Druze are a Shi’ite sect, for instance; in fact, they are very secretive,have an additional set of scriptures and are ostracized by other Muslims fortheir heretical views. The Ismaili sect of Shi’ism is our focus here, and theysplit off in their belief that Ismail, the eldest son of Jafar al-Sadiq (thesixth Imam) was the rightful heir of Ali and thus the seventh Imam, whereas therival Twelvers believed that Ismail’s younger brother was the seventh Imam.These Shi’ites—the Twelvers—are the dominant religion in Iran today, and are thelargest Shi’ite sect in the world. The Ismailis, on the other hand, de- velopedlargely in secret and created a coherent system of faith and thought that wasattractive to many social elements in the Middle East, especially theintellectuals on one hand and the disenfranchised on the other.Ismaili Shi’ism is a kind of Islamic Qabalism. The belief that the Qu’ran hasboth an exoteric (zahir) and an esoteric (batin) meaning is fundamental to thesect, and this idea of hidden or secret knowledge appealed to many who could notunderstand why the world was so full of sorrow and misfortune when the Prophethad shown the world the right way of living and worship; certainly, there wassome secret knowledge of the world, knowledge that was encrypted in the holiestof books, the Qu’ran, for those who were intelligent enough to see beyond theobvious meanings and could divine the hidden truths. (The parallels with theJewish Qabalistic tradition are obvious.) As scholars such as Barbara Thieringand Hugh Schonfield have demonstrated, the Jewish sect of the Essenes also usedcode in their writings to disguise important events and the identity ofimportant persons, thus similarly creating two levels of sacred literature: theexoteric and the esoteric. (In fact, it is entirely possible that Es- senicbeliefs contributed to the creation of the Ismaili doctrine, as the Essenes hadspread throughout the region now known as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistanhundreds of years before the birth of Mohammed.)This type of knowledge could empower the poor, whose only asset was their soul,their passion, and whose only weapon was their belief. It was a form ofneo-Platonism believed to have derived from Muslim contact with the Greeks andtheir philosophical systems, as well as by encounters with Gnosticism,Zoroastrianism, and various Christian sects. It was a syncretist system whichstill relied on the Qu’ran as the final arbiter of spiritual Truth, but whichused the various philosophies and sciences of the West as instruments to deepenunderstanding of the world.Also, secrecy begets paranoia; the need to seek for hidden answers and con-spiracies behind everyday events develops when a social group is suppressed,ostracized or in some other way shoved to the sidelines and no longer “in theloop” of the dominant party, religion, or culture. When one does not know whatthe other knows—or what the other is doing, or discussing—then speculation leadsto suspicion, which can color an entire belief system. This hard-wired paranoiaof the Ismailis—and especially of the Nizari sect which became known in the Westas the Assassins—contributed to the creation of an intelligence organizationunparalleled in the East, and which in turn led to the creation of what wereprobably the world’s first “terrorists.”4Central to the Ismaili belief system is the Imam. Ismaili theologians pro- poseda world of cycles, in which hidden or silent Imams alternated with vis- ibleImams. Regardless of whether the Imam was visible or not, he normally functionedthrough his representative, the Senior D’ai. The d’ai—which means “summoner”—wasvisible proof of the existence of the Imam. (It is interest- ing, and perhapscoincidental, to note the existence of a “summoner” in the annals of witchcraft;the “man in black” of the Salem trials was a summoner who called the faithful tothe sabbat, and the term “summoner” is still used by some modern adherents ofthe Wicca movement.) The Senior D’ai—the Hujja or “Proof ”—was also in directcontact with the Imam, even though others around him were not; thus we have anearly example of the Secret Chief concept that would be so important to theGolden Dawn, a manifestation of the “Great White Brotherhood” of theTheosophists: hidden Masters who guide the world’s spiritual development and whofunction through a handful of intermediaries. The Imam—like the Brotherhood—ishuman, but imbued with divine powers and abilities beyond the normal range ofpossibility.The Ismaili sect divided yet again, into those who followed the FatimidCaliphs—who were very powerful and influential in their day, and who cre- atedthe oldest continuously-running university in the world, the Al–Azhar Universityin Cairo—and those who were loyal to Nizar, the eldest son of the previousCaliph, who was ousted from his appointed role by a scheming military dictator.Nizar fled to Alexandria, but was eventually captured and killed. Many Ismailis(especially those in the East, in Persia, Syria and what is now Iraq) felt thatNizar was the rightful heir to the throne, and decided not to recognize theauthority of the new Caliph, a puppet of the dictator in Cairo. Thus were theNizaris, later known as the Assassins, born.At about this time, the Crusaders began their first invasion of the Middle East.Responding to a call from Alexius I, the head of the Byzantine Empire which wasruled from Constantinople, that the Seljuk Turks were threatening his Christiankingdom, in 1095 A.d., Pope Urban II called for a crusade to help Alexius defendChristianity in the East and to take the Holy City of Jerusalem. The Seljuks hadconsolidated their power in what is now Turkey, virtually up to the walls ofConstantinople. Armenian Christians, Greek Christians and Syrian Christians werein danger of having their cities and lands overrun by the new political,military and religious force that had its spiritual origins in the Saudi Arabiaof the Prophet Mohammed, but its ethnic origins in the Asian steppes. Even theother Muslim territories of the Middle East were unhappy with the way the Turkswere in ascendancy, and plotted how best to contain the Seljuk threat. As thebumbling Crusader armies finally secured the Byz- antine capitol after severalfalse starts, they went on a protracted campaign to capture the main citiesalong their route to Jerusalem, taking Edessa, Tarsus and finally Antioch beforemarching on Jerusalem in 1099. Hasan i-Sabah was an educated Iranian and TwelverShi’ite who eventually converted to the Ismaili form of Islam and spent sometime in the court of the Caliph in Cairo. Becoming embroiled in the internecinewarfare between the Fatimid and Nizari branches of the Ismailis, he cast his lotwith the Niz- ari and wound up back in what is now Iran, secretly searching fora base of operations from which to wage unceasing warfare against the SeljukTurks.5 He chose the impregnable mountain fortress of Alamut, located in the Er-buz mountain range that hugs the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. At the sametime, much of the territory of the Levant had come under control by the Seljuks.The Seljuks were new converts to Islam, and more Central Asian in nature thanArab. They were not part of the Arab feudal states with their complicatedgenealogies and tribal loyalties, and imposed a different sort of politicalreality on the Arab and Persian populations. Muslim or not, they were foreigninvaders and Sunnis as well. The Fatimid Caliphate was disintegrating; it nolonger held appeal for the masses who felt the moral bankruptcy of the regimeand were turning more and more to the antinomian and millenarian “new preaching”of Hasan i-Sabah. Islam was in crisis, and so was the entire politicalinfrastructure of the Middle East.To a devout Muslim, the separation of Church and State that is familiar to theWestern countries has no meaning. In Islamic countries, government and religionare one. This is one of the contributing factors to much political unrest in theMiddle East, as religious differences automatically threaten gov- ernmentleadership. Religion and political administration must run together as one; ifone deviates, then the spiritual structure of the country as well as itspolitical nature is disrupted.In a way, this is the other side of the coin from Communism, in which theabsence of religion is by government decree. While in Islamic countries, churchand state are one (as it were), in Communist countries the state is one; thereis no church—no scripture, no ecclesiastical hierarchy, no liturgicalrequirements, no alternate power base—to worry about. However, as events haveshown in the past fifty years of world history, that attitude was akin towhistling in the dark. Once religious bars in Communist countries were lifted,entire underground networks of religious and occult groups were revealed. Thiswould be unthinkable in an Islamic state … except for the existence of secretreligious/political organizations, groups holding heretical religious beliefsand hence subversive political agendas as well.Thus, in Sunni territories and in Twelver Shi’ite territories, to be a Nizariwas to court danger: imprisonment and execution. The Nizaris were not stupid,and they did not embrace suicide as a group, even though they encouragedsuicidal practices by their agents, as we shall see. Instead, they developed astrategy of “precautionary dissimulation of one’s true religious belief in theface of danger”6—in Arabic, taqiyya—of pretending to be whatever the rul- inggovernment of a given territory wanted them to be, while maintaining themselvessecretly steadfast in their Nizari faith. The Nizari thus became a kind of spyor “sleeper agent,” going about one’s business in the hostile envi- ronment andpretending to adhere to the hated precepts of the evil faith of one’s neighbors,all the while waiting for the order to rise up and strikeHasan i-Sabah began his career in Persia as a secret d’ai of the Nizaris, andthus as a sleeper agent himself. Eventually, he became a minister of this “newpreaching,” the hujja or proof of the invisible Imam, charged with revitalizingIslam both as a spiritual and as a political force in the world. The other Mus-lims—Sunnis, and those Shi’ites who were not part of his Nizari sect—wereheretics and enemies to be destroyed. He could not do this with a standing army;the vast cities of the Muslim world were stronger and richer than he and hisband of followers in the mountain castle of Alamut and the other isolatedfortresses they would come to conquer. But he had another weapon at hisdisposal, one that carried the Ismaili concepts of taqiyya (dissimulation) andbatin (esotericism) to their logical conclusion: political murder.Assassination.More than any other Muslim sect or organization, the Nizaris embraced theconcept of political murder as a strategy central to their survival and success.The records at Alamut show dozens of assassinations carried out by loyalfollowers of Hasan during his lifetime. He was able to control largegeographical areas and make his decisions felt everywhere in the Islamic worldwithout ever leaving his mountain fortress at Alamut. For thirty-five years,Hasan i-Sabah stayed at Alamut and only left his residence twice, and that wasto go onto the roof. 7Devout, abstemious, studious, and completely focused, hemaintained iron control of Alamut and of all the territories under his command.He had his own son put to death for drinking wine (alcohol is prohibited toMuslims). As an intellectual leader, he mastered “geometery, arithmetic,astronomy, magic, and other things.” 8He obviously felt the weight of hisresponsibility as living proof of the existence of the hidden Imam, and soughtto prove himself worthy of that mystical trust his entire life. And thatincluded ordering the assassinations of nearly fifty Muslim leaders.There is controversy over whether or not the Assassin cult had a degree systemof secret initiation. Iranian historian Farhad Daftary thinks not; he admitsthat there were different levels of understanding or learning within thesect, but these he believes were rather informal. 9Bernard Lewis takes adifferent view, and maintains that the Nizaris under Hasan were a rigoroussecret order with a degree system of initiation.10 He ranks these (from lowestto highest) as respondents, licentiates, teachers, preachers, and the Proof,Hujja, or Senior D’ai, i.e., Hasan himself. There may be more ranks withinthese, as evidence is scant and confusing. Some authors have insisted theAssassins had seven degrees, others nine. Daftary dismisses this as ill-formedpropagandizing by the enemies of the sect, whether Muslim or later, European,commentators. Clearly, not all the votes are in yet.Hasan’s assassins were carefully selected and, as the cult became more so-phisticated, so did the selection and education process of the assassins, whichmay have involved disguise and language instruction. Regardless of the degree ofpreparation, the most important aspect of the assassin’s readiness is that he bewilling to strike in a public place for maximum effect, and thereby lose hislife for the cause. Hasan’s enemies were often stabbed to death in mosques whilethey were at prayer. At other times, while walking in the streets or be- ingcarried on litters. It didn’t matter. And a few carefully selected victims,brought down in broad daylight by murderers who welcomed their own death as apassport to Paradise, caused many other leaders to offer tribute and toe theAssassin line without any further demonstration of ability.That a small, devout, Muslim band of true believers based in an impregnablemountain fortress could strike at kings and princes whenever they choose, goingto their own deaths in the process if need be without hesitation, all in thename of God and under control of a charismatic leader—who does not, himself,risk his own life—bears so many similarities to the events of the past fiftyyears in the Middle East that it beggars belief. Suicide bombers, terrorattacks, plane hijackings … we have seen all of this before.Hasan i-Sabah created his band of murderers nine hundred years ago, and in manyways they are still with us, and have been admired and emulated by successiveincarnations of Shi’ite zealots down to the present day. Bernard Lewis accusesHasan of having created terrorism as a political weapon.11 The main differencefrom today’s terrorist is that Hasan murdered leaders and used assassinationwith surgical precision, selectively and carefully, while his moderncounterparts attack non-combatants, civilians, women and children: the innocent,who die in mass bombings and strafings. They have found—as the Assassinseventually discovered to their chagrin when dealing with the Templars and theKnights Hospitaller—that if you killed the leader of a Western army orgovernment, another would come along to take his place. Assassination of Westernleaders does not solve the political problems created by democratic governments;there is always a vice-president, a deputy minister, another general, anotherbattalion, another air raid.Furthermore, while Hasan and his followers did not attack civilian popula- tions(it is, after all, against the Qu’ran to do so), their spiritual heirs do. Ithas become a war of children against children, women against women; thedisenfranchised of the East against the rich, self-satisfied, decadent West:ste- reotypes fighting stereotypes. What began as a political war in Hasan’stime has become a cultural war in ours. The West is evil to the Shi’itefundamentalists; America is the Great Satan. The Devil. The King of Devils. Notonly because it is Christian, not only because of its support for Israel,although these are substantial issues in their own right. No; it is becauseWestern culture—aided and abetted by Western technology—threatens Easternculture, threatens to overwhelm the Faith. The West has movie stars; the Easthas martyrs.Everyone on the planet knows who Madonna and Arnold Schwarzenegger and SylvesterStallone are. What American knows the names of the Palestinian martyrs of thehideous Israeli and Christian Phalange attack of September 15, 1982 on the Sabraand Chattila refugee camps in Lebanon, where even the sick were dragged fromtheir hospital beds and shot? Or the names of the teenaged suicidebombers—school children—who vainly, futilely try to avenge those deaths withdynamite and C-4 taped to their bodies? Yet, their photographs are plastered allover the walls in Beirut, Ramallah, Baghdad, and other Arab cities and towns andare traded like baseball cards among the young, the same young who danced in thestreets when the World Trade Center was bombed; the same young who smiled andlaughed in the coffee shops of Kuala Lumpur when the image of the God StruckTowers was flashed on the TV screen courtesy of CNN. “Finally,” one could almosthear them think, “we are in the movies, too.”When the Crusader armies marched into Jerusalem, the status was re- versed.Islamic civilization was far advanced at that time, and the Europeans were theunbathed barbarians, raping and pillaging their way into the Holy Sepulcher.Their information concerning Islam was scant, and they did not go to any lengthsto improve their knowledge. The Muslims were enemies of Christendom and that wasall they had to know. To study Islam too deeply might have been seen as anunhealthy interest in a demonic practice, and was thus avoided by virtuallyevery European who lived in the Middle East at that time.Rumors abounded in later years that the Assassins and the Knights Tem- plar hadjust such an unhealthy relationship. This was promulgated primarily by thefamous Orientalist Joseph von Hammer (The History of the Assassins, London,1835), who jumped to a lot of conclusions concerning both Assas- sin and Templaralike. He went so far as to assume that the Assassins were the inspiration forthe organization of the Templars, pointing to a similarity in dress andhierarchical structure, and went on from there to insist that the secrets of theTemplars were those learned at the feet of the Assassins. This theory has beenexploded many times over the past two hundred years, but it is still a centralidea in the present-day Ordo Templi Orientis, which views itself as a survivalof the original Knights Templar and which, in its initia- tion rituals,demonstrates an affection for the idea that the Ismailis and the Templars werewell acquainted and had exchanged occult knowledge and initiations. As mentionedpreviously, this is most openly seen in the title of the American OTO leader as“Caliph.” The German secret society which gave birth to the OTO did believe itwas the repository of occult knowledge from the Middle East, much of it sexualin nature, which formed the basic character of the Order. (This knowledge was,however, admittedly of recent acquisition and not the result of a thousand yearsof secret cultivation.) The confusion of Templar with Nizari, however, hearkensback to the errors of von Hammer and his readers, errors which themselves werebased on the charges brought against the Templars by the Church and by theFrench king who wished to see the Order destroyed, and could only do this byassociating the Templars with the grossest forms of heresy and Satanism.Most recently, Farhad Daftary has found evidence to support some of thespeculation concerning the relationship between the Templars and the As- sassins(specifically, the Syrian branch of the Nizari Assassins based in and aroundDamascus). There is ample documentation to show that the Assassins and theTemplars had financial and other relationships. Daftary characterizes these as“complex,” as well he might, as for the most part Templar records were destroyedin the fourteenth century at the time the Order was suppressed by King and Pope.While somewhat more is known about the Hospitallers and the Assassins (therelationship was political, to form an alliance against Saladin, the leader ofthe Sunni Muslims who threatened the Nizaris as well as the Crusaders), therelationship with the Templars is not so well understood or explicated. TheHospitallers, of course, were not suppressed and information about theiroperations is considerably better known. Both military orders were warned by theChurch on several occasions about their unhealthy relation- ship with theAssassins, and with Muslims in general. The Church did not condone the tidylittle arrangement in which the Nizaris paid a tribute to the Hospitallers forprotection against Saladin, and in which the Nizaris agreed to assist theHospitallers against their common enemy as well.Daftary complains about the general ignorance of Western commentators on Islamand on the Assassins in general; however, the close working relation- shipbetween the Crusaders and the Assassins is a matter of record in both Europeanand Islamic sources. Only the details are secret, and especially so in the caseof the Templars. The Templars and Hospitallers were held in captiv- ity by theMuslims for more than a year at one period, and it is said that they learnedArabic at that time (which, of course, makes sense). Templar Grand Masters areknown to have had Arabic-speaking secretaries and to employ Muslim informers inthe courts of the caliphs.I submit that the Templars were more open to cross-cultural exchange than weretheir colleagues in Outremer (the Crusader States), and their brilliance atintelligence-gathering, banking, architecture and other accomplishments demon-strates intellectual abilities which require a certain amount of honestobservation. The Templars and Nizaris were both secret, religious orders thatwere also mili- tary in nature, and they would have respected each other forthat, if for nothing else. In addition, the Templars would have wanted to knowas much as possible about the Assassins without necessarily understanding agreat deal about Islam in general, and it would have been to the benefit of theNizaris to ensure that their philosophy constituted the heart of the Templars’knowledge of Islam.We know that there was a cultural and philosophical exchange between theTemplars and other religious sects in Syria and the Middle East, sects ofvarious denominations encompassing the spectrum from Jewish heretical groups toGnostics, Christian heretics, and various Muslim splinter groups including whatappear to be Muslims with quasi-Christian sensibilities, such as the Mandaeanswho revered John the Baptist. Evidence of this is contained in one of the mostbizarre charges against the Templars, made in 1307, that they worshipped an idolthey called Baphomet. The significance of this will be discussed a little laterin this chapter, but it constitutes a compelling piece of evidence that theTemplars were involved in occult teaching and ritual that they learned duringtheir mission in the Middle East. This would have been especially possible aftera remarkable event known as the qiyama, what is perhaps the most scandalousevent in Nizari history, an event that was known to the Templars and otherCrusaders, as is evident from some of the histories that have come down to usfrom the twelfth century.It was during the month of Ramadan, the month of fasting in which all Muslimsare expected to refrain from eating and drinking of any kind from sunrise tosunset. It was on the seventeenth day of the month, the anniversary of themurder of Ali, a day that is marked by all Shi’ites, some of whom workthemselves up into a frenzy of self-flagellation. It was the year of the Hegira559; in the Julian Calendar, it was the 8th of August 1164.What follows is not the idle fantasy of Christian commentators. The details arein general agreement from Christian to Muslim, from Sunni to Shi’ite, and theyare as follows:On that day, the head of the Nizaris—Hasan II—the grandson of the founder of theAssassins, Hasan-i Sabah, performed a strange ritual at Alamut in the presenceof his followers, who had been summoned from the four corners of the Nizariempire. He erected a pulpit, facing west, with four banners at the corners. Thebanners were white, red, yellow and green. The people he had summoned arrangedthemselves around the pulpit on the right and left sides, and directly in front.They all had their backs to Mecca.At noon, Hasan II—dressed completely in white—approached the pulpit andannounced the millenium.Addressing all the inhabitants of the world of men, of angels, and of the jinn(the spirits, from which we get the word “genie”), he proclaimed that the hiddenImam had spoken to him and told him that the old Law—the Shariya—was abrogated,and that the time of the Resurrection was at hand. He then invited everyone to abanquet, there, at noon, in the midst of the fasting month of Ramadan and on theanniversary of the murder of Ali, to emphasize his proclamation that the time ofthe Shariya was ended. Messengers went out to all the Nizari strongholds,carrying the same message. A shock wave went through the community, and news ofit reached the ears of Muslim and Christian alike. Either Hasan was, as heproclaimed in his speech, in direct communication with the Hidden Imam who hadreleased the faithful from their spiritual obligations, or he was insane, or hewas deserving only of a blasphemer’s death. The Christians understood thecomplicated message to mean that Hasan had accepted Jesus Christ, since he hadannounced the Resurrection! The Resur- rection, in this sense, meant nothing ofthe sort. As Daftary explains,Only the Nizaris were now capable of comprehending spiritual reality, theimmutable truths hidden behind all the religious laws; and, as such, Paradisewas made real for them in this world.12Or, as the Persian chronicler Juvayni writes,…the Resurrection is when men shall come to God and the mysteries and truths ofall Creation be revealed, and acts of obedience abolished, for in this world allis action and there is no reckoning…13In other words, as the popular journalists have written, “Nothing is true;everything is permitted.”As Lewis and other historians have noted, this new dispensation was embraced bymost of Hasan’s followers without question, including in the Syrian strong-holds.14 Thus, the Assassins abandoned all pretence of following the Islamiclaw, discontinued praying five times a day facing Mecca, and began drinking andeating whatever suited them, whenever it suited them. Although there is nodocumentation for this, it can be safely assumed that the consumption of hashishwas then also—if not encouraged—easily tolerated. Perhaps this event in 1164gave the greatest impetus to the derogatory nickname of the Nizaris: thehashishim—the eaters of hashish—the Assassins.Hasan II did not live long to enjoy the new dispensation. On the 9th of January1166 he was stabbed to death by one of his brothers-in-law, who could not abidethe blasphemy of his leader.However, Hasan II was succeeded by his son, Muhammad, who continued the doctrineof the Resurrection and even expanded upon it, reiterating it as the new Nizaridoctrine. And so it was, until Muhammad’s son abolished it after the elder’sdeath (possibly by poisoning) in 1210 A.d. Thus, the era of the qiyama lastedless than fifty years; but the effect this philosophy had on the Nizaris and onthe people who feared them was profound.In 1152, the Syrian Nizaris had begun paying an annual tribute to the KnightsTemplar of 2000 gold pieces.15 This arrangement lasted throughout the qiyamaperiod, even when the Nizaris tried to have it removed by the Christian ruler,King Amalric I. The Templars had the Nizari envoy himself assassinated for evendaring to suggest that the tribute be lifted.Then, in 1187, the great Muslim ruler Saladin sacked Jerusalem and took theGrand Masters of both the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights Templar intocaptivity, where they languished for a year. This, however, did nothing to stopthe Nizaris from paying tribute to the Templars. Even when they had signed amutual assistance treaty with the Knights Hospitaller in 1228, they continued topay their annual fee to the Templars as well. The Nizaris had no reason tocooperate with Saladin, especially after the announcement of the qiyama sinceduring that time (1164-1210) the Nizaris were considered heretics andblasphemers, having more in common with the Christians than with their fellowMuslims. The Nizaris were even known to have assisted the knights in their owninternal struggles with the Christian rulers, a situation which gave rise tothunderous missives from Europe commanding the knightly Orders to desist havinganything to do with the Nizaris.16While the contribution of Muslim historians such as Daftary are valuable andimportant to an understanding of the Assassin phenomenon, their con- clusionssometimes suffer from the same narrow viewpoints as the western historians theycriticize. For instance, Daftary seems upset that Christian Europe would viewthe rise of Islam with alarm. As he writes:…Christian emperors were even more alarmed when the Muslims extended theirhegemony from North Africa to Spain in the eighth century, and later, in theninth century, to Sicily and other Mediterranean islands. Thus, the seeds ofprolonged antagonism between the Christian and Muslim worlds were planted, andIslam, the ‘Other’ world, began to be perceived as a problem by westernChristendom, a problem which in time acquired important religious andintellectual dimensions, in addition to its original political and militaryaspects.17These paragraphs would be humorous if the subject matter were not so important.Presumably, when a continent is invaded by foreign armies with a foreignfaith—what Daftary calls “extending their hegemony”—they may legitimately be“perceived as a problem”!This is evidence of the clash of world-views between Muslims and Chris- tians;and is one of the reasons why western historians and commentators have so littleaccurate information about the Assassins. Daftary admits in many places in hisbook that virtually all of the information about the Nizari Assassins availableto the outside world was promulgated by their enemies. The Muslims themselvesspread scathing, morbidly fantastic tales about the Assassins, and it is fromthe Muslims that they got their nickname, the hashishim. How, then, were theCrusaders or other European chroniclers to obtain more accurate information?Obviously, the only way that was possible would be from the Assassinsthemselves.THE MYSTERIES OF THE CATHEDRALSThat the Crusaders—and specifically the Templars—brought back importantknowledge from the East, however, is beyond doubt. The access of Europeanscholars to the works of the Greeks, the Arabs, the Persians and others caused asudden explosion of creativity in France, for instance. Ironically, the buildingof the great Gothic cathedrals owes much to the architectural knowledge of theMuslim Middle East, knowledge that was put to use to create some of the mostmagnificent European churches ever seen. Geometry, medicine, astronomy, andalchemy were only some of the prizes taken back to France by the Crusaders,including the mysterious Templars and their allies. (Indeed, algebra and alchemyare phonetic transliterations of Arabic words.) The knowledge of how thesedisparate disciplines hung together in a cosmic framework of esotericcorrespondences was the master key to the secret of the Saracens (as the Arabswere wrongly called), a secret that is revealed in the apse, nave and flyingbuttresses of the Gothic cathedrals, no less than in the strange statuary andother ornamentation that has baffled commentators for nearly a thousand years.Louis Charpentier was probably the first to call the intricate relationship ofthe Knights Templar and the gothic cathedrals to our attention. In his LesMysteres de la Cathédrale de Chartres (1995), he put forward a startling theorythat Chartres—like the other gothic cathedrals of France—was the repository ofarcane knowledge from the East, and the evidence in stone of an explosive secretthat would rock Christianity if it were known. At once a machine for expandingconsciousness and a testament to “hidden history,” Chartres Ca- thedral lies ata nexus of science, religion and mysticism. The dimensions of Chartres are shownto be equivalent to those of astronomy and music; the carved statues on theouter walls to tell a story of how a secret treasure was brought from the Templeof Solomon by the Knights, and how this treasure enriched both the Order and theChurch. This story has gone on to create an entire industry based around earlyChurch history, Jewish messianic lore, and sacred geometry, as represented insuch blockbusters as Holy Blood, Holy Grail, The Messianic Legacy, and dozens ofother studies in various languages, as well as television documentaries.Chartres Cathedral itself became a magnet for New Age seekers, and it now hasits own website.Basically, the idea is this:The Order of the Knights Templar was founded in 1118 and formally chartered in1128 by St. Bernard of Clairvaux. Nine impoverished French knights make theirway to Jerusalem in order to provide protection for Christian pilgrims goingoverland through Turkey to visit the Holy Land. Obviously, there was very littlenine knights were going to accomplish if their mission was to police a thousandmiles of road through hostile territory. Instead, they were based at the Al-AqsaMosque (from where Muslims believe the Prophet once ascended to heaven), whichis built over part of Solomon’s Temple.Solomon’s Temple was the center of Jewish worship since ancient times. It hadbeen built according to legend by King Solomon himself, with the help of demonicbeings he summoned by magic. It was destroyed by invaders, built again, and thendestroyed again. By the time the Knights Templar had arrived on site, it was aruin in sorry shape. According to the story now prevalent in New Age circles,the Knights spent their time in Jerusalem digging and looking for something inthe vicinity of the Temple. It seems they found what they were looking for, andbrought it back in a hurry to France.The controversy is over whether this “treasure of the Templars” was a physi- calobject or some kind of secret knowledge. Those of the Charpentier school feel itwas both. Charpentier suggests that the Templars brought back with them the Arkof the Covenant, lost centuries before at the last destruction of the Temple.The Ark, of course, would be the single most important artifact of Judaism,because it would contain the original stone tablets on which the TenCommandments were inscribed by the hand of God. It would also contain themystical Rod of Aaron, a magic wand with divine powers. The Ark, according tothe scant information given in the Bible concerning its use, was so powerfulthat if touched by the unworthy it would bring instant death. The Jewish tribesused it as a kind of weapon in battle, parading it around before their enemieswho then fell before them in disarray. The Lucas–Spielberg film, Raiders of theLost Ark, contains a fairly accurate rendition of some of the legends associatedwith the instrument, as well as Nazi interest in locating it.To Charpentier, the Ark was something more than a weapon. A device forcalculation, a kind of geomancer’s compass, is one possibility; one that wouldhave enabled the Templars to build the domes and buttresses of the cathedrals.It was also secret knowledge. As Charpentier tells us, there is no crucifix inChartres Cathedral. He says that strange omission indicates that the Templarsdid not believe that Christ was crucified, i.e., believed that he lived, hadchildren, and that his descendants also had survived, a theme developed at greatlength in Holy Blood, Holy Grail by the team of Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln. IfChrist was not crucified (or, at least, did not die on the cross, as has beensuggested by historians over the past two hundred years) it would explain themost potent charge against the Templars, that in their initiation ceremoniesthey were expected to trample upon a cross. This might have been a bowdlerizedaccount of what was actually taking place, i.e., a renunciation of the basic,the most central, idea of Christianity: that Jesus was executed, buried, androse from the dead.If the Templars believed that Christ did not rise from the dead, then theyshared this belief with their Muslim counterparts, and it is no wonder that theywere violently suppressed by the Church. Indeed, recent research tends tosupport the idea that the Templars had Muslim aides, and that many spoke Arabicand took a keen interest in Islam as well as in the many heretical Christiansects abroad in the Middle East at the time, sects that owed much to Gnosticismand Zoroastrianism. As has been demonstrated by Lewis, Daftary and otherhistorians of the period, the Templars had a close working relationship with theSyrian Nizaris, a relationship that spanned the period of the infamous qiyamainstigated by Hasan II and continued by his son, Muhammad II. This would haveexposed them to the apocalyptic and mil- lennial cosmologies of the Ismailis, aswell as to other “alternative” religious and historical beliefs.They may have heard the legends current at the time indicating that some-one—either an apostle, or possibly even Jesus himself—had traveled to Kash- mir,a refugee from religious and political persecution, and died in Srinagar. Theymight have heard of the existence of alternative forms of the Gospel of Mark, an“unedited” version of the Gospel found in Egypt which refers to an occultinitiation conducted by Jesus. They might have heard of the Gospel of St.Thomas, a mystical work considered an integral part of the Scriptures in what isnow Ethiopia, where the Ark is said to have been taken after the fall of theSecond Temple. They might have heard that the bloodline of Jesus survived andthat there was—somewhere in the world—a current and living King of the Jews.This exposure to eastern mysticism and alternate history could explain theprecise charges leveled against the Templars by King and Pope, charges that werenot laid against their hated rivals, the Knights Hospitaller.And if these stories are correct, then the House of David may have survived thelast two thousand years of world history and—according to recent Biblicalscholarship supported by discoveries in the Dead Sea Scrolls, among othertexts—one of its current incarnations would be the King of the Jews, thuscasting in doubt the legitimacy of the Catholic Church and, indeed, of all ofChristianity. Over one billion believers would find themselves without a belief.Charpentier—and others who have followed his thinking—feel that this may be theGreat Secret of the Freemasons, Templars, and other secret societies of Europe,knowledge handed down quietly because of the danger to the bloodline shouldChurch or State discover it. This, then, is the true meaning of the Holy Grail,for San Greal could be a pun on Sang Real, Holy Blood. The bloodline of Jesus.What has all of this has to do with anything? If there is any truth at all tothe above conjectures, then the careful edifice of the last two thousand yearsof Western civilization crumbles like a house of cards. The Muslims and the Jewswould have no problem with the discovery that Jesus was never crucified, neverrose from the dead, and had—instead—lived a long life and produced offspring whomade their way to Europe or to India where they live to this day. They wouldonly shake their heads and say, “I told you so.” The Buddhists, Shintoists,animists, pagans and others in the Far East, Africa, and distant parts of theworld would give the news only a passing glance. But it would shake thegovernments and institutions of the West like nothing before.Christianity, per se, would cease to exist, and with it the cherished beliefsand ideals of almost a quarter of humanity. Political and religious leaderswould struggle to fill the void with some kind of generalized humanism, areligion centered around an ambiguous God of no discernible personality orcolor, with a scripture cobbled together with the better parts of Thoreau,Thomas Paine, and perhaps Walt Whitman. Morality itself would be called intoquestion, and one could imagine millions of people—robbed of even the shimmer ofGod’s love and the shadow of God’s wrath—going on a warpath of murder, rape androbbery. Crosses would be pulled down from steeples like busts of Lenin in RedSquare.Thus, if this were indeed the truth, the need to cover it up would be absolute.Cynical pragmatists in the Vatican as well as in the world’s governments woulddo what they could to keep a lid on the secret, and perhaps do so in the beliefthat they were saving civilization. At the same time, it would be necessary toreveal a little of the truth, bit by bit, in selective doses to selectindividuals, knowing that eventually the truth would become known to everyone;by reveal- ing the truth in degrees, one controls the fallout: a much saferapproach than simply dumping the news on the front page of the New York Times.Thus, we have the raison d’etre of the modern secret society.THE NAME OF THE ROSEThe Freemasons believed themselves to be the inheritors of the architecturalsecrets of the Great Pyramid and the Temple of Solomon, as well as of the othersecrets of the Knights Templar. In fact, in America their boys’ auxiliary isnamed after the last Grand Master of the Templars, Jacques de Molay, who wasarrested—along with the rest of his French knights—on Friday, the 13th ofOctober, in the year 1307. De Molay was later executed, burned at the stake onMarch 18, 1314, professing his innocence to the last, after years of hideoustorture at the hands of his coreligionists. His Order was scattered to the winds(those that survived) and wound up in Portugal as well as in Scotland. It issaid that the sails of Christopher Columbus’ caravelles bore the scarlet crossof the Templars, and that Templar knights rode to the assistance of the Scots atBannockburn.Romance aside, it is the strange combination of architecture, ritual and secretknowledge that concerns us here, for it is a combination that can be found inancient Egypt among the pyramids as well as in Chartres Cathedral among thepews. It is an essential element of the Freemason mystique, and has become thefocus of intense scrutiny by some modern intelligence agencies. It survives inthe design of the temple of the Golden Dawn as well as in the various initiatoryrites of Freemasonry, and the idea that the East has a secret technology of themind, of occult power—an idea that has its origins with the controversy andscandals surrounding the Templars—bore fruit in the creation of the RosicrucianSociety in the early seventeenth century, a Society that had tremendousinfluence on the arts and sciences of the next two hundred years, and which wasbrought to America in several forms by English and German immigrants.By delving back into time, into the deserts of Arabia and the Levant, the ruinedtemples of Jerusalem, the stone cathedrals of medieval France, the jar-buriedscrolls of Qumran, the alchemical laboratories of Prague, and back even furtherto the mysteries of ancient Egypt and Sumer, we confront the origin of some ofthe issues that trouble us today. For the recurring idea of the existence of ascience that bridges the gap between mind and body, and perhaps between body,mind and some other human faculty—the soul, the spirit, the petit bon ange orthe gros bon ange, the ka or the ba, the shen or the qing—persists throughouthistory in both the West and the East. Further- more, if it does exist, theorganizations with the funding, the power, and the necessity of harnassing itstechnology today would be the intelligence agen- cies which are, after all, thespiritual descendants of the Nizari Assassins, the Templars, the Rosicrucians,the Illuminati, the Masons, even the votaries of Haitian voudon: secretorganizations with secret membership, whose ideals may have been forged inreligion, mysticism or simply pure idealism, but who owe their allegiance topolitical forces and will use covert methods to accomplish their goals.Whether or not there was any basis in truth for the allegations that theAssassins used hashish as a mind-control substance, the important thing to re-member is that the world—including many Muslims—believed it to be so, andbelieved that therein lies a key for unlocking the mindless killer in us all.Premier among the secret societies believed—in the West—to be at once occult andpolitical was (and in some cases remains) the Freemasons. (The East has itsparallel in the Chinese secret societies that sprang up in response to theexcesses of the Qing Dynasty, with much similarity to the Freemasons, exceptthat the Chinese societies degenerated into criminal gangs, while this chargehas never been laid against the Masons.) The Freemasons have been accused ofevery kind of blasphemy, treachery, and subversion by their crit- ics; admirersand critics alike point to the organization’s supposed origins in the shadow ofSolomon’s Temple, and some go even further and associate its teachings with thenameless cult that designed the Egyptian pyramids. Modern journalists—notably inthe books of Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince—have gone so far as to demonstrate ahistorical continuum between the Egyptian pyramid builders, the Temple ofSolomon, the heretical Christian cults of the first few centuries A.d., theKnights Templar and the Freemasons.18It was the Masonic Society that gave birth to Professor Weishaupt’s Il- luminatiin Bavaria on May 1, 1776: a group that was decidedly political as well asphilosophical and which was eventually surpressed by the Bavarian authorities,as the Templars had been four hundred years earlier. It was a mani- festation ofa general air of revolutionary activity, established as it was on the eve ofAmerica’s own Declaration of Independence from England. England at that time wasa kingdom being run by George III, a man more at home with the German languagethan English. One of the leaders of the American revolutionary movement wasBenjamin Franklin, a Mason and an intimate of French revolutionary and occultcircles in Paris. Later in the century, of course, France would experience itsown revolution after lending its support to the American template. A storycurrent at the time has an unknown revolutionary running through the palace atVersailles shouting, “Jacques De Molay, thou art avenged!” The horror-strickenEuropean nobles accused the revolutionary movement of France of having beenmasterminded by secret societies, and of course the Masons (and the Illuminati)were the first accused.In the nineteenth century, America went through a paroxysm of anti-Ma- sonry,and an Anti-Masonic Party was formed, out of which the Whigs and later theRepublican Party would be created from its disparate limbs. One merely has toreplace the word “Masonry” with the word “Communism” to appreciate the gist ofthe speeches and broadsides against this secret society with its “godless”agenda. America was going through a period of intense soul-searching in theearly days of the nineteenth century, after the second defeat of the Englishduring the War of 1812. Religious fanaticism and fun- damentalism was on therise, and the Masonic Society was identified as one of the sinister forcesattempting to move America into worship of alien gods, while at the same timetaking its orders from mysterious European masters. It was also a time ofanti-Catholic feeling, for the Catholics were perceived as owing allegiance tothe Pope before Country and God. Their religion was seen as idolatrous andsuperstitious, a kind of “outer court” of the Masons, who were seen as a bitmore sophisticated but no less idolatrous. This was ironic, of course, in thatCatholics were forbidden to join the Masonic Society; the Church saw Freemasonryas the survival of Templarism, which they had fought into the ground hundreds ofyears earlier. Secret societies with secret rituals were anathema to organizedreligion, which sought to remain the sole channel to Godhead.Joseph Smith, an occultist at heart, embraced Freemasonry in the years beforehis murder, and Masonic ideas and ritual were incorporated into the Mormonliturgy, as was detailed in Book One. When Hitler came to power in the twentiethcentury, he banned all occult organizations and reserved his special ire for theMasons. Architect of the Final Solution Adolf Eichmann cut his eye teeth in theSS while working on the Masonic files, before he was finally diverted to anothergroup that was considered as great a threat to the race as the Masons: the Jews.In the Freemasonry Section, he compiled lists of Masonic temples, libraries andother holdings as well as membership lists, and maintained a museum exhibit onFreemasonry that was visited regu- larly by Heinrich Himmler. Masonic propertywas seized everywhere in the Reich, and the artifacts sent directly to the SSfor examination and storage, or eventual destruction.Thus, Freemasonry has not had an easy time. Like any secret society, it is thetarget of those who believe that any group of persons meeting in secret must beup to no good; yet, today there is a Masonic temple in virtually every Americantown of any size, and the Masonic Society headquarters in Washington, D.C. is onPennsylvania Avenue, but a stone’s throw from the White House. George Washingtonwas inaugurated as America’s first presi- dent wearing Masonic regalia, and manyfuture presidents would be Masons as well as an overwhelming number of senatorsand congressmen. Yet, few American non-Masons have a clear idea about theorigins of the Society, or even its purpose (other than charity).According to most established histories, the Masonic Society’s official birthwas in the year 1717,when the first Grand Lodge was announced, and allegationsthat the Order has a more ancient lineage was generally derided by academicsuntil recently. As more documentation has become available, it seems clear thatthe Freemasons had existed for at least one hundred years prior to the formationof the Grand Lodge, and perhaps as much as two hundred years. This soundsdubious at first, since there are no published works on the Freemasons beforethe eighteenth century; or so it would seem.Scotland boasts some of the earliest Freemasonic lore, and Masonic temples andlodges have been identified in Scotland as early as the sixteenth century.Further, when the Grand Lodge announced itself in London in 1717, the Freemasonsof York protested and formed a rival lodge, saying that their or- ganization wasmuch older and had nothing to do with the lodges in London. Thus, there seems tohave been a Masonic tradition in Scotland and northern England long before theheavily-publicized formation of the Grand Lodge. If this is so—and currentacademic research supports it—then where did the Masons come from?The official Masonic line is that their brotherhood began in the shadow of theTemple of Solomon. The original Masons had been architects and build- ers in theemploy of King Solomon, and the Master Mason—one Hiram Abiff—was later murderedby three assassins in an attempt to discover the “Master Word.” This Word wasassumed to be the password used by higher ranking Masons to enable them toreceive a higher pay scale, one’s position in the hierarchy of builders beingdetermined by which password one held. If one could know the password of aMaster Mason then one would be com- pensated at a higher rate. Such is thestory. Unfortunately, Abiff refused to part with the information and was killed,his body buried in a shallow grave. Later, his body was dug up and searched tosee if he had written the Word anywhere, but the Word was lost.This odd story is the central myth of the Masons. While there are stories aboutthe Egyptian pyramids, the orthodox origins of the Freemasons are said to belongto the days of Solomon’s Temple. That would mean, of course, that the Masons aremore than three thousand years old. While that chro- nology satisfies some,there are others who question the story with an eye to discovering its realsecret.This secret may have been discovered in the recent past by an amateur his-torian from Kentucky. Due to a fortuitous set of circumstances having nothing todo with the Freemasons, John J. Robinson stumbled upon compelling proof that theFreemasons had their origins with the Knights Templar, and that the TemplarOrder had survived in England and Scotland after the official destruc- tion ofthe Knights by order of the Pope. The evidence begins with the famous PeasantRevolt of 1381, in which there was a general uprising in England against theChurch and the King, which resulted in the destruction of property all over thekingdom and the murder of many high-ranking clerics and nobles.Robinson demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt that the attack was directedspecifically against the Knights Hospitaller, the Templars’ hated rival sincethe days of their mutual origin in the desert sands of Palestine, and inheritorsof the Templars’ assets when the Templars were suppressed by Papal decree.Robinson’s book—Born in Blood—is a worthwhile addition to Masonic studies, eventhough it contains no footnotes or other academic impedimenta that would haveelevated it to more lofty status among schol- ars; its connecting the PeasantRevolt with a “Grand Society” operating in secret in the British Isles, asociety convincingly identified with the Knights Templar, is alone worth theprice of admission. Robinson also shows that Templar shrines were spared theattacks, which left thousands dead and many beheaded as the revolt wound its waydirectly to the Tower of London. The leader of the revolt was known only by thename Walter the Tyler, which is suggestive, since the “tyler” is a Masonicoffice in the rituals of the temple. All this indicates that the Masonic societyhas its origins in the Knights Templar, as many historians have always insisted(albeit without the benefit of documentation).The investigative team of Baigent and Leigh—in The Temple and The Lodge—havegone further, showing how the Templars escaped Europe at the time of theirsuppression and wound up in Scotland, among other places. They discuss thedisposition of the Templar fleet, a substantial armada of ships thatmysteriously disappeared at the time of the Order’s destruction, and suggestthat the fleet enabled escaping Templars to make it as far as the coast ofScotland and even, in at least one case, as far as Greenland and possibly toMexico.In fact, one of the more startling discoveries in The Temple and The Lodge isthe report of a Templar grave, in what is now Israel, adorned with the by-nowfamous compass and square insignia of the Freemasons. This gravedates to the thirteenth century, which again indicates that there existed anidentity between the Templars and the Masons. While this had always been afantasy or a supposition by conspiracy theorists of the Right and the Left, thecombined weight of the various clues as given by Robinson, Baigent and Leigh,and other recent research (such as that by David Stevenson in his The Origins ofFreemasonry), now clearly points to Templar survival in the form of theFreemasons.The only missing link in the story now is whether (and how) the Tem- plars andthe Assassins shared information, including not only military and politicalintelligence but also information of a more esoteric nature. This has also beena belief of conspiracy theorists, who jumped to the conclusion that since theTemplars and the Assassins shared some of the same real estate and had some ofthe same enemies, that they must have—of necessity—become friendly. Indeed, thiswas one of the accusations against the Templars by the Church when they finallyclamped down on them in the fourteenth century. They were said to worship anidol called “Baphomet” (a suggestively Arabic sounding name) rather than Jesus,and to have engaged in other unlawful practices of a distinctly Islamic nature.It is said that the Templars’ aversion to putting a crucifix—a representa- tionof the body of Christ impaled on the cross—in their Gothic cathedrals was anindication that they shared a horror of idolatry which they inherited fromeither the Jews, the Muslims, or both. (Iconography is forbidden in bothreligions, although abstract design is usually permitted; Catholicism, however,embraces statues and paintings of Christ and the Saints, and the OrthodoxChristians permit paintings—the famous ikons—but not statues.) The insistence onrepresenting divinity in the form of sacred geometry and number only is a mainfeature of Islam, and this may have been one of the major influences on Templarthinking in the design of the Gothic cathedrals as well as in the ritualized andsacralized geometry of Freemasonry.The reference to Baphomet is actually quite important, and bears some digressionhere. For centuries, no one knew what that name meant, and many wondered if itwas a corruption of “Mahomet,” a common medieval spelling of Mohammed, theProphet and founder of Islam. Aleister Crowley, on as- suming the leadership ofthe English OTO used Baphomet as his Order name, since the Templars were said toworship Baphomet, and Crowley was never averse to a stiff drink, a good cigar, awarm woman, or a devoted follower. It was up to Dead Sea Scrolls scholar Dr.Hugo Schonfield to solve the mystery, however. Using a well-known and often-usedQabalistic cypher known as Atbash—in which the first letter of the Hebrewalphabet is equivalent to the last letter, and so on—he applied the technique tothe name Baphomet and came up with Sophia, the goddess of Wisdom. Thus, theTemplars may well have been worshipping Wisdom in their secret councils; evenmore, Wisdom in a cryptic, Qabalistic dress. Even more again, Wisdom as Sophia,the con- sort of Simon Magus, one of the legendary fathers of the esoteric cultknown to posterity as Gnosticism. Baphomet comes to us down the centuries, then,from the Templar Inquisition records as a signal to the Bretheren: a secret wordwith its solution buried in its seemingly random combination of letters. A “lostWord.” A “Mason word.” In fact, a word that was hidden using an ancient Jewishcypher, the same cypher that was in use by the Essenes.That is still not proof of a link between the Templars and the Assas- sins,however. If anything, it demonstrates that the Templars were in communicationwith Jewish and Gnostic groups in the Middle East. But the belief that there wasan exchange of secrets between the two groups is persistent, in spite of scantevidence one way or the other. What did they have in common?In the first place, what many do not realize is that the Knights Templar werefirst and foremost monks. They were a monastic order, with a monas- tic rule.They took vows of poverty, chastity and obedience like any other Catholic monks.They owed their allegiance to the Pope, and to no other man: neither king norcleric. They were forbidden to bathe. They were forced to wear sheepskin andleather, even in the pounding heat of the desert lands they went to conquer.They were not allowed any privacy at all. They were forbidden even the mostcasual contact with women.They were forbidden alcohol, and were allowed twomeals a day. They were also expected to fight to the death, regardless of thecircumstances, if their superior so ordered it. They were not allowed to retreatin battle unless the odds were greater than three to one, and then only if theirsuperior allowed them to retreat. The regulations against wine and women wouldhave made the Muslims feel at home. Their willingness to die for their religionwould have made the Nizaris feel at home.They were initiated in secret. Even the monastic rule of the Order was notrevealed in its entirety until a Knight had achieved the highest rank. Thissecrecy was an unusual factor in the composition of the Order, not somethingnormally practiced by other monastic orders. And Templars could not divulgeanything of these initiation rites, or of the monastic rule, under penalty ofdeath.Obviously, the Templars and the Assassins shared much of the same mind- set. Thepassion for secrecy, and the willingness to die if ordered to do so, were twovery important things the two groups had in common. In addition, they were bothreligious orders, devoted to God, and they were both military organizationsdevoted to conquest. The main difference between them—aside from religion—wasthe fact that the Assassins operated in secret, in disguise, with lethalprecision, whereas the Knights Templar were everywhere obvious by their mode ofdress, and they struck as soldiers, in the open field, en masse. While theAssassins would take a castle by murdering its ruler, the Templars took a castleby overwhelming its forces in the heat of bloody conflict. But that would allchange on October 13, 1307, when the Templars were arrested throughout Franceand the order went out to crush them in every part of the Catholic empire. Atthat point, the Templars went underground like their Nizari counterparts, andthey suddenly had much more in common than ever before, for they suddenly had acommon enemy in the Catholic Church and the Catholic kings of Europe.The story of why the Order was suppressed, its leaders arrested, tortured andexecuted and its holdings seized and, in many cases, handed over to the hatedKnights Hospitaller is a matter of historical record, and we will not dwell onit too deeply here. Basically, the Crusades had been lost. There were only a fewEuropeans left in the Middle East, tenaciously holding on to scraps of landalong the coast of what is now Lebanon and Israel. The various prin- cipalitiesof Italy were at each other’s throats, with the Venetians at war with theGenoese and everybody at war with France. Jacques de Molay, the Grand Master ofthe Order, was called to France for what he thought was going to be new marchingorders and a budget for a new Crusade to take back the Holy Land. Instead, hewas arrested, along with all of his lieutenants throughout France, on thatfateful Friday the Thirteenth and charged with heresy. The instigator of this“night of the long knives” was the new King Philippe le Bel of France, in tandemwith Pope Clement V. The reason was a desire to take over the vast holdings ofthe Templars throughout Europe, and wherever else they could be found, and toeliminate the Templars as a political threat.At this point in European history, the Templars were not only the richestreligious order but the richest organization of any kind. Philippe le Bel owedthe Templars money, as did most of the crowned heads of Europe. Many havecredited the Templars with the creation of the modern banking system. Al- thoughelements of this had already been in place in various parts of the world, theTemplars turned banking into an art form. With their monastic vows of povertyand obedience, they were a logical choice to be entrusted with money; with theirinternational network of Temples and multilingual scribes throughout Europe andthe Middle East, they were an obvious channel for transmission of funds throughthe various ports to enable and facilitate trade between nations. In short, theTemplars became rich. And wealth means power.But the King could not simply round them all up and have them killed. He neededa legitimate reason, and this he found through informants and spies: theTemplars were heretics. They practiced strange rites in secret. Theytrampled on the cross. They worshipped an idol they called “Baphomet.” Theyengaged in homosexual intercourse. They hired Muslim aides, and had learnedArabic and the ways of the mysterious East. They did not believe in theCrucifixion of Jesus or His Resurrection. They owed their loyalty to foreignmasters and alien gods.There may have been some elements of truth in the accusations, but the Templarshad always prided themselves on being answerable to no one but the Pope himself.This loyalty to the Church, and their willingness to undergo tremendousprivations in both war and peace, was ignored during the auto da-fe that tookplace in that time. Many Templars—far from France—managed to escape and to takesome of their wealth and records with them. Iberia was still a mixed bag ofChristian and Muslim states, and it is known that some Templars found asylumthere. Others made for England and Scotland.But the damage had been done: the very Church to which the Templars had giventheir lives and devoted their souls had turned on them, and turned on them witha vengeance. Their Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, was finally burned at thestake. This was an intolerable state of affairs, and if the Tem- plars hadindeed learned heretical secrets in the East then this contre-temps seemed toprove them right. The men on the thrones of Catholic Europe and on the throne ofSt. Peter were evil men, unworthy of the faith of the Templars and of the trustof the people. God had forsaken his Church and abrogated the divine right ofkings. The Templars were no longer bound by their previous oaths, but they werestill trained as military monks, still had their weapons in some cases, stillhad their secret networks throughout the civilized world, and were still incontact with the Church’s enemies, should they be needed.As they burrowed deep within the towns and villages and cities of Chris- tendom,they established safe houses where they could meet and exchange information.These were known as lodges, and eventually developed into the Masonic Lodge weknow today. Sixty years after the execution of Grand Master De Molay, theselodges formed the backbone of the Peasant Revolt which attacked Hospitallerknights and temples with rapacity throughout England. They fought alongside theScots against the English and, it is said, metamorphosed into the clandestineorganizations that fomented rebellion against the evil kings of France andEngland in the French and American revolutions, and against the royal houses ofPrussia and Bavaria. Eventually, even the Russian Revolution was blamed on theFreemasons, the Illuminati and their illustrious forebear, the Order of theKnights Templar. It got to the point where even Winston Churchill noted thepower and influence of these covert organizations over European history.Given the weight of the supporting academic scholarship, there can be littledoubt today that the Freemasons owe their existence to the clandestine networkof Knights Templar that was established in the beginning of the fourteenthcentury. Thus, the organization—in general terms, without refer- ence to aspecific lodge—is over six hundred years old; more, if we consider its birth todate from the first expedition by Hugh de Payens, the first Templar GrandMaster, to Jerusalem in 1118. In that case, the Freemasons are a nearlynine-hundred-year-old organization, and their origin in blood and religion, inthe Journey to the East of the Crusades, makes them a template for future cultsawash in secret rituals, privileged information of an occult nature, andpolitical aspirations.The beliefs allegedly adopted by the Templars, however, including the worship ofBaphomet/Sophia and the rejection of the crucifixion, owe their origins to aneven earlier date, and for that we have to go back two thousand years to thefirst Christian century and the Gnostic and Essene forces that surrounded theearliest days of the Church.THE GNOSTIC GOSPELSIn 1945, a series of discoveries was made of a cache of Gnostic texts in avillage in Egypt. This find, known collectively as the Nag Hammadi Library, wasburied for safekeeping in the third century .d. The Gnostics werewell-established in Alexandria by this time, where the Ptolomies had firstsaturated this area of the Middle East with Greek philosophy and culture. It wasthis mixture of Platonic, Pythagorean, and pagan philosophy, science, art andreligion that had such a profound influence on both the Jews and the local paganpopulation, and which, in a way, allowed the spread of a new Jewish cult outsideof Israel and into the world—the Gentile, paganworld—at large.For if it should survive at all, the new cult of Christianity, based on theteachings of the mysterious leader known as Jesus, would have to survive outsideJudaism. The political environment of Israel at the time of Christ has beendescribed at length by Robert Eisenman and Barbara Thiering, among others, so Iwill not go into detail here. It is enough to say that tremendous infighting inthe Jewish population had made it possible for Greeks and Romans to keep Israelenslaved for centuries, and the most critical element of this internecineconflict was the struggle over foreign cultural influences.In the second century b.c., educated and sophisticated Jews wanted their sons tostudy abroad, to learn Greek, and to dress in the Greek manner. The SeleucidEmpire—the Syrian parallel to the Ptolomaic kingdom of Egypt, i.e., successor tothe conquests of Alexander the Great—was in control in much of the Levant,including Palestine. In some cases, Seleucid rulers actively opposed Jewishreligion and customs. This was known as the “Time of Wrath,”and it was during this time that the Chasidim or “the Pious” were born, and whenthe mysterious “True Teacher” or “Teacher of Righteousness” made his appearance,an event that was heralded by the Jewish cult of the Essenes.The Essenes were a purist sect of Jews who were renowned as healers, and whomany thought had the gift—or the science—of prediction, a capability believed tohave derived from their exceptionally holy lives and the devout attention theypaid to the study of the sacred books. The Essenes were millennialist in asense: they expected the arrival of the Messiah at any time, particularly in theTime of Wrath, which was believed to be the End of Days.Their scriptural writings speak of a lineage of priestly kings going back to thetime of King Solomon and his confidant Asaph. Asaph was a master of the occultarts and possessor of the “Ineffable Word of God,” which enabled him to performmiracles.This Word—like the lost Word of Hiram Abiff, also of Solomon’s Temple—is arecurring theme in Masonic ritual and literature as well as in ancient Jewishlore, and has a special place in the Qabala, which concentrates on words andletters and the power certain combinations and pronunciations can give to theinitiated practitioner. This idea of the power of language is reflected in theGospel according to John, the most mystical of the four Evangelists, whichbegins, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Wordwas God.” In the Gnostic writings found at Nag Hammadi and in other places, agreat emphasis is placed on words of no identifiable meaning, whatarchaeologists call “abracadabra,” or meaningless sounds.Obviously, since it seemed that no words from the everyday vocabulary of alanguage possessed any special power (else we would have all witnessed it manytimes in our lives), the magic words must be those that have no usage in commonspeech, words that are otherwise unrecognizable. Gibberish. And since thesemagic words could be phoneticized and written down anyway—and possibly seen bythe unworthy—the secret of their power must lie in their method ofpronunciation, a method that would be passed down to the initiate during thecourse of special ritual. In the later occult lodges of the nineteenth andtwentieth centuries, this method was known as “vibration” rather thanpronunciation, for it was acknowledged that speech (and, indeed, all sound) isvibration or sound waves. Therefore, magical pronunciation must consist of aspecial way of creating those very sound waves, a method of speaking or chantingor singing that would convey the power of the word in its very sound, itsparticular vocalization.The constant repetition of select words or phrases over and over again—like themantra of Hinduism and Buddhism, designed to lead a practitioner to exaltedstates of awareness, into contact with God—was the technique Dr. Ewen Cameronused in the depatterning experiments at his infamous clinic in Montreal onbehalf of the CIA. The difference was that his patients were bombarded withthese words for hours on end over electronic speakers placed under their pillowsuntil they were quite insane. This same technique was used (with no successwhatsoever) in the bombardment of David Koresh’s compound in Waco, Texas, and inthe sonic attack on Panamanian president Manuel Noriega, who was in hiding in acompound controlled by the Vatican, except that in Noriega’s case the selectionwas pure rock ’n’ roll.If the good Doctor Cameron, or the ATF and the FBI, or the Marines had followedthe procedures as originally developed by the Hindus and the Es- senes and theQabalists, they might have tried using some of the “meaningless gibberish” or“abracadabra” of their sacred books rather than specific words and phrases, someof which would have unknown connections with their victims’ belief systems,especially in the case of Waco. Had they relied upon the seemingly meaninglessmantras of the Gnostics, for instance, the results might have been interesting,and even more spectacular than the failures of Cameron, Waco and Panama City.The “Ineffeable Word” was only one aspect of the Essene occult teaching,however; their main interest, outside of the purely religious and apocalyptic,was medical. In Egypt, they were known as Therapeuts, which implies a gen- eralacknowledgment of their healing capabilities. They were said to have a goodknowledge of herbs and “therapeutic stones” and their application in a varietyof diseases. When we consider the Essene lifestyle, belief system, andreputation for healing and prediction, we can see how they could have survivedin one of the most famous eruptions of spiritual passion since the Cathars andAlbigenses of the thirteenth century: the sudden appearance of the Rosicrucians.Even the respected Biblical scholar Dr. Schonfield agrees:The influence of the Essenes of Egypt, known in the first century A.d. asTherapeuts, was particularly strong. Philo of Alexandria learned much from them.The Rosicrucians could look back to an Essene impetus from Egypt relating toarcane matters associated with the Sun-King and Master of Wisdom King Solomon,who had created the Temple in conjunction with the Master Asaph ben Berechiah.And these things were the founda- tions of Freemasonry.19Thus what we have before us is a continuum of belief and practice—religious,historical, medical, architectural, occult and astronomical—that stretches forthousands of years backwards in time, much as the popular legends of Freemasonrywould have it. And the continuum includes everything from the Temple of Solomonto the Essenes, the story of Jesus, the Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians andthe Masons, as well as heretical sects such as the Cathars, the Bogomils and theAlbigenses. It is an anti-history, a history below the surface of what isgenerally and popularly accepted as the truth, comprising elements from Judaismand Christianity and their offshoots, such as the Gnostics, as well as elementsof Zoroastrianism and Islam. What is more, associated with this anti-history isa remarkably coherent and internally consistent set of psychological andspiritual practices that involves what we know as ritual magic, alchemy,astrology and sacred geometry: an anti-science whose secrets were the targets ofsome of the most advanced (and certainly most serious) governments in the world,from the time of the philosopher-kings of Europe down to the present day’s CIAsand KGBs and terrorist organizations, an anti-science that was put to the use ofinterrogation, psychological warfare, “brainwashing” and mind control.But it was not intended that way.While the truth about the life of Jesus, the dispositon of the Ark of theCovenant, the architecture of the Gothic cathedrals, etc. presumably could beknown through archaeological research and examination of ancient documents andhistories, the operational secrets of the Essenes and other groups which share acommon heritage were considered so powerful that they were protected by cyphers,passwords, ritual gestures of identification, and other arcane impedimenta: notthrough jealousy or greed, but because the same secrets that could be used toheal could also be used to kill. Thus the medical doctor could also become thepoisoner; both disciplines derive from the same basic secret, the knowledge ofthe properties of plants and minerals. That is why a very high level ofspiritual devotion and attainment was required of those who desired to share inthis information, as a safeguard against the se- crets being misused. In fact,the rules of the occult Orders were very specific on this point: the sacredknowledge—when used in society—could only be used to heal. The rest of theknowledge was to be kept secret and never used for personal power in the world,only for deeper spiritual understanding. This attitude is quite apparent in oneof the most famous and influential documents printed in seventeenth centuryEurope, the Fama Fraternitatis.Published in 1614—but with manuscript copies in evidence as early as 1611—theFama Fraternitatis was the announcement of the existence of a secret body ofpious and learned men, the Bretheren of the Rosy Cross, who were dedicated tohumanist principles and who were somewhat in support of the religious reformmovement taking place in Europe at the time. Thus, they wedded secrecy to wisdomto politics, all in a few short pages which beginwith the discussion of their founder, one C.R. (identified in later documents asChristian Rosenkreutz), who was born in Germany but who traveled to the MiddleEast at a very young age and learned all he could of the occult arts beforereturning to Germany via North Africa and Spain.Much of the document is taken with the discovery of C.R.’s tomb, and of thesketchy history of the Bretheren after C.R.’s death. The combination of themystical with the scientific (the Bretheren were pledged to offer their servicesto the public only as healers, and to keep their membership in the Order and therest of their arcane knowledge secret) with a bit of the political captured theimaginations of readers all over Europe, in what has been called “theRosicrucian Furore.” Many were desperate to sign up with the Order, if it couldbe found; others went into print either supporting it or castigating it.Shortly thereafter, another document—the Confessio Fraternitatis—appeared, whichoffered more information on the Order as well as being more shrill politically,especially where the Pope was concerned. This hatred of the papacy would havebeen a hallmark of the Templars after they were suppressed, when they felt theyhad been betrayed and abandoned; but many in Europe had reason to despise thecorruption of the Vatican at that time. The importance of the Confessio isperhaps in its giving of actual dates. Here we learn that Christian Rosenkreutzwas born in 1378, and lived to be 106 years old, which means he died about 1484.As mentioned in the Fama, his tomb—when discovered—bore the inscription “Post120 Annos Patebo,” which means, “After 120 years I will open.” Thus, we canconclude that the Tomb of Christian Rosenkreutz was opened in the year 1604.Taking the story to be allegorical, we may wonder if the birth of ChristianRosenkreutz shortly before the Peasant Revolt in England has any significance,especially if we can accept that the Revolt was the work of the Knights Templar,in hiding since 1307. It may be that the Masonic Society was born at that timein 1378, went underground again in 1484 during the period when Islamic kingdomsin Iberia were being lost (at the “death” of Christian Rosen- kreutz, possiblyindicating Islamic support for the society in the intervening years), and thenmade made its way back to the light in 1604. But that is all conjecture; thedating seems quite specific, and may refer to events other than what we know ofthe Masonic Society.There is, however, one very important clue common to both the Fama and theConfessio, and which is emphasized in both texts, and that is the strangeodyssey of Christian Rosenkreutz to Damascus. We are told that he made his wayto Damascus, where he learned Arabic and studied at the feet of the Easternmasters there. We may assume that Christian prelates were not the masters beingcited. The area around Damascus at the time was rife with Syrian Nizaris who,although they had lost their stronghold in Damascus much earlier, were stillactive in the region and would remain so for centuries, tolerated by theOttomans. In addition, it was to the “Land of Damascus” that the Essenes andother religious refugees had often fled in order to find sanctuary and a placewhere they could practice their beliefs in relative security. Both theseRosicrucian documents mention this sojourn in Damascus as the central event inthe religious and occult education of Christian Rosenkreutz, for when he leavesDamascus and travels to other regions—Fez in North Af- rica, and Salamanca inSpain—he views the quality of arcane teaching there as somewhat inferior to whathe had learned in Damascus.Further, in the Confessio, we read,…as those which dwell in the city of Damascus in Arabia, who have a fardifferent politick order from the other Arabians. For there do govern only wiseand understanding men, who by the king’s permission make particular laws;according unto which example also the government shall be instituted in Europe(whereof we have a description set down by our Christianly Father) when first isdone and come to pass that which is to precede.… Even in such manner asheretofore, many godly people have secretly and altogether desperately pushed atthe Pope’s tyranny, which afterwards, with great, earnest, and especial zeal inGermany, was thrown from his seat, and trodden underfoot…Thus, we have in one paragraph a fascinating clue as to the Rosicrucian lin-eage and philosophy. For what Damascenes would have a “different politick orderfrom the other Arabians”? And how does this fit with the impulse to resist thePapacy and actually to destroy it? What Arab philosophy would the Rosicruciansemulate? Obviously, it had nothing to do with mainstream Islamic government. Isthis entire paragraph an allusion to the Syrian Nizari sect, the cult of theAssassins? And its anti-Papal stance a revival of the revenge of the Templars?Or is it even deeper than that, referring to a survival of Es- senism, which didhave a different government, a “different politick order” from Jewish, Christianand Muslim groups alike?Like the Church and like Islam, the Masonic Society and the ephemeralRosicrucian Order have had their share of renagade branches, formed by memberswho long for more initiations, different initiations, greater exclusiv- ity, orwho feel that the personal character of the lodges is not conducive to spiritualillumination or occult power. It is from these offshoots of Masonry andRosicrucianism that organizations like the Golden Dawn and the OTO had theirorigins, groups that eventually led to Aleister Crowley, Jack Parsons, and L.Ron Hubbard. The fact that Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism had their spiritualorigins in Syria, either through association with the Knights Templar or throughsome other collaboration with Islamic, Christian or Jewish heretical sectsthere, is important to a complete understanding of western secret societies, forit was from Syria that the Templars would have learned of the legendssurrounding the crucifixion of Jesus, of the existence of Gnosticism and the Warof Light versus Darkness, of Baphomet/Sophia, and of sacred geometry andQabalistic numerology. It would have been from the Syrian Nizaris that theTemplars would have learned of the infamous qiyama of Hasan II at Alamut and thedoctrine that the old law was abrogated for the faithful.……That, in contemporary terms made popular by Western journalists and amateurhistorians, “Nothing is true; everything is permitted.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Farhad Daftary, The Assassin Legends, I.B.

He was arrested on October 12,1969 on other charges, along with a number of his followers, who were scatteredthroughout the prison system awaiting trial. The Manson Family culpability inthe Tate and LaBianca homicides would not be suggested until December. Untilthen, he was cooling his heels on what was a simple credit card fraud beef, andcalmly expecting to be released at any time.Steve Brandt, though, had committed suicide in New York City that month interror over the killings and the possible existence of a hit list that wouldhave included his name as a close friend and confidante of Sharon Tate.At the same time, a couple—Al and Deanna Mertle—were experienc- ing some maritaltroubles. They had been married exactly a year before, in November of 1968, andeach had children by a previous marriage; but they were finding it increasinglydifficult to communicate with their kids and with themselves, and felt they weregrowing apart.They decided to visit the minister who had married them, and one night they haddinner with him and his wife and the subject of a new church in Redwood City, atown some three and half hours from their home in Hayward, California, came upin conversation. They agreed to go to the church the fol- lowing Sunday, and asit happened the event truly changed their lives.And quite possibly ended them.They joined the church in 1970 and stayed with it through thick and thin for thenext six years. When they left in 1976, they were afraid for their lives. Theycampaigned vociferously against it, and did what they could to inform governmentand civic leaders of the threat it posed to society. They spoke of beatings,sexual abuse including the rape of men, women and children, public humiliation,torture, brainwashing, and the mind control of children, includ- ing sleepdeprivation and being made to witness terrible punishments meted out for theslightest of offences and, sometimes, for no discernible offence at all. Theleader considered himself a God, said he was the reincarnation of Jesus andLenin, and demanded absolute obedience from his followers, who numbered in thethousands. It was Charles Manson and his Family writ large and fine-tuned.In November of 1979 the Mertles published a book about their experi- ences. InFebruary 1980, they were murdered in their home along with their teenageddaughter, each shot in the head execution-style by person or persons unknown.Their triple homicide has remained unsolved to this day.The Mertles had published their book under a pseudonym: Jeannie Mills. It wasentitled Six Years With God and was subtitled Life Inside Rev. Jim Jones’sPeoples Temple.The Jonestown massacre took place on November 18, 1978. In spite of tre- mendousmedia coverage, the case has never been satisfactorily explained, or the murdersof over nine hundred persons ever really solved. The first police officials tobe summoned to the crime scene described evidence that is at wide variance tothat found in the official American reports. Bodies were missing, and thenfound. Numbers were juggled with reckless abandon. Cover stories were tried out,and then dropped in favor of more credible ones. Money was missing. Guns weremissing. Documents were missing. And, as usual, wit- nesses started dying ofunnatural causes.Even the biography of the man at the center of the holocaust, Jim Jones, wassketchy and open to interpretation. His presumed close association with DanMitrione was never investigated by the US government or, if it was, the resultswere never made public. Mitrione was the man taken hostage and then killed bythe leftist guerrilla Tupamaros in Uruguay in 1970, revolutionaries who knewthat he was a CIA agent with AID agency cover. Jones and Mitrione had known eachother in Indiana, where Mitrione was a cop specializing in juveniles and Jones afifteen-year-old sidewalk preacher, and they were both in Brazil at the sametime in the early 1960s: Mitrione with a police training unit that was underAgency for International Development (AID) cover, and Jones in some murkycapacity that involved the US consulate.Mitrione, it is now known, was involved with the training of Latin Ameri- canpolice forces in the use of torture and drugs in interrogations, under theauspices of the now-defunct and cynically-entitled Office of Public Safety(OPS), an Orwellian organization that was formed during the Eisenhoweradministration. Mitrione was an avid practitioner of the methods he taught and,according to one of his trainees in Uruguay in the late 1960s, he would pick uphomeless people on the streets to be used as guinea pigs in his trainingsessions, bloody interrogations which were always conducted in a soundproofroom. In Montevideo, this room was in the basement of his home. When thederelicts died during the course of the “training,” their bodies would be dumpedback in the streets as a warning to Communist insurgents.The drugs and techniques, of course, were the direct and unequivocal legacy ofongoing MK-ULTRA research. According to John Marks,In 1966 CIA staffers, including [John] Gittinger himself, took part in selectingmembers of an equally controversial police unit in Uruguay—the anti-terroristsection that fought the Tupamaro urban guerrillas.… Agency operators worked toset up this special force together with the Agency for InternationalDevelopment’s Public Safety Mission (whose members in- cluded Dan Mitrione,later kidnapped and killed by the Tupamaros). The CIA-assisted police claimedthey were in a life-and-death struggle against the guerrillas, and they usedincredibly brutal methods, including torture, to stamp out most of the Uruguayanleft along with the guerrillas.3John Gittinger was the “MKULTRA program’s resident genius.”4 He devel- opedsomething called the Personality Assessment System (PAS). An incredibly complexsystem, it resisted computerization due to all the variables, and at one pointGittinger had something like 29,000 separate test results on computer printoutin his office that he mined for data on the personalities of drug ad- dicts,prostitutes, homosexuals, criminals, the easily hypnotizable, etc. His specialtywas uncovering the “underlying personality structure—discrepancies that producetension, conflict, and anxiety.” 5Gittinger had left his mark on virtually everyaspect of MK-ULTRA, from the San Francisco “safe house” where prostitutes wereobserved with their johns behind two-way mirrors, to the attempt to develop anaerosol can that sprayed LSD, to the selection of secret police in Uruguay toassist Dan Mitrione in his endeavors.During the same period, Andrija Puharich (of Arthur Young, MK-ULTRA and “Councilof the Nine” fame) was also in Brazil investigating the famous “psychicsurgeon,” Arigo, while Arthur Hochberg (of Robert Mullen and E. Howard Huntfame) was also in Brazil working for the CIA station there. Guy Lyon Playfair,an English-born biographer of Uri Geller and the author of several books onparanormal phenomena, was living in Brazil researching macumba and otherBrazilian occult practices at the same time (working oc- casionally for Timemagazine among other sources of income) and from 1967-71 was working for the same CIA front—AID, the Agency for InternationalDevelopment—that Dan Mitrione used as a cover! (As an aside, even the infamousmedical doctor and war criminal, the “Angel of Death” at Auschwitz, JosefMengele—one of the most wanted men in the world at the time—was living in hidingat a farm ninety-three miles north of Sao Paulo in 1962, and thus only a fewhours’ drive from both Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte.) So, it was one big happy,psychotic, dysfunctional family: Jim Jones, Dan Mitrione, Andrija Puharich,Arthur Hochberg, Guy Lyon Playfair, Josef Mengele, even Arigo the psychicsurgeon. But we are getting way ahead of the story.We must spend some time with the Jonestown episode because it pulls togetherseveral disparate scarlet threads in this tapestry of politics, drugs,intelligence agencies, religion, mind control, and murder. Some commentators andjournalists have gone overboard with accusations of Nazi involvement, and haveclaimed that Jonestown was “a CIA medical experiment.” As outlandish as theseclaims seem prima facie, with Jonestown we are on the very threshold of theunbelievable. The documentation that does exist makes it virtually impossible toaccept the official story of Jonestown as it has been handed down since that dayin mid-November 1978 when Congressman Ryan was shot and over nine hundred othersmurdered. While the mainstream media has been content to cluck and shake theirheads over the Jonestown massacre as an example of “what happens when peoplefollow a religious leader blindly” and leave it at that, there was in reality somuch more to the story of Jim Jones, the Peoples Temple, and the 913 murderedmen, women and children that, if nothing else, the story needs to be told fortheir sake, most of whom never had a decent burial and many of whose bodies werenever even identified.LORD JIMCornelius, who had made himself at home in the camp, talked at his elbow,pointing out the localities, imparting advice, giving his own version of Jim’scharacter, and commenting in his own fashion upon the events of the last threeyears. Brown, who, apparently indifferent and gazing away, listened withattention to every word, could not make out clearly what sort of man this Jimcould be. “What’s his name? Jim! Jim! That’s not enough for a man’s name.” “Theycall him,” said Cornelius, scornfully, “Tuan Jim here. As you may say Lord Jim.…He is a fool. All you have to do is kill him and then you are king here.Everything belongs to him …”-- Joseph Conrad, Lord JimThe basic facts of the life of Jim Jones are a matter of public record. He wasborn James Warren Jones in the small village of Crete, Indiana on May 13, 1931.Crete doesn’t appear on most roadmaps today, although its larger neighbor, Lynn,can be found about twenty miles north of Richmond, Indiana on the Ohio border,due east of Indianapolis. Jim Jones’ father was a World War I veteran who hadbeen gassed in the trenches and was considered disabled, living on a pension. AQuaker by birth, he was now a proud member of the Ku Klux Klan and a nightwatchman for the town, licensed to carry a handgun on his rounds. Jones’ mother,according to one account, had been an anthropologist doing field work in Africaand had returned to Indiana soon after going there; the reasons are not clear.Thus, the marriage between these two people, widely separated in age, backgroundand belief, is fairly incredible but nonetheless a fact.Jim Jones and Charles Manson were contemporaries; Manson was born in 1934, onlythree years after Jones, and had a similar upbringing. Where Jones’ father was aformer soldier in the trenches of the Great War, Manson’s father—at least in theeyes of the Ashland courts—was one Colonel Scott, of unknown background andunspecified military service (where did the “Colo- nel” come from?). They bothwere raised by very religious Christians who were not members of the immediatefamily. In Manson’s case, we are talking about his West Virginia relations withwhom he was housed when his mother was in prison. In the case of Jim Jones, thereligious influence was a Mrs. Kennedy, who was his babysitter in Lynn afterschool while his mother worked at an aircraft plant in Richmond. Mrs. Kennedywas a devout Methodist, and it was from her that he got his first taste of theBible and then wound up holding mock church services for other children at hishome.Then, at about the age of fifteen, he began preaching on the sidewalks inRichmond. This was certainly odd behavior for a high school student, and is anindication of how much he was attracted to religion: going from make- believeSunday services at his home to actually preaching on street corners in town. Itwas at that time that he met Dan Mitrione, who was a police officer in Richmond,although the exact nature of their relationship remains mysterious andunexplored. It was in Richmond nonetheless that the seeds of Jonestown would beplanted.By the time he was ready for his senior year in high school, the Second WorldWar was already over and his parents had separated. Jim Jones moved with hismother to Richmond, and he enrolled in Richmond High School while at the sametime finding work as an orderly in Reid Memorial Mental Hospital. It was at Reidthat he met his wife, a nurse four years his senior. He married MarcelineBaldwin in the Methodist Church in Richmond on June 12, 1949 and the newlywedsmoved to Bloomington, where Jim Jones would attend Indiana University.Jones took a part-time job as a night watchman, which was what his father hadbeen doing to supplement his army pension, and what a generation of othersinister gunmen have been known to do, such as David Berkowitz (the “Son ofSam”) and Mark David Chapman, the killer of John Lennon. He began to drift awayfrom the degrees he had been working towards, first the business degree and thenthe law degree, and then eventually even the degree in education. But by 1952Jim Jones had finally found his true calling: as an assistant minister for theSomerset Methodist Church in Indianapolis. It was at Somerset that thephenomenon we know as Jim Jones was spawned.Somerset was located in a poor white neighborhood in Indianapolis, a town asracist as any other in the United States in 1952. Jones, however, preached agospel of racial tolerance, which was not accepted by the white community butwhich did attract black worshippers. By all accounts he was a charismaticspeaker, but he supplemented his preaching with a fair amount of legerde- main:healing the sick in the manner of fraudulent faith healers the world over whoremove cancerous growths from their patients with mesmeric passes, the shoutingof Biblical phrases, and the generous use of concealed chicken livers as“tumors,” which are revealed at just the right moment to effect the “cure.”Eventually, Jones was kicked out of Somerset, but by then the damage had beendone. He was not formally ordained into the ministry until much later, but hehad developed a following throughout southern Indiana and Ohio nonetheless,aided by his frantic schedule of prayer services and radio programs, a campaignthat wooed black people into a church organization that would include onlywhites in leadership positions.At that time, the early 1950s, Jones’ politics was by all accounts as virulentlyanti-Communist as those of his fellow clergymen, and his radio programs andpreaching carried a clear anti-Communist message. This was, after all, theMcCarthy Era and anti-Communism was fashionable in some circles (just associalism was in others), and for a Christian minister in the Midwest who trav-eled the circuit between Cincinatti, Dayton, Richmond, Indianapolis and FortWayne, it was to be expected that he would preach against the godless Russiansand the atheist Chinese. Politically then, before his trip to South America, hispolitics would have been considered sound by US government officials.As the operation became more sophisticated, though, after his mysterious sojournin Brazil, Jones gradually abandoned any pretense at standard Biblicalterminology or theology. Jones began to speak of revolution, and of Jesus as asocialist. He began to gradually mock and villify the God of the Jews, the “SkyGod” as he called him, and to identify Jehovah with satanic forces bent on thedestruction of humanity. It was pure neo-Nazism, except it was so convolutedthat most of his followers would never have recognized it for what it was. Asdetailed at some length in my previous work, Unholy Alliance, the Naziideologists of the Third Reich had reinterpreted the Bible in such a way thatthe God of the Israelites was Satan. This has become standard theology in suchracist organizations in America as the Christian Identity movement.Lucifer was the “light-bringer,” and intent on delivering humanity from theclutches of the evil Jehovah. This is also a Gnostic belief, as demonstrated inthe scriptures uncovered at Nag Hammadi in Egypt in 1945. In this system, theSerpent in the Garden of Eden was the true God, who wanted to deliver the humanrace from the blind Creator God, the Demiurge who wanted Adam and Eve as hispersonal slaves. This deity is equivalent to the H.P. Lovecraft creature, the“blind idiot god of chaos,” for it was he who created material forms withreckless abandon and who—in his blindness—believed he was the Superior Being anddemanded that Adam and Eve worship only him. According to Gnostic legend, thisbeing—Samael—was then chastised by the other gods for his vanity in assuming themantle of Supreme God. That other gods existed is plain to see by the Biblicalinjunction, “I am the Lord thy God, thou shalt have no other gods before me,”implying that there were other gods to be dealt with.This multiplicity of gods with Biblical geneaology is what gave rise to thetheology of the Process Church of the Final Judgment, as discussed in Book One.This form of Gnosticism also influenced Charles Manson, and he began to identifyhimself with Abraxas, a famous Gnostic deity whose numerologi- cal equivalent is365, the same as the number of days in the year and thus representative of timeitself. With the Nazis, the neo-Nazis, and the Christian Identity movement inthe United States, Europe, and Latin America, we are experiencing a strangeresurrection of first and second century Gnosticism: Gnosticism with avengeance.Some of this is evident in the sermons and speeches of Jim Jones as well, exceptthat in his case he was obviously abandoning all pretense at religion of anykind and was trying to develop a popular political movement using all thecreaking machinery of old-time religious revivalism. Imagine, if you will, allthe ritual, pomp and ceremony of religion but without any mention of God.Imagine people signing over everything they own to a “Temple” that preachesneither Jehovah nor Jesus, but Lenin and Mao. In addition, Jones also preachedreincarnation—not exactly a mainstream Christian belief, but one familiar to theearly Gnostics—and claimed he was the reincarnation of Buddha, Jesus, Lenin, andthe progenitor of the Bahai religion, the Bab. In other words, like hiscontemporary Charles Manson, Jim Jones was God; and by demanding total obedienceand unstinting worship from his follow- ers, he was unconsciously identifyinghimself with Samael, the “blind idiot god of chaos.”As Kenneth D. Wald points out in his Religion and Politics in the United States,the early American political campaigns were based on Christian tent revivalism:Candidates rallied supporters with torchlight parades, tent meetings, door-to-door canvassing, and public declarations of faith, the same methods pioneeredby evangelists seeking religious converts.6Jones merely took this one step further and mixed radical politics with Chris-tian revival sturm und drang to the point where people thought they were in achurch on Sunday—from all the singing and preaching, the handsome Reverend inhis robes and aviator sunglasses, shouting and waving his arms in the pulpit(with no Bible in sight)—but were really at a political rally. An ersatzsocialist political rally.There is evidence to show that Jim Jones and his wife, Marceline, visited Cubain 1960, for reasons unknown. It is here that the story takes on all thehallmarks of an intelligence operation, for there appear not one but two JimJoneses, two different passports, and mutually contradictory itinerariesthroughout the period 1960-63.Probably the best source of information on this period of Jones’ life iscontained in the parapolitical journal Lobster, a British publication that haslong been a favorite of conspiracy theorists and investigative journalists. Itis here, in issue number 37, that some of the most frightening information aboutJim Jones was presented by veteran journalist and television documentaryproducer Jim Hougan (of Spooks and Secret Agenda fame). Entitled Jonestown, TheSecret Life of Jim Jones: A parapolitical fugue, it gently debunks some of thewilder theories about Jonestown, while giving evidence for a scenario that is,if anything, even more unsettling. As I began to write this chapter, I wasignorant of some of the very firm connections that existed to support my ownthesis, and I am thankful to Jim Hougan for the benefit of his two years ofresearch on Jim Jones and Jonestown undertaken in the United States and SouthAmerica.Hougan has shown that Dan Mitrione and Jim Jones did know each other, and thatJones actually referred to his friendship with Mitrione several times during thecourse of his taped speeches at Jonestown. This is impor- tant, for it brings usone step closer to a true understanding of the events of 1978. More importantly,Hougan demonstrates that Jones was known to the CIA and the FBI before themassacre, and that the CIA maintained a file on Jones that coincided quiteprecisely with Dan Mitrione’s career as an overseas “trainer” of foreign policeforces. That is, the file on Jones was opened when Mitrione began to work forthe AID-sponsored OPS program and was closed when Mitrione was killed in Uruguayin 1970, a period of roughly ten years spanning the Castro revolution in Cuba,the socialist victory at the polls in Guyana, the Bay of Pigs invasion, theassassination of President Kennedy, the socialist victories in Brazil, themilitary coup in Brazil, and even the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and MartinLuther King. This coincidental opening and closing of Jones’ file in tandem withMitrione’s career leads Hougan to believe that this was an indication of aJones–Mitrione working relationship. If so, it has implications far worse thaneven the Jonestown massacre provides, for it means that Jones was infiltrat- ingreligious organizations, and specifically black religious organizations, onbehalf of the United States government.Jones visited Cuba in February of 1960. Certainly an awkward time for anAmerican clergyman to be in Havana! Castro had just taken power the previousyear, in January of 1959, and the Bay of Pigs plotting was already underway. TheAmerican presidential election of 1960 was months away. Yet, Jim Jones chosethis time to visit what was practically a war zone.According to a Cuban whom he met in Havana during that trip, Jones was involvedin trying to arrange for Cubans to emigrate to the United States. This was partof a larger American policy of encouraging Cubans to defect from Castro, inorder to weaken the Cuban economy as well as win some propaganda points. Joneswas specifically trying to recruit black Cubans to come to Indianapolis wherehis Peoples Temple was still located. It seems that nothing much came of thisplan, but Jones was evidently working on behalf of American political interestswhen he was there. He brought back with him photographs of himself in Cuba andmost curiously a photo taken of him standing next to a downed aircraft that hadbeen flown by anti-Castro Cubans—not exactly on the main tourist circuit, evenin revolutionary Cuba. The anti-Castro Cubans were bombing the sugar cane fieldsin a further at- tempt to destabilize Castro’s regime, and one of these photosshows a pilot’s dead and mangled corpse. As Hougan points out, this type ofphoto would have been of extreme interest to American intelligence.Did Dan Mitrione recruit Jim Jones one day on the streets of Richmond, Indiana?Did he note that Jones seemed to have a rapport with black people, somethingquite unusual for a white teenager in 1950s middle America? Was there a largeragenda, especially at a time when the FBI and the CIA were worried that a blackrevolution could threaten the existing American institutions and disrupt thestatus quo? Was Jones supposed to provide both an intelligence source within theblack community, as well as a safety valve for the anger and resentment felt bya race that had been enslaved and even then were struggling for basic humanrights?If Jones did have an intelligence agenda, and was working for Dan Mitrione insome capacity, then it might go a long way towards explaining the two passportsand, incredibly, the two different versions of Jim Jones.Like the strange appearance of one, two, many Oswalds in New Orleans, MexicoCity, and Dallas, which has plagued Kennedy assassination research- ers foryears, there were at least two men traveling to South America at that time namedJim Jones.As pointed out in Hougan’s research, Jones had two passports issued to him attwo different times. One, issued in Chicago on June 28, 1960 and another issuedin Indianapolis on January 30, 1962. The problem is twofold. First, as there isstrong evidence (on the basis of an eyewitness account, an affidavit signed byJones during that period in Cuba, etc.) that Jones was in Cuba in the first fewmonths of 1960, how did he travel there if his passport was not issued untilJune 28? Secondly, why the two passports, as the first one issued in 1960certainly would still be valid?It is certain that Jones was in Cuba in February of 1960. It is also certainthat he visited Cuba again a year later. And there is further evidence—alsoincontrovertible, and verified by newspaper accounts printed at the time—thatJones had visited Guyana (when it was still called “British Guiana”) yearsbefore he ever set up the commune known to the world as Jonestown. In fact,according to an eyewitness—a Cuban he eventually brought to the United States inAugust 1960 to stay with the Temple in Indianapolis—Jones appeared to have beenwell-traveled by that time and “knew Latin America well. He had already been toGuyana, and wanted to start a collective there.”7The assumption is that Jones also spoke Spanish, since the witness—CarlosFoster—did not speak English at that time, and they spent entire days for a weekdiscussing plans for bringing Cubans to the United States. (Why, Jimmy, we neverknew ye!)Then, in 1961, the Jim Jones phenomenon becomes positively …other- worldly.He was named as the Director of the Indianapolis Human Rights Commission when hewas thirty years old, by most accounts, which would mean sometime in 1961. Onewonders what the duties of a Human Rights Commission director would have been inIndianapolis in 1961, but whatever they were, by October he was resigning thepost after having spent a week in a hospital due to stress. He had been hearing“extra-terrestrial voices”—shades of Aleister Crowley and Aiwaz, or of Barneyand Betty Hill, whose celebrated abduction by a UFO had taken place the previousmonth in New Hampshire—and having seizures. 8These symptoms sound quite serious,and would be evidence of a psychotic episode, perhaps a schizophrenic orschizophreniform disorder, but alas we have insufficient information aboutJones’ particular illness, rendering further speculation futile.At the end of October, Jones left Indianapolis for a few weeks of rest andrecuperation, in Hawaii according to most accounts. Unfortunately, as Jim Houganpoints out, this story is patently false, for the Guyanese newspapers have Jonesin their country in late October 1961. He could not have been in both Hawaii andGuyana the same week of October. Not in 1961. Further, he is supposed to havestopped in Mexico City during that time as well, which renders the impossibilityof being in three different countries spread that far apart in the same week.For those who have not attempted to visit Guyana, it is a difficult place toreach today, and was even more so in 1961. There were no direct flights fromHonolulu to Georgetown. The airfare—in 1976 when the author was contemplating atrip, two years before the Jonestown massacre—was also prohibitively expensive,as Guyana is off the main tourist routes. One typically flew via Trinidad orJamaica or one of the other Caribbean islands.All of this simply goes to say that Jim Jones could not have been in both Hawaiiand Guyana the same week. Further, there is evidence that Jones had been underpsychiatric care in San Francisco and—as Hougan points out—some have offered theopinion that Jones went to Hawaii in order to “receive psychiatric care withoutpublicity.”9The idea that Jones might have spent time in a mental hospital in Hawaii is richwith further implications, for one of history’s most infamous assas- sins—MarkDavid Chapman—also spent time in a mental hospital in Hawaii, and Hawaiianhospitals also came under investigation for their possible role in a network ofdrug trafficking that involved the organization now believed to have beenresponsible for the Son of Sam murders in New York City. Also, and for reasonsthat are really not very clear, several of the Manson Family women, to keep oneof their own out of the witness chair during the trial of Charles Manson, fledto Hawaii, where they fed her a hamburger laced with an overdose of LSD. Theunfortunate victim—Barbara Hoyt—wound up wandering in the busy streets ofHonolulu and was taken to a hospital for observation and treatment. Thisbetrayal by her fellow Family members led to her becoming a very cooperativewitness against them once she recovered. Why the Manson Family chose Hawaii isopen to speculation. It would have been just as easy—and far less expensive—tohave moved the witness to one of the other states or even to Canada or Mexico.The selection of Hawaii seems either serendipitous or evidence of a deeperagenda.Nonetheless, what is known about Jones beyond any doubt is that he was underpsychiatric care at the Langley-Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute in SanFrancisco, a hospital that conducts experiments on behalf of ARPA, the AdvancedResearch Projects Agency of the Defense Department, and where “virtually everysurvivor of the Jonestown massacre was eventually treated.”10Jones’ medical files have been withheld from scrutiny, even though Jones hasbeen dead since 1978.So, we have two passports, two distinct destinations, and many motives. Jones inGuyana was preaching against Communism. Jones in Cuba (during one trip) wasattempting to lure Cubans into the States, and during another was meeting withFidel Castro. Jones in Mexico was up to God knows what. And finally Jones was inBrazil. But the usual reasons given for his trip there also defy thechronological record.The usual impetus described is an article published in the January 1962 editionof Esquire magazine entitled “Nine Places to Hide.” In the event of a nuclearwar, according to the article, there were nine safe places on the planet thatwould be immune from both bombs and radioactive fallout. One of these wasEureka, California and another was Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Jones is described asextremely paranoid about nuclear war, and desperate to find somewhere to sit outa holocaust. Although he was based in Indiana at the time, and therefore muchcloser to Eureka, California, for some reason Jones decided that Brazil was theplace to be, and he moved himself, his wife, a personal friend and his wife, andtheir four children to Belo Horizonte that year.The problem with this scenario is that Jones was already in Guyana in October of1961. The article on Jones was published in the Guyana Graphic on October 27,1961, so the story that he stopped off in Guyana on his way to Brazil doesn’twash. And the story that the Esquire article prompted his trip also doesn’twash. It wasn’t in print in October of 1961.The months between October of 1961 and April of 1962 are a black hole in hisbiography. It seems evident that he was not in Indianapolis, but aside from thatthere is no way to know where he was or what he was doing. All that is certainis that he arrived in Sao Paulo, Brazil on April 11, 1962. Ac- cording to afriend who knew Jones in Brazil at this time, he had arrived in Sao Paulo fromCuba.11 The problem with this account should be obvious to anyone who remembersthe period, because it is only a year after the Bay of Pigs invasion, and onlysix months before the Cuban Missile Crisis. How many Americans were touringHavana at that time? In addition, the same eyewitness claims that Jones showedher a photograph he had taken with Fidel Castro. This was the same Americanminister who made anti-Communist speeches in Guyana the year before.Will the real Jim Jones please stand up?Jones may have admired Castro’s style of public speaking, for it so mirrored hisown: lengthy speeches lasting hours, filled with revolutionary rhetoric,paranoia and ad hominem appeals to the better angels of our nature. But thisforeign travel of the Joneses is mysterious and hard to understand on the basisof the existing documentation. So much of it is not explained. So much of theinformation that is available is contradictory. Witnesses describe Jones’lifestyle in Brazil as lavish; others as meager at best. Witnesses say thatJones was setting up an orphanage in Brazil, but for whom and with what fund-ing is not described; others say that Jones did no missionary work at all inBrazil, but left the house each morning with a briefcase and returned eachevening with few comments on where he had been or what he had done. He wouldmake passing references to Naval Intelligence (à la Ron Hubbard) or to othergovernment work; people who knew him in Brazil thought of him as a spy: noBrazilians who knew Jones during his stay there and can attest to his Christianmissionary work have been discovered.Whatever took place in Brazil, by the time he returned to the United States hehad undergone a conversion to socialism, a conversion that would eventually leadhim to espouse Communism as the only way. He dropped his pretense of being aChristian minister in the 1960s and began openly supporting revolutionaryactivity, particularly an end to racism. This could have been an honestconversion, based on witnessing firsthand some of the very poor conditions inSouth America and understanding that the United States was at least partially toblame for the suffering. On the other hand, the conversion—as so many havecharged—might have been false, a cover story being developed for a far moresinister purpose. After all, most of the people who were murdered at Jonestownwere black. Most of the people doing the killing were white.As mentioned previously, Jim Jones was in Brazil at the same time as DanMitrione, whom he had known from their common sojourn in and around Richmond,Indiana. Mitrione had since left Richmond to join the FBI, and eventually becamean instructor of foreign police departments on behalf of the Office of PublicSafety, which worked hand-in-hand with AID, the Agency for InternationalDevelopment. Mitrione’s work involved training police investigators in the finertechniques of interrogation. This work was eventually heavily criticized by theUS Congress when word of its excesses began to be known publicly in the 1970s,and the unit was disbanded and reorganized under other supervision. But it wasin the 1960s that the damage had been done.State Department, military and CIA operations in Latin America were notoriousfor their rapacity during that time. It is a matter of public record that theCIA managed to orchestrate a military coup in Guatemala in the1950s, the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, the election of a supposedlypro-US Forbes Burnham as Prime Minister in Guyana over his socialist op- ponentJagan (who later expressed himself as satisfied with the results of the riggedelection, when it was learned that Burnham himself was even more of a socialistthan Jagan!), and, of course, the US-sponsored overthrow of the Allende regimein Chile on September 11, 1973. The police forces of Latin America have allreceived training of one kind or another from US special- ists working for AID,OPS, or the US military directly; and this training has taken place either inthe United States or, during the 1960s, more likely in the foreign countryitself, far from the watchful eye of congressional oversight committees.Indeed, the US government does not know what training programs were in placeduring that time or how much they cost, as they were often buried under otherappropriations and other budgetary columns in the annual reports. But it wasmillions upon millions of dollars for dozens of programs spread throughout thevarious Departments and Agencies. In the unlikely event that it is ever shownthat Jonestown was a “CIA medical experiment,” there will be no documentation tosupport the contention. The personnel, equipment, contingency plans and budgetswill all be buried in just the way government accountants and bookkeepers knowso well: just as they had done for the international police training programs ofthe 1960s; just as they had for the mind-control experiments of the CIA, until ablunder revealed four boxes of financial papers sitting in a basement at Langleylong after the rest of the documentation had been thoroughly shredded by RichardHelms and his Dr. Strangelove, Sidney Gottlieb.During the same era, the author himself was employed by a large govern- mentcontractor and Fortune 100 company, the Bendix Corporation. where I wasprivileged to work in their International Marketing Operation, located onBroadway in mid-town Manhattan. At Bendix—from 1973-79—I witnessed severaloccasions where my employer was used as a cover for intelligence ac- tivitiesand police and military support operations all over the world. Indeed, in thewake of the Watergate revelations, several newspapers carried stories about theinvolvement of Bendix “field engineering personnel” in the training of SaudiArabian troops, as one example. We read these reports avidly in the office,looking for the names of people we knew. In Argentina, local Bendix employeesand their expatriate manager were kidnapped by left-wing revo- lutionaries andheld hostage. Our sales rep from Caracas, Venezuela—from the swashbuckling firmRepresentaciones Godoy—would fly to New York in his private plane and walk intoour offices wearing a sidearm, much to the consternation of our security staff.I remember watching the telex machine one day as our man in Lebanon sent hissales report and purchase orders; in the middle of transmission, the machinedied and we held our collective breath. Civil war had just begun, and our officewas in the middle of the war zone in Beirut. Finally, after an agonizing wait ofabout twenty minutes, the transmission resumed. It was the last we would receivefrom Beirut, and our man transferred to another Middle Eastern location wherethe sound of small arms fire did not punctuate the night.Considering that our clientele involved everyone from the Shah of Iran to themilitary procurement departments of countries all over the globe, it was nowonder that we would be used as a cover for intelligence operations. Financialarrangements at Bendix for international accounts were also so byzantine andcomplex, involving the payouts of huge “commissions” and the awarding of bizarreorders for seemingly useless equipment, that we began to understand that USintelligence agencies could have easily financed many of their operations simplyby using Bendix sales people and sales agents in the target countries asconduits for funds, funds that would go both ways. For instance, we once sold tothe Government of Pakistan six early-warning type radar systems. Six! The UnitedStates itself only had one of the same type at the time. It was understood thatthe contract for the six systems was, in reality, a contract for something elsealtogether; that the Pakistani government was paying for other services orequipment that it was considered best to conceal from the watchful eyes ofjournalists and congressmen. And so it goes.Thus, when the author heard some of the stories about Dan Mitrione, as well asabout Operation Condor in Latin America, Operation Phoenix in Vietnam, etc., hecould well imagine how easily the finer details had been arranged. Had Jim Jonesbeen in Brazil on some sort of assignment—either for the CIA, or for some otheragency such as Mitrione’s OPS—his funding would have been easy to source and tohide. As a contract agent, he might even have been paid in cash, with a paperreceipt signed either in his name or in a mutually-agreed upon pseudonym.It is known that Jones returned to the United States with money, not an easymiracle if one’s whole time in Brazil was spent in missionary work, living closeto the bone and building an orphanage, as he claimed in his speeches.12In an emotional confession before his assembled followers, in fact, he said thatthey were so broke in Brazil that he had to become a gigolo and sell his body tothe rich and eager wives of local Brazilian businessmen in order to raise moneyfor the impoverished children under his care, and all with his wife Marcelline’sapproval. One must pause for a moment and brush a tear from the eye in sympathywith the tremendous sacrifice Jim made—over and over again—in order to put foodon the table for the starving orphans of Belo Horizonte!And, if such really is the case … where is the Reverend Jim Jones MemorialOrphanage?THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL“The precise pain, in the precise place, in the precise amount, for the desiredeffect.”-- Dan Mitrione (in Killing Hope, by William Blum)Brazil in 1962 was in virtual chaos. Janio Qaudros had been elected in 1960 onan anti-corruption platform. His vice president was the Brazilian Workers Partycandidate, Joao Goulart. (In Brazil, presidents and vice presidents are electedseparately.) Seven months later, however, for reasons that have never beenrevealed, Quadros resigned the presidency and threw the country into aconstitutional crisis. By rights, Goulart should have taken the oath aspresident, but due to his socialist politics, the army resisted hisinauguration. Finally, he was allowed to take office, but only with reducedresponsibilities. The job was to be shared with a newly-created position ofprime minister, someone who was acceptable to the military and could keep thesocialist president in line.Finally, in 1962, a national referendum held by Goulart reversed the 1961decision, and Goulart was allowed to take full powers and remove the primeminister. This did not, however, happen with the full cooperation of theBrazilian military authorities. Brazil was as much in the midst of the Cold Waras the United States and the other powers. Brazil, alone of all countries inSouth America, had sent troops to Europe to fight in World War II, specifi-cally in Italy, and the Brazilian army considered itself a close working ally ofthe United States. Goulart, on the other hand, was seen as a Communist, andBrazilian and American military and intelligence forces began to cooperate tofind a way to have him overthrown. Mitrione was in the middle of that plotting,and his training of the Brazilian police forces involved not only the usualthird-degree and torture techniques but also “political” training. Both theUnited States and the Brazilian right-wing viewed Goulart as a revolutionary inthe pocket of the Soviets and the Cubans, and this message was brought across byAmerican advisors like Dan Mitrione.This was the political environment in which Jim Jones and his entourage foundthemselves. Goulart’s presidency had just been assured by the nationalreferendum, and the Brazilian Army was in the grip of fear of a Communisttakeover of their country. Of course, Christian fundamentalist churches could becounted upon to support the Army and the right-wing against Communist“evangelism” in the countryside. Godless Communism was the common enemy of allChristian churches, so a successful American preacher like Jim Jones could beexpected to add his support to American and Brazilian efforts to counter theattraction that Goulart and other Communist sympathizers had for some of theelectorate. There is no doubt in my mind, based on long experience in SouthAmerica and Asia, that the presence of Jim Jones in Brazil in 1962 had politicalovertones, whether or not he was actually in the employ of an intelligenceagency or simply cooperating with an old friend like Dan Mitrione. Religiousgroups in South America have long been po- litically affiliated or politicallyactive; World Vision is only one example of an organization that is widelyreported to have cooperated extensively with American intelligence services inSouth America.During Jones’ time in Brazil, the economy began to deteriorate. Goulartstruggled to keep the country afloat as foreign loans were called in, loans thathad been made to Brazil during the previous administration. By 1964, when Joneswas leaving Brazil, inflation had reached 100 percent, and there was no foreignmoney coming into the country to help it stave off the creditors. In January andFebruary of 1964, desperate to hold on to power and to keep the military at bay,Goulart organized political rallies in major cities throughout Brazil. Henationalized the oil refineries and put a cap on the expatriation of profits byforeign investors. Finally, he made a speech to the Brazilian Army, asking thenoncoms to refuse to carry out any order by their officers if the order was notin Brazil’s best interest. This speech was carried on national television. Itwas all the excuse the Army needed.On March 31, 1964 the Army seized power in Brazil, and Goulart went into exile.Forever. A few months earlier, Jim Jones went home.While Jim Jones was ostensibly setting up an orphanage or missionary operation(and it is perhaps relevant to note here that Jones had not yet been actuallyordained as a minister by any church; that would not happen until after hisreturn to the United States in 1964), Andrija Puharich was in Brazil toinvestigate the claims of “psychic surgeon” Arigo. Also at the same time, GuyLyon Playfair was living and writing in Brazil about a variety of topics, butconcentrating on his main interest: the paranormal. Both Puharich and Playfairwould later become involved with Uri Geller, the Israeli psychic who dazzled theworld with his apparent ability to bend spoons with his mind. As for Playfair,he was working for Time magazine and eventually for the AID office in Rio.Brazil is a greenhouse for occult societies and alternative religious practices.When the author was there in the 1990s, it hadn’t changed much from the 1960s.Native practices such as macumba, umbanda and candomble are very popular, andwith every level of society. More surprisingly, the works of Alan Kardec arealso popular. Kardec was a nineteenth-century spiritualist who wrote on a widevariety of occult themes, mostly having to do with contact- ing spiritualforces. In addition, basic grimoires of European ceremonial magic—such as theGreater and Lesser Keys of Solomon—are widely available and treated withreverence. All this operates in close proximity to the Catholic Church and tomany different Christian sects, from Pentecostals to Evangeli- cals to standardPresbyterian and Methodist churches. Add to this the largest Japanese communityoutside Japan, located in Sao Paulo, and you have quite a mixture of spiritualbeliefs and practices, which of course include Buddhism and Shintoism. Faithhealers and spiritists abound, and new occult techniques and teachers areembraced with fervor. The sacrifice of animals occurs on a regular basis, in thedeep jungles of the Amazon River basin as well as in the high-rises of Sao Pauloand the favelas of Rio de Janeiro.According to Hougan’s sources, Jones was there to study the phenomenon of DavidMiranda, a Pentecostalist minister who started his own congrega- tion—the Churchof God is Love—in Brazil in 1960-61, shortly before Jones’ arrival. Miranda’smix of Christian fundamentalist Pentecostalism with faith healing and (asaccused in 1999) money laundering would have attracted the like-minded Jones.Hougan believes, however, that there might have been another element to Jones’fascination with Miranda, and that would have been the CIA’s interest in “massconversion techniques” as part of its MK-ULTRA program. Certainly, Jones’ visitto Brazil coincides with a major effort on behalf of the CIA to study primitivereligions worldwide, from the psilocybin-eating Indians of Mexico to the Yorubafaith healers of Nigeria. This was not only a CIA interest, for the military hadalso actively pursued these studies in the name of psychological warfare. Themanipulation of the masses—whether by drugs, hypnosis, or other means—would havebeen of extreme interest to the CIA and the military, and people like DavidMiranda would have become a focus of this interest. Today, Miranda’s operationspans the globe, particularly in developing countries, and is worth manymillions of dollars; it was probably a model for Pat Robertson’s ChristianBroadcast- ing Network and the Christian Coalition, which has also been involvedin supporting right-wing military dictators from Mobutu of Zaire to Taylor ofLiberia to Rios Montt of Guatemala and the Contras of Nicaragua (as we shall seelater on).Brazil is a multi-racial society, built by the Portuguese with imported slavesfrom Africa and indentured servants from Asia. (Guyana, its next door neighbor,is populated almost completely by Africans and East Indians; the native Americanpopulation is a distinct minority.) In the Brazilian bush can be found a widevariety of Native American tribes, their numbers dwindling as the rain forest iscut down and their cultures lost forever. The Brazilian capitol ofBrasilia—located not on the coast like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, but in theinterior—is surrounded by animists and spiritualists of every stripe, andgovernment officials are known to frequent these practitioners to ensure thesuccess of their respective careers. It is a country steeped in respect for theparanormal, and therefore no wonder that the psychic surgeon Arigo should haveknown such acceptance there.Andrija Puharich had gone to Brazil in August of 1963 with businessman HenryBelk,13 a former agent with the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), heir to thelargest chain of department stores in the southeast United States (the BelkStores which are headquartered in Charlotte, South Carolina), and founder of theBelk Research Institute, of which Puharich was president, an institute createdfor the study of paranormal phenomena. Belk had also been acquainted with Dutchpsychic Peter Hurkos but, according to one account, became disillusioned withHurkos when Belk’s ten year old daughter and only child went missing shortlyafter Hurkos had done a psychic reading for Belk and predicted nothing of thesort. His daughter was found dead by drown- ing and, according to the samesource, it was Hurkos who saw the site where she would be found. That was notenough for Belk, of course, who felt that if Hurkos had any real powers he wouldhave warned Belk of the tragedy so that he could have averted it. The Belkfamily is famous in South Carolina; they have endowed various educationalinstitutions and have been major contributors to charities. William Henry Belk,the founder of the department store chain, began in 1888 with a small store inCharlotte which he named The New York Racket. (Cynics will claim the name was acase of psychic premonition by the energetic Presbyterian businessman!)According to one source, the two had gone to Brazil to investigate Arigo at thesuggestion of John Laurence, an RCA engineer who worked with NASA and who wasactually on the committee that formed NASA in 1958. In Puharich’s book, URI,Laurence is described as “one of our researchers” in a group of medicalspecialists put together by Puharich in 1968 to return to Brazil to studyArigo,14 and the one who spotted a UFO at the same time. Laurence’s specialtywith NASA and RCA was satellites, and it is possible that his role in Brazil waslinked with the development of communications satellite technology. Laurence’sother interests obviously involved the paranormal, and it is not clear what hisrelationship was to Puharich and why he would have invited Puharich specificallyto come to Brazil at a time when that country was on the verge of a militarycoup to counter what was believed to be a nascent Communist insurgency. Further,as Puharich admits that Laurence was a specialist in satellite technology andworked for the Astroelectronics Division of RCA in New Jersey, 15and thus wouldnot seem to have had medi- cal training, one wonders why he was present at all.Yet, there we have it. An unusual grouping of individuals in Brazil during theprecise timeframe when both Brazilian and American intelligence agencies werepondering what to do about Goulart and the Communist menace: former agent andCBW special- ist Puharich, police trainer and torture specialist Mitrione, localspecialist in Brazilian occultism Playfair (who would later find work with AID),wealthy businessman and paranormal aficionado Belk, and NASA and RCA engineerLaurence. If we really want to stir ourselves up into a paranoid frenzy, we canadd Josef Mengele to the mix.Mengele had escaped justice after World War II and eventually found him- self inBrazil in late October 1960, staying first in Sao Paulo before winding up, inthe 1962-64 time period, at a farm about ninety-three miles north of Sao Paulo,which puts him within an easy distance of both Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte.16Mengele, of course, was a notorious medical practitioner at Auschwitz,responsible for experiments on live subjects and with special interest in twins.It was Mengele—the Angel of Death—who would stand at the train station when theboxcars of Jewish prisoners were unloaded, telling the bewildered, starvingvictims “Right” or “Left,” to live or to die. Of course, Mengele was in hidingafter the war, desperate to avoid Israeli commandos, and would not have beenhobnobbing with the likes of Jim Jones or Dan Mitrione or Andrija Puharich. Itis only another example of the action of a sinister synchronicity at work inhistory.However, it can be stated with some degree of certainty that the politicalevents in 1964 that returned Brazil to the control of the military were welcomenews to Mengele. A socialist or Communist in power meant worse conditions forNazis on the run, particularly if the regime was pro-Soviet. The Russians haveno sense of humor when it comes to Nazi war criminals; witness theirintransigence in the case of Rudolf Hess, who was the only prisoner left atSpandau by the time he died in 1987, more than forty years after the end ofWorld War II. Considering how deeply American intelligence agencies wereprotecting Nazis after the war, and how closely Brazilian and American mili-tary and intelligence agencies were cooperating, we can be sure that the localauthorities would not have been looking too hard for Josef Mengele.We can, however, posit a relationship between Jones and Mitrione due to theircommon origins in and around Richmond, Indiana and Jones’ statements to thateffect in his Jonestown speeches. Puharich and Playfair certainly knew eachother, and both knew Geller. In fact, Geller would refer to Puharich as his “CIAcase officer.” Did the investigation of Arigo have an intelligence aspect? And,considering that Jim Jones made a very public spectacle of “psychic sur- gery”in the United States, by palming rotten chicken livers and holding them up asevidence of cancerous tumors extracted from his adoring congregants by nothingmore than blind faith and mesmeric passes, was there any contact at this timebetween Arigo and Jones or Jones and Puharich? Unfortunately, we shall neverknow. Arigo, Puharich, Mitrione and Jones are all dead.However, one connection can be made, to be filed perhaps under the “six degreesof separation” rule. In February of 1953, Andrija Puharich had been redraftedinto the US Army, and posted to the Army Chemical Center in Edgewood, Maryland,where he would remain until April of 1955. His du- ties are not describedanywhere in any detail, although evidence examined in Book One demonstrates thatat least some of his responsibilities involved experiments under the CIAmind-control effort. Before Puharich’s posting, one Dr. Laurence J. Layton wasposted to Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, a test center for the Chemical WarfareDivision of the US Army; this was in November of 1951. In March of 1952, Laytonhad been named Chief of the US Army’s Chemical Warfare Division, a position heheld until 1954. In other words, Dr. Layton was—at least on paper—Dr. Puharich’sboss.The relevance of this will become clear shortly. Suffice it to say for now thatDr. Layton—and especially his children, Larry Jr. and Deborah—would play a majorrole in the events that led up to the Jonestown massacre and that Larry Jr. isstill in prison, the only man ever convicted of murder in that hideous event,while it was his sister, Deborah, who had been an important influence onCongressman Leo Ryan’s decision to go to Jonestown in the first place.And, in one more bizarre twist to this story, another associate of Puharich andthe busy occult circle around Arthur Young, Jack Sarfatti, Ira Einhorn and therest was physicist Russell Targ, who by his own admission was involved with theAl and Jeannie Mertle group of Jonestown survivors. In fact, he was the Directorof Counseling at the Mertles’ Human Freedom Center in Berkeley, California in1979, and worked for them for “almost a year” until he left to join the StanfordResearch Institute (SRI) to study psychic phenomena. It was the Mertles who,under a pseudonym (Mills) wrote an exposé of the Peoples Temple entitled SixYears With God. A few weeks after Targ left their employ, the Mertles were founddead, murdered execution style in their home.17DISCIPLES OF THE MILLENIUMUpon Jones’ return to the United States he quickly found himself formallyordained as a minister, and began setting up shop as the Peoples Temple, firstin Indiana and then relocating to Ukiah, California. According to Jones, therelocation to Ukiah was of a piece with the Esquire magazine article that saidthe nine safest places in the world included Eureka, California. Now, Eureka andUkiah are quite distant from each other and, to make matters worse, Ukiah isquite close to several military installations around San Francisco which wouldbe targets in the event of a nuclear strike. No matter; somehow Jim rationalizedhis choice in his own mind.By 1968, things at the Peoples Temple had become quite spooky. The Bible wasbeing replaced by Jones’ political oratory. The good citizens of Ukiah weregetting worried about this strange preacher in the aviator sunglasses whopeppered his “sermons” with obscenities and his theology with Marx. In addi-tion, the white community of Ukiah was nervous at the growing numbers of blackswho were joining the Peoples Temple and causing cultural distortion in theirlittle town. Jones began casting about for another home, and this wouldeventually become San Francisco.In the meantime, he managed to attract some of his most important mem- bers (anddefectors). He would also become heavily involved in the health-care industry,and in California politics. What does not compute in reviewing his career is howJim Jones—if he was truly the psychopath as painted by the press and governmentreports—was able to garner such support from bureaucrat and politician alike. Wecan understand the influence of a charismatic preacher over the multitudes; thatis, after all, the basic premise of broadcast television: to be able tocommunicate effectively with the largest mass of viewers one must tailor one’sprogramming and vocabulary to the level of a sixth grade public schooleducation. That is basically what Jones did, as is evident from the tapetranscriptions of some of his speeches, including the last one made during themassacre at Jonestown. What we cannot understand is how this same individual wasable to function effectively with governors, mayors, and businessmen who—atleast theoretically—should be able to spot a con artist at thirty paces; some ofthe power of these men (and they were mostly men) resides in the ability to spotthe same power in others. Jones had the admira- tion and support of his flock,which numbered in the thousands, and he made substantial donations to thereligious organization that eventually adopted the Peoples Temple and insuredits legitimacy: the Disciples of Christ.Garry Wills, in Under God: Religion and American Politics, notes that theDisciples of Christ have given the United States three presidents: JamesGarfield, Lyndon Johnson, and Ronald Reagan.18 (Oddly enough, the first wasassassinated and the third would be the target of an assassination attempt. OnlyJohnson, it would seem, escaped the attentions of an assassin, although hebecame president due to the assassination of his predecessor.) The Disciples ofChrist is a millennialist sect, and this is probably why—again, according toWills—Reagan “felt so comfortable with biblical language about the end timewhenever he met with fundamentalists.” 19Indeed, not only Reagan, but othermembers of his administration held deeply apocalyptic beliefs, men such asDefense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Interior Secretary James Watt.These high government officials held a Biblical, fatalistic acceptance of theidea that the End Times had come and were upon us; that the Second Com- ing ofChrist was imminent and that the events of the world were pointing towards themeltdown of civilization and the ensuing Rapture. America was, therefore, andhowever briefly, in the hands of an administration that believed in the literaltruth of the Book of Revelation, the Apocalypse (however one interprets thephrase “literal truth” when it comes to the hallucinatory prose of that work).Most Americans were blissfully unaware of this fact, and the implication thattheir government was on a collision course with the Evil Empire based onBiblical prophecy and Christian Fundamentalism, as if we were living in thetwelfth century instead of the twentieth. How dangerous was the world in the1980s! One wonders what Soviet intelligence made of all of this, ignoring forthe moment that their celebrated revolutionary, Bakunin, was an avowed Satanistand that Stalin’s daughter was a follower of the Russian mystic Gurdjieff.…Oddly, Wills does not mention Peoples Temple or Jonestown in this study ofAmerican religion and politics, although he does agree that in America, religionand politics can never be truly separated. The Disciples of Christ were born inthat same mad religious fervor of the early nineteenth century’s religiousrevivalism that brought us the Awakenings … and the sight of an impoverishedfarm boy with a book of medieval spells summoning an angel on a mound on thenight of the autumnal equinox in upstate New York: the Angel Moroni and the boyJoseph Smith.Lest we believe that millennial and apocalyptic beliefs are a legacy ofAmerica’s purely European and purely Christian ancestors, there is the parallelcase of the Native American Ghost Dance phenomenon which culminated—in 1890—withthe massacre of the Lakota Sioux at Wounded Knee. Without going overmuch intohistorical and ethnographic detail, suffice it to say that the Ghost Dance wasoriginally designed to bring the Native Americans close to nature and to healthe wound they perceived had been made by the arrival of the white man and hisprofligate ways. It was believed that if the tribe performed this sacred dancedaily then the breach between heaven and earth would be mended and the earthrenewed, and all the buffalo that the white men had killed would be reborn andwould wander the earth as in the Golden Age, and the white people themselveswould be destroyed by a flood.The Ghost Dance as such was instigated by a Native American prophet, Wovoka, whohad a vision of God telling him to teach the Ghost Dance to the people. Thisoccurred years after the famous Battle of Little Big Horn, in which ChiefSitting Bull destroyed the forces of General Custer. Sitting Bull had beenexiled, then imprisoned in the United States, then freed to live on areservation. The Lakota tribe was moved onto a reservation, and forced to becomefarmers rather than the hunters and gatherers they always had been. They had noidea about farming and began to starve to death, prohibited from carryingweapons and hunting for their food. In secret, they revived the Ghost Dance andmet in the hills to pray for deliverance.It was believed by the American forces that Sitting Bull was somehow behind theGhost Dance movement and was using it to foment discord and hatred against thewhites (as if they needed any instigation). They arrested and killed ChiefSitting Bull on December 15, 1890 and then pursued his followers into the hills.The massacre of Wounded Knee took place on De- cember 29, 1890 and was the lastmajor battle between Native Americans and whites. The exact number of slainLakota Sioux is not known, but was estimated to be between 200 and 300, mostlynon-combatants: women and children, including infants. A number of Americantroops were also killed, mostly from “friendly fire.” The Sioux were wearing“ghost shirts” that had been specially prepared and blessed by their medicinemen, and they believed the shirts would render them invulnerable to bullets.They were mistaken.The Lakota were looking for the millennium, but instead they found ApocalypseNow. The parallels to Montsegur, to Masada, and even to Waco are too numerous tomention, and any interested reader can find sober histories detailing the sadevents of the Lakota, as well as of the Cathars, the Branch Davidians and other“cults” that were deemed too dangerous to exist. The story of the PeoplesTemple, however, differs from these examples in several important ways, as weshall see; but we should note that Jim Jones was a close friend and supporter ofAmerican Indian Movement (AIM) leader Dennis Banks, who himself led a ten-weekprotest and occupation of the original Wounded Knee site in 1973.As more and more congregants signed over their life savings, their social secu-rity checks, and their tax refunds to the Peoples Temple, the church became, ifnot wealthy, at least well to do. Jones, fearing racial backlash in Ukiah, movedhis congregation first to Orlando and then to San Francisco in 1972, to an oldsynagogue on Geary Street in 1972. By that time, he was already something of apolitical power in the state. He was the foreman of the grand jury of MendocinoCounty, and one of his top aides—Timothy Stoen—was an assistant districtattorney for Mendocino County. That meant, essentially, that Peoples Templerepresented the power of both the grand jury and the DA’s office: a powerfulcombination, but it is not clear whether this power was put to actual use.It is clear, however, that for whatever reason (genuine revolutionary cha- rismaand sincere love of his fellow humans or a secret intelligence agenda) he becamepopular and powerful in the State of California after his return from Brazil andhis move from Indiana. It was during this transitional period that he met thepseudonymous Al and Jeannie Mills—who would be murdered a few months after thepublication of their book on Jonestown—and the Laytons. Two of theLaytons—Thomas N. Layton and his sister Deborah Layton—have also published bookson the subject. Their brother, Larry Layton, Jr., is the one still in prison forhis role in the Jonestown massacre: the murder of Congressman Leo J. Ryan.As the Laytons are at the very heart of the story, we need to take a closer lookat the family in order to ascertain the shift and shadow of the sinister forcesthat brought them together in fissionable combination with Jim Jones; for it isclear that the major players in this story all had prior professional experiencein secret military and intelligence projects, and that Congressman Ryan was onthe trail of CIA medical experimentation in his home state of California at thetime he was murdered by the son of a man who was in charge of all US ArmyChemical Warfare, a brilliant scientist who was deeply conflicted over his roleas master of chemical weapons and their delivery systems.Once again, as we have so often in this study, we must return to Germany in thewar years.Many people that like to accept tradition as it is, without even questioning it,are religious in this superficial, conventional way … They merely accept apicture they have in their imagination, colored with the strange and sweetfeeling of memory from childhood and early youth.… It is living somewhere backin our unconscious mind and shows up in everything we ‘feel’ toward otherpeople, situations and ourselves.This picture memory plays the most important part in the religious concept ofmost people as they are nowadays. And it is a dangerous one….-- Lisa Philip, in a letter to Laurence Layton dated Sept. 15, 194120The Layton family is, of course, two families: the Laytons of Boomer, WestVirginia and the Philip family of Hamburg, Germany. There is some mildcontroversy over the ancestral lineage of the Philip family, and one com-mentator (Meier) has attempted to prove that they were Nazis. This does not seemlikely, as the same commentator does admit that they were related to theNobel-Prize winning physicist, James Franck, who was—like the Philip family—anon-practicing Jew. According to Dr. Laurence Layton, the Philips also claimedto be related to a sixteenth-century Spanish cardinal, which is an unusualpedigree for Jews,21 particularly in the sixteenth century, although possible.As for the Laytons, Laurence Layton’s ancestors in Pennsylvania had been Quakers(although Laurence himself was now a Methodist, raised by a Methodistgrandfather), and Lisa Philip had become a Quaker shortly after emigrating tothe United States, and was a member of the State College Friends Meeting atPennsylvania State College where she was studying, 22thus shar- ing a strangelink with Ruth and Michael Paine, who were also Pennsylvania Quakers, albeit ageneration later.Dr. Laurence Layton was born in Boomer, West Virginia—a small town about fiftymiles southeast of Charleston along the Kanawha River, in an area of burialmounds and prehistoric mystery—on March 8, 1914. His mater- nal grandfather,Sheldon Nutter, was “a circuit-riding preacher, Baptist and Methodist onalternate Sundays, in the hills of Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky” 23andwas general manager for the Mark A. Hanna Coal Com- pany in Boomer. His father,John Wister Layton, was an electrical engineer credited with the design of thecircuit breaker, among other devices.24 John Wister Layton married Eva Nutter onJanuary 18, 1913. Laurence Layton was their first child.At the age of nineteen, Laurence Layton fell in love with the sixteen-year- oldMildred Arthur, a girl from Kentucky who had come to Boomer to visit relatives.Unfortunately, Mildred had a friend back in Pikeville, Kentucky: one of theHatfield clan. He came to visit one week and Laurence—thinking he was Mildred’sboyfriend—became depressed and quit college two days later, fleeing to Scranton,Pennsylvania where his mother and her new husband lived. (His father, JohnWister Layton, had died at the age of thirty-one from a staph infection.)It was in Scranton that Laurence Layton first made the acquaintance of the YoungPeople’s Socialist League, which was meeting in a YWCA in town. (Oddly enough,future CIA mind-control czar Sidney Gottlieb would also be active in the YoungPeople’s Socialist League, in his case at the University of Wisconsin, andduring the same timeframe.) Layton stayed involved with the Socialists for abouta year, and then returned to West Virginia, where he eventually garnered somelocal fame as a youthful inventor and scientist and went on to earn a master’sdegree, leaving shortly thereafter for Pennsylvania State to get his doctoratein chemistry. These were the late 1930s, the years just before America’s entryinto World War II. Six thousand miles away, in Europe, the Nazi menace wasbuilding strength after strength, and millions of lives were in terriblejeopardy.Lisa Philip was born on July 14, 1915 in Hamburg, Germany, to Hugo and AnitaPhilip. The Philip family was descended, it is claimed, from Sep- hardicJews—the “Asiatic” Jews rather than the more Slavic Ashkenazi Jews of EasternEurope—and had been in Europe for a thousand years, arriving in Spain during theMoorish conquests and leaving during the subsequent Inquisition in the fifteenthcentury, which forced the Philips out of Spain and eventually into Germany. LisaPhilip was raised as a German, and had never visited a temple or celebrated anyJewish holidays. They observed Christmas and Easter, and had never identifiedthemselves as Jewish at all. This gave rise to some suspicion among latercommentators that the Philip family was Nazi, particularly considering the factthat Lisa’s father, Hugo, was a banker and stockbroker whose accounts includedI.G. Farben and Siemens, companies later identified as integral parts of theGerman war machine.25The Philip family was cultured and sophisticated. Their home was done in theBauhaus style, and they cultivated music and the arts. When the politicalsituation became untenable, the Philip family began to make arrangements toleave Germany forever.Lisa Philip was the first to leave, on May 6, 1938 aboard the SS Manhat- tan,bound for New York. Her passport, according to Thomas Layton, was stamped Judenor “Jewish.” Her sponsors in the United States, the Berlin family, met her atthe dock and took her to live with them in Philadelphia. Her parents were not sofortunate, finding it very difficult to leave Germany and emigrate to the UnitedStates along official channels. Things looked very bleak when they were turnedback at the Italian border and sent on a return train to Germany. Rather thanface a horrible fate in the camps, Hugo and Anita Philip took an overdose ofVeronal.They were saved, however, when a conductor found them unconscious and took themoff the train in Austria, putting them in a hospital. For the time being, theywere under Austrian supervision, even though Nazi officials were visiting thehospital daily to inquire after their condition. They managed to convincefriends in Vienna to sponsor them until they received their American visas and,with the help of these friends and the American Society of Friends (the Quakers)spent four months there under heavy Nazi observation, before finally beingallowed to leave for America on March 20, 1940.In the meantime, Lisa Philip had moved to Chappaqua, New York (at the time ofthis writing, the new home of former President Bill Clinton) and foundemployment with a Congregationalist minister, Reverend Galen Russell. At-tending church every Sunday with the Russells, Lisa Philip had become not onlyAmericanized but Christianized. By the fall of 1940, she found another position,this time at Pennsylvania State College as a physical therapist (in thecollege’s hospital). It was there that she met Laurence Layton.They were introduced by a mutual friend, Franz Werner, in early 1941, and onOctober 18, 1941 they were married.On December 7, 1941 the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, and the United Statesentered World War II.Laurence Layton could have been drafted, but his wife wrote to her relative Dr.James Franck to get him an appointment with the University of Chicago so that hecould avoid the draft. Franck did manage to arrange a posting for Layton, but heinstead received a student deferment through regular channels and decided tostay on at the University of Pennsylvania. Had he accepted Franck’s offer, hewould have been involved with the Manhattan Project, which is what Franck wasworking on in Chicago.26 Instead, he finished his doctorate and wound up workingfor Eastman Kodak at their headquarters in Rochester, New York. That job did notlast very long, but the Laytons’ first child—Thomas—was born there. In Novemberof 1943, Laurence Layton decided to take a job as an assistant professor at theUniversity of Maryland, a position he held for three years, during which theirnext two children—An- nalisa and Laurence John, Jr.—were born. After the war,Dr. Layton found employment at Johns Hopkins University and eventually publishedimportant work in the field of cortisone treatments for arthritis.27 This led toa higher profile for Layton, and he came to the attention of the US Army.On November 5, 1951 he arrived at Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, where he wasnamed chief of biochemistry of the Army’s Chemical Warfare Division. In thespring of 1952, he was named chief of the entire Chemical Warfare Division.During the preceding years spent in Maryland, the Laytons had regularly at-tended Sunday meetings with the Quakers and considered themselves sincereFriends. Quakers are pacifists and have a very negative attitude towardswarfare, finding the idea of armed conflict repugnant. (During the Vietnam War,it was common for Quakers to declare themselves conscientious objectors and tofind themselves assigned to non-combatant duties in hospitals and other publicservices. The fact that Richard Nixon was a Quaker is one of history’s ironies …or dirty jokes.) However, chemical warfare must seem even worse: especially ascountries were busy writing laws against both chemical and biological warfarewithout actually banning warfare altogether.There is a common denominator among people of different racial and ethnicorigins that such weapons are inhuman and should be forbidden. Yet, this devoutQuaker and man of high morals—so high, in fact, that he could never accept thefact that his devoted wife and the mother of their three children, Lisa Philip,was not a virgin on their first night together—accepted the job with the Army,even though his work was being recognized on an international level and he hadbeen lecturing on it in Europe. No one, not even his eldest son ThomasLayton—who is now a well-known and respected archaeologist with many awards andhonors to his name—can explain this strange about face. Yet, there is no denyingthat it happened, and that Dr. Laurence Layton was “responsible for thepublication of ten classified reports on research aspects of chemical warfareand more than 100 reports on chemi- cal weapons systems.” 28All that in only thetwo years he was employed by the Army. Dr. Layton was therefore quite anenthusiastic sponsor of chemical weapons, averaging one report on chemicalweapons systems per week and five classified reports on chemical warfare peryear. It was during his tenure as head of the Army’s Chemical Warfare Divisionthat some of the military’s most controversial experiments on unwitting humansubjects were taking place, such as the spraying of aspergillus fumigatus overpopulated areas. As- pergillus fumigatus is an infectious organism that affectsthe “lungs, bronchi, external ear, paranasal sinuses, orbit, bones, andmeninges.”29 The organism can, in fact, cause death.During the first three months of 1953, for another instance, the city ofMinneapolis was subjected to a total of eighty-one hours of an aerosol spray-ing of zinc cadmium sulfide (to simulate a bacteriological attack) during thehours of 8:00 P.m. to midnight, and 1:30 P.m. to 5:00 P.m. 30No one was warnedabout these events, of course, and everyone was exposed: men, women andchildren. The same type of simulation was undertaken in St. Louis dur- ing thefollowing three months, from April to June of 1953. No testing was done of thehumans who had breathed the chemical, and no follow-up was ever reported todetermine what effect, if any, the testing had on the health of the generalpopulation.Other tests, involving the aforementioned aspergillus fumigatus as well asserratia marcescens and bacillus subtilis, were undertaken in the 1950s, andsome of these projects were undertaken during Layton’s tenure. The Army hasinsisted that these organisms—used to simulate such toxic substances asanthrax—are harmless to human beings, even though the medical literatureavailable at the time shows clearly that they are, indeed, dangerous and—in somecases—fatal to human beings.The most famous germ warfare test, though, was undertaken a little before Dr.Layton’s tenure as CW chief, and that was the test over San Francisco in 1950,in which several people were taken ill and one died. Thus, Dr. Layton was bothheir to a tradition of experimentation on unwitting populations and for twoyears the man in charge of the entire program. Perhaps coincidentally, and asdescribed in John G. Fuller’s memorably-entitled The Day We Bombed Utah, bothUtah and neighboring Nevada were the scene of a controversial series of tests ofatomic weapons during the time that Dr. Layton was living there. Specifically, atest with the code name “Dirty Harry” took place on May 19, 1953, and thefallout from the blast affected both human beings and livestock in both states.That test had been preceded by many others over the years since 1951, andalthough Dugway was considered as a site for these tests, it was passed over dueto its proximity to large population centers. Everyone in Nevada and Utah wasaware of these tests, however, and the Army began to realize that large amountsof radiation were affecting citizens as far away as Troy, New York in the formof radioactive rain. Dr. Layton would have known all about these tests, ofcourse, even though they were taking place outside of his area ofresponsibility. His tests—also involving unwitting citizen popu- lations—were ofweapons systems, but of a chemical and biological nature rather than atomic ornuclear.It is important to remember that this was the Cold War, and that drasticmeasures were not only considered but often employed in the struggle to defendthe country against every sort of attack from the Soviet Union and China; thatdoes not justify using human beings as unwitting guinea pigs, of course, but itputs these operations in some sort of context. That Dr. Layton was dismayed bythe uses to which the science was put is evident from his reluctance to staywith the program; that he performed excellent service for that program is alsoin evidence, to wit his one hundred reports on chemi- cal warfare systems andthe ten still-classified reports published during his short tenure with theArmy’s Chemical Warfare Division. Such, perhaps, is the structure of the humanmind, able to support two such contrary natures simultaneously, each as strongas the other, both vying for dominance at the expense of the soul.Later, in 1954, Dr. Layton transferred to the Naval Powder Factory at IndianHead, Maryland, where he would work with ICBMs and missile systems; but in themidst of this vigorous military research and development there was a tragicnote. On May 10, 1952 Dr. Layton’s mother-in-law, Anita Philip, committedsuicide in New York City.Hugo and Anita Philip had emigrated to the United States in 1940 and thusescaped the hideous fate of many of their friends and fellow Jews. But AnitaPhilip had never quite escaped the Nazis in her mind. Her suicide is one of thestrangest episodes of this story, and there have been several attempts toexplain it. The generally-accepted theory is that—due to the classified natureof her son-in-law’s work for the Army—a routine background check was in progresson her family, and that it is the heavy-handed approach of the FBI thatcontributed to her paranoia that the secret police were after her once again. Anexpanded version of this theory has it that Anita Philip was so distraught overher son-in-law’s work for the Army that she was moved to shame and despair.She left a note, and there is in it a hint of guilt over an undisclosed indis-cretion:My friends, know that I, free and proper, am a good American. But I was a gossipand have been entangled in a network of intrigue.31The letter was written in German, so perhaps something of its nuance was lost inthe translation. It is strange that it would be addressed to “my friends,” as ifto a wider audience than her children and family, whom she mentions later on inthe brief note. Does the word “friends” perhaps refer to her fellow Quakers?Alas, we shall never know. Nor shall we know what she meant by “I was a gossipand have been entangled in a network of intrigue,” which is cer- tainlysuggestive of something other than paranoia over an FBI investigation. To whomwas she gossiping? What was she saying? What was the network of intrigue? Thefamily brushes it off as a symptom of her failing mental state. But afterwriting the note, and signing it with a simple initial, “A,” she leaped to herdeath from her apartment window.A year later, and another person connected with the Army’s Chemical WarfareDivision would fall from yet another window in New York City. That person, ofcourse, was Frank Olson and there is every indication that he was murdered bythe CIA.With Dr. Layton in Utah and Dr. Olson in Maryland, there was also Dr. Puhar-ich, also in Maryland and also at Camp Detrick where Olson was stationed. Allthree men worked for the Army in chemical and biological weapons research, andall at the same time. The fact that the CIA was running its own operation inconjunction with the Army at Camp Detrick at the time Dr. Layton was chief ofthe Army’s Chemical Warfare Division indicates that these men were all known toeach other, if not on a personal basis then surely by name and function. Olsonfell to his death in New York in November of 1953, and it is perhaps more than acoincidence that Dr. Layton decided to leave the Army’s CWD soon thereafter tostart work for the Navy in Indian Head, Maryland.Other men connected with the CIA found themselves dying under mysteri- ouscircumstances at the same time. While much of the focus has been on Dr. FrankOlson—thanks to the brave and tireless efforts of his son, Eric—the other deathshave been ignored until recently. With the new developments in the Olson case,reporters and investigators have begun to look at other suspicious deaths andthe tally is surprising.A former State Department employee and suspected Soviet agent, Laurence Duggan,fell to his death from his 16th floor office window in Manhattan on December 20,1948.Former Secretary of Defense James Forrestal fell from the 13th floor of the USNaval Hospital at Bethesda, Maryland on May 22, 1949: a case that has all theearmarks of an “assisted suicide,” and which many family members believe washomicide.On January 24, 1953, State Department official and suspected CIA agent James C.Montgomery was found dead with a cord around his neck, his body completely nude.The death was ruled a suicide, but then-Congressman Fred E. Busbey of Illinoisdidn’t believe it and called for a full investigation in the House. Lifelongintelligence agent Speyer Kronthal was found dead on April 1, 1953. The cause ofdeath was believed to have been a self-administered drug overdose. Ahigh-ranking CIA official, Kronthal was revealed in 1975 to have actually been aSoviet double agent.Duggan and Kronthal have been revealed to be Soviet agents—well, re- vealed bythe CIA—and perhaps we can consider their executions appropriate, if notjustified. We have no such reassurances on the case of Montgomery, none at allon Olson, and especially not on James Forrestal. Could it be that a governmentagency which finds it expedient to execute suspected Soviet spies without dueprocess of law could also find it expedient to execute other men with whom theyhave “issues”?At any rate, by July of 1957 Dr. Layton had accepted a (relatively benign?)position as a research scientist for the US Department of Agriculture, at alaboratory near Berkeley, California. The family up and moved to the Bay Areaand looked forward to a healthier environment, free from talk of payloads andweapons systems and lethal chemical agents. A new addition to their family,Deborah Layton, had been born in February 1953 (she was conceived the week ofAnita Philip’s death).As the 1950s moved into the 1960s, the Layton children were as affected by thegrowing youth culture as any other youngsters. Deborah Layton be- came veryproblematic, getting involved with drugs and teenaged depression and alienation.Thomas Layton had become cerebral and intellectual and was already moving in hisown circles, as was big sister Annalisa. Laurence Jr. was consciously avoidingthe draft for the Vietnam War, and was working in hospitals and waiting forconfirmation of his conscientious objector status.Deborah Layton—after a stint in the United Kingdom at a strict Quaker school—wasfinally drawn into the Peoples Temple experience by her brother Larry. This waswhen the Temple was located in Ukiah, California. Gradually she became veryinvolved with the group and was entrusted to greater and greaterresponsibilities by Jim Jones. She found herself becoming part of an innercircle that handled the money, and was involved in moving funds out of theUnited States and into bank accounts in Latin America and Europe. Just as Rev.David Miranda of Brazil would be accused of doing some twenty years later, JimJones moved millions of dollars out of the country using church members as“mules,” carrying the cash with them and depositing it in various accountsspread over the globe.In addition, Deborah’s mother—Lisa Philip Layton—also became involved with thePeoples Temple. Things were never that close between Lisa and her husbandLaurence, and she saw the Peoples Temple as an adventure to be shared with herchildren. Lisa Layton, the German-born Jewish refugee from the Nazis, wouldemigrate to Guyana with Deborah, and would die at Jonestown months before themassacre itself.Larry Layton, the youngest son of Dr. Laurence Layton, had had his share ofemotional turmoil growing up and found himself involved with drugs and all theother alternative experiences available to the youth of the sixties. But in theSummer of 1968, he and his new wife—Carolyn Moore, the daughter of Rev. JohnMoore, a Methodist minister—moved to Ukiah, where Larry got a position as anaide at the Mendocino State Mental Hospital and was working on obtaining hisconscientious objector status. His wife visited the Peoples Temple and came backimpressed with Jim Jones and the Temple experience.The “Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ of Redwood Valley” had beenincorporated in the State of California since November 26, 1965. In 1967, Joneshad been named the foreman of the Mendocino County Grand Jury and was also theDirector of the Mendocino and Lake Counties Legal Services Foundation. His wife,Marceline Jones, had become a state nursing home inspector and, in the process,the Peoples Temple had opened three convalescent homes and a home for boys, andeven a pet shelter. Thus, sud- denly the Peoples Temple was in the health-carefield, and its leader was heavily involved in local politics. His assistantpastor, Tim Stoen, was also an assistant district attorney for Mendocino County.The church was acquiring a power base.At the time Carolyn Moore Layton decided she wanted to join the Peoples Temple,she was considered perhaps the most attractive woman in the church and this cameto the notice of its priapic minister. He decided that he wanted Carolyn as hismistress, so he orchestrated the divorce of Carolyn and Larry in1969 by first having Carolyn publicly humiliate Larry in front of the congre-gation. The influence of Jones was so great that Larry meekly accepted Jones’suggestion that he should divorce Carolyn since they were so incompatible. Jonesthen offered another one of his flock as a substitute on the spot, and thebewildered Larry—pressed to choose someone—selected a blonde, blue- eyed formerhippie chick, Karen Tow. Done. Larry and Karen were married, and Carolyn becameJones’ paramour, eventually becoming pregnant by him and bearing their child, aboy they named Kimo (the Hawaiian equivalent of “James”). In order to provide alegal father for the birth, Jones had Carolyn marry another Temple member.Then, in 1970, Deborah Layton met Jim Jones for the first time. (That samesummer, Jones’ associate—case officer?—Dan Mitrione had been killed by theTupamaros in Uruguay, leaving Jones high and dry but not without resources inthe government.) By the mid-1970s she had become one of his most trustedfollowers, an essential partner in setting up the Jonestown facility andmanaging the administrative and financial matters of the church both in theStates and, eventually, in Guyana. Her brother, Larry, was just as deeplyinvolved and was part of the security force that guarded the Jonestown complex,a security force that was more like a troop of prison guards than a defensivearmy to protect the members from outside hostilities.By that time, it was hard to tell the difference between Jonestown as be-leagured commune and Jonestown as stalag. Jones had become increasingly paranoidabout government intervention. His socialist rants from the pulpit of thePeoples Temple church in Ukiah and, later, in San Francisco became increasinglyfull of dire warnings about the doom facing America and the coming race war thatwould target groups like the Peoples Temple and its followers. Like any goodmember of the Disciples of Christ, Jones’ view of the late twentieth century wasapocalyptic.There would be a conflagration, perhaps a nuclear war, and only those he managedto save would survive the holocaust. Jones’ vision of an imminent race war waseerily similar to Manson’s. One could say they were on either side of the sameargument: Jones (ostensibly) wanted to preserve the black people of America andManson wanted them destroyed. Both, however, saw race war as inevitable. Whenthe dust cleared, however, Manson had killed only white people (with anattempted murder on one black drug dealer); Jones had killed hundreds of blackpeople in Jonestown.In March of 1976, Jones was appointed to the San Francisco Human RightsCommission, a reprise of his role with the Indiana Human Rights Commission inthe early 1960s. In September of that year, there was a testimonial dinner inhis honor that was attended by San Francisco Mayor George Moscone, Lt. Governorof California Mervyn Dymally, Angela Davis, Eldridge Cleaver, and many otherluminaries.His popularity and importance were such that by March of 1977 he was sharing atable with First Lady Rosalyn Carter at the Democratic Conven- tion Dinner,after having met in previous months with President-elect Jimmy Carter’stransition team and Vice President-elect Walter Mondale. Suddenly, Jim Jones wasa force to be reckoned with in California state politics, and therefore at thenational level as well.And this publicity attracted some unwelcome attention from the media.THE POLITICS OF THE FAMILYIn October 1976, a month before the US presidential election that would putJimmy Carter in the White House, a man named Bob Houston decided he would leavethe Peoples Temple. He wrote a letter of resignation to Jim Jones on October3rd. On October 5th, he was dead.He was not the first victim, and certainly would not be the last. Jim Jonesexceeded even Charles Manson in sheer brutality and convoluted, complexmind-control games. Like Manson, he retreated from society with a band offollowers. In Manson’s case, it was to the desert; in Jones’ case, it was to thejungle. Both had millennial expectations. Both could not countenance defectionfrom the “Family”; such disloyalty was punishable by death.The ‘family’ becomes a medium to link its members, whose links with one anothermay otherwise be very attenuated. A crisis will occur if any member of thefamily wishes to leave by getting the ‘family’ out of his system, or dissolvingthe ‘family’ in himself. Within the family, the ‘family’ may be felt as thewhole world. To destroy the ‘family’ may be experienced as worse than murder ormore selfish than suicide.—R. D. Laing, The Politics of the Family, 1969In the 1960s, the writings of Scottish psychiatrist R. D. Laing became verypopular with alternative mental-health-care professionals, people who felt—likeLaing—that perhaps schizophrenia was more a spiritual state than an actualillness or disease, and could be treated with metaphysics rather than electro-shock and lobotomies. His seminal work, The Politics of Experience, could befound on many a bookshelf in college dorms and hippie communes. His moreclinical work, such as The Divided Self, Self and Others and The Politics of theFamily, reinforced the message of political liberation through spiritual libera-tion, of mental health through spiritual health. Laing focused on the family asthe origin of most mental problems as well as most social problems, and in thishe was not much different from Freud and generations of social workers. Laing,however, took the argument to a different level and used his findings inclinical psychiatry to extrapolate a larger vision. To Laing, schizophrenia wasnot necessarily a break-down, it could also be a “break-through.”Laing’s work was attacked, predictably, by other psychiatrists who felt thatschizophrenia was not a metaphysical playground but a serious and debilitat- ingmental illness whose only hope of a cure was through surgery—the dreadlobotomy—or electroshock, or drugs. When chemical imbalances were found to be atthe heart of schizophrenia and thus the disease could be treated with chemicalsthat would redress the imbalances, Laing’s theories were abandoned as so muchquaint hippie furniture from the sixties.However, Laing’s basic premise was not necessarily invalidated by the discov-ery that there exists a link between chemicals and mental states. After all, theCIA had spent millions in an effort to clearly define the relationship betweenhallucinogens and consciousness. Science, however, preferred to believe thatthere was a direct cause and effect relationship between chemical imbalance andmental illness: the technological approach was to use chemicals to create anartificial balance wherein the illness would disappear. For Laing, this was justanother form of lobotomy. It did not speak to the spiritual imbalance that hadcaused the illness in the first place—it treated the symptom and not thecause—and by using drugs to create the illusion of psychic integration, onemerely swept the core problem under the rug. But the mechanistic approach topsychiatry and psychotherapy—demanded by a mental health profession which feltthat psychology should be as “scientific” as possible—meant that more holistictheories would be abandoned in favor of chemical, surgical and electroconvulsivetherapies.The methodology of Jim Jones—both at the Peoples Temple in Ukiah and SanFrancisco and especially at Jonestown—was a combination of both approaches.Religion is, after all, a close cousin to psychotherapy and psy- chology ingeneral. Like Manson, Jones had his “family.” The followers were to call him“Father,” not like the Catholic custom of referring to all priests as “Father,”but in a more intimate way. Only Jones could be called “Father” at the PeoplesTemple. All the members were his virtual children, and they demonstrated this intheir submissive and dependent attitude towards him. And whenever any of themwished to “defect”—that is, simply leave the church—it was considered tantamountto an act of betrayal against Father and against the entire Family.Jones used psychodrama extensively in his dealings with subordinates and themembers of his congregation, a psychodrama composed of equal measures offire-and-brimstone sermonizing, sexual politics, public humiliation, and—it isbelieved—drugs. The pharmacy at Jonestown was heavily weighted in favor ofnarcotics and psychoactive compounds, and it is not clear to what extent thesedrugs were used in the everyday life of the commune. As for sex, Jonesconstantly complained of his continuous need for sex, and would enlist as manywomen as he could in his sexual stable. He would then ridicule the sexual livesof his male followers, and insist that all men but him were basi- callyhomosexual.He would control the sex lives of the members of the Peoples Temple, andarranged marriages between couples who were then not allowed to have sex. Hewould demand that wives complain publicly about the lack of sexual performanceor prowess of their husbands, while demanding as well that they praise Jim Jonesin that department. In other words, it was Mansonism writ large and, ifpossible, even uglier. Ostensibly, the rationale behind all of this was thespiritual liberation of his followers. In fact, the clever use of thesetechniques ensured not the liberation of his awe-struck congregation but theirnear-total enslavement.Ed Sanders, in his book about Charles Manson and the Family, stated that if thePentagon ever formulated the Manson Secret, the world would be in trouble. Onewonders if Jonestown was an example of such a formula: a white man, with murkyintelligence connections and political activity in Latin America and theCaribbean during the sixties, becomes the leader of a large black congregationand orders them all to their deaths. If this had been in a novel, it would havebeen dismissed as unbelievable.Soon, the press began to get wind of the weird circumstances surrounding thePeoples Temple. Any organization that powerful in state politics would certainlycome under scrutiny, and it was only a matter of time before the newspapers andmagazines began to do exposés of life at the church. This situation wasexacerbated by the defection of several church members and their opendiscussions with the media. This, coupled with the FBI raid on Scientologyoffices when it was discovered that the Scientologists were infil- trating thegovernment and spying on government agents, made Jim Jones increasingly paranoidabout a government raid on the Peoples Temple, which he painted in terms of thefascists attacking the socialists.In the 1970s, this was a distinct possibility. On January 22, 1974 GovernorRonald Reagan of California, in his State of the State message, announced plansfor the creation of a “violence center” to study the causes and cure of violenceamong youth, minorities, etc. The plan was to use an abandoned nuclear weaponstest site in the Santa Monica mountains; although it was conveniently close toLos Angeles, it was also remote from populated areas, hard to reach, guarded bybarbed wire fences and secure buildings, and con- sidered an excellent site forthe type of research Reagan was intending to carry out. This did notmaterialize, mostly due to public outcry over the very idea of a secretgovernment center to study violence as divorced from the social conditions thatcontribute to violence, such as poverty, lack of education, etc. Many peoplefeared—rightly or wrongly—that the center would be used to develop a moreefficient and more oppressive security apparatus in the state where the LosAngeles Police Department already had a reputation for a harsh and swiftresponse to crime, particularly minority crime. This was coming at a time whenthe Watergate hearings were reinforcing a negative view of governmentinterference in domestic life, interference that would be escalated once Reaganbecame President in 1981.At the same time, California Congressman Leo J. Ryan was making a name forhimself as a government watchdog. He had co-authored the Hughes-Ryan Amendment,which required the CIA to get prior approval from Congress before undertakingany covert activity. In addition, he was asking questions about the CIA’smind-control projects in the State of California, as he won- dered whether ornot the notorious members of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) had been thewilling or unwilling beneficiaries of the MK-ULTRA program while serving time atVacaville.The SLA was a bizarre revolutionary militant group, whose claim to fame was thekidnapping of publishing heiress Patty Hearst on February 4, 1974 only a fewweeks after Reagan’s controversial “violence center” announcement, and it hasbeen a favorite subject of conspiracy theorists for decades, who believe thatthe SLA was a front for a domestic CIA operation. The mere fact of thekidnapping itself, with Patty Hearst being subjected to brainwashing by the SLAcadres and then sent out to help them rob a bank, was headline- grabbing newsfor weeks, even though many people could not understand what it all represented.She had been blindfolded and subject to sensory deprivation, held in a closet,and raped by her captors: circumstances familiar to political prisoners all overthe globe and particularly in the Latin American nations where men like DanMitrione trained the security forces. When Patty Hearst was finally freed shewas put on trial for armed robbery as if she were legally culpable, a subject onwhich many psychiatrists disagreed passionately. It brought many of the old CIAmind-control experts out of the woodwork, although they were not necessarilyadvertised as such. Dr. William Sargant, who was a friend of Dr. Frank Olson andwho advised the British intelligence agencies on inter- rogation andbrainwashing techniques, was one of those who examined Patty Hearst, as was Dr.Martin Orne and Dr. Robert Jay Lifton, the latter an expert on Chinesemind-control techniques.Much was happening between 1973 and 1975. Donald DeFreeze, the com- mander ofthe SLA, had earlier been a prisoner at the Vacaville facility that was used bythe CIA as part of their mind-control experimentation program. At Vacaville, anorganization was set up to raise black consciousness—the Black CulturalAssociation, or BCA—which was under the direction of Pro- fessor ColstonWestbrook. Westbrook has since been identified as a former intelligence officerwho served in the Far East during the 1960s and, in fact, worked for AID—thesame agency that provided cover for Dan Mitrione and, perhaps, Jim Jones inBrazil—during the same years that Mitrione was with them. It is tantalizing tospeculate about a handoff of Jones from Mitrione to Westbrook; or perhaps afterthe murder of Mitrione, Westbrook simply picked up where he had left off. Weknow now that Jones spent time at the Langley-Porter Neuropsychiatric Instituteduring the 1960s and 1970s; Westbrook had been a psychological warfare officerin Vietnam, Japan and Korea. At Vacaville, he may have been involved in theMK-ULTRA testing and manipulation of violent inmates. Therefore there may beconnections between these men, but Jones is dead and Westbrook isn’t talking.What is more stimulating in terms of bizarre synchronicities is the fact thatfour members of the SLA had come to Berkeley from Bloomington, Indiana. (The SLAnever had more than a few dozen members at its height.) Emily and Bill Harrisand Angela and Gary Atwood had been students at the Uni- versity of Indiana,just as Jim Jones had been almost twenty years earlier. And they wound up inBerkeley—a suburb of San Francisco—at about the same time that Jones wasshifting his attention away from Ukiah and towards San Francisco, where he had alarge and enthusiastic congregation. (He bought an old synagogue on Geary Streetin late 1972, and moved his operational headquarters there in 1975.) Jones washeavily involved in black liberation politics (witness his relationship withAngela Davis and Eldridge Cleaver), and the SLA was allegedly a black liberationarmy. There is no way that they would have been unaware of each other in SanFrancisco in 1973. Jones was too prominent, for one thing. He was active instate and local politics. His church was a magnet for black people, and hepreached a boisterous revolution- ary, socialist and anti-racist platform. Inaddition, his members were actively involved in mental hospitals and otherhealth-care institutions in California, working as volunteers or as paidemployees.After the nineteen-year-old Patty Hearst was kidnapped on February 4, 1974, byApril 15 she had become “Tania” (named after Che Guevara’s lover) and had joinedthe SLA. She is photographed in a beret and holding a rifle during the robberyof a bank in San Francisco by the SLA. The public’s con- fusion over thisbizarre change in Hearst’s status could find only one possible solution: PattyHearst had been brainwashed. Pundits appeared on television talking about“Stockholm Syndrome,” the identification of a victim with his or her captorsafter a prolonged period in their custody. The young, conser- vative heiressmust have been programmed to participate in these acts; there could be no otherexplanation.The police were mobilized in an intensive manhunt to find the SLA and bring themto justice. No one who was in front of a television will ever forget the day inMay when SWAT teams destroyed a house in such an intensive storm of gunfire thatthe building collapsed in flames. Six members of the SLA—including DonaldDeFreeze, their leader known as “Cinque”—were killed in the conflagration. PattyHearst and Bill and Emily Harris were not in the building at the time. The May17, 1974 attack was criticized by some members of the press, especially when itbecame obvious that the inhabitants of the house—and of surrounding buildings,some of which were damaged in the fire—were given little opportunity to evacuateor surrender. If Patty Hearst had been in the building at the time—somethingwhich the SWAT team presumably did not know—she would have been killed with allthe rest, and the story of her captivity and “brainwashing” would have been lostforever.However, on September 18, 1975—more than a year after the SWAT at- tack and morethan eighteen months after her kidnapping—Patty Hearst was found and captured bythe FBI in San Francisco. She would be convicted of the armed bank robbery, eventhough specialists insisted on the obvious: that she was mentally conditioned byher captors and forced to adopt an alternate identity. She had even fallen inlove with one of her captors, Willie Wolfe, also known as “Cujo.” Wolfe had diedin the SWAT attack.In January 1979, President Jimmy Carter commuted Patty Hearst’s sen- tence andshe was released from prison. She served twenty-one months of a seven-yearsentence. In January 2001 she was pardoned by President Clinton as one of hislast official acts as President.The existence and actions of the SLA are so strange, and so illogical, and soout of context that the organization has been subject to the full-court press ofthe conspiracy theorists. The leader of the SLA—Donald DeFreeze, or “Cinque”—wasblack. Virtually everyone else in the SLA was white. (This is a mirror-image ofthe Peoples Temple, where the leader was white and the congregation black.) Thegroup was believed to be Maoist, but the evidence for this was flimsy. Further,they claimed responsibility for the murder of Dr. Marcus Foster—Superintendentof the Oakland school system—in 1973 … by two white men who had used makeupduring the commission of the crime, making themselves look black. This attemptto incite a race riot had been prefigured, of course, by the Manson Familyattacks on the Tate and LaBianca households in 1969.DeFreeze himself was a police informant who spent very little time in prison,even though he had a record of arms-dealing, among other felonies. When he leftprison, he simply walked out, leading many to assume that his escape was aninside job. This was after prolonged contact with known intelligence officerColston Westbrook. Although the SLA was painted in the worst possible colors asa violent revolutionary group, their record as violent revolutionaries is ratherweak. They make so many mistakes, and reveal themselves to so many people duringthe course of their life “in hiding,” losing large quantities of arms andammunition at various poorly-disguised safe houses, that it is possible to viewtheir actions as those of agents provocateurs and not as genuinerevolutionaries. At one point they even hijack a car and driver, drive aroundfor a few hours introducing themselves, and then let the driver free: actionsreminiscent of the life of Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the Kennedy assassination,where he was seen in used-car lots talking about killing Kennedy, and then at arifle range doing the same.Congressman Ryan may have been getting a little too close to the truth when hedemanded that the CIA inform him of any relationship between Don- ald DeFreezeand MK-ULTRA. They responded in writing to his office on October of 1978,stating that there had been no connection that they could find (remember, mostof the documents had been shredded long before). The wording is a perfectexample of a typical CIA response and is worth quoting at length:Dear Mr. Ryan:Thank you for your letter of 27 September to Admiral Turner requestingconfirmation or denial of the fact of CIA experiments using prisoners at theCalifornia medical facility at Vacaville. It is true that CIA sponsored testing,using volunteer inmates, was conducted at that facility. The project wascompleted in 1968.… Your letter referred to Donald DeFreese [sic], known asCINQUE, and Clifford Jefferson, both of whom were inmates at Vacaville. In sofar as our records reflect the names of the participants, there is nothing toindicate that either was in any way involved in the project.The letter was date-stamped “18 Oct 1978,” and bore the signature stamp of FrankC. Carlucci.32There are several points worth mentioning about this “non-denial denial” (asthey used to say at the Washington Post during the Watergate investiga- tion).The first is the misspelling of Donald DeFreeze’s name, which—as any lawyerknows—is a way to cover one’s ass in the event that the denial is proved false.It means that there was no one at the facility being tested who bore the name“Donald DeFreese.” The CIA has used this tactic before. Yet, let us allow thatit was an honest mistake, a typographical error by a typist. Then there is thequestion of “our records.”In the first place, the key MK-ULTRA records, of which the Vacaville experimentswould have been a part, were all destroyed in 1973 (except for four boxes ofaccounting and bookkeeping records). So, the CIA had no records of it at all. Inthe second place, the letter is very careful to hedge even further: “In so faras our records reflect the names of the participants,” Very clever, consideringthat in all likelihood no records existed and, anyway, the name of DeFreeze wasmisspelled.Then there is the statement by future-CIA Director Carlucci that the projectwhich had drawn Congressman Ryan’s scrutiny “was completed in 1968.” DeFreezedid not become an inmate at Vacaville until 1969. Thus, we are left with thedistinct impression that the CIA had nothing to do with DeFreeze. But, from 1970on, DeFreeze was in twice-weekly contact with Colston Westbrook, formerintelligence officer under AID cover, psycho- logical warfare officer, andVietnam veteran, who created and ran the Black Cultural Association at thefacility. By running an operation at the prison at arm’s length, the CIA hadwhat is known as “plausible deniability.” When DeFreeze was being sought bypolice during the SLA fiasco, he repeatedly warned that Westbrook was a CIAofficer, but his warnings were taken as the ramblings of a deranged Communistand black revolutionary, and few paid his charges any attention.A month to the day after he received his non-denial denial from the CIA,Congressman Ryan was dead on the ground at Port Kaituma, Guyana.It wasn’t only a suspicion about CIA activity in California that bothered Ryan,however. The son of an old friend of his had died under mysterious cir-cumstances, and his friend had pleaded with him to look into it. His friend wasa well-known press photographer, Robert “Sammy” Houston. His son, Bob Houston,Jr. had died two days after resigning from the Peoples Temple.Here is another case of Jim Jones deciding that his married followers shoulddivorce. He “assigned” Joyce Shaw to marry Bob after the Jones-initiated breakupof his first marriage. Bob married her at Jones’ urging, and they set up one ofseveral foster homes run by the Peoples Temple, which took care of twentychildren in addition to Bob’s own two kids. But, according to Thomas Layton’sbook about Jonestown, Bob Houston asked too many “probing questions” and wassubject to brutal beatings in the famous Peoples Temple boxing matches.33The boxing matches were one way Jones controlled his flock through physicalpunishment and fear. An accused person had to stand passively in the ring as oneof Jones’ lieutenants beat them. The accused was not permitted to defendhimself. Bob Houston evidently suffered through more than one of these in orderto show his loyalty to the Temple and specifically to Jim Jones, but it wasn’tenough. Houston worked two jobs to support his family and to send two thousanddollars every month to the Peoples Temple. Two thousand dollars a month in 1976wasn’t a bad donation; on the contrary, it was serious money. The questions BobHouston was raising, however, were putting them all in jeopardy.The press had already been critical of the Peoples Temple in 1972. LesterKinsolving was a reporter (as well as a minister) who investigated the PeoplesTemple, and although the worst thing about his article was probably the ob-servation that a number of Temple employees carried firearms, his newspaper waspicketed by Temple members and a mail-in campaign was organized by Temple staffto smear Kinsolving and have him run out of town.34In another case, journalist George Klineman was meeting with Temple defectors,and the Temple decided to spy on him to the extent of tunneling under his houseand listening to his conversations.35Thus, the last thing the Temple needed was Bob Houston free and at large andtalking to the press. His own father worked for Associated Press, and that onefact was probably enough to incite the Temple leaders when they received hisletter formally announcing his resignation. He worked a second job as aswitchman on the railroad, and his mangled body was found the next day on thetracks.36 Then his father went to his friend Congressman Ryan and asked for hishelp in getting to the bottom of the case. It was another episode in the growingchorus of voices complaining about the conditions at the Peoples Temple.Deborah Layton was initiated into some of the worst excesses, including havingbeen raped by Jim Jones three times in 1976 during the course of her employmentat the Temple, even at one point acquiring a sexually transmit- ted disease. Tocomplete the humiliation, she was singled out by Jones in one public meeting asone of those who had had sex with him. In addition, Jones revealed that he hadalso had sex with Karen Layton, the woman Larry Layton, Jr.—Deborah’sbrother—had taken to wife at Jones’ urging. He had done so, he said, becauseLarry Layton (like all other men) was really homo- sexual and could not satisfyhis wife the way Jim Jones could. Further, part of this public humiliationritual was the insistence that all of the women who had had sex with Jim Joneshad approached him, not the other way around, and that Jones was simply beingkind and generous to them by relenting to their sexual desires.37It was in that same year of 1976 that Jones began to expatriate the Temple fundsto banks in Panama and Switzerland, using Deborah Layton as one of theadministrators of these funds and as a courier. He had simply been amassing toomuch wealth—he had one hundred thousand dollars in cash in a safe at the Templeto cover “incidental expenses”38– and he was getting thousands of dollars ofcash donations every week, in addition to members’ Social Security checks andreal estate that was signed over to the Temple.Deborah Layton made several trips over the course of a year or so to theseforeign banks, setting up accounts and depositing cash. Thus, when the dust hadcleared after the Jonestown massacre, one of her tasks was helping govern- mentofficials locate and seize the millions of dollars in those accounts.Jones had made another trip to Guyana in 1973,39 and was seriously con- sideringmoving his congregation there, where he would be free from both press and legalscrutiny. By 1976, he had already leased nearly four thousand acres of land fromthe Guyanese government, and Temple members were down there clearing the landand getting ready for a major influx of Americans.No one knows exactly why Jones chose that particular site. Its location close tothe Venezuelan border—a hotly contested area by both countries, by the way—issuggestive of a hidden agenda. Some commentators believe that having more thanone thousand Americans living so close to the border would blunt Venezuelanmilitary action to take that land for itself. Others, including the presentauthor, believe that he was simply being smart: having his settlement close toanother international boundary meant that, in the event of a problem with theGuyanese government, he could quickly be safely inside Venezuelan territory.This was the same strategy employed by fugitive Nazi Paul Schaefer, who set uphis notorious Colonia Dignidad on the Chilean border with Argentina, and mayhave used his colony’s proximity to Argentina to make his escape when theChilean authorities finally raided the estate in the 1990s. Colonia Dignidad wasanother “religious” community with a political agenda (it had been used as atorture and interrogation center by the Chilean secret police during theoverthrow of President Salvador Allende in 1973), was completely populated byGerman citizens (as Jonestown was by American citizens), was run by a ministerof religion who was also a sexual sadist, etc. In both cases, orphaned childrenand foster children were exported to the colonies, and financial subsidiesderived from their respective governments. In both cases, the colonies hadshortwave radio communications with their offices in the country’s capitols.Those offices were used by members to influence govern- ment officials, and, inthe case of Jonestown, one Temple member was ordered to become the paramour of aGuyanese government official. And on and on. The parallels are almost toonumerous to mention.Yet another disturbing coincidence lies in the fact that the site chosen byJones was in the Northwest District of Guyana, the same place where—in 1845—aReverend Smith called together the local Native American population (includingthe Arawaks, Tituba’s countrymen), and told them the Millennium was at hand.When it did not materialize, Smith’s four hundred followers committed masssuicide on the spot, believing they would be resurrected as “white people.”40The parallels to the Jonestown event are too strong to be ignored.We can, of course, choose to categorize this uncanny synchronicity as “merecoincidence,” as if the mass suicide of four hundred in 1845 and the mass murderof nine hundred in 1978 should be reduced to a scientific curiosity at best, ora scientific absurdity at worst. However, as we have noted before, in historythere are documents … and there is blood. And as the fictitious detectiveSherlock Holmes remarked in his very first appearance—in a story aboutMormonism, no less, and secret societies and cult homicide—there is a scarletthread of murder running through the tapestry of life. It runs among the Indianmounds of Charles Manson’s hometown, Ashland, Kentucky, and the mounds ofChillicothe, Ohio and Moundsville, West Virginia, familiar to the inmates of theprisons built on those sites, people like serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, as wellas Manson himself and Lynette Fromme. It runs to the doomed jungles of Guyana,where the Arawak faithful went willingly to their deaths a century before ninehundred Americans did likewise. Blood cries out to blood, and history repeatsitself.America had first learned in some detail of the CIA’s domestic spying program aswell as its mind-control projects in 1975. The information was provided by theRockefeller Commission Report, published in June of that year, and evidencepresented in that report rang alarm bells in the home of the Olson family, asthey recognized the facts surrounding the death of Frank Olson and learned, forthe first time, of his unwitting participation in an LSD experiment being run bySidney Gottlieb. This was also the year that Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme attemptedthe assassination of President Gerald Ford, leading everyone to agree that theManson Family was still armed and dangerous, and abroad in the land.By June 1977, things were getting too hot for Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple.New West magazine was preparing an exposé of the Temple, and Jones began topanic. Complaints started to trickle in to government offices in Californiaabout the church and its bizarre practices. Important Temple members—such asAssistant District Attorney Tim Stoen—began to “defect,” and to tell theirstories to the media and to the authorities. The word “cult” was being used, and“brainwashing,” and people became suspicious and fear- ful. Jones finally fledto Guyana himself on July 13, 1977, leaving trusted members like Deborah Laytonin charge of things (especially the money) in the States.THE RETURN OF THE NATIVEDeborah’s mother, Lisa Philip Layton, had decided to join the Peoples Templesometime in 1973 after attending one late-night meeting there at the SanFrancisco Temple with her daughter Deborah. This veteran of Nazi Germany foundsomething comforting and uplifting about Jim Jones and the raucous Templeservices, and soon began making the long trip to the Los Angeles congregationthree times a week.41 This developed into a kind of devotion or even fanaticism,and by November 1974 she had moved out of her home with her husband, Dr. Layton,and asked him for a divorce.42As her involvement with the Peoples Temple grew, so did her paranoia. The Templewas fearful of secret government action against it, or so Jones liked to claim.The postulation of a hostile outside force—whether one ex- ists or not—is auseful tool for binding the members of any group together, and as the Templegrew in power in the seventies, so did its paranoia. Lisa Philip Layton hadreason to fear this type of intervention, however, because she had witnessed itin Nazi Germany; and then there had been the suicide of her mother in New YorkCity, a death attributed to Anita Philip’s fear of what she felt was some sortof secret police investigation. By working with the predominantly blackcongregations of the Peoples Temple, Lisa Layton felt herself identifying withtheir oppression as well as becoming accepted and even loved. She began to adoptJones’ beliefs and fears as her own. She thought she could identify who was aCIA “plant” at the Temple.43 And she put her money where her mouth was. When herdivorce had become final, she donated something like three hundred thousanddollars to the Peoples Temple, a very large sum in those days.44Thus, when the opportunity arose for her to travel to Guyana and live in theworkers’ paradise that was Jonestown, she was eager to do so and traveled therewith her daughter Deborah in late 1977, arriving in Georgetown on December 7 andin Jonestown itself on December 14. It was then that both women began toexperience the dreadful living conditions and draconian “security” measures thatdominated Temple life.Deborah was sent to work in the fields for six weeks, a grueling andimpossibleregimen in the jungle, subject to insects, venomous snakes, sunstroke,dehydration and overwork. The Temple members lived on rice and beans, and alittle water (depending on the rainfall). It was, essentially,concentration-camp living, with the ever-present security forces alert to anydeviation from the fixed routine, any complaint, no matter how reasonable or howminor. For infractions, one could be imprisoned in “the box” for extendedperiods of time, fed on a liquid diet—with vital signs monitored daily to ensurethat the inmate was still alive—and subjected to interrogation by the securityteam until they were satisfied that the inmate was giving the correct answers.Children were subject to even worse treatment, taken to a well at the bottom ofwhich two adults would be hiding in the water, waiting to grab the unfortunatechild’s legs and drag him or her under the surface of the brackish water. Aftera long session of that, the child would be allowed to return to the surface, andthen would have to walk all the way back to the compound through the jungle,repeating over and over, “I’m sorry, Father.”Eventually, once the medical center had been built and enlarged, trouble- somemembers would be imprisoned there and drugged heavily until theiranti-revolutionary attitudes had been adjusted. The pharmacy at Jonestowncontained Thorazine, as well as “Quaaludes, Demerol, Seconal, Valium, Nembutal,morphine—enough to fill the ordinary needs of a city of sixty-five thousandpeople.” 45Another source records that large quantities of Haldol and Mellarilin liquid form were being shipped to Jonestown. 46Normally, these would be takenin pill form. The liquid form could be used for injections, which is a rare wayto administer these drugs, or, more significantly, as a means to give the drugto people without their knowledge. All this pharmacopoeia was for a commune thatnever numbered more than twelve hundred souls.The question of whether or not there were other drugs present at Jon-estown—hallucinogens and other psychoactive substances useful in mind- controlexperiments—has never been satisfactorily answered. However, the drugs of whichwe are aware could readily be used in behavior modification treatments, whichthey obviously were.By 1977, Jones had yet another problem on his hands. His former assistantpastor, Timothy Stoen, the Assistant District Attorney, had defected. First togo was his wife, who left the Temple, separated from her husband, and claimedcustody of their four-year-old son. Eventually, Tim Stoen also left the Temple,but by that time their son was in Jonestown. The Stoens fought Jones for custodyof their child, and this was another legal nightmare for Jones, who claimed thathe had fathered the child himself.When the Supreme Court ruled in the Stoens’ favor, demanding the ex- traditionof the boy, Jones went ballistic and threatened—not for the first time—that hisentire community would commit mass suicide if the Guyanese government acceded tothe extradition demand. In a panic, Temple lawyers and other spokespeople in theStates began phoning everyone they thought could help in this situation, andTemple attorney Charles Garry arranged a phone call to Jones from Angela Davis,Huey Newton and American Indian activist Dennis Banks to beg him to reconsider.At the same time, the wife of the Guyanese ambassador to the United States wasreached—oddly enough, in Indiana where she was visiting a friend—and when thedust had cleared, the Guyanese government had bowed to the pressure from Jones,and the extradition proceedings were delayed.Perhaps not surprisingly, the example of Jim Jones’ news reports to Jon- estownprovides one of the strongest arguments against government man- agement of thepress. Loudspeakers were set up all over the settlement, like something out ofM*A*S*H. They would go on at any time, day or night, and Jones would regale hiscaptive audience with the details of the latest book he was reading, or newsreports from journals and magazines he supposedly had in his cabin. No one wasallowed to see these publications, of course. During these readings, he wouldinform his people that—for instance—Los Angeles was being evacuated due todrought and famine, or that the Klan was on the rampage, killing black people orenslaving them in camps. The people of Jonestown—having absolutely no access tothe outside world in any way, shape or form—were reduced to either believingJones’ accounts and thank- ing God they were safe in the jungles of Guyana, orin disbelieving them and keeping that dangerous secret to themselves.Suicide practice runs became frequent in the last years. At that point, with sofew calories in their diet, a heavy workload of clearing jungle and rais- ingsome pitiful crops, and the constant loudspeaker harangues and forcedmarches—and worse—of the security staff, some people actually became indifferentto whether they lived or died. While romantic relationships were frowned uponunless encouraged or approved by Jones and sex was considered“counterrevolutionary,” suicide itself was considered a revolutionary act byJones, and he told his followers that they would be reincarnated in a betterworld. This was essentially the same rationale given to me by an American Nazi,who defended the genocide of the Jews and the Gypsies by claiming that—sincethere would be no more Jewish or Gypsy bodies after they were all killed—theywould have to be reincarnated as Aryans. And of course Reverend Smith, more thana hundred years earlier, had told his Amerindian follow- ers in Guyana that ifthey committed suicide, they would be reincarnated as white people. And so itgoes.A US State Department officer, Frank Tumminia, visited Guyana in 1978 and made areport, saying that the communards appeared “drugged and robot- like in theirreactions to questions and, generally, in their behavior towards us visitors.”47Officials visiting as late as November 1978, however, had no such observationsand came away thinking everything there was just fine.But back in December 1977, after a week in Jonestown, Deborah Layton had madeplans to escape. She took the opportunity of a planned cultural program inGeorgetown in March 1978, and she managed to stay in Guyana’s capitol until shecould arrange her return back to the United States. In the meantime, the Templestaff in Georgetown was told to approach the Soviet Embassy and try to getpermission for the entire Jonestown population to emigrate to Russia. DeborahLayton was involved with this maneuver, which did not result in anyone actuallygoing to Russia, but was part of an ongoing set of negotiations opened by Joneswith both Russia and, to some extent, Cuba. The Russians, naturally, were alittle leery of accepting the twelve hun- dred or so Americans, aboutseventy-five percent of whom were black—not a common racial group in Russia.By the middle of May, Deborah—in a series of cloak-and-dagger moves to evadeTemple members, and one false start due to documentation prob- lems—managed toget into an Embassy car and get taken to the airport for her trip back to theStates. Her brother, Larry Layton, was still in the US, and Deborah tried towarn him not to go down to Guyana if called. His sister, Annalisa, made awarning phone call, and Larry replied he was not planning to go anywhere; buthis mood was cool.He then went to his father’s house, dressed in his hospital uniform, and mowedthe lawn. He appeared to be in a drugged state, although these would not havebeen recreational drugs at this time, since Larry had become a de- voted memberof the Peoples Temple, even if he had slacked off considerably during Jones’absence. Then, still dressed in his hospital uniform, he dove into the swimmingpool.His father, Dr. Layton, was just about to take some action, fearing that his sonhad gone over the edge, when the phone rang. It was for Larry. Larry got out ofthe pool and answered the phone. He listened. He hung up. He left immediately.And was on a plane bound for Guyana that night.A WATERGATE OF THE CULTSTim Stoen encouraged her to make her information public; he felt that her storywould be the beginning of a “Watergate of the cults.”—Min S. Yee & Thomas N. Layton, In My Father’s House48Religion, like Watergate, is a scandal that will not go away.—Victor Turner49Deborah Layton began working very hard to raise some awareness of what washappening in Jonestown. She knew that Jones’ constant threats of mass suicidewere not merely empty attempts to win sympathy or support for his plight, butcould very possibly turn deadly in a heartbeat. She became the focal point fordefectors and for people who had family living in Jonestown. She appeared in thepress, wrote letters to government officials, and lobbied everyone who couldhave any impact at all on the escalating tensions in Guyana. Her mother wasstill down there, very sick, and she feared for her life and for the lives ofher friends. Even her estranged husband, Phil Blakey—a man she met when she wasat the Quaker school in England, and with whom she was never able to have agenuine married relationship, due to the Temple—was still there, working in thefields.When she spoke with ADA Tim Stoen, he urged her to go public with everything sheknew. She was, after all, one of the trusted members of the Peoples Temple (orhad been) and knew about the money laundering, the psychodramas, the phonycancer cures, the raising from the dead, the revolutionary speeches, theattempts to flee to Russia … her story would open a can of worms that wouldreach back into other cults. It would be the beginning, said Stoen, of a“Watergate of the cults.”Not much was made of that statement at the time; it was probably considered abit of hyperbole on Stoen’s part. The nation, after all, was still “wallowing inWatergate,” and there were congressional and senate committees every year onsome aspect of government corruption or secret government operations. Therevelations were coming fast and furious. Tim Stoen—a dis- trict attorney, afterall, and an intimate of the Peoples Temple—evidently felt that the informationDeborah Layton had in her possession would start an important enquiry into theoperation of cults, an enquiry that would reveal much more about them than hadbeen ever suspected.Unfortunately, the “Watergate of the cults” that Stoen hypothesized never tookplace, because the events in Jonestown in November of 1978 were so hideous, andthe cover-up so complete, that no such “Templegate” ever trans- pired. Jonestownentered history as one of the western world’s great icons, a mystical portraitthat means different things to different people, painted by trained politicalmystics who knew the right amount of spin to employ (the same way Russian ikonpainters know how to apply gold leaf on the haloes of the saints), a hoodwinkthat would be used later to explain the ferocity of the attack on the BranchDavidian compound in Waco, Texas. What the western world learned in theaftermath of Jonestown was what it was intended to learn. A moral for the storywas ready and waiting in the wings.As Deborah Layton agitated for a full-scale investigation of Jonestown, JimJones was on the attack. He had invited veteran conspiracy theorist and attorneyMark Lane to Guyana, ostensibly to lecture on the life (and the assassination?)of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. But when he arrived back in the States after hisvisit to Jonestown, Lane immediately embarked on a legal campaign against the USgovernment over its alleged persecution of Jonestown, the Peoples Temple, andJim Jones. Jones’ paranoia about the CIA, FBI, IRS and other government agenciesfound a receptive ear in Mark Lane, whose work on the assassination of PresidentKennedy was well-known. It seems incredible that Lane would have visitedJonestown and not come away with serious misgivings about what was going onthere, but his visit was short—only a few days—and Jones typically rehearsed hiscongregation beforehand and created a festive atmosphere for guests, as he wouldwith the visit of Congressman Ryan in 1978. In addition, Mark Lane was first anat- torney, and one specializing in unpopular causes it would seem. The PeoplesTemple had deep pockets, and Lane could have been looking at this as any otherlegal gig. Who was he to argue with State Department officials who found nothingsinister in the Jonestown commune?And there might have been another element to the relationship. We know now, forinstance, of Jones’ involvement with people like Dan Mitrione, and of Jones’trips to Cuba and Guyana in the early 1960s, as well as of his mysteriouspsychiatric treatment at Langley-Porter. How much of this did he tell to MarkLane? How much of this did he spin in just the right way to indicate to Lanethat he was dealing with a very serious nexus of govern- ment mind control,political action and torture? How many hints did Jones drop of his priorexperience with intelligence operations? How much more did he promise Lane ifonly Lane could get the US government off his back long enough? There were bitsand pieces of an autobiography by Jones found among the wreckage of theJonestown settlement after the massacre. Was this a manuscript being preparedfor Mark Lane?This author finds it difficult to believe that Mark Lane would have gone so farout on a limb for Jim Jones after only one visit of a few days in Jon- estownunless he had found something very valuable there. Lane must have been thevictim of dozens of people laying their paranoid trips on him over theyears—especially after the publication in 1966 of his book on the Ken- nedyassassination, Rush to Judgment and of his subsequent work, A Citizen’s Dissent,published in 1975—people claiming to have inside information on theassassination of President Kennedy, or that of his brother, Bobby, or that ofMartin Luther King, or of any of a host of other scenarios. Why would he chooseto cast his lot, as it were, with Jim Jones, a paranoid fanatic in the middle ofthe jungle, as close to Joseph Conrad’s crazed character Kurtz in the Heart ofDarkness as any man alive?In the first place, money. We know, from the Thomas Layton book that Lane waspaid ten thousand dollars up front for his legal assistance in suing the USgovernment. The Peoples Temple had deep pockets; they were get- ting—in SocialSecurity payments alone—sixty-five thousand dollars a month mailed to Guyana.Very little of this money was actually spent in Guyana for the residents ofJonestown, who had to make do with the most primitive living conditionsimaginable, a near-starvation diet, and a heavy workload. The ten thousanddollars paid to Lane was probably only a down payment. The Peoples Temple couldturn into a cash cow.In the second place, revelations about CIA involvement in Latin Americanpolitics, secret police, and training in brutal interrogation techniques. Thelatter had already been the subject of several government investigations by thattime, however. Jones would have had to have had something more worthwhile thanthat, something juicier. If there was anything there, though, it never surfaced.Mark Lane has not published anything remotely explosive on the subject ofJonestown. It may be a case of attorney-client privilege … except that in thiscase his client is dead. So, what’s the story, Mark?Congressman Leo Ryan (D-CA) had also begun his own investigation of the PeoplesTemple. His friend’s son—Robert Houston—had been killed just at the time he wastrying to leave the church. That, coupled with new charges surfacing in thepress and in the form of petitions and letters being circulated by relatives ofthe Jonestown community, pushed the Peoples Temple to the forefront of Ryan’sconsciousness. He arranged a clandestine meeting with Deborah Layton and tapedher two-hour statement on the conditions at the Jonestown compound as well asher own involvement over the prior seven years. Former Temple members Al andDeanna Mertle were also busy organiz- ing and petitioning. Stories of childrensuffering at the Jonestown settlement and being held against their will—oragainst the will of their parents—were surfacing, and the heat was on thegovernment to do something before the situation got completely out of hand.Deborah Layton pressed her case on Congressman Ryan, insisting that there was avery real possibility of mass suicide in the jungle.Ryan was convinced that there was at least the possibility of disaster. Ahands-on type of politician—who had worked undercover for two weeks in aninner-city school district as a teacher, and had spent a week as an inmate inthe State’s prison system so he could understand the conditions first-hand—Ryanwas no stranger to dangerous situations. He made the arrangements to go toJonestown himself, and his secretary—filled with ominous presentiments ofdeath—urged the Congressman to make out his will before he left, as she wasdoing. A reporter who had interviewed Deborah Layton was convinced she waslying, making the whole thing up, and did not file a report on his interviewwith her concerning the situation in Jonestown.He took a bullet in the wrist and another in the arm at the Port Kaitumaairstrip.Ryan notified the Peoples Temple officially of his upcoming visit, whichprompted a response not from Jim Jones but from Mark Lane, now operating as theTemple’s attorney. Lane tried to get Ryan to change his schedule. At the time ofthe proposed visit, Mark Lane was in Washington, D.C., where he was working onthe Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination investiga- tion. An importantwitness to the events leading up to the assassination was a woman—GraceWalden—who had been institutionalized for mental illness after she insisted thatJames Earl Ray was not the gunman. She was the landlady of the apartment complexthat was used as the sniper’s nest, and she identified someone else entirely asthe shooter. Mark Lane was trying to get her story out in front of the HouseAssassinations Investigation Committee, but when he heard that Ryan had ignoredLane’s plea for rescheduling and was on his way to Jonestown, he droppedeverything—although he had worked on the King case for years, and had even takenthe steps to obtain legal custody of Ms. Walden from the mental hospital wherehe found her—and instead flew immediately to Guyana to intercept theCongressman’s party.What happened next is so well-known, and has been covered in so many books,articles and documentaries, that I will not waste the reader’s time with adetailed examination of the timeline leading up to the Jonestown massacre. Thereare a few salient points which should be viewed in context, however, and tothese we turn our attention.Congressman Ryan was held up in Georgetown for a few days, as Jim Jones hadrefused him and his party—which by now included newsmen and representatives ofthe “Concerned Relatives” group—until his attorneys Mark Lane and Charles Garrycould get to Guyana. Ryan had met with State Department officials in Washingtona few days before his visit, and had asked Deborah Layton to address them aswell. The State Department people professed to have no knowledge of Jonestown atall, and had nothing to contribute to the meeting.When Ryan arrived in Guyana, he met with the local US Embassy staff as well aswith the local office of the Peoples Temple. His patience wearing thin, heinformed the two Temple attorneys that he was chartering a plane and flying outto Port Kaituma whether or not Jim Jones approved. The lawyers made a hurriedradio call to Jonestown and convinced Jones to let the party come.An eighteen-seat chartered plane took the group to Port Kaituma, but they weremet by Temple members, who took only a handful of persons back with them,leaving the rest behind at the Port Kaituma airstrip. One of the membersaccompanying Ryan to Jonestown was Richard Dwyer.Dwyer’s involvement in this—and subsequent discoveries about his back- ground inintelligence—is one of the more suggestive elements of the whole saga. Dwyer wasa career intelligence officer, working under State Department cover at the USEmbassy in Georgetown. He was, according to several sources, the CIA Chief ofStation for Guyana. As such, he could be expected to have very good informationon Jonestown; unfortunately, he did not choose to share this information withRyan or his party. It was well-known in Georgetown that the Peoples Temple hadstrong influence with the Guyanese govern- ment; Temple women were expected todevelop personal relationships with Guyanese officials, and one such woman wasthe mistress of the Guyanese ambassador to the United States. Dwyer would havehad to have known all of this, as Georgetown is small as capitols go, a placewhere gossip is about the only entertainment there is. Further, as CIA stationchief, it would have been his business to know all about the Peoples Templepolitical involvements, not only with the Guyanese government but also with theSoviet Union and Cuba, as the Temple had approached both of thesecountries—through their embassies in Georgetown—as possible relocation sites.Yet, Dwyer—and the State Department in general—remained strangely silent on thesubject of the Peoples Temple and offered very little assistance to CongressmanRyan before and during his trip.Ryan managed to visit Jonestown, and during the course of his two days there wasapproached by several Temple families who asked him to take them with him backto the States. At one point, Ryan was attacked and held at knife point by one ofJones’ followers, who had to be restrained by Mark Lane and Charles Garry; itmade for a dismal end to the Congressman’s visit, and although Ryan had intendedto stay longer, the atmosphere had changed and discretion seemed the better partof valor.A truck was organized to take the Congressman’s party—plus anyone else whowanted to leave—back to the Port Kaituma airstrip. The truck began filling up.One of the “defectors” was Larry Layton. It was November 18, 1978.Remember that Larry was called back suddenly to Guyana after the defec- tion ofhis sister, Deborah. He had been sinking in his father’s swimming pool, dressedin his hospital X-Ray technician’s uniform when the phone call came. He left hisfather’s home at once and flew to Georgetown that evening.It is Larry Layton’s presence at Port Kaituma that is one of the more trou-bling aspects of the entire case. Larry had had problems growing up in theLayton household, but then many children of the sixties had problems with thegeneration gap: drugs, sex, and rock ’n’ roll were the pathways to a different,altered state of consciousness and political and social awareness. He marriedthe daughter of a minister, Carolyn Moore, and they both joined the PeoplesTemple and became intimately involved in the church hierarchy including thedread PC, or Planning Commission, which was really the “inner court” of theTemple, the place where Jones could rant and rave for hours on end aboutpolitics, metaphysics, and especially about sex. It was during those PCsessions—to which only the most devoted (or important) were invited—that Larrylost Carolyn to Jim Jones, and was instead “assigned” to Karen Tow. Carolynbecame a vociferous supporter of Jones and even bore him a son, Kimo. Larry andKaren, however, were not to have sex at all unless approved in advance by Jones.Instead, Larry was forced to make humiliating “confessions” of his homosexualityand of his homosexual attraction for Jones before the assembled throng of PCregulars.Larry Layton’s psychological and spiritual disintegration—begun years beforewith hallucinogens and religious yearnings—was exacerbated by the type ofpsychological mind games that Jones was playing. Jones after all was a religiousleader and a political leader of sorts; he held a captive audience in thePlanning Commission, whose meetings were usually held only at night and throughto the early hours of the morning, exhausting the participants, including attimes Jones himself, who was the only one allowed to eat and drink during themarathon sessions. Layton, like all the other PC attendants, had been worked onin a highly-charged, emotionally-draining controlled atmosphere. Jones was quiteaware of the effect that the isolation and insular- ity of the scene would haveon the psyches of his flock. He demonstrated this during a session in which ayoung boy was accused of stealing. Jones lightly drugged the boy, telling him hecould strike him dead. By the time the drug began to take effect, the boy wasquaking in fear. He was revived briefly, in the darkened church and to the soundof the other members of the congre- gation making terrifying sounds, as if theboy had descended to the very pit of hell. The boy was then “brought back fromthe dead” by Jones, and the traumatized child promised he would never commitanother crime in his life. This is the environment in which Larry Layton foundhimself.He became, in the terminology of Erich Fromm, a “true believer.”So, when the time came for the defectors to go back to the airstrip withCongressman Ryan, and Larry Layton hopped aboard the truck, the other defectorstried to warn the Congressman’s party that Layton was not a genuine defector andthat there would be problems. But, in the chaos of the leave-tak- ing, Larry wasbrought along to the airstrip with the others.Back in Jonestown, Jones knew that the end had come. He began to tell his flockthat the plane would explode in the sky; that the pilot would be killed by oneof the people who had gone to the airstrip. Thus, the plan was revealed, and thewords captured on tape. The transcript of that tape has since been madeavailable, and besides the oblique reference to the assassins on their way tokill Congressman Ryan there is also one other disturbing clue that has botheredresearchers and commentators for years: the references to Dwyer.Jones several times insists that Dwyer be allowed to leave; in fact, he doesn’twant Dwyer in Jonestown at all when the curtain comes down and calls over theloudspeaker to have him taken away. As we have seen, Dwyer was likely the localCIA Chief of Station. Why, suddenly, is Jones worried for his safety? If thewhole congregation is going to commit mass suicide (as the cover story wouldhave it), then why would Jones care one way or another about Dwyer?According to the press reports by eyewitnesses, Dwyer was on the truck withLayton and the Congressman’s party. Dwyer was ostensibly going to return toGeorgetown with them. However, Dwyer was wounded in the attack on the PortKaituma airstrip: not seriously, it seems to have been a flesh wound in histhigh. Witnesses saw blood on his pants leg, but did not see a wound. Whateverthe details of the wound, it did not prevent Dwyer from running into the jungleto hide with a few other survivors, and then organizing the events of the nexttwenty-four hours and shuttling back and forth between the airstrip and the townof Port Kaituma.Why did Jones think that Dwyer was still at Jonestown? And why did he care?The truck arrived at the airstrip, and shortly thereafter another vehiclearrived with three members of the Jonestown security force. There were twoplanes on the airstrip, one a small, single-engine craft and the other a largerplane to accommodate the growing party of defectors. Dwyer had just arrived froman- other part of the airstrip with a policeman holding a shotgun. The Jonestownsecurity people marched up to the policeman and seized his shotgun. Neither thepoliceman nor Dwyer seems to have made any attempt to resist. A tractor pulledup to the airstrip, carrying more Jonestown security people, parking a trailerbetween one plane and the next and trying to determine who was going on eachplane. Those defectors still on the tarmac, and fearing the worst, began to runto the jungle. The Temple security forces opened fire on the Congressman’sparty, killing the NBC news crew first as they were filming the murders. Theythen walked up to Leo Ryan, already wounded on the ground, and shot him in coldblood, leaving his body lying on the tarmac next to the plane.Larry Layton had boarded the single-engine Cessna first—shoving himself forwardahead of everyone—and was armed; he either picked up a pistol earlier atJonestown or it had been planted in the plane. Since all the Temple defectorshad been checked for weapons before boarding, it seems more likely that the gunhad been planted in the plane, which is why Layton insisted to Ryan that he havea seat on that particular aircraft.He began shooting in the plane as it was trying to take off during the attack,wounding defectors Monica Bagby and Vernon Gosney before his revolver misfiredand it was taken from him by defector Dale Parks.There were others at the airstrip at the time, local Guyanese troops in fact,guarding a military plane that was being repaired, who made themselves scarcewhen the shooting started. The congressman’s party did not have any weap-ons—thanks to the surrendering of the policeman’s shotgun to the Temple securityforces—and were sitting ducks. Bob Flick, an NBC producer, ran to the troops andbegged them for help. They refused. They said it was a conflict betweenAmericans and had nothing to do with them. He asked them for a weapon in orderto defend himself. They refused again. They sat and watched five people beingmurdered in cold blood, and when the murderers took off in their tractor forJonestown after the killing, they made no move to pursue them but instead letthem pass.50Back in Jonestown, the word reached Jim Jones that the Congressman was dead. Noone knows how the information reached him so quickly. There had to have been aradio at the airstrip that was used to transmit the informa- tion, either fromone of the planes or from somewhere else nearby. Once the information wasrelayed, however, the White Night was begun. Jones went on the loudspeaker andcalled everyone’s attention, and began talking about the need for them to killthemselves.Dwyer then went into action. Larry Layton was standing casually on the tarmacand talking to two Guyanese policemen. The defectors raised the alarm, pointingto Layton, and finally Dwyer walked over to the policemen and demanded thatLayton be placed under arrest. They refused initially but then agreed, and tookLayton back to Georgetown. He would be the only person charged and the onlyperson ever convicted of the Port Kaituma attack and of conspiracy to murderCongressman Ryan.51 Dwyer had his scapegoat; there was no need to look anyfurther for the other gunmen.What was Larry Layton doing, standing around the airstrip and chatting withGuyanese policemen just after shooting two people and attempting to shoot athird?The events of the day became even more horrible. Attorneys Mark Lane and CharlesGarry were permitted to escape into the jungle. The rest of the Jonestowncompound was subjected to a lengthy harangue from Jim Jones as he attempted toconvince them all to commit suicide. He asked mothers to kill their childrenfirst, and then to take their own lives. What actually transpired, however, hasnever been clear, and the crime scene investiga- tion—such as it was—was one ofthe worst travesties of justice in the history of any country.Many of the victims bore gunshot wounds, which argues strongly against thesuicide-by-Kool-Aid story that was disseminated shortly after the massa- cre.Those who did survive recall the sounds of gunshots in such abundance it soundedlike a war. The security forces had armed themselves with heavy automaticweapons at the start of Jones’ plea for suicide and were ensuring that nonewould escape the compound. Jones had allowed Lane and Garry to leave, and haddemanded that Dwyer also leave. It is possible that Dwyer was in Jonestown atthe time of the massacre, since there are hours during that afternoon and nightafter the airstrip attack when it seems he was not present at Port Kaituma. Inany event, Jones believed that Dwyer was there, and repeatedly asked thatsomeone take him away.Aerial photographs of the site days later would show the famous scene of bodiesall over the compound; millions saw those photographs in the news magazines, butfew came to the obvious conclusion: the bodies were all lying facedown and inmany cases neatly arranged, indicating that the story of mass suicide might havebeen in error. It beggars belief that everyone in Jonestown would have fallenforward onto their faces after taking the cyanide-laced grape drink. It isentirely possible that the bodies were arranged that way to make theiridentification more difficult when photographed from above. It is also entirelypossible that the bodies were arranged that way by persons unknown after themassacre. For it was a massacre.Initially, the body count—performed by the first contingent of Guyanese troopsthat arrived the morning after the massacre—was only about two hun- dred. Later,as the days went on and more investigators (and curiosity-seekers) arrived, thebody count was corrected upwards. At first, it was believed that the grand totalwould come in at three hundred sixty-three, of which eighty-two were identifiedas children. Yet, as the body count increased, the incredulous wanted to knowhow it was possible that it could go from 363 to 913; how was such a widevariation possible?The explanation given was that some of the bodies were those of children, andthat the adult bodies had fallen on top of them, rendering immediate locationand identification difficult. In other words, there were more than five hundredbodies hidden under the first 363. That did not seem possible, particularly asthe initial counts showed that of the 363, more than 80 were children. It simplydid not make sense, and it seemed as if someone, somewhere was lying about thebody count on behalf of some hidden agenda.What made matters worse was the discovery of some 789 American pass- ports atthe scene. If there were only 363 bodies discovered, then 426 other souls wereunaccounted for and possibly on the run through the Guyanese jungles. One had toput a stop to that rumor at once, and the body count was adjusted upwards to thepoint where 913 became the official number. But, to be perfectly honest, therewas no verifiable, official record of the number of corpses, and only aboutthree hundred had ever been positively identified. 52Photos of some of thebodies show that they were wearing iden- tification bracelets on their wrists,the type commonly used in hospitals to identify patients. No one knows why thiswas done, and particularly why those bracelets mysteriously disappearedsomewhere between Jonestown and the American air base where the bodies wereeventually shipped, thus ren- dering further identification even more difficult.(Three bodies were actually lost, and turned up in storage lockers in southernCalifornia years after the fact!53) The bodies were left in the open jungle airfor days, and had reached a particularly loathsome state of putrescence,rendering hellish the task of coroners and medical examiners. In fact, therewere virtually no autopsies performed on the bodies recovered.Only seven autopsies were ever performed on the more than nine hundred bodiesfound at Jonestown, and only one of those showed any sign of cyanide poisoning.In fact, the autopsies were not performed until a month after the bodies hadbeen embalmed! The first forensic specialist on the scene was a Guyanese doctor,and his initial report on the massacre is widely at variance with the story thatwas later given so much publicity in the foreign press.Dr. Mootoo, Guyana’s chief medical examiner, noted that many of the victims hadpuncture wounds from syringes on their shoulders, where they could not havepossibly injected themselves. In addition, cyanide was pres- ent in bottleslabeled Valium, and Mootoo assumed that the victims had been given thefictitious Valium and discovered the switch too late, as they lay dying. Tosummarize his findings, he believed that the evidence strongly supported acharge of homicide in at least seven hundred cases. The tissue samples that hecollected at the site—representing tests of more than twenty bodies—were handedover to an official of the American embassy for onward transmission to forensicspecialists in the United States. They never arrived, and to this day no oneknows what happened to them.As if anyone needed additional mysteries to solve, Jim Hougan points out onemore incredible anomaly: the CIA knew that there were mass suicides in Jonestownat 4:44 A.m. on Sunday morning, Guyana time. But the site had not been visiteduntil mid-morning that same day by Guyanese troops. How did the CIA know thatthere had been mass suicides in Jonestown at least six hours before anyone elsedid?One of the planes involved in the attack at Port Kaituma had managed to leaveand make its way to Georgetown the night of the 18th, but the only news they hadwas of the attack on the Congressman’s party at the airstrip and the murder offive people whose bodies still lay on the tarmac. No one knew about the massivedeath toll at Jonestown until the next day. Yet, somehow, the CIA knew all aboutit and was already spinning the story as a “mass suicide.” Hougan believes theprobable source to be Richard Dwyer; in addition, a CIA memorandum concerningGuyana refers to a CIA “field station” in Guyana, giving rise to speculationthat there was another CIA operation in Guyana beyond that of Dwyer’s embassyposting.AFTERMATHThe deaths did not end with the massacre at Jonestown. As in the case of theManson Family murders, people connected with the case continued to die fromgunshot wounds for quite some time after the discovery of all those bodies inthe jungle. At the beginning of this chapter, we noted that Al and DeannaMertle—who had published a book about their Jonestown experience, replete withthe sexual escapades and physical and mental torture of followers—were murderedin their home in February of 1980, only a few months after their book waspublished, in a case that has not been solved. They were not the first, and notthe last.Only nine days after the Jonestown massacre, San Francisco Mayor Moscone—whomJones had helped to elect in the 1976 campaign—was shot dead, as was HarveyMilk, the famous defender of gay rights in government. There are numerous photosof Moscone and Jones, and even at the height of the Peoples Temple scandals inthe press, Moscone stood behind Jones and was vocal in his support of thechurch. There is some circumstantial evidence to suggest Peoples Templeinvolvement in these deaths, but nothing substantial enough to warrant a fulldiscussion at this point. The presence of a longtime Peoples Templemember—Bonnie Thielmann—however is suggestive. Ms. Thielmann lived with Jim andMarceline Jones in Brazil in the 1960s, and continued her involvement with thePeoples Temple right up to and after the Jonestown massacre. She was on theplane with Congressman Ryan that flew into Georgetown as one of the ConcernedRelatives—even though she was not related to anyone in Jonestown—but she did notgo to Jonestown with the group, staying behind in the capitol instead, and thenflying back to the States with Tim Stoen.She attended (uninvited) Leo Ryan’s funeral in California, latching onto MayorMoscone and using him as her entrée into the private funeral service. She issaid to have whispered something to the Mayor which left him visibly shaken. Hehad been receiving anonymous phone calls from people claiming to be members ofthe Temple or relatives of members, warning him to be very careful andinsinuating that the Peoples Temple wanted him dead. Clearly, he felt that themassacre in Jonestown was somehow connected to him personally, and not onlybecause of his support for Jones. He urged that survivors of the holocaust betreated by a psychiatrist, unfortunately a psychiatrist associated with theLangley-Porter clinic, the same institution that had been treating Jim Jones forhis mysterious ailment, an institution that also specialized in classifiedDefense Department research, including the effects of ELF (extremely lowfrequency) waves on humans.Mayor Moscone began to fear for his life, and on November 27, 1978 he lost it toa bullet.Dan White had resigned his position as City Supervisor earlier that month, andthen tried to retract the resignation but failed. There was some conserva- tivesupport to have White (a former police officer) reinstated, but it seems thatMoscone was just as happy to have White out of the way. At 9 A.m. on the 27th ofNovember, White drove to City Hall with his aide, Denise Apcar. Ms. Apcar wentinto City Hall through the front doors and metal detectors, but White decided tofind another way into the building. The loaded, five- shot revolver he wascarrying would not pass the metal detectors.He went in through a basement window, assisted by some workmen. He used thestory that he did not want to go through the front doors because there weredemonstrators outside supporting his reinstatement (which was true), and thatthe side doors were locked and he had forgotten his keys (not exactly true, hehad surrendered his keys earlier, at the time of his resignation).He went upstairs to the Mayor’s Office, waited patiently in the outer of- ficeuntil Moscone was ready for him, and then went in and had a heated discussionwith the Mayor. He then fired four rounds into him, and left by another door.He went down the hallway, reloading as he walked, and stepped into Harvey Milk’soffice, asking him for a private word. Milk joined White in another room, wherehe was shot five times.White left City Hall and phoned his wife, meeting her away from home.Eventually, he surrendered himself to the police and confessed to the crimes,even though he told the investigators that he walked through the murders in akind of stupor, having blacked out on the way to City Hall and having no memoryof the actual killings.What happened next became a landmark in the history of jurisprudence. DanWhite’s lawyers came up with the infamous “Twinkie Defense,” based on theirallegation that Dan White committed the murders while in diminished mentalcapacity due to an over indulgence in junk food. He was convicted of the lessercharges of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to seven years, eight months inSoledad, in segregation from the main prison population. He was freed on parolein January 1984 after serving only five years.On October 21, 1985, White was found dead in his garage, a victim of probablesuicide from carbon monoxide poisoning.The motives for the Moscone and Milk murders were never very clear. White had noparticular agenda against Moscone. He had resigned his city position for thesimple reason that it would not pay enough to support him and his family. Hethen decided to retract his resignation, but there was no legal precedent forit. All in all, it did not seem enough to warrant his insane plan to murder theMayor. As a political and moral conservative, he prob- ably despised gayactivist Harvey Milk; it’s possible that he considered killing Milk at the sametime as Moscone on general principle. But we will never know; White hadconfessed to the crimes, and it only wanted a decision by the courts as towhether the homicides were murder or manslaughter. The question of motive wasnot explored because, quite simply, White insisted he didn’t even remembercommitting the crimes. His death raises more questions than answers, since itoccurred at a time when White was planning to move his family to Irelandpermanently.On July 31, 1980 the surviving children of Congressman Leo Ryan’s family broughta lawsuit against the United States of America in the matter of Ryan’sassassination. They charged that the State Department knew in advance of thedangers inherent in a trip to Jonestown, but failed to warn the Congressman inadvance. They further charged that Jonestown was a CIA mind-control experiment,and that the community was heavily armed, and was infiltrated by CIA agents,among whom they named Richard Dwyer and Deborah Layton’s estranged Englishhusband (and former Quaker) Philip Blakey. It was Blakey who had gone to Guyanayears before the rest of the Peoples Temple, in order to clear the land andprepare the site for habitation. His role has always been open to speculation,as he seemed to be Jones’ right-hand man. The suit was dropped, for reasons thathave never been revealed, although many still persist in their belief thatJonestown was a CIA operation of some kind and, if it was, the only type ofoperation that makes any kind of sense would be something along the lines ofMK-ULTRA or some other, related, mind control experiment, since we are told byCIA that MK-ULTRA had been discontinued in the 1960s.One of the Ryan family children eventually went on to become involved with theCult Awareness Network (CAN) after the lawsuit against the CIA was dropped.Other influential members of CAN at one time included Dr. Margaret Singer, longassociated with the Langley-Porter clinic, as well as notorious CIA mind-controlpsychiatrist Dr. Louis Jolyon West. These doc- tors had also been involved inthe defense of Patty Hearst, asserting she had been brainwashed.Larry Layton was acquitted of all charges in Guyanese courts, but had to standtrial again in the United States. His first trial ended in a mistrial; he wastried again a few years later and convicted, and is still in prison as of thiswriting. He is the only person to have been tried and convicted in the Jonestowncase, and the only crimes he is actually known to have committed are theshootings of the two Peoples Temple defectors in the Cessna, both of whom werewounded but not killed. The actual murderers of Congressman Ryan and the fourother individuals at Port Kaituma have never been identi- fied, apprehended, orcharged in any way by anyone. It is almost certain that they were still alive atthe time of Larry Layton’s numerous trials.Deborah Layton went on to retrieve the money that Jim Jones had salted away inSwitzerland and Panama, but it is not known whether she found all the moneyJones had hidden or just a portion. Jones’ affairs were heavilycompartmentalized, and several of his higher-ranking PC staff had access tooverseas accounts and funds. There are also persistent rumors that some of thesecurity staff escaped into the jungles with a suitcase full of cash. The Templeowned three sailing vessels in Guyana, which were all at sea at the time of themassacre. One of these was named Cudjoe, ironically enough, since it was alsothe nom de guerre of Patty Hearst’s SLA lover, William Wolfe. Another vessel wasthe Marceline, the name of Jim Jones’ wife. Evidence of conspiracy, or ofsinister forces at work behind the flimsy façade of reality? Who were on thesevessels? How many were they? Where were they dropped off? No one seems to care.Bonnie Thielmann, Terri Buford, the Mertles/Mills, Thomas Layton, and DeborahLayton have all written or co-written books on Jonestown, each providing theirown particular spin and adding to the general informa- tion—or disinformation—onthe case. Tim Reiterman has written a book, as has Charles Krause, both newsmenpresent at Port Kaituma when the shooting started. Mark Lane has also written abook about Jonestown. So have other survivors.“MISTAH KURTZ -- HE DEAD.”As for Jim Jones himself, his fate is also open to question. His death was ruleda suicide, by a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The pistol he is alleged to haveused, however, was found far away from his body. At least one researcher—MichaelMeier—insists that the body that was identified as Jim Jones at the scene couldnot have been Jones, because the body does not match some essential physicalcharacteristics, thus giving rise to the “Jim Jones double” theory; that Jonesmay have had a double is supported by some circumstantial evidence, as shown inthe Jim Hougan article. In Meier’s view, the real Jim Jones is sipping bananadaiquiris on a tropical beach somewhere, enjoying his millions in relativepeace. Hard to believe? Sure. But, as so often in this study, we are confrontedwith more questions than answers. One wonders, for instance, where Dwyer was atthe moment Jones was killed? Jones wanted him gone; thus he seemed to have beenthere at the time of the massacre. Was he Jim Jones’ executioner, playing theMarlow to his Kurtz? Or was it a bit more like the Martin Sheen and MarlonBrando characters in Apocalypse Now, with Brando’s crazed but successfulrenegade Colonel—surrounded by his Montagnard Army who revere him “as a god”—whomust be assassinatedby Sheen’s Captain Willard.In the original theatrical release of the film, we are shown an image that isfrighteningly reminiscent of what might have happened at Jonestown. In thisscene, which is nowhere to be found on the videotapes and DVDs that have sincebeen produced, the end credits roll up over the sight of Colonel Kurtz’ jungleencampment being razed by napalm, killing all the inhabitants. Although thisfinale is suggested by other events in the film—such as the dis- covery ofKurtz’ manuscript with the words “Drop the bomb! Kill them all!” scribbledacross one page—the actual firebombing of the site is not shown on laterreleases.I like to think that Jim Jones was Colonel Kurtz; that he had been recruited bythe CIA in his early days, and then become increasingly psychotic as hispersonal and spiritual isolation grew. I like to think that the CIA used him andhis Guyana operation for a variety of experiments in situ because it was outsidethe United States, in the middle of nowhere, far beyond any possibility ofcongressional interlopers (until events forced Congressman Ryan’s hand), andanyway the victims were poor, black, and socialist; by openly accepting Jones’rabid form of “apostolic socialism” and parroting his fear of an attack by thefascists, the Nazis, the KKK, the CIA, the FBI, etc., they had placed themselvesbeyond the pale. They could not be repatriated. Bringing a thou- sand paranoidblack people who had been through the fires of hell together back into theUnited States could only have been seen as a terrible liability. Furthermore,who knew what some of them had witnessed at Jonestown? What tales would theytell?As the tropical night deepens, the loudspeaker blaring the last, crazed harangueof Jim Jones, like the Brando character reciting poetry and broken, bitter proseover the radio deep within the jungles of Cambodia, and with the Jonestownpopulation falling to the effects of cyanide, or to bullets in the back of theirskulls, Richard Dwyer creeps along the wooden planks of the pavilion and firesthe coup de grâce into the brain of a madman.I hope I may be forgiven if it seems that I have gone off the deep end with thistheory, but stranger things have happened. We have left other people behind, indangerous territory, in the hands of torturers and psychopaths. Why should thePeoples Temple be any different? And by spinning the story so that it looks likemass suicide, we can assuage any guilt we may have over the exact manner oftheir fate. After all, they killed themselves. It’s sad, and tragic, and awarning to us all … but we had nothing to do with it.The Peoples Temple settlers in Guyana had come in search of God, in search ofparadise, in search of spiritual liberation. Religion, after all, was theirprimary motive. Jones had abandoned religion very early on, ridiculing theBible, but at the same time claiming that he was the reincarnation of Jesus andLenin, among other heroes. He was merging religion and politics, in a way thathas become all too familiar now, promising a workers’ paradise “on earth as itis in heaven.” In robbing his believers of an afterlife, of a blissful existenceon the other side of death, and giving them only horror in this life, Jim Jonesworked the ultimate blasphemy. God became, for the hopeful, idealistic parents,and innocent, wide-eyed children of Jonestown, a hungry tiger lurking in thejungle darkness, its eyes shining in the reflected light of their souls. Thesewere people who wanted what everyone wants: peace, se- curity, happiness, abright future for their children, and the knowledge that they are doing good inthe world and furthering the spiritual liberation of the planet at the sametime. This is what Jim Jones promised them. Instead, he gave them despair.As they stand in the compound the jungle night darkened, the sound of gun firechilling them like some satanic orchestra as their friends are being shot, therounds marching closer and closer to the center of the mass as the men march upand down the columns of the helpless. The helpless who suddenly realize thatthey are breathing their last moments on earth, an unspeakable fear minglingwith the tears and the screams of mothers poisoning their children, husbandsembracing their wives for the last time in horror and in desperate love,surrounded by evil men and a hostile landscape, all hope dying within theirhearts in a dreadful plummet as, one by one, their friends and family fall tothe vermin-infested earth, never to hope or pray or dream or laugh again. Theywere so very far from home.Robert Graves once wrote, in reference to the Gordian Knot,Alexander’s brutal cutting of the knot, when he marshalled his army at Gordiumfor the invasion of Greater Asia, ended an ancient dispensation by placing thepower of the sword above that of religious mysteries.54Perhaps so. Perhaps the modern world is still in the grip of that conceit, thatmilitary conceit of absolute power. The CIA recognized that there was militaryvalue in those religious mysteries, however, and strove to make those myster-ies serve the State. They picked up the two pieces of whatever knot they hadsevered, savagely and without concern for the souls of the men and womendestroyed in the process, and tried to find out how it was tied.“God,” said Nik Aziz, a powerful Malaysian politician and dangerous Islamicfundamentalist, “is a gangster.”55 Amen. But as I once wrote in another time,another place, and as the Jonestown victims learned too late to save theirlives, “God is the only safe thing to be.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Gordon Thomas, Journey Into Madness, Bantam, NY, 1990, p. 276 2 Charles A.

A lawsuit was brought against the CIAin July1980 by relatives of Congressman Leo Ryan, who believed that the CIA knewmuch more about Jonestown than they told the Congressman. On October 18,1978—and thus exactly a month before the massacre—CIA Deputy Director FrankCarlucci had written the Congressman to tell him that although the CIA hadconducted mind-control experiments at Vacaville, they had not involved withDonald DeFreeze (Cinque) of the Patty Hearst kidnapping “insofar as our recordsreflect the names of the participants.”Lisa Philip, the mother of Larry Layton and Deborah Layton, had died inJonestown of cancer three months before the massacre. Although this survivor ofNazi Germany lived to see serious problems in the Peoples Temple “para- dise,”she did not live to see the horrible devastation of the White Night, and perhapsone should be grateful for that if for nothing else.Carolyn Moore—Larry Layton’s first wife and mistress of Jim Jones, mother of hisson Kimo—was dead at Jonestown. Karen Tow Layton, Larry’s second wife andsometime sexual partner of Jim Jones, also died during the White Night. It isnot known when Jones died: did he wait for all of the others to die and thentake his own life? Was he shot by one of the security guards at some pointduring the proceedings? Was he “terminated with extreme prejudice” by a CIAofficer present at the scene? We may never know. We can assume, however, thatJones died with the screams of his followers in his ears and the sight of bodiesfalling all around him as far as his eyes could see.Larry Layton was the only person ever charged with murder and conspiracy tocommit murder in relation to the events of Jonestown and Port Kaituma. He hadbeen seized at the Port Kaituma airstrip on the urgings of Richard Dwyer, eventhough the Guyanese police were reluctant to do so, and, indeed, Dwyer had noauthority in Guyana to order anyone’s arrest. It was necessary to charge someonewith the murder of the Congressman, and Larry Layton was the only one whoremained behind at the scene to be charged. No one else was ever arrested, triedor convicted, even though Peoples Temple defectors who survived the rampagewould have recognized exactly who had done the shooting. There is no evidencethat the shooters died at Jonestown with the rest of the commune. Once LarryLayton was in custody, there was no need to look any further, and thus he couldbear the responsibility for all of it. Once someone was in custody—reminiscentof the events at Dallas in 1963 and Los Angeles in 1968—the police stoppedlooking anywhere else. Although Layton was convicted of conspiracy, no otherconspirators were apprehended or charged. Layton was a conspiracy of one.To put this in some kind of perspective, we have to remember that it was in 1977that the Senate hearings took place on the CIA’s mind-control opera- tions,which involved everything from BLUEBIRD to ARTICHOKE to MK- ULTRA and MK-NAOMIto OFTEN. The revelations came as a stunning surprise to many Americans, and theCIA’s efforts to downplay the projects as basically worthless and non-productivewere met with incredulity. In July of1977, New West magazine published (in their August 1 issue) an investigativereport on the Peoples Temple which was anything but congratulatory. Only a fewdays later, on August 3, 1977 the Senate hearings on MK-ULTRA took place.Simultaneously, a public outcry against the Peoples Temple began, and there weredemands that it be officially investigated by the government. Jim Jones, in thathostile climate, began making plans to get out of Dodge and to move to thepresumably more welcoming and benign climate of Guyana.On October 31, 1977 (Halloween), President Carter’s Director of the CIA—AdmiralStansfield Turner—summarily fired over eight hundred of the Agency’s covertoperations personnel, reducing the CIA’s operational staff from 1,200 to lessthan 400, virtually overnight. 5Known as the “Halloween Massacre,” Turner’s movecreated an unofficial network of eight hundred “dis- gruntled former employees.”It is a miracle that these men, with their special- ized training picked up atThe Farm and other Agency locations, did not “go postal”! (Arthur Hochberg wasone of those fired that day who subsequently disappeared from public view.)However, many did find themselves working for the Reagan–Bush presidentialcampaign, actively supporting a former CIA Director (George Bush), whom theyfelt might get the Agency back on track. Campaign posters began to appear at CIAheadquarters at Langley, with the “Reagan” half of the poster torn away, leavingonly “Bush.” On the other hand, radical protesters at the Republican NationalConvention in Detroit on July14-17, 1980 wore buttons that said, “Shoot BushFirst.”Shortly after the “Massacre,” Leo Ryan, the Congressman who co-authored theHughes-Ryan amendment forcing CIA to advise Congress in advance of covertactivities, proceeds to Guyana and is slain on November 18, 1978, as we haveseen. The people of Jonestown are killed in a massacre of horrific proportions.Large quantities of drugs are found at the scene, drugs that are later describedas “mind-control” substances, but which include everything from Valium tocyanide. The amount of drugs found is far in excess of what the thousand inmatesof Jonestown would or could use in the normal course of living. That, and theinvolvement of the son of Dr. Laurence Layton (formerly of the Army’s ChemicalWarfare Division) and others with suspi- cious backgrounds in government, themilitary and medicine, gives rise to speculation—so soon after the MK-ULTRAhearings—that Jonestown itself was some kind of mind control experiment goneawry.Then, on November 4, 1979 a mob of Iranian students attacked the US Embassy inTeheran, Iran and took fifty-two Americans hostage.Americans will not soon forget the searing image of our people being rounded up,blindfolded and bound, in the midst of thousands of screaming Shi’ite students.Americans will not forget the sight of these same students trying to tapetogether the millions of strips of shredded documents that the staffers hadtried to destroy when the students were leaping over the embassy walls. Whereastwo years previously Admiral Turner had fired most of the CIA’s covertoperations officers, he must have thought he could have used them now.There was no way to get into Teheran and free the hostages. There would have tobe a negotiation for their release. But first, there was tremendous propagandavalue in having these once-proud Americans so helpless, as the televisioncameras of the world trained their lenses on Teheran—helpless and terrified theway the Shah’s dreaded secret police, the SAVAK, had kept Iranian citizens in aconstant state of fear and anxiety for decades. Beginning in 1960, and thusduring the same period that Dan Mitrione was training secret police in Braziland Uruguay, the CIA was training SAVAK (as were the Israelis who had longmaintained a “de facto” relationship with Iran due to the fact that Iran is anation of non-Semites who feel they have nothing in common with their Arabneighbors except Islam, and even then their ver- sion—Shi’ism—is consideredheretical by most other Muslims). The Shah himself, after all, had been put inpower in Iran by the American CIA in an operation of which the Agency is stillquite proud. So turnabout was fair play in the eyes of revolutionaries, andthere was thus no real hurry on the Iranian side to negotiate a return of thehostages.This was the Carter presidency. Jimmy Carter had been elected largely as a kindof backlash against what was perceived as the excesses, corruption andconstitutional violations of the Nixon years. He was the first Democrat in theWhite House since 1968, and Carter’s homely, simple Southern Christianpersonality seemed like the perfect antidode to nearly eight years of Vietnam,Watergate, student rebellions, race riots, and assassinations. It looked as ifit was going to be an administration of healing from the “long national night-mare” that was Watergate and the Nixon presidency.Carter was elected in 1976, at the time of the nation’s bicentennial. It hadbeen two hundred years since a group of Freemasons and freethinkers had declaredtheir independence from England and “fired the shot heard round the world.” Itwas an appropriate time for America to rethink and re-invent itself. Saigon hadfallen in 1975. Vietnam was the first war America had lost. Gerald Ford had beenpresident for a short time in the wake of Nixon’s resignation over Watergate.The Freemason and former male model and partner of Harry Conover—Candy Jones’first mentor and first husband—and member of the Warren Commission had notexactly covered himself in glory. He had been physically attacked twice, mostfamously by Manson Family member Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme, who is still inprison because of the attempted assassination, and totally unrepentant. It wastime for America to take some spiritual inventory.The Senate hearings into the CIA’s abuse of its charter were one prominentfeature of the Carter administration, as was his selection of Admiral Turner asCIA Director. In the wake of the Watergate revelations—which were almost toosordid for most Americans to believe—a house-cleaning of Howard Hunt’s oldemployer seemed very much in order. As the CIA was being dragged through the mudand hoisted on its own petard publicly, particularly with respect to itsdomestic spying activities under Nixon, Turner found he had the mandate heneeded to fire all the odd birds in the Agency that still reveled inclandestine, cloak-and-dagger espionage. It was going to be a new era, one inwhich less importance would be placed on HUMINT (human intelligence- gathering)and more on fancy technology and spy-in-the-sky strategies. The Admiralobviously felt that agents with decades of experience in the field could bereplaced by computer keyboards and exotic cameras.But then the Iran hostage situation changed all that.The CIA was blamed for not knowing about the Ayatollahs’ threat to the Shah’sregime in advance, and for not knowing what to do about it. The CIA was blamedfor the raid on the US Embassy in Teheran and the fifty-two Americans now beingheld by fanatic Shi’ite students in various scattered and undisclosed locationsall over the city. And Carter was being blamed for not solving the problem atonce.And then, there was the oil.The Middle Eastern situation was precarious. The creation of Israel in 1948 andthe subsequent wars with its Arab neighbors had threatened not only the delicatebalance of power between Capitalist and Communist, between Zionist and Arab,between America and Russia, but had also threatened the world’s supply of oil.America had helped Saudi Arabia develop its enormous oil re- serves since theearliest days and had wisely remained on the country’s good side, supplying itwith arms, the latest in aviation technology, and training for its fighterpilots, its troops, its weapons specialists. It had thus ensured a ready supplyof oil regardless of what happened between Israel and Egypt—neither of whom haveany oil—and watched the developing situation between Iraq and Iran carefully; itwas not enough to simply control the oil reserves in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, wehad to control the reserves of Iraq (second in size only to that of SaudiArabia) as well the transportation of that oil from the Middle East to Europeand America. That meant controlling the Persian Gulf, which is bordered by bothIraq and Iran, with the rich oilfields of Kuwait especially vulnerable to Iraqiattack. If these two fought each other, the US could side with either one, orboth, and thus be assured of access to the Gulf for its gi- ant tankers. If theybanded together, however, they could decide to make life miserable for oilexports, just as OPEC did for a short time during the famous “Energy Crisis” ofthe Carter administration, until the unity between the oil producing nationsfell apart and the oil embargo failed.Many a book could be written—and many have—on Middle Eastern oil politics, andwe will not go into all of that now. The taking of the American hostages was butanother chapter in the ongoing saga of oil, race, religion, and history in aregion that has been called everything from a tinderbox to a dynamite keg … tothe cradle of civilization. (And, oh, how that cradle will rock!) What we willexamine here instead, and in brief, is the famous incident known to historiansand conspiracy theorists as the “October Surprise.”LIVES IN THE BALANCEIn a replay of the Nixon–Chenault–Thieu secret arrangement to torpedo the peacetalks and thereby prolong the Vietnam War in 1968—to assure that Humphrey andthe Democrats would not taste victory at the polls—there is evidence that theReagan–Bush campaign pulled the same stunt in 1980, to keep the hostages in Iranuntil after the November election, thus ensuring the defeat of the Democratsonce again. In addition, just as the Nixon strategy in 1968 ultimately led tofive more years of American involvement and American and Vietnamese deaths inVietnam, the Reagan–Bush strategy in 1980 culminated in the Iran-Contra Affair,as advisors answerable to the President decided to ignore Congress and do whatthey could to aid the Contras in Nicaragua while at the same time providingweapons to Iran in exchange for the hostages. Once again, a sitting President’spolicy—being effected at the highest levels of international diplomacy, withmany lives at stake not to mention the nation’s foreign policy direction—wassubverted by a political challenger to gain advantage in an election. In othercountries, going behind the president’s back and cutting a secret, separate dealwith a foreign power would be called treason; in the America of the 1960s and’70s, it was business as usual.The basic story of the October Surprise is as follows:As Carter tried desperately to resolve the hostage crisis, his efforts werebeing undermined by a coalition of Republicans, Iranians and Israelis. When theShah was deposed on January 16, 1979, ending thirty-seven years of rule, theAyatollah Khomeini was back in Teheran two weeks later on February 1(Candlemas). On November 4, students took over the US Embassy in Teheran. OnApril 7, 1980, President Carter froze Iranian assets and enforced an arms andtrade embargo against Iran. This made Iran vulnerable to an Iraqi attack.Furthermore, much Iranian military equipment was of US origin and needed US-madespare parts. Israel had a large inventory of exactly the spare parts Iranneeded, and they urgently wanted to sell those parts to the Iranians. Carter’sembargo against Iran made that impossible … or, at least, very difficult.And then, on September 22, 1980—the autumnal equinox—Iraq went to war againstIran.Iran’s backdoor contacts with Israel, coupled with Reagan’s rising popularity inthe polls, coalesced to form a cabal that would destroy Carter’s chances forre-election. There is a controversy about who first contacted whom to set thecovert operation going, but it was a menage made in heaven. The Israelis wereable to sell arms to Iran, Iran got the arms they needed, and the Republicanswere able to ensure that the hostages would remain hostages until after theelection. Initial meetings were undertaken between Iran and the Republican Partyin Madrid in late July of 1980, at the Hotel Ritz. William Casey—soon to be headof the CIA under Reagan—was present, as well as two other Americans usingaliases, and a delegation from Iran. Interestingly, an Iranian delegate had meta only few weeks previously with a representative of the Carter White House,also in Madrid, on the 2nd of July. This developed into what appeared to beimproving relations between Carter and Iran that September, which could have ledto the release of the hostages before the election. However, Casey’smachinations insured the failure of that.Much ink has been spilled over the question of an October Surprise. Thejournalism that has appeared supporting either side of the issue has beenflawed, or has not presented enough unequivocal evidence one way or another toclose the case. It would seem virtually impossible to get this kind of closure,considering the people and organizations involved. Naturally, had the Repub-licans been actively involved in an attempt to cut a secret deal with a foreigngovernment to win an election, they would not have left a lot of paperworkaround as evidence; conversely, they would have covered their tracks very wellwith considerable planning before any meetings or telephone contacts, etc.Similarly, the Iranians would have no interest in proving or disproving anyallegations and neither would the Israelis. The CIA isn’t talking, and the USgovernment has not been able to prove a case against the very people who claimthat the October Surprise did happen.Its attempts to convict Richard Brenneke and Ari Ben-Menashe of per-jury—accusing them of lying about their testimony in connection with the eventsof the October Surprise—ended in acquittal for both men. Thus, in the eyes ofthe American legal system, Brenneke and Ben-Menashe were either telling thetruth … or, at least, they were not lying! In Brenneke’s case, during a trialfor his friend Heinrich Rupp in 1988, he “declared under oath that he hadattended one of a series of meetings in Paris in late October 1980 where WilliamCasey, Donald Gregg, and other American, Iranian and French in- dividuals hadconvened to discuss the release of the US hostages in Iran. He said that Rupphad told him that George Bush was also present in Paris.”6These were important allegations, being made at the time George Bush wasrunning for president against Michael Dukakis. The US government decided tostrike back—after the election—and in May 1989 brought an indictment againstBrenneke for perjury.In order to prove its case, all the government had to do was present wit- nessesand documentation to show that Brenneke was lying. Incredibly, the governmentprovided no conclusive evidence to show that any of the individuals mentioned byBrenneke were actually where they said they had been. Incredibly, because theOctober Surprise took place at the height of a presidential campaign in whichall or most of these individuals should have been very easy to reach and tolocate. Phone records alone should have been available to prove (or at leastsubstantiate) the claims of Bush, Casey, Gregg and others that they were wherethey said they had been, but there was no substantiation. Eyewitnessescontradicted each other and their own stories. The prosecution was a mess.Facing five counts of perjury, Brenneke was acquitted on each one. That does notmean that he was telling the truth, of course; but it does mean that, for somereason, the government could not prove he was lying, and that is by far the mostimportant conclusion to be drawn from the case. At the time of the OctoberSurprise, neither Casey nor Bush were government employees or members of theintelligence services; the records of their whereabouts would not be consideredmatters of national security, but subject to the normal privacy regulationscovering any American citizen and capable of being examined during the course ofa jury trial. But they were not. This can only lead one to surmise that theseindividuals were acting in some official or semi-official capacity at the timein question, and were being protected by the government.Ari Ben-Menashe was an arms dealer specializing in the sale of Israeli-made armsto Iran at the time. He was arrested in California on charges of smuggling C-130transport planes to Iran, was held without bond for a year, and then acquittedof all charges. At that time, bitter and angry over his treatment by thegovernment, he began to spill all he knew—or claimed to know—about the OctoberSurprise affair and about Iran-Contra.One’s opinion of the truth or falsehood of the October Surprise allegationsdepends largely on whether or not one believes the witnesses who have comeforward, and that is a tricky business. Gary Sick, a former US Navy careerofficer and staffer on the National Security Council during three presidentialadministrations, wrote a book about the affair in which he concluded that theOctober Surprise did happen, that the Reagan–Bush administration did conspireagainst incumbent president Jimmy Carter, and that the hostages were held byIran until Reagan was safely elected and inaugurated. The hostages were releasedwithin minutes of Reagan taking the oath as President of the United States. Andthe arms sales to Iran began in earnest in the months that followed.As if reprising his old role during the Vietnam War, former President Nixon hadtraveled to London a week after Reagan’s 1980 nomination at the RepublicanNational Convention to talk to the chairman of Bristow Helicopters, AlanBristow, who had experience in Iran as a chopper pilot, and who had once planneda commando raid in Iran to retrieve the company’s helicopter fleet.7 Nixon metwith Bristow at the US Embassy in London, and asked how feasible it would be toplan a second attempt at rescuing the Iranian hostages. Carter’s first attempt,on April 25, 1980, had ended in disaster, with Delta Force commandos stranded inthe desert as their helicopters crashed and burned during a sandstorm. It wasgenerally believed that Carter would not make a second attempt, and instead waspursuing diplomatic means to resolve the crisis. Nixon was in London to arrangea non-governmental rescue attempt, presumably on behalf of the Republican Party.The plan was eventually dropped, because it would have required access toup-to-the-minute military intelligence on the hostage situation which even theRepublican Party did not have, revealing that this was a private attempt torescue the hostages and not an official one. Why, for instance, would Nixon havegone to a firm outside the United States to contract this mission if it had theblessing of the US president? Why abort the mission when Reagan would have hadall the access he would need to military intelligence come January? There can beno other conclusion than that this was a separate initiative, undertaken byNixon at the behest of the Reagan–Bush campaign and without the knowledge orconsent of the Carter administration. It was a fallback option, a contingencyplan should the negotiations with Iran in Madrid and Paris fall through for anyreason. And Nixon would have been the perfect person for it, experienced as hewas with the Thieu–Chennault arrangement of 1968, and his given general attitudetowards Constitutional niceties during his years as President.The rest, as they say, is history. Carter was roundly defeated at the polls,Reagan was elected, the hostages were immediately released, and Iran-Contrabegan to get up a nice head of steam.What interests us about the October Surprise and the development of the planinto what eventually became known as Iran-Contra is the involvement of some ofthe strangest people ever to become associated with American poli- tics—which,as the attentive reader may agree, is quite an accomplishment. In this case, weare talking about the woman who first blew the whistle on October Surprise witha book of the same title, a woman who worked for the Reagan Administration andwho resigned her staff position, charging sexual harassment: Barbara Honegger.Incredibly, Barbara Honegger brings us back again full circle to the weird,post-war group that first attracted our attention in Book One: the Round Tableof Andrija Puharich, the same Round Table whose members were inex- plicablylinked to the assassination of President Kennedy. For it was Puharich, Honegger,accused murderer Ira Einhorn, and nuclear physicists Saul Paul Sirag and JackSarfatti who formed a nucleus of another sort in the 1970s, and who brought TheNine back to life—and back in operation—in the person of Israeli psychic andsometime intelligence agent Uri Geller. And, as we shall also see in Book Three,it is Sarfatti and his confreres in the community of quantum physicists whoprovide us a working model of the sinister forces we have been chasing soassiduously thus far.RETURN OF THE NINEIn 1968, when the political situation in the United States was in turmoil,visionaries assassinated, students rioting, and Nixon cutting secret deals towin the election, Andrija Puharich met Ira Einhorn. Puharich at this time washeavily involved in paranormal research, but—due to his academic credentials aswell as his status as something of an inventor (his specialty was electronichearing-aid devices and, some say, electronic implants)—he was respected bythose scientists whose broadmindedness encompassed the possibility of paranormalabilities such as ESP and psychokinesis. At the time he met Einhorn, he was“doing research in connection with the Atomic Energy Commission, working withthe head of biophysics”8: Puharich, as usual, working with the paranormal butalways under the aegis of a classified project of some kind, either for themilitary, the intelligence agencies, or other—equally secretive—governmentorganizations, such as the AEC. Einhorn, who would later be indicted andeventually (in 2002) convicted for the murder of his girlfriend Holly Maddux,was something of a New Age entrepreneur at the time. He had read Puharich’sBeyond Telepathy, a book that posited a connection between energy andinformation, and felt that it was one of the most important books of the decade.It was out of print by1968, and Einhorn wanted to help Puharich find another publisher and get it backin print. The two then developed a close working relationship for a while, whichwas further energized by Puharich’s discovery of Uri Geller in Israel in 1971.Jack Sarfatti, on the other hand, had been a gifted child who won a scholar-ship to Cornell to study physics in 1956, when he was only seventeen years old.In 1953, however, and during the same year as Puharich and the Round Table werein contact with The Nine, Sarfatti had been getting strange phone calls at home.Much later, Puharich’s book, URI, brought it all back. Sarfatti’s mother beganreading the book—which contains a description of the Round Table séances withthe Dr. Vinod who channeled The Nine—and suddenly recognized the symptoms. Shebrought the circumstances to her son’s attention and the memory of the strangephone calls came back in full force.Sarfatti had been getting calls from someone speaking in a strange, metallicvoice stating that it was the voice of a computer aboard a spacecraft hoveringover the earth. These calls went on for a while, and would cause the youngSarfatti to wander around dazed. Evidently, the memory of the calls receded intohis unconscious as he pursued his career in nuclear physics, and only the bookby Puharich about Uri Geller brought it all back. The Nine claimed to be aboarda spacecraft, hovering over the earth, called Spectra. Sarfatti himself seemedselected at a very early age for something of importance. He was being tutoredin a separate program for gifted children by a founder of American MENSA, WalterBreen, in a program that was funded (at least in part) by the Sandia Cor-poration. Some of this extracurricular training included lectures on patriotismand anti-Communism: heady stuff for a bunch of thirteen-year-olds. It would beBreen who would recommend Sarfatti for the Cornell scholarship.There is a lot of Sarfatti email correspondence available on the Internet, muchof which is concerned with quantum mechanics and nuclear physics in general, butsome of which has to do with the events surrounding Spectra and The Nine. Thereare times when Sarfatti is obviously doubtful about the communications,wondering if they were the product of some bizarre sort of intelligence agencymind-control program. As Puharich was obviously involved in the series ofséances which invoked The Nine at the same time as Sarfatti was getting thephone calls (which mirrored the information the Round Table was getting), thereis at least the possibility that the calls were made by Puharich or by one ofhis associates (possibly Breen himself ) as part of some wider program.The fact that Puharich would also arrange long-term psychic experimentsinvolving children at his farm in upstate New York in the 1970s gives one pause,considering the long military and intelligence background of Puharich. Were the1970s experiments an outgrowth of whatever was happening to Sarfatti in the1950s? Sarfatti does not seem convinced one way or another that the calls hereceived were extraterrestrial in origin (The Nine, or Spectra), or the resultof a man-made intelligence trick; he is only certain (as is his mother) that hereceived them. One of the predictions made in the calls was that in twenty yearshe would become involved with a group of people whose mission was theacceleration of human evolution through contact with these otherworldlyagencies. This is exactly what happened, for in 1973 he began to developcontacts with other, like-minded, scientists through the Stanford ResearchInstitute (SRI) and eventually with Puharich himself. These contacts wouldeventually culminate in a business venture in the 1980s with Harold Chipman, aCIA Chief of Station in San Francisco, who was involved with SRI and theparanormal testing that went on there with Puharich and Geller, as well as withRussell Targ, Harold Puthoff, Ingo Swann, and the whole murder of crows thatformed the most strictly controlled investigation of psychic phenomena that theUnited States had ever known.The documentation concerning Sarfatti’s relationship with Chipman (includingChipman’s resume, which tantalizingly speaks of his language capabilities inSpanish, Mandarin Chinese, and … Tibetan) is available on Sarfatti’s ownwebsite, as are huge strings of email exchanges on everything from Puharich andGeller and The Nine to discussions of quantum physics that are so arcane thatamateurs are advised to keep their dignity intact by simply reading and notresponding, as anyone who claims to add to the discussion is likely to beattacked if one can’t back up one’s statements with solid physics. There is noindex to these exchanges, and many are very hard to decipher, as there arequotes within quotes within quotes from the correspondence that would require aHoudini to unravel; but the effort is usually well rewarded with someinteresting bits of history.In the 1970s, however, when Sarfatti was still developing the theories thatwould later make him famous in the world of physics, he was hanging out withPuharich, Uri Geller, and other notables in a hothouse atmosphere of radicalthinking about science, communication, information, and psychic phenomena.Sarfatti claims to have introduced Geller to Jacques Vallee—the French UFOresearcher of Passport to Magonia fame—and both to Steven Spielberg. Spielbergwould later produce Close Encounters of the Third Kind, using Vallee as atechnical adviser: Vallee the Anton LaVey to Spielberg’s Ro- man Polanski. Thecharacter played by Francois Truffaut in the film is said to be based on JacquesVallee himself. This same nexus of Puharich and Sarfatti is said to haveinfluenced Gene Roddenberry in his development of the Star Trek televisionseries. And behind all of this is the hugely influential figure of Ira Einhorn,usually referred to as “the Unicorn” after the translation of his surname intoEnglish.For a while, Einhorn served as Sarfatti’s literary agent (as he did with Puhar-ich to get Beyond Telepathy reprinted). Einhorn was active in New Age pursuits,a kind of showman or P.T. Barnum of hippiedom, making connections andnetworking, bringing together people he felt should be brought together tocreate a kind of explosion of new thinking that cut across traditional disci-plinary lines. So you had filmmakers talking to physicists, psychics talking tosoldiers, and spies talking to everybody. Seminars were held, books and paperspublished. People like science-fiction author Philip K. Dick (who was discoveredby Hollywood in the 1990s, unfortunately after his death) and Robert AntonWilson could be found in kaffeklatsch with Timothy Leary, John Lilly, Saul PaulSirag, and assorted G-men. There was a sense among these people that an event ofmomentous importance to the planet was imminent, and that they were in theforefront of whatever it was going to be.Many of them had already had paranormal contacts of some sort (a list thatincludes Sarfatti, Wilson, Dick, Geller, Puharich, and many, many oth- ers) andwere certain that these contacts signalled the beginning of a more overtpresence by these beings. These were people with government grants and contactsat the highest levels of the US military … and not only the US military. TheSoviets were also involved, if only peripherally. And much of this was going onrelatively un-noticed by the American people at large. Although they had seenUri Geller bend spoons on national television, and had read the stories andnovels by Dick and Robert Anton Wilson, for instance, they had no idea that allthis activity was being produced by a loosely-organized group of intellectualsoperating half-in, half-out of the mainstream … and half-in, half-out of the USgovernment. And it was not until 1974, with the publication of Puharich’s bookabout Uri Geller, that anyone outside a small circle of friends and associateshad ever heard anything about The Nine.Now, one of the members of this loose association of physicists, psychics andspies was Barbara Honegger. Honegger’s entry pass was a master’s degree in theparanormal that she obtained from John F. Kennedy University. A somewhatperipheral figure in the Einhorn/Puharich/Sarfatti circle, she was for a timethe girlfriend of physicist Saul Paul Sirag, who was a frequent contributor tothe group. From there, she went on to greater glory as a Reagan staffer who hadquit his administration over charges of sexual misconduct. She then published abook on the October Surprise, which earned her a great degree of vitriol fromRepublican congressmen who characterized her as someone who dressed as a “bunnyrabbit” at staff meetings and who listened to voices in her head: clearly sexualabuse of a different kind. It was Honegger’s book that triggered NSC stafferGary Sick to write his own account of the October Surprise, and the groundswellof paranoia began to grow anew.As if this story needed to get any stranger, Honegger then—according to accountspublished on the Internet—befriended the wife of one of the Iran- Contra pilots,Gunther Russbacher; and now we are well and truly in over our heads.Gunther Russbacher is not mentioned in many books on Iran-Contra for the simplereason that he was not an active participant in the arms-for-hos- tagesnegotiations with McFarlane, Secord, North and the others. He was, however, onthe flight crew of the aircraft that took 400 TOW missiles to Iran in September1985, and then was on deck again for the famous flight of Robert McFarlane,Oliver North and their staff to Teheran in May of 1986. He is identified as ONI(Office of Naval Intelligence) in Iran-Contra related correspondence, as was hiscolleague on these flights, Robert Hunt.A letter to Robert Hunt from Moshe Ben-Manash, Special Envoy to the IsraeliAmbassador to Washington, dated November 11, 1993, confirms the presence ofRobert McFarlane, Oliver North, Robert Hunt, George Cave, Howard Teicher,Gunther Russbacher and John R. Segal on a flight that left Israel loaded withone pallet of spare parts for the Hawk missile system. Russbacher and Segal (thelatter identified as CIA) are mentioned as the pilots of the aircraft.Other documentation shows that Russbacher was the pilot for the initialshipments of TOW missiles to Iran in August and September 1985, and thatPoindexter advised Bill Casey, the Director of the CIA, that a confidential ac-count had been set up for Russbacher, Segal and the other staffers of the May1986 Teheran flight, with the implication that these funds would be used tocompensate their families in event that the mission ended in disaster.Several years later, Gunther Russbacher married a woman who believes herself tobe descended from royalty, a woman who also believes that she and her brotherwere experimented upon by the government when they were children, who believesthat her eggs were taken from her when she was eleven years old, etc. Herstories—available on the Internet through various sites—are a bizarre tripthrough a very disturbed psyche. She recounts events whose participants are allhigh-ranking US government personalities—engaged in weird, uncharacteristicbehavior involving Templar chapels, underground submarine bases, and thelike—and an individual introduced to her as the “King of the World.” The eventsresemble those of an early Bond film, but without John Barry’s score. Theunsettling thing about her reminiscences is that she often mentions people andevents from the covert world in a perfectly nonchalant and matter-of-fact way.Even though her tales are outrageous, the little details are quite unnerving.As an example, consider a posting on the Internet dated 9 Nov 1998:Gunther and I drove directly to Offutt Air Force base in Omaha. We stayed in VIPquarters. William Webster, the DCI was on one side of us. Brent Scowcroft, theNSA, was on the other side. George Bush was across the hall, and Dick Cheney wasat the end of the hall.William Webster wore red shorts and a red Hawaiian shirt.The meeting was to upgrade Gunther on his SR 71 flying so he could fly a missionto Moscow. On the mission with Gunther were Brent Scowcroft, William Webster,Gunther’s boss, the DCO (Director of Covert Operations) an Admiral named WilhelmJohann. There was a fourth passenger, but Gunther would never tell me who hewas.Thank goodness.The events described above were said to have taken place in July of 1990. It isa little strange to see George Bush (pere?) and Dick Cheney mentioned in thesame sentence about an event said to take place a decade before Bush’s son andCheney would wind up in the White House. Bush Sr., of course, was President ofthe United States in July of 1990. To be sure, the email is dated November 9,1998 but that is still long before Bush (fils) and Cheney campaigned together inthe 2000 election.If you’re going to invent wild stories, then this is the way to go, I guess.Drop names like mad. Add the little details that give the reader a sense ofreality: I can’t get that image of William Webster out of my mind. It haspoisoned me on red shorts forever.In case there are readers who feel that the story may perfectly well be true,allow me to point out that according to this same posting, Gunther Russbacherhad been in prison in St. Louis for a year: he had been arrested two days afterhe and Rayelan were married. Gunther was released in July 1990, and the couple“drove directly to Offutt Air Base in Omaha,” where Gunther was evidentlyimmediately being trained to fly a Stealth spyplane full of the intelligenceelite to Moscow. Does any of this make any sense at all? Yet, there are copiesof documentation available on the Internet—including a military record of somesort from Offutt Air Base—that would seem to support this story. At least inpart. At least if we can believe that the documentation itself is real.What we do have is Rayelan Russbacher (a/k/a Rayelan Allan) performing somethingcalled the “Avalon Mystery Mass” at the Church of Antioch in Santa Clara,California; perhaps I should say “concelebrating” the said Mass, along withMatriarch Mary Spruitt, and with that we are back at the ranch, for with MarySpruitt and the Church of Antioch we are at home and hospitality with thewandering bishops of Book One.Mary Spruitt was ordained and consecrated by her husband, Herman Adrian Spruitt,who in turn held the Vilatte succession and a number of others. He wasco-consecrated by a bishop of the Liberal Catholic Church (the ecclesiasti- calarm of the Theosophical Society) and by a bunch of other notables, some of whomshare lines of succession with the Gnostic Catholic Church of the OTO, theAmerican Orthodox Catholic Church (of David Ferrie fame), and so on, and soforth, and so it goes. In addition to the Avalon Mystery Mass, Rayelan Allan—atleast, as of 1998—was also offering something called the Dance Enchants, ameditation method based on “temple dancing” which also forms a part of theAvalon Mystery Mass. (According to personal correspon- dence with thepresent-day leader of the church, Rayelan Allan was indeed a priest of theChurch of Antioch and had worked with Matriarch Spruitt, but not after 1993.) Toquote from her promotional material on the Web:DANCE ENCHANTS is a simple and easy way to experience the bliss of meditationand the beneficial spiritual and mental changes found on a dis- ciplinedspiritual path. Whoever said that enlightenment couldn’t be fun?Indeed.Yet, here we have the intrepid Rayelan Allan Russbacher feeding information toBarbara Honegger on Iran-Contra… the same Barbara Honegger who was Saul PaulSirag’s main squeeze… who has a master’s degree in parapsychology… who was anintimate of the circle around Puharich and Sarfatti and Einhorn...…and who today is a military affairs journalist for the Naval PostgraduateSchool, Department of the Navy. A journalist who warned Washington a week afterthe September 11 attack on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center that a fifthcolumn within the American military and justice systems—including a judge,military officers, pilots, and even Israeli intelligence—had advance warning ofthe attacks and did nothing to stop them, and may, indeed, have had a hand inplanning and carrying out the horrendous events of that day.It… it… boggles the mind.UNDER GODReagan’s apocalyptic view of history, and his near-Manichean view of the world,was never deeply disected by the journalists of the time of his presidency. Amember of the Disciples of Christ (which was, oddly enough, the religiousbackground of the family of his would-be assassin John Hinckley, as well as ofJim Jones of the Peoples Temple) and a profound believer in the prophecies ofthe Bible, particularly the Book of Revelations, Reagan saw the world in blackand white terms. The Soviet Union—we all remember—was characterized as the “EvilEmpire.” The missile defense shield—the Strategic Defense Initiative, or SDI—heproposed to protect the United States was referred to as “Star Wars.” He saw thefight against Communism as a spiritual one, one which ran the risk of demonizingthose living in Communist countries. Oddly enough, however, his administrationwas also characterized by the intense astrological interests of his wife, Nancy,leading some of us to wonder if the Reagan administration was a hotbed ofGnosticism.What we had in the White House at that time—and probably what at- tracted manyAmericans to the Reagans—was a First Family representative of the strangestqualities of American life (Christian fundamentalism and chiliastic panic,astrology, xenophobia masquerading as anti-Communism, and theHollywood-movie-star heritage of both the President and his wife) packaged in anon-threatening, homely manner by a grandfatherly authority figure. ManyAmericans could not understand the contempt others felt for Reagan and, perhapsrightly in a way, interpreted any anti-Reagan sentiments as anti-American. Hispopularity would only be increased by the failed as- sassination attempt by JohnHinckley, Jr., an attempt that promoted Reagan into a kind of Jack Kennedymanqué, thus perfecting the icon.But to many, the Reagan presidency was an assault on all that the Kennedyadministration had represented. Many remembered Reagan’s cooperation with theHouse UnAmerican Activities Committee during the McCarthy era. Many viewed hiscareer as Governor of California with alarm, particularly his support for aproposed center to study violence that had all the earmarks of a concentrationcamp for undesirables. Critics of the far left, in a bit of self- conscioushumor, began to equate Reagan with Regan, the demon-possessed character in TheExorcist. When it was discovered that Reagan’s assailant—John Hinckley, Jr.—wasthe son of the same John Hinckley who had a meeting scheduled with Neil Bush(one of the Vice President’s sons) the same day that Reagan was assaulted,conspiracy theories began to blossom once more in the land. That cynical 1980campaign button—“Shoot Bush First”—suddenly took on a cautionary and propheticmeaning.Before the Hinckley assassination attempt, however, another murder was beingplanned. We know the victim; we know the man who pled “guilty,” and thus avoideda murder trial where evidence could have been presented in the glare of publicscrutiny. What we don’t understand is the motive; or, we suspect the motive andit is monstrous.LET ME TAKE YOU DOWN“You’re not a saint. I’m not a saint. Yoko’s not a saint. Nobody’s a saint.”—John Lennon9“I’m the Devil, and I’m here to do the Devil’s business.”—Charles Watson“…would you kindly inform [Charles Manson] that it was Paul McCartney who wrote‘Helter Skelter’, not me.”—John Lennon10It was a few weeks after the election. Reagan had just been elected President,and former CIA Director George Bush was elected Vice President. If we believethe conspiriologists, the Reagan plan to subvert the election process and dealdirectly with the Iranians on the subject of the hostages had worked. Thehostages, however, had not yet been released. That would not happen until theday of the inauguration, a month away.The mother of all conspiracy theorists—Mae Brussell—believed that the deaths ofrock stars Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison were in realitypolitical assassinations, carried out in an attempt to defuse thecounter-culture revolution, which was the only movement actively challenging theestablishment on issues such as racism, the environment, sexual morality, thewar in Vietnam, etc. She associated the premature deaths of the rock-and-rollicons of the Sixties with the Manson killings, believing they were all of apiece: an attempt to destroy the youth movement and pull America into line by agray flannel assembly line of right thinkers and right believers, feeding thewar machine.However, I have found it difficult to subscribe to this theory, as attractive asthe sentiment behind it may be. The history of rock-n-rollers is littered withthe “exquisite corpses” of men and women who lived life at the very edge ofhuman experience and who took tremendous chances—with their bodies, their minds,and their souls—and courted death by the very manner of their lives. BuddyHolly, the Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens in that terrible airplane crash seemedto set the standard for the mayhem that would follow: Elvis Presley’s demisefrom the inevitable complications due to his larger-than-life lifestyle, and onand on, from the senseless deaths from overdose and suicide of the sixtiesthrough to Kurt Cobain and the other tragedies of the nineties. It is too easyto hold a dark government plot responsible for these deaths, especially withouta shred of evidence when, in fact, the evidence that exists all points in adifferent direction.Yet it is when we begin to examine the slaughter of the rock stars that we comeclose—not to a specific conspiracy, but—to those sinister forces we have beentracking, forces that lurk behind the events in question. This is a study thatgoes deeper than the “deep politics” of Peter Dale Scott. It is, perhaps, closerto what the Italians mean when they speak of dietrologia or the “science of theleft hand”; for that is what “sinister” means, anyway.Before, however, we jump from our cautiously established platform of conspiracyand coincidence, built so carefully, throughout The Nine and herein, decade bydecade and century by century, we must stop once more to pick at another threadin our study of scarlet. For of all the dead rock stars, there was one whosepremature death was most clearly a murder and an assassination. This was not arock star embarked on a hazardous journey of drink, drugs and exhaustion, but aman clearly comfortable with himself and his surroundings, a husband and father,a calm and rational human being who was at the brink of a comeback after adecade of silence. A man whose killer prayed to Satan hours before the triggerwas pulled and who—Larry Layton-like, Sirhan Sirhan-like, Dan White-like—walkedrobotically through the motions of murder, in a trance-like daze, and foundhimself in police custody, staring bewilderedly out at the world from within atiny closet of darkened dreams.We are discussing, of course, John Lennon and the events of December1980.I never met John Lennon or his wife, Yoko Ono, although as a New Yorker I wasfrequently privileged to see them both around town. Eerily, a few years afterJohn’s death, I would find myself constantly running into Yoko on the streetwith an array of bodyguards in tow (Yoko, not me); but, as a typical New Yorker,I never approached either of them for an autograph or attempted to speak withthem. We New Yorkers, you see, feel we are much too cool to approachcelebrities; such behavior is reserved for tourists.Or for assassins like Mark David Chapman.Many people are aware that the Beatles had had a fling with mysticism back inthe 1960s, and that with George Harrison it “took,” and he became a lifelongBuddhist until his death, a passing that included the chanting of prayers byBuddhist monks. The gallery of photographs on the cover of the Sergeant Pepperalbum of “people we like” included Aleister Crowley. Yet of all the Beatles,probably John Lennon was the most cynical, the most skepti- cal. It was he,after all, who uttered the immortal line, “The Beatles are more popular thanJesus.” It was a simple observation rather than a declaration of faith, but onewhich resulted in Beatles albums being burned across America’s Bible Belt. Hissignature song, “Imagine,” asks us to imagine that there is no heaven and nohell. In his conversation with Paul Krassner, quoted above, he immediatelyrejected any reference to anyone as a “saint.” The conversation in this caseconcerned Mae Brussell. In a bizarre twist of fate, it was John Lennon whofinanced conspiracy queen Brussell’s first published article, when Paul Krassnerfound that his printer, alarmed by the contents of the article, insisted onbeing paid up-front.What many do not know about John and Yoko, however, is that they were fascinatedwith the occult.John’s approach seems much more in line with a no-nonsense attitude towardsspirituality: he accepted that spiritual realities existed, but denied theauthority of organized religions and cults to determine who should believe what.Occultism is a mechanical approach to spirituality; faith is not as large acomponent in western magical practice as it is in western religion. A religiousperson drives a car without knowing anything about its engine; an occultist is amechanic who is not satisfied until he or she understands the machine and can,perhaps, build a better one.Which may explain the visits of John and Yoko to the Magickal Childe Bookstorein Manhattan in the 1970s.At that time, I was friendly with Herman Slater, the proprietor of the store,and had known him since the days when he ran the Warlock Shop in BrooklynHeights where I lived. As the fame and notoriety of his establishment grew—beingcovered extensively in the overseas press as well as by local newspapers andtelevision shows—he began to attract an equally notorious clientele. The Processwould hang out at the Warlock Shop, as well as the odd Satanist and witches ofvarious denominations. The Shop is alluded to several times in Maury Terry’s TheUltimate Evil as a hangout for people who knew more about the Son of Sam murdersthan they were telling. And, amidst all of that publicity, would occasionallyarrive John and Yoko Lennon.Their tastes ran more to Egyptology in those days, and they would typicallyspend hundreds of dollars on books in a single visit. They didn’t ask anyquestions; they knew what they wanted. They would show up during the middle of aweekday afternoon, a time when there were few other shoppers, and take theirtime going up and down the aisles in relative peace and quiet. We later learnedthat Yoko was very fond of fortune tellers, and had one or two that she reliedupon extensively. In the years directly following the murder of her husband, sheseemed to rely upon them even more.I even invoked the “forces of darkness.” I don’t mean a demon with a tail andhorns, but as a religious person I believe there are spiritual powers in theworld and an evil side of the spirit. The point is I did the invoking, so theresponsibil ity is mine.—Mark David Chapman11John Lennon is dead. The world is over. Forget it. It’s just gonna be insanity…—John W. Hinckley, Jr., taped on Dec. 31, 1980.Mark David Chapman is something of an enigma. The back story to his as-sassination of Lennon does not really compute: the trip around the world, thework for the YMCA that is missing from their files, the visit to war-tornBeirut, the trips back and forth between New York City and Honolulu, the storyabout the “Little People” in his head, his abrupt decision to plead guilty andavoid a trial … all of these things put together make him look uncom- fortablylike your standard political assassin or serial killer. Like Lee Harvey Oswaldand James Earl Ray. Chapman seemed to have had access to funds for overseastravel that are not accounted for by a salary. (Hinckley also trav- eledextensively throughout the United States in the weeks leading up to his attempton Reagan’s life, flying from New Haven—where Jodie Foster was going to schoolat Yale—to Nashville, Denver, Washington, etc.) Oswald lived in Russia. Chapmanattempted to visit Russia… but opted for Beirut, instead.He spent time in Korea—as did Oswald, of course, and David Berkowitz (the “Sonof Sam”)—but not in the military; his employer was the YMCA. Chap- man workedamong Vietnamese refugee children at Fort Chaffee in 1975, as the Vietnam Warcame to a close. He used a Charter Arms .38 revolver when he shot Lennon: thesame weapon favored by Arthur Bremer. He was hospitalized for mental illness inHawaii after a suicide attempt; Oswald was briefly hospitalized for mentalillness (after his suicide attempt) in Moscow. And, like Oswald, Berkowitz, andso many others, he never stood trial, thus cheating history of a public debateover the evidence.There seems to be no doubt that Chapman did indeed pull the trigger of the gunthat killed John Lennon. In fact, he stood around and waited for the police toarrive, calmly reading The Catcher In The Rye, that coming-of-age novel byformer US Army intelligence officer J. D. Salinger. What is missing is acoherent motive. Of course, one does not need a motive in order to con- vict akiller if one has all the other evidence available including, in this case,eyewitnesses, the murder weapon, and a confession. What is under scrutiny hereis not whether or not Chapman fired the weapon that killed Lennon. (Thankfully,since the ballistics evidence in the case of Lee Harvey Oswald, James Earl Rayand even Sirhan Bishara Sirhan has been attacked repeatedly by critics, and theballistics evidence linking David Berkowitz to all of the Son of Sam killings islikewise very weak.) What is being questioned is the phenomenon of Mark DavidChapman himself, and the strange coincidence in the timing of a murder ofsomeone who could have been a very big fly in the ointment of a Reaganadministration that was just coming into power.John Lennon had been out of the mainstream for five years. Content to be ahouse-husband and father to young Sean Lennon, John did not record or even writemany songs in the period 1975-79. He was not politically active. He had fought ahard battle with the American Immigration and Naturalization Service in order toremain in the United States—specifically New York City, a place he loved morethan any other—and won ... during the Carter administration, when heavy FBI andCIA surveillance on Lennon as a “dangerous extremist” was switched off. He andYoko moved into the Dakota Apartments on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, andtherein the murky correspondences begin to merge.The Dakota Apartments, of course, is where Roman Polanski filmed Rosemary’sBaby. It is a beautiful, pre-War building with large rooms, high ceilings, andoutrageous rents. The Lennons would eventually wind up owning four apartments atthe Dakota, taking over the entire seventh floor.The Dakota was so named because when it was built it was considered so far awayfrom the city center that it might as well be in Dakota. At that time, the latenineteenth century, Dakota was still a territory of the United States and hadnot yet split into two states. Oddly, the very word “Dakota” will re- emerge inour investigation, linked to the Son of Sam cult, which links us to the MansonFamily and thus right back to Roman Polanski and Rosemary’s Baby. Another cult,this time including some well-known European fashion designers, was known to beoperating in Manhattan out of another building, similar to the Dakota and calledit’s “sister building.” This cult was linked to at least one death, that of ayoung woman who plummeted out of an apartment window à la the character inRosemary’s Baby. For now, however, let us look more closely at the sinisterforces swirling around John and Yoko Lennon, forces that would work very hardindeed to ensure that Mark David Chapman and his Charter Arms .38 revolver werein the right place at the right time.The problem inherent in most histories is not that they merely accumulate factsand details and stretch them into a narrative that purports to tell the truth ofwhat actually happened; the problem is in what is kept in and what is left out.Histories must be essentially synopses of what transpired, with fo- cus on thehigh points: when a certain battle was fought, or how many votes were cast, etc.We are then reassured that in this pile of data we are seeing what actuallyhappened; it is a bit like summing up a marriage by reciting the date and venueof the ceremony, how many years the union survived, and how many offspring itproduced. Documents are necessary, of course. They represent the skeletal matterof the corpse being examined. But there are documents, and there is blood.The American attitude towards the concept of blood sacrifice is one of mixedincredulity and horror. Incredulity that such a thing as blood sacrificeactually exists anywhere in a civilized society, and especially in America; hor-ror at the very concept of slaughter in the name of religion. The reaction ofAmerica during the “satanic cult survivor scare” of the 1980s is very revealing;some Americans firmly believed that an organized network of Satanists wasstealing children—or breeding them deliberately—for use in ritual sacrifice.Other Americans immediately rejected the idea as absurd. Both, of course, wereill-informed.Those who believed in the stories simply confabulated movie plots with realityand didn’t bother to ask some of the obvious questions: where did the babiescome from? Where are the bodies? Why is there no record of such widespread childsnatching? Etc. Those who did not believe in the stories rejected evidenceshowing that many Americans are, indeed, involved in religious systems whichprescribe blood sacrifices and that blood sacrifice is carried out on a dailybasis in the country; although, of course, not of human infants. The Caribbeanand South American religions of santeria, macumba, candomble, palo mayombe,voudoun and many others regularly sacrifice animals during the course of theirrituals. In Haiti, human sacrifice did take place—euphemistically referred to as“the hornless goat” sacrifice—right through the nineteenth century, at least.Muslims practice animal sacrifice at specific times of the year, most notablyduring the Hajj: the pilgrimmage to Mecca, when hundreds of thousands of lambsare slaughtered. Hindu worshippers also incorporate animal sacrifice into theirrites, and the altars dedicated to Kali are often awash in the blood of victims.As late as the nine- teenth century (and, some say, the twentieth) the Hinducult of the Thuggee also prescribed human sacrifice to honor their goddess,Kali; and also until very recently it was common for women to throw themselveson the funeral pyres of their husbands in a rite known as suttee, now officiallybanned but which still occurs with some frequency in the countryside.In Malaysia, the newspapers often carry stories about human sacrifice takingplace today. Some small cults have used human sacrifice as a means of ensuringlottery wins, and the bodies of several Caucasians murdered for that purposewere discovered in one village in 2001, their skulls used as ritual implementsof power.In South America and in the South Pacific, special laws were enacted—andenforced—to stop aboriginals from practicing head hunting and some relatedcannibalistic practices. There are men still alive today in Borneo (forinstance) who regularly tasted human flesh.And, of course, the Christian Eucharist is a celebration of sacrifice in whichthe congregants eat the flesh and drink the blood of Jesus Christ. There aretoday roughly one billion such God-eaters on the face of the earth.David Ferrie, the American Orthodox Catholic bishop and anti-Castro gunrunner,practiced a form of voudoun in his apartment in New Orleans (North America’scapitol of voudoun), killing chickens and calling on African gods while at thesame time plotting to murder a President. Was Papa Doc Duvalier correct instating that he had engineered the Kennedy assassination? Did voudoun call tovoudoun, like blood calling to blood? Ferrie, with his white rats in cages,looking for a cure for cancer, not realizing that the cancer in America’s soulwas deeper than rat and syringe could cure.Thus, the American attitude towards blood sacrifice is complex. The Ameri- cantradition of political assassination is perhaps an eruption of this atavisticimpulse, refined in the alembic of the Industrial Age to produce sacrificialrites where the feudal-era knife has been discarded. The machinery of the guntakes its place as the ritual implement of choice, not quite as emotion- allysatisfying, perhaps, as the visceral stabbing of the victim, but nonethelesseffective and emblematic of the Western colonization of an entire continentwhere the firearm dominated over the bow and arrow and the tomahawk; andemblematic of the way America has developed since then, a nation ofwatchers-from-afar.These grizzly scenes of political murder were recorded on video cameras andplayed out on television newscasts, just as Aztec rites were performed in publichigh on the pyramids of Teotihuacan along the Avenue of the Dead. TheEucharistic Mass had already prepared millions of worshippers for an “anemic”bloody sacrifice, one that takes place off-stage, behind the icon screen, on theother side of the altar rail, but whose elements are shared with the worshippersin the form of bread and wine; yet nothing is as emotionally satisfying,perhaps, as being a witness to the actual ritual death itself. Witness thepublic execution of Charles I, and the frenzied dipping of handkerchiefs in hisblood by the mob.That political assassination may be sacerdotal in nature, a spiritual or mysti-cal act with all the attendant symbolism, mythology and invocation of darkforces that it implies, is not really a new notion to the American public, butperhaps it has not been described quite this way before. After all, we expectour serial killers to have mystical—if twisted—motives. Witness the murder- ersin the Thomas Harris novels based on his fictional “Dr. Hannibal Lecter,” whereour serial killer is in search of some type of personal transformation. InSilence of the Lambs, the killer wishes to change his sex by killing women andstripping them of their flesh and making, essentially, a “woman suit” out oftheir skin. He is acutely aware of the transformative aspect of his killings,for he inserts the larva of a special moth into the mouths of his victims afterhe is through with them.The moth, of course, like the butterfly is an ancient symbol of transformationand regeneration through transformation. This degree of sophisticated reasoningis something the American public has come to expect from their fictional serialmurderers. What is more, the villain in Silence of the Lambs is based loosely onthe actual case of Ed Gein, who did kill women and preserve their flesh in asimilar fashion. Gein was also the inspiration for the archetypal Hitchcockfilm, Psycho, in which the killer assumes the personality of his dead mother inorder to perpetrate the killings, dressing in her clothes and speaking with hervoice. Transgender transformation also hints darkly at the sexual nature ofthese crimes; the mystical element is elaborated upon by novelists, butnonetheless exists in the sexual fantasies of the actual killers themselves.Witness also Jef- frey Dahmer, perhaps the most emblematic of the ritualizedserial killer with extreme sexual fantasies, cannibalism, rape, and blood lust,who designed an altar as a power center on which would be displayed the skullsof his victims… a throwback to the Borneo head hunters and the Malaysian cultists.Why not, then, a mystical motivation for political assassins?It seems obvious, somehow, in the choice of victims: John F. Kennedy; Robert F.Kennedy; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; John Lennon. No one shoots a Jesse Helmsor a Strum Thurmond. Or an Arlan Spector. Or Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, orDonny and Marie. The victims selected are always icons of the best and thebrightest, regardless of the reality of the personalities involved; or they arechosen because they threaten the politico-economic establishment. They are nottrivial victims. Abraham Lincoln. Dag Hammar-skjold. Olaf Pahlme. Che Guevara.No one successfully assassinated Hitler, although there were attempts. No oneassassinted Mussolini; not really. He was brought down by an angry mob once thewar was lost. No one assassi nated Chairman Mao. Fidel Castro himself stilllives, despite everyone’s best attempts at the contrary.It’s the dreamers who die by an assassin’s hand. Quite often, they are killed bymen who are dreamers themselves.Mark David Chapman was born on May 10, 1955 in a suburb of Fort Worth, Texas.His father was in the Air Force, a staff sergeant, while his mother was a nurse.Conspiracy theorists love that combination, of course, and believe it hints atother, stranger, connections. Whitley Strieber’s father was also in the AirForce in Texas at the time of his birth, ten years previously, but in Strieber’scase the Air Force base involved was Randolph, outside of San Antonio, and wasthe locus for the Nazi scientists who were brought over during OperationPaperclip, scientists who specialized in “aviation medicine.” However, in MarkChapman’s case, the father was discharged soon after he was born and got adegree in engineering at Purdue University in Indiana before moving on toDecatur, Georgia, then Roanoke, Virginia and eventually back to Decatur, wherehe had been transferred by his job with the American Oil Company in Atlanta.It’s Chapman’s interior life that interests us most, however. He described hisprivate childhood fantasies to Jack Jones, who recorded them in his biography ofChapman, Let Me Take You Down. Instead of an imaginary playmate, Chapman had anentire kingdom full of imaginary playmates. He called them the Little People,and he was their king. If they dissatisfied him in any way, he would blow themup “and a lot of them would die,” but they would forgive him later andeverything would be okay. It’s possible he got this concept the “Little People”from his fascination with the film The Wizard of Oz. He was so enthralled withthis movie that when he went to New York City to kill John Lennon, he bought astill of the film that he left propped up in his hotel room.Many commentators on Chapman and the Lennon killing focus on his identificationwith Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye since he was reading it when hewas arrested in front of the Dakota, and because he flogged the book everywherehe went and to everyone he met, even “autographing” copies of the book,sometimes as Holden Caulfield. This element was picked up in the film ConspiracyTheory, where it is pointed out that Chapman was not the only killer to walkaround with a copy of the book, and the film’s plot talks of the book as a kindof mind-control trigger for selected political assas- sins of the MK-ULTRAvariety. Before we look at that any deeper, however, we should first examine therole that The Wizard of Oz plays in Chapman’s psyche, for we will uncover somestartling clues.With Catcher, Chapman can identify safely with the character of HoldenCaulfield, a young man disgusted by the “phoniness” in the world, who leavesschool and wanders around Central Park, eventually having a nervous breakdownand winding up in a mental hospital. With Oz, however, we are on shaky ground.For here Chapman identifies with Dorothy, the character played by Judy Garland.The plot of the film—based on the L. Frank Baum story of the same name about ayoung girl from Kansas who winds up “over the rainbow”—is similar to that ofMaeterlinck’s The Blue Bird which was, as we have suggested in Book One, thelikely inspiration for the CIA mind- control project BLUEBIRD.Dorothy is knocked unconscious during a tornado at her home in Kansas. This partof the film is in black and white. She then awakens in a different land,discovering that her house—which was picked up in the tornado—has landed on anevil witch, killing her. She finds herself surrounded by the Munchkins, asociety of Little People who are grateful to her for having killed the evilwitch. It is in this film that we first hear the song “Ding Dong, The Witch IsDead,” the same song that was sung at the gates of the White House when Nixonannounced his resignation. Barbara Honegger was also once referred todisparagingly as a “munchkin” after her attack on the Reagan administra- tionover the October Surprise. Thus, politically, the battle lines are drawn:Munchkins to the Left, Wicked Witch to the Right.This, and the rest of the film until the ending, is in color.In order to get back home, she must find the Wizard, who lives in the EmeraldCity. Along the way, she is befriended by a Good Witch, is targeted by anotherEvil Witch, and picks up a Cowardly Lion, a Scarecrow, and a Tin Man. And, asalways, she is accompanied by her little dog, Toto. They must go through ahaunted forest, and undertake other adventures in a very similar fashion toMaeterlinck’s story, until they finally find the Wizard, who tells them he can’thelp them until the Wicked Witch is dead. So, off they go to destroy the witch,who has an army of flying monkeys. This done, they return to the Emerald City,and the dog, Toto, accidentally reveals the true identity of the Wizard: just anormal man hiding behind a curtain at a set of electronic controls that make himappear as a monstrous and all-powerful genie. That immortal line, “Pay noattention to the man behind the curtain,” is uttered by this man, desperate topreserve his secret to the last.The Wizard, however, proves to be wiser than even he believes he is, and theCowardly Lion gets courage, the Tin Man a heart, and the Scarecrow a brain.Finally, Dorothy can return home by using a mantra and clicking the heels of herruby slippers together … slippers taken from the corpse of the witch slain byher falling house … and she awakens back in Kansas. The mantra she repeats asshe clicks her heels together, SS officer style: “There’s no place like home.There’s no place like home.” A xenophobe’s slogan if ever there was one. Sheawakens in her home (in black and white again) to her adoring family, who haveall appeared in her “dream” as different individuals. There’s no place likehome, and there isn’t a dry eye in the house.The movie is a musical, of course, and the highlight is the most famous songfrom the film, “Over The Rainbow.” It is a melancholy ballad about a yearningfor home, but for an ideal home “over the rainbow,” a kind of heaven on earth.Dorothy seeks that, but finds it instead in her own home, among her family. Thisis how Maeterlinck’s story also ends. Although each series of adventures seemsto take days and days, both hero (Tyltyl) and heroine (Dorothy) wake up in theirown homes the following morning. Both hero and heroine discover that what theywere seeking was always in front of them, in their own home. In Tyltyl’s case,the quest was for a Blue Bird. In Dorothy’s case, her ticket home was a pair ofRuby Slippers. The alchemists and tantrists among my audience will recognize thesexual symbolism immediately: blue for boys, and red for girls! Moreimportantly, the device Tyltyl uses to “see” with enlightened vision is adiamond on his hat that he must twist in a certain direction. A diamond in thecenter of his head, then, is a famous Buddhist symbol, the adamantine substance;Dorothy’s slippers are made from rubies. They are both precious stones and bothhave deeper meanings to adherents of Eastern religions as well as topractitioners of Western occultism.Of course, there is an enchanted forest in The Blue Bird also, and it is ashostile to Tyltyl as the forest is to Dorothy and her friends. There are evilwitches in each story. Both Tyltyl and Dorothy are accompanied by a dog. BothTyltyl and Dorothy eventually pick up other companions along the way who arelooking for their own salvation.The message of The Wizard of Oz, however, can be seen in a more danger- ouslight to someone like Chapman. The Wizard is obviously a “phony,” not a realwizard at all but a charlatan who has been deceiving people with his showman’stricks, for his own personal gain. In the film, Dorothy unmasks the charlatanand forces him to do good deeds for the people of the city.On the streets of New York, however, Mark David Chapman shot him with a CharterArms thirty-eight.We’re not in Kansas anymore.Chapman also walked the yellow brick road, just like Dorothy. He traveled aroundthe world before meeting Lennon, and made the trip to New York City from Hawaiitwice before actually pulling the trigger.He also had his Munchkins, the “Little People” who were his subjects. In fact,the Little People had argued against his killing of Lennon and walked out on himwhen he told them he was going to do it. Thus, once again, the Munchkins provethemselves to be Leftists, at worst, or Democrats at best! Might it have beenhis affinity with the Little People in his mind that made Chapman so successfulwith Vietnamese refugee children during the summer of 1975 at Fort Chaffee,Arkansas?Remember, these were days when drugs were rampant in high school halls. Lot ofhippiedom. Lot of confusion. The war in Vietnam was going strong. We were lostin the forest.—Mark David Chapman12Mark was a loner in school, a type that was picked on and bullied. His motherwas abused by her husband, Mark’s father, and sought comfort in a closerelationship with her son, whom she idolized, telling him he would be a greatman some day. Mark found himself taking sides in the war between his parents,defending his mother against a remote but overbearing father. His mother wouldcome into his room at times after being slapped around by her husband, and sleepin Mark’s bed until the storm had passed.Mark, ostracized at school and generally friendless, woke up one morning andfound that there were Little People living in houses and apartments and going towork in skyscrapers … in the walls of his bedroom. He summoned them before himand ordered their assistance in protecting his mother against his father. Toencourage them, he played Beatles music for them: in his head, beamed out alonginvisible wires to invisible speakers.He would rock back and forth in front of the stereo and listen to the Beatlesendlessly, applauding after every song as if he were at a rock concert. He hadonly one Beatles album, Meet the Beatles, and he inspected the album coverminutely, memorizing its details.He was nine years old.By the time he entered high school, he was undergoing substantial changes in hispersonality. From a clean-cut and awkward boy from a good family, he turned intoa doper who cut classes and hung out with similar individuals. For once, he waspart of a group and accepted. He grew his hair long, wore dirty bellbottoms thathe never changed, and dropped acid and smoked grass at every chance he got. Atthe age of fourteen, he ran away from home and went to Florida, and lived on thebeach for two weeks until his money ran out.This episode is rather strange in its details. Mark had called a taxi service totake him to buy the air ticket two weeks before his trip. The car that met himhad two men in it. They dropped him off at a ticket office, and waited until hebought his ticket and then they drove him back, agreeing to show up in two weekstime, at five o’clock in the morning, in front of a diner, to drive him to theairport.Strangely enough, the taxi arrived at the appointed hour with the same two menin the car. This is certainly a very odd circumstance. The boy was fourteenyears old. There were two men in the taxi each time, not simply a driver. Whowere these men? What were their roles? And why did they agree to meet him againat 5 A.m. two weeks in the future … and show up? The story does not make a lotof sense. Indeed, it is troubling. There is obviously more to the tale than MarkChapman has told, and it is possible that he does not remember the incident verywell; thus, it is one more strange mystery waiting to be solved.Mark flew to Miami and took a taxi to the beach, where he hung out for some timeand had a moderate series of adventures, including a walk of twenty miles to arock concert in the Everglades under a broiling Florida sun. Eventu- ally, aCuban family in Coral Gables took pity on him and let him live with them for afew days before finally putting him on a bus back to Georgia.It was the summer of 1969. Charles Manson was ordering the Tate and La Biancakillings. Jim Jones was ranting and ramping up in Ukiah, California. Everythingwas going to hell. And we were lost in the forest.On October 25, 1970 Mark David Chapman had a satori of sorts. He had gone to aweekend religious retreat at the urging of a friend, the motivation being thepresence of a lot of girls. It was a “charismatic fundamentalist congrega- tion”13sponsored by the South Dekalb Presbyterian Church, and during the retreat theyshowed a film about the life of Jesus which seems to have made an impression onMark, for he wrote down the date as if it were something significant, a“spiritual turning point.” 14On that same day, in California, Mary Bennallackwas slain, the fifteenth victim of the Zodiac killer. That same month, JoelRostau, a business associate of slain Tate-victim Jay Sebring, was murdered inNew York City. The Manson Family was suspected of the crime, as they were of thedeath of Charlene Cafritz in Washington, D.C. the month before. Cafritz—a friendof Sharon Tate, Charles Manson, Terry Melcher and Alan Warnecke—claimed to havesecret videotapes of the Manson Family, tapes that were never found. She died ofa Nembutal overdose.Cult killings went on that year, from the Zodiac killer to “Maxwell’s SilverHammer”: according to Manson Family member Gypsy Share, they were responsiblefor the savage murder in July 1970 of two people on the beach near SantaBarbara. There was one survivor of that attack, who spoke of the killers wearingrobes and chanting. And on September 18, 1970, Jimi Hendrix was found dead of adrug overdose in the London apartment of his German girlfriend, Monika Danneman.The Scotland Yard investigation documents were sealed.Mark David Chapman had not yet become a born-again Christian. Al- though thedate of October 25, 1970 was firmly etched in his mind as a day of spiritualimportance, he returned to school and lapsed into his familiar drugged-outhippie routine. But one connection he made that weekend was to influence therest of his life, for he met Michael MacFarland, the boy who would insist thathe read The Catcher in the Rye.In the summer of 1971, during the school vacation, Mark went to visit hisgrandmother in Ormond Beach, Florida. Still a hippie by his own standards, andstill doing drugs—even though he felt a strong attraction to his new Christianfriends and the comfort of religious community—he sought out other like-mindedpeople and hung out doing drugs along the Florida coastline. It was when hereturned home one day to discover that his wallet had been cleaned out by hisnewfound “friends” that he had a religious conversion.“…I remember, when I realized that my buddies had gone through my wallet,feeling the lowest I had ever felt. I felt like nobody. Like nothing. Nothing atall.”15In the midst of his profound depression, he reached out to Jesus. He lifted hishands and asked Jesus to come to him. He described the moment to a psychiatristat Riker’s Island as a physical sensation of God entering his room, feeling a“tingling from the tip of the toe to the top of my head”16 on his left side, forGod was sitting on his left knee. Mark David Chapman had become born-again.When he showed up for classes in the fall of 1971, he was a changed man. Gonewere the hippie clothes, the dirt, the long hair, the rock-and-roll lyr- ics,the drugs. And gone was any fascination for the Beatles, particularly for JohnLennon. He told his friends that Imagine was a Communist song, 17a notunreasonable assumption for a high school junior to make. He was also incensedby Lennon’s comment that the Beatles were more popular than Jesus. Like mostdevout Christians, he assumed that Lennon was boasting, when in fact he made thecomment cynically, as his own worst critic.The period of devout Christianity didn’t last, however. Chapman was always wireda little too tight. During a typical prayer service replete with witness- ing,praying, and singing, Chapman—who had written a Christian song and brought hisguitar—found that there was no time or opportunity for him to play it after thethree-hour-long session. The frustration grew in his heart and turned him offwhere the Christian prayer groups were concerned. Like discovering his “buddies”had ripped him off in Florida the summer before, Chapman felt again like nobodybecause the group had failed him.18 He cast about, looking for another cause oranother group, something else to join, somewhere he would be embraced.And he found it, this Holden Caulfield manqué, as a counselor to children at theYMCA.As he cleaned up his act, he volunteered as a counselor at the South DekalbCounty YMCA and later became an assistant program director. He was, in fact,recognized as an important asset to the YMCA program. His rapport with childrenwas tremendous. They hung around his neck, sat in a circle around him as heplayed his guitar, and generally just followed him around. In addition, Chapmanfound that he was a great fundraiser as well, and was honored by having his name“engraved on a tile above the Olympic size indoor pool that he helped build” forthe YMCA. 19Well, it wasn’t his birth name, actually. It was “Nemo.”Those who remember the stories of visionary author Jules Verne will recall thefigure of Captain Nemo. According to friends of Chapman at the time, he wantedthe kids to call him Captain Nemo or just Nemo, and somehow the name stuck.There does not seem to be any clear explanation of why Chapman liked thatparticular name, except perhaps that he identified with the Jules Vernecharacter who is an enigmatic and powerful commander liv- ing 20,000 LeaguesUnder the Sea. At one point, during an awards ceremony when Chapman was beinghonored by the YMCA, the kids began to chant “Ne-mo! Ne-mo!” as he walked onstage to receive his award. Those were, according to Chapman, the greatest daysof his life.20What is astounding to a person looking, Umberto Eco-like, at the semiotics ofhistory is the actual meaning of the name “Nemo,” for it is Latin for “No one.”That is, in fact, why the Verne character chooses that name rather than use hisown birth name: he wanted to disguise his real identity and be known only as“Captain No One.” Chapman, who all his life feared being a “nobody” a “nothing”was now universally acknowledged as such by the children, and praised for it.But sadly he never made the connection.Indeed, as novelist Patricia Cornwell has documented in Portrait of a Killer:Jack the Ripper—Case Closed, even Jack the Ripper suspect Walter Sickert signedsome of his famous letters to the press as “Nemo” and used “Mr. Nemo” as a stagename.21Those who remember the book and the movie The Exorcist will recall the scene inwhich Father Karras attempts to decipher the strange language that the possessedchild, Regan, has been screaming. He is playing a tape recording of the gutturalvoice over and over, until another priest tells him that the child is screamingEnglish, backwards. When Karras plays the tape backward he hears the Devil, inresponse to Karras’ question “Who are you?” reply, “No one. I am no one.”Chapman turned his academic career around, as well, and graduated from highschool six months early. He went to live with his friend Michael MacFarland (whointroduced him to The Catcher in the Rye) in Chicago, where the two of thementertained church groups with music and comedy routines. When this was notgoing anywhere, Chapman returned to Georgia and worked at the YMCA at a seriesof jobs, and even worked for a time at a mental hospital in Atlanta, on a floorspecializing in children suffering from autism and other men- tal illnesses.“Little People.” Then, in 1975, the YMCA sent him to Beirut.Chapman had filled out an application to something called ICCP/Abroad, anon-profit program being run by the YMCA which placed American YMCA volunteerswith foreign affiliates, as a kind of Peace Corps for YMCA camp counselors. Thiswas in February 1975. As British researcher Fenton Bresler reveals, however, onegot to choose where one was stationed. Chapman did not list Lebanon as his firstchoice, but rather, oddly, the Soviet Union.He even went so far as to sign up for a Russian language course in anticipa-tion of this trip, but was turned down at ICCP/Abroad because he did not alreadyspeak Russian. Instead, he got his second choice: Beirut.There is no guidance available as to why this deeply committed Christian wouldhave picked Beirut when Jerusalem was also available. No one seems to be able togive an answer to this perplexing question. Beirut was already in the throes ofpolitical upheaval and instability, and was only weeks away from full-blowncivil war. Mark was one of only two people sent to Beirut by ICCP/Abroad, and hespent very little time there once the shooting started. He made a tape-recordingof the small-arms fire going on outside his hotel room window, which he broughtback with him and played for friends. He was obviously very shaken andparadoxically excited by this experience. From Fenton Bresler’s point of view,he was sent to Beirut to be “blooded.”22To understand this reference, one has to remember that in 1975 Beirut wasprobably the CIA’s largest Middle Eastern station, one responsible for intelli-gence activities throughout the region. One must also remember that the CIA hada history of engineering coups in the region, such as the one that placed theShah of Iran back on the Peacock Throne. Although some researchers insist thatthe CIA maintained a school for the training of assassins in Lebanon, there isno proof of this available, of course. However, virtually every other MiddleEastern group with an axe to grind has had training camps in the region, and inaddition the author knows of IRA and other European revolutionary and terroristgroups that trained in Lebanon during the same period.Further, it is also known that the CIA used students studying abroad as a sourceof intelligence. As Bresler notes—and as anyone who was of the author’sgeneration may remember—Ramparts magazine did a report on just that subject in1967, which caused quite a furor at the time. Bresler’s thesis is that MarkDavid Chapman was a CIA-trained assassin, and that the murder of John Lennon waspolitical. Certainly, the timing is suggestive, as we shall see. Bresler hasgone further, suggesting that a “split personality” was induced in Mark DavidChapman, and that the alternate personality had only some tangential points incommon with the original Mark David Chapman, such as—for instance—The Catcher inthe Rye. Bresler’s case is persuasive, and is consistent with what we alreadyknow of MK-ULTRA and other intelligence- and military-sponsored mind-controlprograms. Further, the target was both a cultural icon and a political figure inhis own right, and someone who could have rallied American sentiments againstwhat would become the Reagan and Bush administrations, Iran-Contra,arms-for-hostages, and the stepped-up war against the Soviet Union, a Cold Warwhich would eventually result in the destruction-by-bankruptcy of its Communistgovernment.Upon his return to the States after the aborted Beirut mission, Chapman foundhimself at the newly-created Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, which was a kind of waystation for Vietnamese refugees who had fled the fall of Saigon in April of thatyear. With him at Fort Chaffee was the former head of the YMCA station inSaigon, David C. Moore, who had only been in-country for about a week beforeSaigon fell, and who was now at Fort Chaffee helping the Vietnamese in theirAmerican orientation. This episode is ripe with significance.Why would the YMCA have sent anyone to Saigon in April 1975? It was clear toeven the most optimistic that the country was falling. Da Nang had fallen byMarch, long before Moore’s arrival in Saigon. The North Vietnamese Army wasadvancing rapidly towards Saigon; the entire country north of the capitol hadalready fallen. What was there to be gained by sending a brand- newadministrator there at the time? It seems, in retrospect, insane. Unless therewas a hidden intelligence agenda.This same David Moore then appears at Fort Chaffee with some of these refugees,and rooms with Mark David Chapman who has just returned from … Beirut. Anotherfalling city, resounding with sound of explosions and machine-gun fire.Together, the two were involved in some fashion with these unfortunate victimsof what the Vietnamese call the “American War,” ostensibly helping them in theirrelocation to American communities and in some cases adoption by Americanfamilies.These are only suggestive facts which, taken separately, perhaps mean little,but when taken together show the lineaments of a darker purpose. Once again, weare forced to decide whether there was a controlling governmental agency behindthese events, with an agenda of its own, or whether instead these strange eventsare representative of a mystical nexus of deeper, unconscious spiritual forcesthat underlie conscious, visible phenomena. Either way, the conclusions aredisturbing.By the end of 1975, the Fort Chaffee refugee-placement program had com- pletedits mission, and nearly 30,000 refugees had been placed in American communitiesthroughout the United States. It was during his tenure at Fort Chaffee that Markhappened to shake the hand of President Ford, who had come to visit theresettlement camp. Thus, President Ford came into contact with some of the mostnotorious individuals of the late twentieth century: Mark David Chapman andwould-be presidential assassin and Manson Family member Lynette “Squeaky”Fromme. Not bad for a president whose admin- istration did not even last asingle term. If we include his partnership with Harry Conover, the futurehusband of alleged mind-control victim Candy Jones, and his inclusion in theWarren Commission panel which effectively covered-up certain aspects of theKennedy assassination, we have a man whose history bears a bit more scrutinyAt that time, Mark had developed another, very odd, relationship with a manwhose name is only given as the pseudonym “Gene Scott” in Bresler’s book, butwas later identified as “Dana Reeves” in the Jack Jones biography of Chapman.23This gentleman was an officer with a Georgia sheriff ’s depart- ment at the timeBresler’s book was being written (1989), and it is not known where he is today,but his influence over Mark was powerful and bizarre. Chapman, who was said todespise guns and violence, became a gun enthusiast around this man and seemed tobe under the control of his personality in some way. And as it turns out, it wasthis same mysterious individual who supplied Mark David Chapman with thehollow-point bullets he used to murder John Lennon.24We don’t know much more about him beyond the enigmatic references in Bresler’sbook, and the fact that he was with the Henry County sheriff ’s department asmentioned in the Jones biography, 25but this strange mentoring of Chapman by aman from a police department resonates with the pairing of Dan Mitrione and JimJones: one, a police officer from a small town with an ulterior motive, and theother a young, religious man—a boy, really—who comes under his influence andthen morphs from devout Christian into murderer. Both young men spent timeabroad, financed by unknown sources of income, in politically unstable regimes.Both came home with palpable personality changes. Both men abandoned theChristianity of their youth, yet committed their heinous crimes in the name of ahigher ideal. Jim Jones ridiculed the Bible and the concept of a “Sky God”; MarkChapman invoked Satan in the hours before he killed John Lennon.The implosion of Jim Jones in the jungles of Guyana was very public, very messy,and left a lot of loose ends, red herrings, and smoking guns. I think Mark DavidChapman was a refinement of the same system. If Jim Jones was the “alpha”version of an experimental program, then Chapman was the “beta” release: acarefully constructed multiple personality with a tightly focused purpose, asingle target, and ultimate deniability. There is evidence of the same type ofsexual dysfunction in both Jones and Chapman: Jones was obviously bisexual, andhad sexual relations with both the male and female members of his congregation,something of which he boasted openly and frequently—as well as constantlyreferring to the size of his penis—indicating in Jones some confusion over hissexual identity; documentation on Chapman’s sexual re- lationships are somewhatmurkier, but offhand references by someone who knew him during the Beirutepisode seem to indicate that he was suspected of having an unhealthy interestin his young charges.26His Georgia police officer friend got him a brief job as a security officer atDeKalb General Hospital,27 and they shared an apartment in Atlanta during thistime. Bresler intimates that possibly there was more to the relationship thansimple friendship; the police officer was never married, but is described ashandsome and Rambo-like in appearance. Others who knew the two of them duringthis period also indicated “complex undertones” to the relationship, whichevidently continued through the Lennon assassination and well into Chapman’sincarceration.28Chapman’s sexuality is frequenty invoked as some kind of touchstone to the restof his story, and it is worth looking at briefly. He did not have sexualintercourse until he was twenty years old, and this with a female roommate whowas somewhat more worldly than he was. The fact that he was engaged to anotherwoman at the time is said to have given Chapman an incredible feeling of guiltover this single sexual episode. He is also said to have been sexually attractedto older women, and fantasized about them being chained, naked, in a dungeon—inthe basement of his high school—where they were forced to do what he wanted,which did not include intercourse but did include fellatio. 29(This seems to beanother version of the “Little People” fantasy, with Chapman in complete controlover helpless victims who are forced to worship him under penalty of death. Wasthis then a repressed sexual fantasy, which threatened to erupt into hisrelations with children?)As devout Christians, he and his fiancée struggled with the question ofsexuality and prayed over it. He eventually told her about his one-night-standwith the roommate and she evidently felt betrayed by the revelation.He tried to attend college with her at her university, but failed at that aftera while, broke up with his fiancée, and wound up booking a ticket to Honolulu.GOD’S LONELY MANSome commentators have written that Chapman’s trip to Hawaii was for the purposeof committing suicide. Others have said that Chapman went to Hawaii for furthertraining and indoctrination by any one of several classified military operationsthat were based on the islands. What we do know is that Chapman did, indeed,attempt suicide in Hawaii by means of a hose running from the exhaust pipe intothe closed window of his car, but it was a pathetic and failed attempt andChapman wound up in a mental hospital.This juxtaposition of Hawaii and mental hospital is one that we encounteredalready in the case of Jim Jones. In Jones’ case, the belief is that hecommitted himself to a hospital or clinic in Hawaii in order to avoid adversepublicity back on the mainland. Chapman would have had no such qualms. Yet, thenexus of Hawaii and hospitals comes up again in the Son of Sam case, where itwas revealed that drugs were making their way onto the mainland from Hawaii bybeing secreted in bags of plasma. The plasma would arrive in a hospital in NewYork City and the drugs removed there by hospital workers who were one link inthe supply chain. This trafficking in narcotics is said to be one of the mainsources of income for the Son of Sam cult.Chapman was in Hawaii at the time of the Son of Sam killings, and it isworthwhile to note that he did have access to unexplained sources of incomeduring that time, income that helped finance his trip around the world and hissubsequent flights to New York City leading up to the assassination of Lennon in1980. In fact, one of the strangest episodes of Chapman’s visits to New York washis taking a cab through the city and stopping for a few minutes at variousapartment buildings where he seemed to be making pickups or deliveries, whichmakes no sense since Chapman supposedly knew no one in New York. At one point,he offered the cab driver some cocaine, which is also totally out of characterfor Chapman at that time (this was long after his “drugged out hippie” days inColumbia High School in Georgia) and has never been explained; but if Chapmanwas making drug deliveries in Manhattan it all begins to make much more sense:everything from the Hawaiian hospital connection to the multiple air fares toNew York to the unexplained source of income to the strange cab ride and theoffering of cocaine. 30As I used to tell people in New York in the 1970s and’80s, if you overheard a conversation between two people and it didn’t make anysense, it was probably about drugs.While Chapman’s murder of Lennon in New York—where the Son of Sam killings hadbeen taking place—does not seem to be linked in any way to the Sam cult, and onthe face of it appears to be a wholly-independent act, the parallels betweenDavid Berkowitz (the convicted “Son of Sam” killer) and Chapman are compelling,as we shall see.Whatever the reason for his trip, Chapman quit his job in Atlanta, soldeverything he owned, and flew to Honolulu in January 1977. After a short timethere, loneliness building up inside him, he phoned his former fiancée inGeorgia, and she convinced him to return, which he did … believing it wasbecause she wanted him back. As it turned out, she did not; she only thought shewas helping him by urging him to return. Disgusted, he turned around and flewback to Hawaii.At that point, he began to realize that he had a problem, and he phoned asuicide hotline and was eventually referred to the Waikiki Mental Health Clinic.That seemed to help somewhat, but still did not keep him from the suicideattempt with his car’s exhaust on June 20, 1977, an attempt that failed when hisplastic hose melted from the heat. He was eventually accepted into CastleMemorial Hospital, a private hospital run by the Seventh Day Adventist Church,where his fees were paid by the state’s welfare system. He was diagnosed asbeing severely depressed, but not psychotic. He was released in two weeks.Castle Memorial is located in a small town on the other side of the island fromHonolulu. Mark Chapman decided to stay there and find an apartment, and waseventually hired by Castle Memorial, first as a maintenance man and thenpromoted to customer relations. Now we are back in the twilight zone, because—aswith Jim Jones, Lee Harvey Oswald, and so many others we have come across—thereseem to have been two Mark Chapmans.Bresler has noted 31that all the documentation possessed by Chapman at the timeof his arrest checks out. His Hawaiian driver’s license was issued in July of1977, which is about right. The owner of the apartment where he stayed says thathe did, indeed, live at the address on Puwa Place in Kailua where he said hewas. Everything seems fine. Except that the owner says that Chapman was livingwith “a woman and three young children,” 32and that they left owing a month’srent, had no electricity in their final month at the complex, and left theapartment in such a mess that it cost two thousand dollars to clean it up. Asearch of records at the post office and other agencies in Kailua failed to turnup any identification of the mysterious woman and her three children. Therecords of the apartment complex do not show Chapman as having lived there, eventhough it is the precise address on his driver’s license.This has led some researchers to believe there was a confusion, and there musthave been another man named Mark Chapman involved. But how could that be? Howcould one Mark Chapman (in custody) show that address on his driver’s license …but not actually live there? How could the other Mark Chapman (mistaken by thelandlord to be the man in custody) live there anonymously at the home of amystery woman and her three young children, whom the apartment owner believesmight have been her sisters?Was Mark Chapman being “sheep-dipped”? Was a false story being planted, histraces obscured by conflicting records … or no records at all? Chapman had beenundergoing treatment at Castle Memorial; he told his therapist all sorts ofthings about his past, about Beirut, about his girlfriend in Georgia. No oneseems to have known anything about him living in an apartment with four females.Yet, at the time Bresler’s book was being researched—more than five years afterChapman’s arrest for the Lennon assassination—Chapman was still get- ting maildelivered to the apartment on Puwa Place.33At any rate, on Oahu Chapman began dating again. One of his girlfriends was awoman twenty years older than he, a psychiatric nurse at Castle who was said tobe an illegitimate daughter of comedian Oliver Hardy of Laurel and Hardy fame(as if this story could get any weirder) That relationship lasted for somemonths, until a local Presbyterian pastor convinced Mark that his relationshipwas immoral. Chapman would eventually move in with the pastor and his family andbecome reconverted to the fundamentalist form of Christianity the pastorpreached. Then, in December of 1977, his parents came to Hawaii to visit. It wasevidently a pleasant time for everyone, and Chapman was eager to demonstrate hisnewfound stability—both financial and emotional. Everything seemed to be goinghis way.Then, six months later, Mark David Chapman went on a trip around the world.According to Chapman’s account, he had arranged for a loan from the hos- pital’scredit union. The hospital has refused to confirm or deny this aspect of thecase, citing confidentiality. Yet, Chapman had only been employed at CastleMemorial since August 1977. It seems unlikely that the credit union would haveadvanced him the money necessary for a world tour after less than one year ofservice. He had no other collateral that anyone has been able to discover,nothing to secure a loan that must have been a minimum of three thousand dollarsby my estimation, allowing for the cheapest possible airfare and budgetaccommodations. Nonetheless, he was able to take leave from the hospital on July6, 1978, for over six weeks after only ten months of employment, and, armed withhis credit union loan and a thousand dol- lars he received from his father onChristmas, he visited Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Thailand,India, Nepal, Israel, Iran, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland andAtlanta, Georgia before returning to Hawaii. He stayed in YMCA youth hostelsthroughout the trip, armed with a letter of introduction from his old friendfrom Fort Chaffee days, David Moore, who was by now working for the YMCA inGeneva.In Bangkok, he found himself spending the night with a prostitute, but otherwisehis trip seemed uneventful from a sexual perspective. He did, how- ever, seesome very sobering sights in India and Nepal, and was in Iran only six monthsbefore the Shah was deposed and fled into exile. In Hong Kong, he was one of thefirst American tourists allowed to cross over into China, as the border had beenopened the same week as his arrival.In India, he arrived in Delhi and was able to visit the Taj Mahal and take atrip to Nepal. This meant some difficult traveling for a lone, young American:from Delhi to Agra (which is not too bad) where the Taj Mahal is located, andthen up to the Nepali border across the province of Uttar Pradesh. There aretrains from Delhi to Agra that accommodate the heavy tourist traffic to the TajMahal, and they take roughly two to three hours to make the trip. Getting toNepal from Delhi, however, is somewhat more problematical depending on where oneenters Nepal. Buses from Delhi to some of the closest border towns can taketwelve hours. It is possible that he flew to Kathmandu from Delhi, but I havebeen unable to find any more detail about this part of his itinerary. Oneassumes that the local YMCA was able to arrange safe passage for Chapman.Nevertheless, he did see a cremation as well as overwhelming scenes of extremepoverty and desperation. During this world tour, he took something like 1,200slides.In Geneva, he met with his friend from Fort Chaffee, David Moore, and theydiscussed everything, including Chapman’s failed suicide attempt. Moore tried toreassure his young friend, who was disappointed over his failure to finishcollege and get a degree, which would have enabled him to have a real careerwith the YMCA.Mark Chapman arrived back in Hawaii on August 20, 1978, where he was met by histravel agent, Gloria Abe. He had been sending her postcards and lettersconstantly during his trip, and soon the two people found themselves in love.Gloria Abe is the daughter of Japanese immigrants to Hawaii—her mother aBuddhist and her father a follower of the Japanese national religion, Shin-to—and although she is a few years older than Chapman, she is younger inappearance. A thoughtful, patient woman with an interest in reincarnation andastrology, she was able to stand up under Chapman’s constant self-doubt anderratic behavior, and even more she was moved by his religious fervor andChristian spirituality. In an eerie reminder of Jim Jones’ youth, he told herthat he used to preach on the streets when he was young, passing out religioustracts.34 She found herself converting to Christianity at the same time she wasfalling love with him.They were married on June 2, 1979.Their minister was the same pastor who had re-converted Chapman tofundamentalist Christianity. At their wedding, for instance, there was noalcohol served to the one hundred or so guests. The wedding itself was not heldat the pastor’s church since, in fact, he did not have one. His congrega- tionof less than thirty souls met in a room loaned to them by a local school onSundays. As someone who worked for the Presbyterian Church in 1969 and 1970, Ican attest that this was a somewhat unusual pastor and congrega- tion. Chapman’spastor was on a mission, and his influence over Chapman seems suspect to me.Chapman’s involvement with a fringe Christian opera- tion—when surrounded byevery sort of mainstream Christian denomination and observance—is of a piecewith the rest of his life. Even when he became involved with the YMCA—certainlya venerable American institution, the Village People notwithstanding—it would bein a manner fraught with ex- treme expression and experience.One learns to swim at the “Y,” or goes on summer camp or day trips; but MarkDavid Chapman goes to Beirut for the YMCA as civil war is breaking out, then toFort Chaffee to help with Vietnamese refugees in the months after the fall ofSaigon. He then travels around the world, staying at various YMCA hostels andmeeting his old friend from Fort Chaffee days—David Moore—in Switzerland. And,as we shall see, on his way to kill John Lennon he will spend a mysterious threedays in Chicago: the same city where David Moore has by that time beenreassigned, although Moore claims that he was not contacted by Chapman duringthat trip. Clearly, Mark David Chapman cannot do anything in an average, low-keyfashion, even though most of the people who knew him describe him precisely thatway: friendly, normal, re- sponsible. Yet he pushes the envelope of his ownpersonality, taking extreme positions on spiritual subjects, moving to Hawaii,marrying an older Asian woman, traveling throughout Asia and then to Europe onhis own, dodging bullets in Beirut, working with Vietnamese refugees in Arkansas… and still feels constantly alone, depressed, unfulfilled. Then, just whenthings seem to be working out okay, he swings in another direction entirely,ruining any chance he might have had for a “normal” life.Two months into the marriage, and Chapman had prevailed upon his wife to quither job as a travel agent and to get a job instead at Castle Memorial, where hewas working. He did not like her long hours at the travel agency, and clearlyseemed to want to dominate her time and to control her social interactions asmuch as possible. He then decided that they had to move to the other side of theisland and commute to work by bus, selling off their car in the process. None ofthis made any sense, of course. Chapman was going out of his way to complicatehis life, and that of his wife. Most people would try to move closer to theirplace of employment: Chapman chose the oppo- site strategy. Most people would,in that case, have held on to their means of transportation: Chapman sold thecar, making them both rely upon public transportation.And then, he suddenly decided he had an interest in art.He began haunting art galleries and educating himself on art; he wound up buyingsome lithographs and then reselling them, borrowing money from hisfather-in-law, from his mother, from his credit union. It was a strangeinterlude. People who work in intelligence circles know that art is one way todisguise income: art is a very volatile commodity, and a painting can appreciateor depreciate in value quickly over time, or may simply become attractive to acollector who will pay more than the market price. That it was this series oftransactions in art that supposedly financed Chapman’s trips to New York makesone wonder, especially as the passion for art did not last long … andespecially as it seems Chapman paid back the credit union loan and the loan fromhis mother before his trips, while for some reason not paying back the $2,500 heborrowed from his wife’s father, using that money to finance his New Yorktravels. It is all very strange.Then, towards the end of the art episode, he quit his job at CastleMemorial—days after the hostages had been taken in Iran—in an uncharacteristicquarrel with the human resources people over a promotion he claimed he deservedand did not get, and wound up instead getting a low-paying job once again as asecurity guard: on December 19, 1979, at an apartment complex across the streetfrom what was then Scientology headquarters in Honolulu.Chapman is known to have harassed the Scientologists. He is one of fourindividuals known to be doing so at the time. One of these four men was in thehabit of making phone calls to Scientology offices and threatening members withdeath. It might have been a case of a security guard with too much time on hishands, but again Chapman may have had another agenda. He is said to have blastedBeatles music across the street in an effort to harass the Scientologists, butthere is no indication that he was particularly fond of the Beatles at thistime. He had objected to Lennon’s “more popular than Jesus” statement whilestill living in Georgia, as we have seen; he had undergone a born-againChristian conversion in Georgia before this animosity towards the Beatles began,and then had undergone another conversion to the Presbyterian group before hismarriage to Gloria Abe. It thus seems unlikely that he would be blasting Beatlesmusic, if he was, indeed, blasting music at all. How does a security guard whoseresponsibility is the protection of an apartment complex manage to set up such ablatant operation without attracting the ire of his own employers? This is yetanother part of the story that does not compute.In addition, according to Chapman in his interviews with Jack Jones, he alsoharassed Hare Krishnas. He objected to the way they coaxed money out ofpassers-by. 35He only stopped, afraid for his safety, when told by one personthat the Krishnas could find a way to hurt him, that they were dangerous.Then, in August 1980, he rediscovered The Catcher in the Rye.As we have seen, this novel about a young man’s coming of age was written by aformer US Army intelligence officer, who served in Europe with the troops thatlanded at Utah Beach during the Normandy invasion of June 1944. Thecircumstances of J. D. Salinger’s military career are—like virtually everythingelse in his life—shrouded in mystery. We know that his job involved theinterrogation of captured German civilians who were believed to be spies,saboteurs or simply Nazis-in-hiding. We also know that he suffered some form ofnervous breakdown during his career in Europe. And we know that, shortly afterthe publication of Catcher, he retired in complete anonymity to a small town inNew Hampshire, a few miles from where this author once lived in the early 1960s.We also know that Salinger was—and possibly still is—a believer in Easternmysticism as well as in psychic phenomena.He claimed to be in telepathic communication with his first wife, whom hemarried in Europe during his military posting there (yet another mystery thathas not been adequately described), and that they could go into trances and meeteach other in the ether. 36Virtually nothing is known of this woman, save thatshe was French and her given name was Sylvia. 37She was also described aspossibly being a psychologist, or an osteopath! Whatever the case, we know verylittle about her; what we do know is that Salinger signed on for a further sixmonths of civilian work for the Defense Department in Europe after his officialdischarge in November 1945. 38The nature of this work is not revealed. One ofhis biographers, Ian Hamilton, believes it had to do with denazification, whichis entirely possible since that is what Salinger was involved with when he waswearing a uniform. It is believed that his interest in the occult began with hisrelationship to the mysterious Sylvia.It was suggested to us by an ex-army acquaintance that perhaps Salinger is stilla spy, or that somewhere in his spying past there is a secret so secret that henow has no choice but to dwell perpetually in shadows, in daily fear, no doubt,of some terrible exposure.39It is fascinating to contemplate the number of former intelligence officers whowent on to write bestselling novels. Salinger is one; William Peter Blatty isanother. Ian Fleming, of course, and E. Howard Hunt and Dennis Wheatley. In thenon-fiction area we have such luminaries as Peter Tompkins and his “secrets ofthe pyramids” and T. E. Lawrence of Arabia and The Seven Pillars of Wisdom.Salinger, Blatty and Fleming, however, have had enormous impact on our culture,giving us unforgettable characters in Holden Caulfield, Regan and Fr. DamienKarras, and James Bond: an alienated teenager who has a nervous breakdown, apre-pubescent girl possessed by demons and saved by a conflicted priest, and aninvincible, not-so-secret secret agent. Fears and fantasies, courtesy of theAmerican and British intelligence services.In reality, perhaps, these characters have been transformed into … teenagers whoexpress their alienation by shooting each other, and the rest of us, withautomatic weapons; Catholic priests who are suspected more of pedophilia than ofsaving the souls of small children like Regan (how many mothers these days wouldleave their little Regans alone with a Catholic priest?); and an intelligenceservice that overthrows regimes it doesn’t like, assassinates the heads ofsovereign nations, spies on its own citizens, and through all this still managesto shoot itself in the foot more often than not.But, meanwhile, back at the ranch, Chapman latches on to Catcher again, perhapsseeing in it something of his old self, his true self before Hawaii andmarriage, before Beirut and Fort Chaffee … or perhaps, as Fenton Bresler sug-gests, it was handed to him by his controller. Regardless of how the book showedup in Chapman’s environment, however, it began to once again exert a stronginfluence over his consciousness. He was becoming Holden Caulfield.DOUBLE FANTASYHear me, Satan … Accept these pearls of my evil and my rage. Accept these thingsfrom deep within me. In return I ask only that you … give me the power … Thepower to kill John Lennon. Give me the power of darkness. Give me the power ofdeath.—Mark David Chapman40Now I say to you: I don’t believe that Mark did it. It was terrible. It was theDevil!—Mrs. June Blankinship41Holden Caulfield, and Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz. It was all coming back tohim now. Dorothy the savior of the Munchkins; Holden the Catcher in the Rye.There was no place like home, and the Little People hadreturned.In 1980, Chapman is either unemployed or sporadically employed. He beginshanging out at the library; his physical appearance begins to deteriorate; hetries selling blood to raise money. His wife is still working; so they aresurviving, but not much more than that. Incredibly, he has paid off all theirdebts—which had been mounting, including credit-card debt and various loans—andis at loose ends. He suddenly develops a renewed fascination for The Catcher inthe Rye and buys two copies, one for his wife and one for himself. He signs themboth as Holden Caulfield.He reads a recently-published biography of Lennon, and finds himself apalled atLennon’s repudiation of his earlier life, the Beatles, his revolutionary ideals.He claims he is disgusted at Lennon’s obvious wealth, since his signa- ture tuneImagine contains the phrase “imagine no possession.” Chapman is coming to theconclusion that Lennon is a phony.Then, he is sitting in his apartment going through his record albums and comesacross the Beatles’ Sergeant Pepper album, sees the picture of Lennon in thesmall mustache and granny-classes, and decides then and there that he has tokill him.We’re one world, one people whether we like it or not.… Leaders is what we don’tneed.—John Lennon42It is October 1980. The Double Fantasy album is almost ready for release,containing seven cuts from Lennon and seven from Yoko Ono. John Lennon is makinga comeback. A single from the album—(Just Like) Starting Over—is climbing thecharts. There are photos of Lennon in the weekly and daily newspapers,interviews, and hints of a matured political consciousness.Reagan is running against incumbent Jimmy Carter for the presidency. He is aheadin the polls, but not by much. It is this month that the alleged “OctoberSurprise” conspiracy is taking place, with involvement by former- CIA Directorand current-vice presidential nominee George Bush: an ar- rangement with theIranian government not to release the hostages until after the election. Thisarrangement will grow into the Iran-Contra scandal, with arms-for-hostages dealsinvolving the US, Israel and Iran, while Ollie North arranges illegal supportfor the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels in Nicaragua. Guns, drugs, money,logistical support. It will be a nightmare of realpolitik and dirty tricks,surpassing Watergate in abuse of the Constitution and contempt for the Americanpeople by those in power. But the stakes are very high, at least in theviewpoint of the conservative faction within the Republican Party. It is nothingless than a battle for the human soul, the destruction of the Evil Empire, andthe fulfillment of what Ronald Reagan sees as the Biblical prophecies in theBook of Revelation.The last thing they needed was an activist Beatle, one who would become anaturalized American citizen in 1981, and then be able to vote and rail againstthe administration, reawakening old sentiments of peace, love and rock’n’roll.Particularly not this Beatle, the one who said they were more popular thanJesus. A Beatle worth something in excess of $150 million in 1980 dollars. ABeatle who could, conceivably, run for an American political office one day, anddo so without having to raise a dime for his campaign treasury.Chapman is sitting in his living room, listening to Beatles records and bob-bing back and forth, davvening, rousing himself to a state of trance-like rage.He summons his Little People, for the first time in years. He needs to organizehimself to go to New York City and murder John Lennon. If he does that, heknows, then the terrible pressure in his soul will be relieved. Maybe he willwind up in prison, or executed (New York did not have the death penalty at thattime). Either way is okay with Mark David Chapman.He signs himself out of his job for the last time, as “John Lennon.” He thencrosses out that name and signs his own. It is October 24, 1980.Chapman buys a Charter Arms .38 revolver from a gun shop in Honolulu, but forsome reason does not buy ammunition. It is October 27, 1980.On October 29, he flies to New York City, and checks into the Waldorf Astoria,stays a few days, then changes to the YMCA, then the Sheraton Center, then theOlcott, which is down the block from the Dakota. He stakes out the Dakota,visiting every day, but also doing tourist things like Broadway plays, theStatue of Liberty, etc.He tries to buy ammunition at a gun shop there. But one cannot buy am- munitionin New York City, which has tough gun control laws, unless one has a New YorkCity permit. Thwarted at this juncture, he decides to call on his old friend,the Georgia sheriff ’s officer, and source the bullets that way.He flies to Georgia (first class) on November 5, where his friend not onlysupplies bullets—hollow points, or “dum dums” as they are called, bullets withreal stopping power—but takes him out for target practice for a day untilChapman is proficient, firing 150 rounds in the process.43Chapman returns to New York , but discovers that Lennon is not at home. Thedoorman at the Dakota—the famous “Rosemary’s Baby” apartment building where theLennons have bought an entire floor—tells everyone the same thing: they are notat home, they are away, they are abroad, don’t know when they will be back. Infact, the Lennons are still at work on the publicity and promotional materialfor Double Fantasy.Chapman goes to the movies, and sees Ordinary People. The film provides a kindof catharsis for him, and his desire to kill Lennon subsides. He calls his wifein Hawaii, tells her that he had contemplated killing Lennon, that he has givenup on that idea and is coming home.Chapman returns to Honolulu on November 12, believing he has won a great victoryby not killing Lennon, telling his wife that from now on ev- erything will beokay, everything will be fine, it’s all over, he’s found himself. Don’t worry.Be happy.Within weeks, he is back on a plane for the mainland. This is where the storybecomes muddied, with conflicting evidence showing that Chapman either leftHonolulu on December 2, 1980 or December 5, 1980; that he either switched planesin Chicago, or stayed in Chicago for three days; that he brought his grandmotherfrom Hawaii to Chicago, or that he visited his grandmother in Chicago, or hedidn’t see his grandmother at all.Bresler makes a very convincing case—based on evidence at the Ho- nolulu policedepartment—that Chapman left for the mainland on De- cember 2 and stayed inChicago for three days before traveling on to New York, intending to return toHawaii from there on December 18; he did not purchase a direct flight fromHawaii to New York, even though that would have been the cheaper alternative.Instead, he booked a roundtrip Honolulu-Chicago ticket, and then in Chicago atsome point purchased a ticket for New York.What was Chapman doing in Chicago for the missing three days? Was his trip inDecember specifically for the purpose of killing Lennon, or was there anotherpurpose entirely, something to do with Chicago? Did he make the decision to goto New York to kill Lennon only after his visit in Chicago, with whomever it washe may have met there? His good friend David Moore says that he did not see himin Chicago, which, Moore admits, was very strange because even if Chapman onlyhad an hour layover in O’Hare Airport he would have phoned him anyway. Whatwould have kept Chapman from phoning his friend from the Fort Chaffee andworld-tour days?Several reports have stated that Chapman was accompanying his grand- mother backto her home in Chicago, although they conflict on how long he spent in Chicago.Oddly, this grandmother cannot be located. Even more incredibly, UnitedAirlines—the carrier he used for the flight from Honolulu and the later flightto New York—no longer even has a timetable in their records for the period inquestion, much less any passenger manifests! So it has been impossible forBresler to backtrack over Chapman’s movements and pin them down.The missing three days in Chicago is troubling, as is the fact that Chap- mandid not purchase his ticket for New York until after he had landed and spentsome time there. What happened in Chicago to point Chapman back toward histarget?Regardless of the Chicago interlude, by the time Chapman lands in New York Cityon December 6, 1980 his plan has been reaffirmed. He books him- self into theYMCA closest to the Dakota and begins immediately to hang out around theentrance, waiting for Lennon. When Lennon doesn’t show up that first day,Chapman begins that strange odyssey around Manhattan with a single cab, makingtwo quick stops uptown and offering the driver a hit of cocaine, which thedriver evidently refuses. Chapman then gets off in Greenwich Village, at Bleekerand Sixth. 44We don’t know what he does there, or when he gets back to the YMCA.The next day, he checks out of the Y and books himself into the Sheraton CenterHotel, an expensive place on 7th Avenue and 52nd Street, far south of the Dakotaand not within easy walking distance, as was the YMCA. No one knows why thesudden change of venue.Then, in the hotel room, he arranges the famous shrine.This is a composition of symbolic meaning, and consists of his expired passportwith all the immigration stamps of his world tour; the letter of recommendationfrom his friend at the YMCA, David Moore; a photo of himself at Fort Chaffeewith the Vietnamese refugees; a photo of his old car from his Georgia days, a’65Chevy; his air ticket showing only the Honolulu- Chicago round trip, nothingshowing how he arrived in New York; a Bible, inscribed “Holden Caulfield”; and astill from the movie The Wizard of Oz, also inscribed, this time “To Dorothy.”We must wonder at this point if Chapman was trying to tell us something, amessage that was never received. The passport, the letter from David Moore, andthe photograph of the Vietnamese refugees can be seen as simply an indication ofsome of the high points of his life, like the photo of his old car, or it couldbe seen as pointing in another direction: a paper trail meant to suggest thespoor of an ulterior motive, a hidden agenda. These, packaged with the Bible andthe movie still, sums up the story of the inner and the outer Chapman.He then has a call-girl come to his room at the Sheraton, and after she leaveshe phones his wife in Hawaii and assures her of his love.The next day is Monday, December 8, 1980.So worrying about whether Wall Street or the Apocalypse is going to come in theform of the Great Beast—is not going to do us any good today.… I am going intoan unknown future…—John Lennon, the last interview, December 8, 198045On Chapman’s twenty-block walk north to the Dakota, armed and dan- gerous andcarrying a copy of the just-released Double Fantasy album, he realizes somethingis missing. Frantically, he seeks out a bookstore and finds a copy of TheCatcher in the Rye. Relieved, he goes on his appoint- ment with destiny with thefamiliar red paperback in his pocket. In it he has written, “From HoldenCaulfield to Holden Caulfield,” and “This is my statement.”He waits around outside the apartment building, without seeing Lennon. Aroundnoon, he invites two girls who had also been standing around to go to lunch withhim, and they do. After lunch he returns to the Dakota, and that afternoon meetsJohn and Yoko’s five year old son, Sean, and shakes his hand. But still noLennon.Finally, Lennon shows up, and Mark Chapman manages to get his autograph on theDouble Fantasy album, as do all the others who had been hanging around. But hedoes not shoot. There are too many people, too many things could go wrong. And,anyway, maybe Mark isn’t ready yet. Maybe actually seeing John Lennon in theflesh was startling; and he acts like any regular fan when he realizes that hispicture had been taken by a photographer who had been watching the building,saying, “They’ll never believe this in Hawaii!”46Finally, at nearly 11 o’clock at night, John and Yoko arrive back at the Dakotaafter a long session in the recording studio. Mark Chapman is still there. Thereis a voice in his head, saying over and over, “Do it. Do it. Do it.” 47He says,“Mr Lennon,” and John turns to see Mark David Chapman in combat stance aimingthe .38 revolver at him, firing the five rounds in rapid succession, hitting histarget with four of them.Lennon falls. Yoko screams. The doorman picks up the phone to call the police.Mark David Chapman sits there, pulls out his copy of Catcher, and begins toread.The subway entrance was right behind him. He could have escaped easily longbefore the police arrived. He could have been back in Hawaii (or Chicago) beforeanyone could identify him as the shooter, if actually anyone could. In fact, oneof the first New York police detectives to interrogate Chapman felt that theyoung killer had been programmed to kill.48Chapman was duly arrested, strangely shouting at the arresting officers, “Iacted alone!” 49He became silent in the police station, would not answerquestions, but seemed strangely calm and unworried. (This was, incidentally, thesame opinion people had of Lee Harvey Oswald after his arrest for the shootingof Officer Tipitt and the subsequent charge of killing the President.) As themonths progressed, and as psychiatrists began visiting Chapman to derive someinsight into his mental state, he was given an attorney, who la- bored toprepare a solid defense of “not guilty by reason of insanity” for his client. Hewas examined by a battery of famous psychiatrists, including Dr. BernardDiamond, who had interviewed Sirhan Sirhan, Dr. Daniel Schwartz, who interviewedDavid Berkowitz, and hypnosis expert Dr. Milton Kline. All of that became mootwhen, on June 22, 1981, Chapman told the judge he was changing his plea toguilty. He told the judge that God had told him to plead guilty. His plea wasaccepted, and there was therefore never a trial in the murder of John Lennon.In mid-August 1981, Chapman suddenly went berserk. He began screaming at otherprisoners, tearing up his Bible and attempting to flush it down the toilet inhis cell, which caused it to overflow. He splashed the water from the toilet atthe guards, tore off his clothes, and started screaming like a monkey. (Shadesof the Sirhan Sirhan hypnosis session with Dr. Diamond!) It took six men tosubdue him, and bundle him off to Bellevue, New York’s famous mental hospital.In the ambulance on the way, he spoke to his guards in two entirely differ- entdemonic voices, named Lila and Dobar. 50They said they had been sent to him bySatan.After he was injected with anti-psychotics, the demonic presences began to fade,but not disappear entirely. He was visited by clergymen and prison chaplains ofvarious denominations; all were convinced that Chapman was possessed by demons,a claim that only made Chapman angry.On August 24, 1981 he was sentenced to twenty-to-life at Attica.In Attica, in 1982, he began to invoke Satan again. His wife visited him andtried to exorcise the demons herself, but to no avail. Eventually, Chapman’sdemons faded once again, and he became somewhat normal.Then, in 1983, the demons returned. Chapman began to invoke Satan for eighteenstraight months, composing hymns and praying to the demonic forces day andnight. He became so violent, that he was taken to Marcy, a mental hospital forconvicts. They used anti-psychotics again, and brought him back to Attica.But the demons returned.Finally, in 1985, the exorcism of Mark David Chapman began in earnest. Aminister would stand outside the prison in the middle of the night and beginthe ritual, while Chapman would try to cooperate inside his prison cell at thesame time.51 The exorcism sessions finally worked, and Chapman slowly beganto recover after vomiting up six demons, fluids leaking from his mouth as hewrithed on the floor of his cell, snarling in arcane languages unknown to him.He was cured. He was little Regan, safe at last.A DAY IN THE LIFEIn June of 1989, a stalker named Robert John Bardo—armed with a copy of TheCatcher in the Rye and a Charter Arms .38—walked up to actress Rebecca Schaefferand blew her away. But he was not the first to imitate MarkDavid Chapman.In the crowds gathered outside The Dakota to mourn the loss of John Lennon, asthey still do every year on Lennon’s birthday and on the anniversary of the dayhe was shot, another man joined the throngs outside the infamous apartmentbuilding; another man stared up at the building, gazed at the crowds of peoplearound him, many of whom were openly weeping, and silently plotted his owndesperate act. Standing on the street across from the entrance where John Lennonwas gunned down that December was John Hinckley, Jr. To avenge the murder ofJohn Lennon, and win the admiration of Taxi Driver star Jodie Foster, he wouldattempt to assassinate President Ronald Reagan.… I made a list of 50 total coincidences, things that were pretty frighteningbecause there was no way that they could have been planned, no way that I couldhave set them up. It was like the whole killing was set up by destiny, justsomething that was meant to be.… It was just eerie, like something more wasgoing on than I had ever envisioned. Like it was out of my control. It was likeall of those coincidences were not only confirmed, but they were magnified athousand times and enlightened and new angles and nuances and the whole purposewas given to me to understand.—Mark David Chapman52Coincidence or, as Jung would have it, synchronicity. It is the first layer ofevidence that what we are dealing with is something other than a normal, linear,cause-and-effect dynamic underlying the warp and woof of creation; it is thefirst level of experience that can be reliably expected to obtain when occultpractices are employed, or when violent acts are accompanied by reli- giousfervor. It is what one sees when there is a strain in the fabric of reality,when time or space stretches or contracts, when terrible deeds are committed bylittle men.Once again, we are forced to consider: are the coincidences that surround MarkDavid Chapman evidence of a political conspiracy to murder John Lennon? Thatwould be the scientific view, accepting for the moment that we reject the notionof “coincidence” as being itself unscientific. Or are they evidence of theworkings of another force in the universe? Is a coinci- dence simply the line ofleast resistance, the shortest distance between two phenomenological points? Aswe will see, the ancients had a special way of dealing with coincidences: theycodified them into something they called “correspondences,” and consciouslyemployed the phenomena to attain specific goals.Are there people—individuals, or organizations—that, consciously orunconsciously, employ these techniques today?It is not known whether Chapman ever saw Taxi Driver, a film that was releasedin 1976 to much critical acclaim, and this at a time when he was struggling withhis relationship with his fiancée and his university courses, months before hehad cut and run to Hawaii. One wonders if he would have found any resonancebetween the character of Travis Bickle and his own situation. Travis Bickle is adesperately lonely man, a nobody, like Chapman. He has a hard time with humanrelationships, as does Chapman. He has a very ambiguous sexual identity, as doesChapman. He gorges on junk food and alcohol, as does Chapman. He begins todevelop a plan to assassinate an important figure, as does Chapman. He buysweapons, conceals them on his person, and goes out to commit an assassination.In Travis Bickle’s case, he does not manage to kill the political candidate, butis run off before he can draw his weapon.Taxi Driver was based, in part, on the George Wallace assassination attemptcommitted by Arthur Bremer, and on Bremer’s diary. Thus, it was a case of artimitating life. Bremer had used a Charter Arms .38 revolver, the same make andmodel as that later used by Mark David Chapman.Bremer had attempted his assassination of Wallace on May 15, 1972. His CharterArms revolver only held five bullets, like that used by Chapman eight yearslater. Yet, Wallace was struck by a minimum of four bullets, and pos- sibly allfive. Taking into consideration the fact that three other people were wounded inthe same fusillade, it would appear that at least eight bullets had been fired,which immediately raises the ugly specter of a second shooter, and thus of aconspiracy. Wallace himself always claimed that he was the victim of aconspiracy that day.In addition, Bremer’s fingerprints were not found on the gun retrieved at thescene, even though the famous film footage of him shooting Wallace shows he wasbare-handed and not wearing gloves. An FBI agent retrieved it, not from Bremer,but from the ground where the assassination attempt had taken place, and held onto it for hours. No one knows why.Like Chapman, Bremer traveled extensively in the days leading up to the murder;this for a man whose jobs were as a busboy in a restaurant and as a janitor. Infact, Bremer had also flown to New York City (from Milwaukee) and stayed at theWaldorf-Astoria Hotel, the same hotel favored by Chapman on his original trip toNew York.In the days leading up to the Wallace attempt, Bremer had bought a second- handcar, took a helicopter ride around New York City, rented limousines, boughtweapons, etc., all on a busboy’s salary. Records of his hotel stays, bills, etc.were seized by the FBI and not made available to the press.Bremer’s half-sister—Gail Aiken—was a close associate of Reverend Jerry Owen,the man who befriended Sirhan Sirhan in the days leading up to the RobertKennedy assassination: yet another minister of religion with mysteri- ous tiesto assassination and murder. Reverend Owen was believed to be one of the sourcesof income for Sirhan Sirhan, and one of the members of the assassinationconspiracy, according to researchers Turner and Christian. The net draws tighterand tighter.And so it goes.On March 30, 1981, John Hinckley, Jr.—strongly influenced by Taxi Driver (basedin part on Bremer) and by Chapman’s murder of John Lennon—at- tempted toassassinate President Ronald Reagan, armed with a revolver and a copy of TheCatcher in the Rye. A case of life imitating art imitating life. And, like thefictional Travis Bickle, he does not succeed in his assassination attempt.From Bremer to Hinckley, by way of Chapman.The Hinckley family knew the Bush family; both were in the oil business.Hinckley’s father had an appointment the day of the Reagan assassination attemptwith George Bush’s brother in West Virginia. The net draws even tighter. This iseither evidence of a political conspiracy or simply another coincidence … but inour case, we must look at coincidence very carefully, for it usually representsthe action of a deeper, more sinister force.Diane, when two events happen simultaneously pertaining to the same object ofinquiry, we must always pay strict attention.—Special Agent Dale Cooper, Twin Peaks, pilot episodeThe shooters are all invariably nemos, nobodies. Stunted personalities. Easy tomanipulate, either by government forces or by … other forces. They are attractedto conspiracies because they see in them an entrée into the working world, theworld where things happen and where people are fully-realized personalities.They seek the missing piece of themselves, filling the empti- ness with a gun.They seek spiritual transformation. They are told (either by a government agent,or by the very culture itself ) that they can become whole by absorbing thelife-essence of a great man, a great warrior whose blood they drink, whose liverthey eat. As the Mass says, Hic est corpus meum; hic est enim calix sanguinemmeam. It is the oldest ritual of the shamans, the consumption of a God.And it is the most dangerous message of the sinister forces, that there isnothing behind the curtain or the icon screen; that the Wizard is a fraud; thatthere is, in short, no God but Man. What was meant to liberate has now enslaved,for its message has been perverted by Men who wish to be known as Gods — whoreserve Godhead for themselves — filling the vacuum of belief with naïve faithand the fascist mantra that “there’s no place like home.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Jack Jones, Let Me Take You Down, Villard Books, NY, 1992, p. 216 2 Fenton Bresler, Who Killed John Lennon?, St Martin’s, NY, 1989, p. 312 3 Russ Bellant, Old Nazis, The New Right, and The Republican Party, South EndPress, Boston, 1991, p. 68 4 August Strindberg, Inferno, Penguin, NY, 1979, p. 250 5 Ibid., p.23 6 Gary Sick, October Surprise, Times Books, NY, 1991, p. 210 7 Ibid., p. 75 8 Steven Levy, The Unicorn’s Secret, Prentice Hall Press, NY, 1988, p. 130 9 Quoted in Paul Krassner, Confessions of a Raving Unconfined Nut, Simon andSchuster, NY, 1993, p. 215 10 Ibid., p. 215 11 Bresler, op. cit., p. 322 12 Jones, op. cit., p. 125 13 Ibid., p. 121 14 Ibid., p. 122 15 Ibid., p. 12 16 Ibid., p. 123 17 Ibid., p. 123 18 Ibid., p. 125-6 19 Ibid., p. 131 20 Ibid., p. 131 21 Patricia Cornwell, Portrait of a Killer, Little, Brown, London, 2002, p.178-9 22 Bresler, op. cit., p. 116-121 23 Jones, op. cit., p. 209 24 Bresler, op. cit., p. 125 25 Jones, op. cit., p. 209 26 Bresler, op. cit., p. 121 27 Jones, op. cit., p. 204 28 Bresler, op. cit., p. 125 29 Jones, op. cit., p. 135 30 Bresler, op. cit., p. 217 31 Ibid., p. 150-151 32 Ibid., p. 150 33 Ibid., p. 151 34 Jones, op. cit., p. 171 35 Ibid., p. 220-221 36 Ian Hamilton, In Search of J.D.

He said that “ideologicalconflicts” had “swirled about this nation for half a century,” i.e., since about1945. Further, he warned that the nation was on the verge of breaking out into“ideological warfare in which the very foundations of our republic arethreatened.” This can not be understood without reference to the last days ofthe Second World War, and the polarization of the two most powerful Americanpolitical parties on either side of the right-versus-left conflict, as Naziswere being recruited into the American intelligence, aerospace, medical andscientific establishments as a means of combating the Communist threat.Deep into the Clinton presidency, a right-wing ideologue was giving voice towhat a generation of conservatives and rightist Republicans feared most: thatwith the collapse of the Soviet Union and the demonstration that Com- munism waspolitically bankrupt, America would not take the initiative and extend itshegemony—even, according to some, its imperialism—over the rest of the world. Tothe Republicans, the Democrats were throwing away the one best chance Americahad to bring the entire world to heel. This conflict of opinions, of “truebelievers” from both sides, would result in the catastrophes of the earlytwenty-first century, and in particular, the invasion of Iraq under a Republicanpresident who is the son and heir of former CIA Director George Bush.As detailed in Book One, this was, indeed, an ideological conflict, and it wassupported by powerful and influential individuals and organizations in theUnited States, with their ideology exported abroad in the support of viciousdictatorships of every stripe: essential elements of a “bulwark against Com-munism.” Even as members of the American intelligentsia in science andmedicine—notably space science and psychiatric medicine—were probing the farreaches of space and the deep secrets of the human mind, American political andreligious leaders were leading the popular charge at home and abroad in the openforum.Taken together, this was nothing less than a redesign of the American politi-cal and religious environment, an attempt to create a new country, one worthy ofthe mantle of global liberator, a liberator with its eyes on the domination notonly of the world, but of space, as well. And, in order to create this newcountry, this new spiritual paradigm with new rules of engagement and a strangenew morality in which some of the most brutal regimes the world has everknown—the Nazis and the Imperial Japanese—would become our allies against“godless Communism” and the “yellow peril,” we had to take measures that wereharsh and ruthless.The war against Communism took more out of American society than the war againstNazism. For one thing, it lasted much longer and, as Communism was an“international” enemy and painted as more truly an ideological enemy thanNazism, anyone could be a Communist. Your neighbor, your boss, your employee,your brother, your senator and even—in the eyes of some—your president. Americaturned inward upon itself in its search for socialists, Com- munists, “reds” ingeneral and their fellow-travelers. While Eleanor Roosevelt and Albert Einsteinand Helen Douglas were in New York City raising conscious- ness and voiceagainst the importation of war criminals under the Operation Paperclip program,the Dulles brothers and Richard Nixon were plotting an extension of that programto include thousands more. It was an ideological conflict that perhaps had itsorigins in American history decades if not centuries earlier, but which onlybecame refined and fine-tuned during the war years.We may say it was a Republican versus Democrat conflict, and in one sense thisis true. The Republican Party had not been slow to support Nazism, as has beensubstantiated not only in Book One, but also in reports by other authors and insubstantial documentation over the past fifty years. The Democratic Party hasresisted this type of immoral realpolitik for a long time. In general, itsleaders have supported human rights issues at home and abroad—whether in deed orin mere lip-service—and have resisted corporate America’s attempts to give thecountry a make-over into its own, grey-flannel image. When critics of Democraticleaders itemize their complaints, they are generally in terms of politicalcorruption (gerrymandering, pork barrel politics, bribes, and the like) andissues of sexual morality: character issues rather than policy issues. Forexample, Presidents Kennedy and Clinton have been pilloried in the conservativepress because of real or imagined sexual adventurism.Many consider this sheer hypocrisy: Kennedy was seen as dangerous to whitehegemony in the United States with his, and especially his brother Robert’s,support of integration; Clinton and (especially) his activist wife, HillaryRodham, were seen as too popular among the black and Latino vot- ers, and amongwomen in general.While it would be the grossest sort of hyperbole to suggest that Republicans areNazis and racists, and that Democrats are loving humanitarians, there is sometruth to the notion that the Republican Party is the party of corporate America,and this generally means white America. When attacks are made on Democraticleaders for purely political reasons, the attacks seem weak and unpopular. Whenattacks are made for social reasons—religion, sex, “character” issues—then theattacks become more confident, more virulent. Character issues are seen asspiritual ones, even theological ones.Republicans are seen as the party of the corporation, big business, wealth.Democrats are seen as supporters of the labor unions, the poor, blue collarworkers, racial minorities. It is, therefore, very difficult for many to viewthe Republican Party as anything but an oppressor of the poor, minorities andlabor ... even though the large corporations that support the Republican Partyare the source of jobs and technology that employ the workers. This is a sim-plistic view, but it is one that holds true for many people. The reinvention ofthe Republican Party in the last twenty years or so has been largely due to itshijacking of Democrat platforms and its apparent move towards the center underthe neo-conservatives (to the dismay of old-line conservatives), just as theDemocratic Party was losing the support of the very people it was supposed todefend against the rabidity of the Republicans. This took place against abackdrop of a frightening increase in crime, in the proliferation of drugs, il-legal aliens (the terrestrial kind), unwed mothers, and AIDS. The Americanpeople—terrified at these domestic developments—turned towards the “law andorder” Republicans to defend them against these threats to “homeland security.”The taking of the hostages in Iran during Carter’s Democratic administration wasjust one more indication that the Democrats were not the people to protectAmericans and American interests.We then had eight years of Ronald Reagan, and four of George H.W. Bush.Predictably, word of secret deals, guns-for-hostages, drugs-for-guns, and otherskullduggery leaked out, and we had the spectacle of Iran-Contra and the rumorsof an October Surprise. America learned that it was secretly arming drug dealersand guerrillas to fight against the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua, even thoughit was against the law to do so without the approval of Congress. Americalearned that people in positions of power and influ- ence (non-electedpositions) had nothing but disdain and contempt for the elected officials ofCongress. America learned that it had agreed to sell arms to Iran, the samecountry that had taken Americans hostage in a humiliating orgy of nationalism.America learned that the White House operated on quite another level, one ofrealpolitik, one that did not respect Congress and the laws it had passed. Butthen, what did we expect of a Party that had held its1980 National Convention in Dallas, not far from the spot where the most popularDemocratic president of recent memory was assassinated?And then there were the savings and loan scandals, in which even a Bush familymember was indicted for his participation in a series of corrupt businesspractices that led to the collapse of the Silverado S&L. America was suddenly indebt up to its ears due to the S&L crisis, which was engineered by Ronald Reaganwhen he enacted sweeping banking “reforms” that opened loopholes in thepractices of savings institutions large enough to drive police wagons through.It was business as usual. And it became too much. Too much busi- ness. Too muchof the usual:Item: May 1985. Reagan at the Nazi cemetery in Bitberg, Germany.

A flurry of news reports concerning a heavy concentra-tion of Nazis on presidential candidate George Bush’s newly-formed Coalition ofAmerican Nationalities, including the usual grouping of Romanian Iron Guard-ists, Ukrainian SS supporters, Croatian Nazis, and Holocaust-denial activists.This list includes Fred Malek, who, when working for the Nixon White House,compiled an enemies list of “Jewish sounding names.” Malek resigned his posi-tion as Bush advisor immediately. He would eventually—and quietly—enter theadministration after the election of George Bush.The comfort of Republicans—and particularly the conservative wing—around Nazisand Nazism was (and is) unsettling.But, hey... the Soviet Union fell. The Berlin wall fell. China becameincreasingly capitalist. Talks were held with Communist Vietnam with an eyetowards trade. The enemies that the Republicans had warned about, sometimesshrilly, since 1945 were now disappearing. The Red Menace and the Yellow Perilwere things of the past. We even witnessed the shocking scene of Brent Scowcroftin Beijing a month after the brutal Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, toastingthe Chinese leaders at the request of self-proclaimed China expert andformer-Ambassador to China (briefly), President George Bush. Although Americalaid sanctions against China for the massacre (most Demo-crats were outraged at the wanton slaughter of students and pro-Democracysupporters), Bush ensured that his older brother—Prescott, Jr.—was still able tobroker a deal between the Chinese government and Hughes Aircraft forthe sale of communications satellites, when other American companies were barredfrom so doing. It was a New World Order, indeed. The Republicans had made theworld safe for… well, Republicans.And then along came Bill Clinton.No matter what side of the fence you’re on, you have to admit that there hasnever been as vicious, as concentrated a campaign to destroy a presidentialcandidate—and, then, a president—as there was with Bill Clinton. The emotions hearoused in his enemies were visceral, rabid, hysterical to the point ofpathology. The fact that Clinton was re-elected and served his full eight years,even surviving an impeachment process, is testament more to his popularity amongthe rank and file American voters than it is to the lack of effort or focus ofhis enemies. During the Clinton administration, America prospered. That wassupposed to be a Republican gimmick. Just as the Republicans tried to co-opt theDemocratic Party platforms by loudly proclaiming a return to “family values”(this, in the Party of Newt Gingrich and his famous divorce from hishospitalized, bed-ridden wife), it seems the Democrats had taken a page from theRepublican book and reminded themselves, “It’s the economy, stupid.”When Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton announced for the presidency, thescramble began to defeat him before he ever went to a single primary, much lessthe convention. Clinton, after all, had avoided the draft during the VietnamWar. Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar who went to Oxford. Clin- ton spoke Germanfluently. He was obviously the wrong person to have as the Commander-in-Chief ofthe Armed Forces, which title comes with the Presidency. He was brilliant; heopposed the Vietnam War; he had a famous photograph of himself shaking the handof President Kennedy; he had an accomplished and attractive wife (who hadactually worked for a Watergate investigator) and a young daughter; he was afriend of racial minorities; and … he played the saxophone. He even admitted hehad smoked pot, although he famously declared he “didn’t inhale.” Looking at theClintons, one could not help but be reminded of the Kennedys. And there isnothing the Republican Party hates more than the Kennedy clan.Clinton had to be stopped.The story of the 1990s is that of how Clinton could not be stopped, no matterhow much money and influence the Republicans and conservatives threw at theproblem. It is not a story in which the Republican Party covered itself withglory. It is, in fact, the story of how the opposition to Clinton became socrazed that it didn’t care how much America itself was humiliated in theprocess, giving rise to some speculation that the Republican Party has anotheragenda. Hillary Rodham Clinton was not spared the vitriolic characterassassinations, either. An extremely intelligent and well-spoken First Lady, sheepitomized the New Woman who could hold a prestigious job in law and still makea home for her husband and daughter, as well as find time to write a book on theproblems of raising children in the new society: It Takes a Village. But as theRepublican Party and especially the powerful Conservative wing mounted pressureon the Clintons both in personal as well as in policy terms, it was as if wewere reliving that moment from the Vietnam War in which we heard that awfulaxiom: we had to destroy the village in order to save it.It is also a story of how many Democrats lost their nerve and began to distancethemselves from a President whose only crime—the only one ever proven after theexpenditure of more than forty million dollars of taxpayer money and untoldinvestigative man-hours over the course of more than eight years—was that of asex act with Monica Lewinsky and his denial of same under oath. Essentially, itwas the Profumo affair all over again, but minus the Communists.In order to understand what happened to America during the Clintonadministration—and without taking sides one way or another on Clinton’spresidency, character, or accomplishments (or lack thereof )—we will see many ofthe same old faces reappear, like unsettled ghosts, in the American hauntedhouse. We will have to look back once again to the first Nixon campaign andNixon’s mentor, Murray Chotiner. We have to go back and watch the slurry ofChristian fundamentalists and charismatics around first Nixon and then Reaganand Bush, watch their influence over this story, and how they played true toform and supported some of the worst mass murderers in history. We have toremember how German Christians were duped and “played” by the Nazis into givingtheir support to the Third Reich (or, if not their support, then their studiedneutrality) and watch the same strategy taking place again, in the America ofthe 1990s as—in the words of Sara Diamond—a famous televangelist “establishedfor the Christian Right the standard message of tying one’s personal redemptionto a gospel of political participation.” 4We have to investigate the moniedfamilies of America, some of the same families who swirled around the séancetables of Andrija Puharich and Stephen Ward.We have to evoke sinister forces.GOING UP RIVER“They were laying on hands,” an American aid worker recalls, “speaking intongues and holding services while people were dying all around.”—“Jewels for Jesus: Zaire, Mobutu and Pat Robertson” by Andrew Purvis,Time magazine, February 27, 1994In Book One, we examined the development of the psychological warfare operationsof the American military from World War II and extending through Vietnam. Whatwe did not focus on then was the growing importance of evangelical Christianityas a venue for psychological operations against target nations, using resourcesthat had “plausible deniability” written all over them. It was the influence ofsuch Christian propaganda efforts as the Far East Broadcasting Company’s radiostations beaming messages into Communist China (as one example) that led to agrowing presence of the Christian Right within U.S. intelligence andpsychological warfare operations around the world, often with chilling effect.5Although we described the cynical manipulation of Congolese spiritual beliefs byU.S. intelligence forces, we did not take that argument to its logicalconclusion: the ability to manipulate American spiritual beliefs the same way,and for similar ends. We shall do so now, and with the prime example being PatRobertson’s Christian Broadcast Network (CBN) and his Christian Coalition.In Book One, we cited in some detail a special report on African occultismprepared by the Special Operations Research Office (SORO) at American Uni-versity, a paper commissioned by the US Army that was entitled “Witchcraft,Sorcery, Magic and Other Psychological Phenomena and Their Implications onMilitary and Paramilitary Operations in the Congo,” by James R. Price and PaulJureidini. This paper—prepared in 1964—was focused specifically on events in theCongo, where a young Army Chief of Staff tried to consolidate his power base andcreate a new country.Previously, Patrice Lumumba had been the leader of the newly-independentDemocratic Republic of the Congo, a country that had once been known as the“Belgian Congo” and which had gained its independence from Belgium officially onJune 30, 1960. Lumumba was a charismatic speaker and firebrand, and largelybelieved to be a supporter of the Soviet Union and its brand of Communism. Ofcourse, this volte-face had happened after Lumumba (in a replay of circumstancessurrounding Ho Chi Minh’s similar request of the United States in the 190s) requested UN support to defend his country from an insurrection in southernKatanga province, a “native” insurrection bolstered by the sudden appearance ofcrack Belgian paratroopers. The UN turned him down, even though they had senttroops immediately to Leo- poldville. Their mandate, Lumumba was informed, wasto protect the new country from foreign aggression, but not from its internalproblems. The fact that these “internal problems” also involved the presence ofBelgian troops did not matter to the UN. Feeling betrayed, he was forced to goto Russia for help to prop up his administration, and the Soviets sent troops tohelp Lumumba put down the insurrection.Thus, his government was seen as hostile to the United States. Long before theSORO paper had been prepared and digested, however, it had been up to anotheragency of the government to take steps to remove Lumumba from power, toterminate him with “extreme prejudice.” This agency, of course, was the CIA,under orders from President Eisenhower. And the man who flew to Africa to putthis plan into motion was none other than Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, the man in chargeof MK-ULTRA.Under orders from Richard Bissell, head of CIA Clandestine Services at the time,Gottlieb flew to the Congo in 1960, and hand-carried an infectious agentdesigned to kill Lumumba and make it look as if he had simply con- tracted alocal, fatal disease.6 His asset in the Congo—career CIA agent Larry Devlin—wasunable (or unwilling7) to infect Lumumba in time, however; but the die—or thespell—was cast.Mobutu—Lumumba’s Army Chief of Staff—took over the country on September 14,1960, barely two-and-a-half months after its independence from Belgium. Lumumbahimself was mysteriously assassinated on or about January 17, 1961. His body wasnever found. According to one source, Lu- mumba—who had been arrested and takento an out-of-the-way military base—was chopped into pieces and dissolved inacid, either by Belgian spe- cialists who wanted to remove all traces of theassassination8 or on the advice of Congolese shamans so that his spirit wouldnot haunt Mobutu or the new republic. 9By November of 1965, the psy-warwitchdoctors—in concert with Mobutu’s witchdoctors—had won the day and made theCongo (renamed Zaire) safe for democracy, and Zaire safe for Mobutu (like PapaDoc Duvalier of Haiti, and Augusto Pinochet of Chile, a “president for life”)for another thirty-two years.What happened next could have been predicted by anyone who has spent any time atall in Africa. Mobutu changed his name from Joseph Desire Mobutu to Mobutu SeseSeko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga, “The All- Powerful Warrior Who Goes from Conquestto Conquest, Leaving Fire in His Wake.” He re-instated African religious andcultural practices in his new nation, considering anything else to be thetrappings of colonialism. (As an example, Congolese were banned from wearingneckties and western dress.) In the process he became a leader equivalent to theDuvaliers in Haiti or Marcos in the Philippines, stripping his country of itsnatural resources and hoarding the proceeds in Swiss and Belgian banks. (It wasMobutu’s reign that inspired the creation of the term “kleptocracy.”) Althoughaccounts of his reign are largely concerned with his greed—his personal worthhas been estimated in the billions of US dollars—most studies (such as MichelaWrong’s otherwise entertaining In The Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz) ignore Mobutu’ssecret police, the torture of political dissidents, the ruthless exterminationof the opposition, and the murderous events of 1990, when more than 200 studentswere gunned down by Mobutu’s security forces at a pro-democracy rally at theUniversity of Lubumbashi. They ignore his administration’s support of theRwandan Hutu rebels who massacred the Tutsi minority in one of the worst casesof bloodshed and genocide the African continent has known in the past century.A man who claimed vicious Romanian president Nicolae Ceausescu as his personalfriend, this was the African leader adopted by American Christian fundamentalistand right-wing demagogue televangelist Pat Robertson as his idol.And business partner.To come to grips with this story is to begin to understand the depth of humandepravity in the face of wealth. It is written in the Bible that “the love ofmoney is the root of all evil” (1 Timothy 6:10), and while that may seem like anoverstatement to some, it is certainly close enough to the truth to get us home.We have to say that either the opulence of Mobutu’s personal wealth blindedRobertson to the truth of his regime, or that Robertson simply didn’t care.After all, he was no stranger to Africa and its problems. His businessenterprises there involved everything from logging to diamonds, and it wasdiamonds that lured Robertson to Zaire, a country famous for the stones that area girl’s best friend. And, while diamonds may be forever, Mobutu certainlywasn’t, and as his regime began to fail in the face of popular uprisings,invasions, a disaffected army, and waning support from the West, Robertson’sfortunes in Africa also dried up; but not before rumors began to spread of hiscynical exploitation of the humanitarian efforts in Zaire as a mask for hisbusiness activities.This is the Christian minister who would throw his support behind theconservative movement to discredit the Clinton administration by accusing it ofhaving masterminded the murders of 200 individuals over the course of theArkansas politician’s career: two hundred unproven, unverified, unsubstantiatedhomicides, which were more the product of feverish imaginations than crime sceneevidence and grand jury subpoenas. Two hundred fictitious murders over a longpolitical career, up against what his close personal friend Mobutu had actuallyaccomplished in a single day with his army at the Uni- versity of Lubumbashi.We read previously of the Christian minister-turned-socialist Jim Jones, who ledhis followers to death in the Guyanese jungles. Only a few years later,Robertson would travel to Zaire in the midst of war, disease and starvation… and ignore the plight of the suffering to take care of his burgeoning busi-ness deals in the diamond mines. He would use his religious organization as acover for his more material pursuits, taking whatever he could get out ofZairean jungles before the insurrections and corruption made it impossible toleave with his fortune intact.One of the little known sidebars to the story of World War II is that of the warin Africa. Once Belgium had been occupied by the Nazis, its colony in Africa—theBelgian Congo—also should have come under Nazi control. While Field MarshalRommel was busy fighting a hit-and-run campaign across North Africa, there was amore shadowy campaign being waged in the Congo, in the heart of Conrad’s “heartof darkness.”The Congo was valuable to the war effort for two reasons, one obvious and theother not-so-obvious, at least at the time. In the first case, it was thediamonds. Diamonds are an important commodity during war, as they can be used inindustrial applications to further the war machine: as cutters in machine tools,as abrasives, and in a variety of other uses such as guidance systems and otherelectronics. They are also, of course, a means of barter and trade whencurrencies collapse due to invasions and insurrections. The Congo has theworld’s largest diamond reserves outside of South Africa, and when the Naziscame into power in Belgium they foresaw coming into this large fortune as well …if they could secure it. Although they were nominally in charge of Belgium andmade it part of the Third Reich, they did not have physical control of theAfrican colony. The Nazi military had other problems in Africa of a moreimmediate nature, and were not there in sufficiently large numbers to invade theCongo in order to control the diamond trade; but they didn’t have to.There was a large black market in diamonds, and the American OSS saw this astheir opportunity to work in concert with the South African diamond giantDeBeers to thwart the Germans and gain control of the world’s diamond supply.DeBeers, for its part, intended to drain the Congo dry of diamonds with Alliedcooperation, in order to protect its own native reserves in South Africa frompremature depletion. At the same time, DeBeers was actively smuggling diamondsto the Third Reich and making money from both sides in the conflict, ignoringRoosevelt’s repeated requests for a guaranteed diamond stockpile in the UnitedStates or, at the very least, in Canada. By the time the OSS had learned of thedetails of the DeBeer black market network, the war was almost over and theurgency declined.It would be to these diamond mines that Pat Robertson would resort, fifty yearsafter the war’s end, in a botched—but expensive—attempt to make his own fortune.At the same time, there was that other commodity in the Congo, one that made itof such importance that Albert Einstein would write a letter to Washington,begging the Roosevelt administration to do all it could to protect that countryfrom Nazi invasion. This, of course, was uranium. The Manhattan Project was infull swing, and the weapons-grade uranium that would eventually be used to buildthe two atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan in August 1945 did indeed comefrom the Congo.With the end of World War II came the end of the Nazi occupation of Bel- gium.The Congo remained in Belgian control, but the times were changing and the endof the period of colonialism was near. Great Britain was losing control in Indiaand Malaya, and Belgium was on the ropes in Africa. By the1960s, the colonies would be liberated … but at the same time find themselves inthe midst of tremendous internal struggles.The Congo was no exception. Civil war was tearing the country apart, and intothis madness stepped Patrice Lumumba. With his eventual arrest andassassination, the Congo was not entirely free of internecine conflict. Mobutuwould not become leader of his country for another five years, years of intensefighting in the Congo’s provinces ... and of intense spell-casting bygovernment-approved shamans, if the above-mentioned SORO document is anyindication. Into this nightmare of war and bloodshed many adventurers andentrepreneurs would find themselves a home. One of these was Siegfried “Congo”Mueller.Shown in an East German film of the 1960s, Der Lachende Mann (“The LaughingMan”), Mueller was a former Nazi and present-day mercenary who found himself“defending civilization” in the Congo’s civil wars. He was interviewed by twoEast German filmmakers, who pretended they thought favorably of the Third Reich,and he opened himself up to them, smiling and laughing, smoking cigarettes anddrinking from a glass of Pernod as he described his enthusiastic contribution tothe savagery taking place all around him. The film was released in 1967 to somecritical acclaim, but it was an East German offering and received very littleattention in the West, which, after all, was satisfied that Lumumba was dead andthat Mobutu—an anti-Com- munist and friend of the United States—was safely incharge of the Congo, now renamed Zaire.Africa has always been a haven for military adventurism, whether of thehome-grown or the imported variety. The mercenaries taking part in insurrectionsin Angola, Rhodesia, Mozambique and Namibia are the stuff of legend. The Biafranconflict in Nigeria provided mercenaries with employment on both sides of thatconflict. The famous Selous Scouts of South Africa provided another opportunityfor blood and money, if not glory. Tribal conflicts became inflated to nationalconflicts; revolution became civil war, became indepen- dence, became civil war,became revolution, in a sickening spiral of violence and deceit and greed thatwould characterize African politics for generations. Add to that religious andethnic rivalries, economic competition, foreign manipulation of all sides inevery struggle, and you have an excellent laboratory for weapons, tactics, andpsychological warfare experimentation.The Nazis who escaped justice at the end of World War II wound up in LatinAmerica, North America, and Australia in large numbers. Many of these wereprotected by Allied intelligence agencies, as has been covered at length and indepth in many other studies, including my own Unholy Alliance. That Naziscientists and criminals wound up assisting the governments of the Arab world isalso not in doubt. The activities of Otto Skorzeny, Hitler’s commando, in Egypt,Syria and other North African and Middle Eastern countries are well-known. Theassistance of these men in the development of Arab missile and weapons programshas changed the balance of power in that troubled region.The presence of Nazi war criminals in Africa has rarely been addressed, if onlybecause Africa itself is still a “heart of darkness” for most Americans andEuropeans, a treacherous land of incomprehensible intrigue. That Nazis such asSiegfried Mueller would have found their way to the Congo comes as no surprise.The opportunities for war and the spoils of war were too numerous.In addition, with the advent of Lumumba, the struggle became characterized as awar between Capitalism and Communism, between the “values” of the West versusthose of the East. The renegade Nazis came down squarely on the side of the Westand Capitalism, fighting their old enemy the Soviet Communists on thebattlegrounds of Katanga province. Enlisted to assist the efforts of the UnitedStates, and of the Belgian forces in the region, Nazimercenaries were only too glad to offer their expertise in torture,interrogation, and military drill. This is the dirty secret of the African warsof the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s. More attention has been paid to the presence ofNazi war criminals in Latin America, but the activities of Nazis in Africa, Asiaand Australia are only now coming to light in the literature.For instance, under Otto Skorzeny’s leadership, the Middle East became a safehaven for Nazis on the run. Moving there in 1953, Skorzeny managed to find postsfor a lot of his old friends. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, spiritual leader forthousands of Muslims in Palestine, had worked for Schellenberg’scounter-intelligence division of the SS. King Farouk of Egypt had collaboratedenthusiastically with the Nazis during the war years. Skorzeny became the “chiefmilitary adviser” to General Mohammed Naguib of the new republic in Egypt,selected and groomed for that position by an “unholy alliance” of former Nazispymaster and now head of the CIA’s anti-Soviet effort in Europe, ReinhardGehlen, and the CIA’s own Allen Dulles. Skorzeny began the happy task ofrecruiting as many former SS officers as he could find to fill the ranks of whatwould become Egyptian strongman Nasser’s secret police, including some fourhundred SS men as a special operations group involved in the train- ing ofPalestinian commandos for attacks across the Gaza Strip.10 Members of FieldMarshall Rommel’s Afrika Korps were also located and turned over to Nasser’scommand and, it is said, that some of these men were involved in the quietliquidation of Jews in Egypt in the 1950s.11 But, in addition to therank-and-file SS criminals sponsored by the Skorzeny/Nasser/Dulles triumvirate,there were also the superstars.These men included Adolf Eichmann, who sojourned in Egypt before moving on toArgentina; General Oskar Dirlewanger, the Butcher of Warsaw; Leopold Gleim, incharge of the SS in Poland; and, even more ominously, a gaggle of concentrationcamp medical men.Dr. Hans Eisele was Buchenwald’s medical officer, and he was recruited bySkorzeny together with Heinrich Willerman, his opposite number at Dachau. Thesemen formed a core of specialists in interrogation and torture techniques,seconded to the Egyptian secret service.12Thus, what is being revealed, slowly and painfully, is the degree to whichpsychological warfare, biological and chemical weapons, and mind-controlexperimentation have been exploited with reckless abandon throughout Africa, andwith the connivance not only of renegade Nazis but also of British and Americanscientists and government experts from Porton Downs and Fort Detrick ... whichimplies, of course, the participation of both British and American intelligenceagencies since these organizations are military bases operating under thetightest security measures in their respective countries. This CBW effort wasnot limited to Sid Gottlieb’s aborted attempt to kill Congo leader PatriceLumumba with a nasty virus in 1960.The depth and degree of the homicidal intent reaches much further into ournightmares. The existence of these programs in African countries being targetedby American intelligence agencies, as well as courted by American right-wingChristian organizations led by men like Pat Robertson, gives us the opportunityto witness what such programs could do when they were being expanded outsideAmerican territory, far from the reach of Congress and a disinterestedelectorate. We can see what these programs were intended to do, as theydeveloped, untrammeled, in the African bush. We can proceed behind theapologetic shrugs and embarrassed smiles of a Dick Helms or a Sid Gottliebbefore Congressional investigators, and go right where the fruits of theirlabors were being harvested. How else to really understand what MK-ULTRA and allthose acronyms were all about unless we see them in action? How else tovisualize the true nature of the “fifty years of ideological conflict” mentionedby Scaife unless we watch some of the combatants, the same people who wouldconduct pious crusades against Clinton and the Democrats for real or imaginedwrongs?We might as well begin with South Africa, therefore, a favorite destination ofNazis on the run, as the regime was eager to import as many able-bodied whitemen as possible, men who were not afraid to get their hands dirty. Or bloody. Wemight as well begin with the revelations of biological and chemical weapons use,which have poured out of that country in the years since the end of apartheid.We might as well begin with Project Coast.PROJECT COASTThe image of white-coated scientists, professors, doctors, dentists,veterinarians, laboratories, universities and front companies, propping upapartheid with the support of an extensive international network, was aparticularly cynical and chilling one.-- Final Report, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Volume Two, ChapterSix, “Special Investigation into Project Coast,” 29 October 1998In June and July of 1998, hearings were held in Cape Town, South Africa todetermine the extent of chemical and biological warfare programs in that countrywhen it was under apartheid rule. One does not automatically think of SouthAfrica when one discusses chemical and biological weapons, but during the era ofapartheid and before Nelson Mandela was released from prison and became thatcountry’s first black president, the Republic of South Africa pursued a “weaponsof mass destruction” campaign as serious as any other. In cooperation withforeign firms and agencies, the South African Defence Force (SADF) and its CBWproject leader—Dr. Wouter Basson—developed an arsenal of poisons, both chemicaland biological, for use against critics of the regime. The cabal in charge ofthis effort included the chief of staff of the defense force, the chief of staffof intelligence, and the surgeon general, as well as Dr. Basson. Thus, it was aprogram initiated and maintained at the highest levels of the South Africanmilitary and intelligence organs and was not a rogue effort by lower-levelstaffers.Ironically, the discovery of the true nature and scope of this program was madein virtually the same way investigator John Marks made his discovery of theMK-ULTRA documents: “The arrest of Dr. Basson and the seizure of four trunkscontaining documents related to Project Coast in January 1997 provided theCommission with proof that there was more to the programme than had initiallymet the eye” (Final Report, “Methodology”). Readers may recall that Marks’discovery of the MK-ULTRA documents was also based on four boxes of documentslong thought destroyed, and, in fact, crucial evidence regarding Project Coastwas likewise in the form of financial records...This cornucopia led to a major reappraisal of South Africa’s CBW program andrevealed links to foreign assistance that would prove embarrassing; soembarrassing, in fact, that the Deputy Minister of Defence tried to pres- surethe Commission to hold its hearings in camera so that they would not “jeopardiseinternational relations with countries which may have assisted the programme butwith whom South Africa continues to have diplomatic relations” (Final Report,“Methodology”). This request was denied, and the hearings were held in opencourt.The revelations were nothing short of sensational, in a perverse sort of way,e.g.,The discovery of a document which has become known as the ‘Verkope lys’ (saleslist) and a list of SADF sponsored (‘hard’) projects conducted at RoodeplaatResearch Laboratories provided the Commission with a clear indication that therewas an intent to poison individuals, and that the front company, RoodeplaatResearch Laboratories, was involved in the develop- ment of the toxins used forthis purpose.The toxins involved included “anthrax in cigarettes, botulinum in milk andparaoxon in whiskey—in the Commission’s view clearly murder weapons.”Even more bizarre was the baboon fetus.The inclusion of a baboon foetus on the list, dated late July 1989 (just priorto such a foetus being found in the garden of Archbishop Tutu’s house), as wellas a reference to chemical and biological operatives, indicated that the itemsmay well have found their way, directly or indirectly, into the hands ofoperatives of the Civil Co-operation Bureau (CCB).The CCB, of course, was the Orwellian-nomenclatured South African secret police,responsible for assassinations in other African countries as well as withinSouth Africa, and which maintained offices in Europe for monitor- inganti-apartheid activities and conducting operations against those who opposedwhite rule in South Africa. The CCB has claimed responsibility for numerousmurders in Africa, many of which were committed with toxins developed underProject Coast.Another front company for Project Coast and Dr. Basson was Delta G Scientific,which was involved in the development of street drugs such as ecstasy andmethaqualone. This was admittedly used for crowd control, but also forassassinations in which prisoners were injected with muscle relaxants … and thendropped from planes. In addition, Basson was sent to Croatia in 1991 during anegotiation to buy 500 kg of methaqualone from the Croatians (including“high-ranking government officials”), which was brought back to South Africa.This is the deal that eventually led to Basson’s arrest when he was discoveredholding $40 million worth of Vatican bearer bonds. His involvement in ProjectCoast gradually became revealed after his arrest (in Switzerland) and thediscovery of the four trunks of documents in his possession.But Croatia was not the only country on Basson’s list. He also visited Taiwan tomeet with CBW specialists there, as well as the United States, where—ac- cordingto the Commission documents—the South African surgeon general met in 1981 with“Americans who were part of the United States CBW programme”; these Commissiondocuments “demonstrate their willingness to assist the South Africans.” As areminder, this would have been during the Reagan administration and during thetime of the United States’ boycott of trade with South Africa.By 1993, both the American and the British governments were concerned about theSouth African program and approached the South African govern- ment with theseconcerns. The Commission found this approach “unclear.” According to Basson, thegovernments were afraid that the CBW program would fall into the hands of theAfrican National Congress after the 1994 election. The ANC was viewed by mostWestern governments as a Marxist front or, certainly, unfriendly to Europe andAmerica. Whether the approach was made at the level of the US State Departmentand the British Foreign Office, or whether it was an approach from nervousintelligence agencies who feared that documentation would reveal the true extentof their support for apartheid and the assassinations carried out in its name,is not known. A chemical-weapons attack on Mozambican forces in 1992 by SouthAfrican troops came dangerously close to exposing the true extent of SouthAfrica’s CBW program, and it is possible that the Fort Detrick and Porton Downsscientists rushed to cover up their involvement.The trial of Dr. Basson is, at the time of this writing, still underway. He hasbeen charged on numerous counts in connection with his Project Coast program,but the lack of direct evidence linking him specifically to murder andassassination may prove to be his salvation. Others were not so fortu- nate;members of the CCB are in prison in various countries under lengthy sentencesfor using the chemicals and toxins developed under Basson’s aegis. Other formermembers have become mercenaries, or are running “executive security”organizations, providing bodyguards for executives and security forces fordiamond mines, oil rigs, and other industrial concerns in Africa. We have notheard the last of this episode, nor of the CCB.JEWELS FOR JESUSIn the 1980s Shaba emerged as a key strategic outpost for the Reagan Doctrine.Report- edly, the CIA used an airstrip in the remote Shaban town of Kamina inorder to channel covert weapons into neighboring Angola. President Reagan hailedMobutu as “a voice of good sense and good will.” …“Ethnic cleansing” was theterm that Zaireans, diplomats, and aid workers used to explain the cramming oftens of thousands of hungry and destitute citizens into and around twofly-strewn railway stations in the mining towns of Likasi and Kolwezi. They wererefugees in their own country.…—Bill Berkeley, “Zaire: An African Horror Story,” The Atlantic Monthly, August1993Into this morass of murder and methaqualone, Nazis and neurologists, comes oneof the strangest white men ever to set foot on the Dark Continent. Less than ayear after the above lines appeared, Time magazine would print a storythat—taken in this context—is nothing less than shocking.When I began writing this book—more than twenty years ago—I considered writingit as a novel, since I was certain that no one would believe it as non-fiction.That was before revelations about Pat Robertson’s business dealings withPresident Mobutu and his cynical manipulation of relief efforts in Zaire madethe newsweeklies in the 1990s. Now, I am presented with an embarrassment ofriches. Truly, this is the stuff of fiction. Imagine Joseph Conrad-meets-ThomasPynchon. Or Paul Theroux-meets-Tom Robbins, All this, and against the backdropof an African Holocaust and a campaign to destroy a sitting American president.The cinematic possibilities are endless,but this story will never make it onto the silver screen. Too many reputationswould be ruined. Too many deaths avenged.Pat Robertson, the creator of the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), thefamous televangelist who once ran for the American presidency, is perhaps themost prominent spokesman for Fundamentalist Christianity in the United States.His 700 Club—with its Bible-oriented spin on world events—is watched by millionsnationwide. As the “ideological forces” invoked by Richard Mellon Scaife beganto polarize even more strongly in the 1980s and ’90s, it began to appear as ifthe Fundamentalist Christian Right was hijacking the moral high-ground, even asit was making its bed with conservative Republicanism.Soon, it would be difficult to find a Democrat in a Fundamentalist Christiancongregation. Democrats, after all, supported a woman’s right to choose in thecase of an unwanted pregnancy; Republicans were grudgingly supporting the Rightto Life movement of the anti-abortionists. That alone was enough of a religiousrallying point, enough to polarize a nation into those who supported abortion asan alternative to an unwanted pregnancy and those that preached that abortionwas murder.Democrats also numbered many ethnic minorities among their constituencies whoprofessed Roman Catholicism—the Irish, the Italians, the growing numbers ofLatin Americans—as well as Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Hinduism, etc.Republicans, on the other hand, traditionally attracted their numbers fromhigh-church Anglicans and other so-called WASPs (White Anglo-Saxon Protestants).That strategy was fine when neither women nor minorities nor teenagers had thevote. With the change in American demo- graphics, however, it behooved theRepublican Party to find a power base that was large in terms of numbers and notjust assets. The Supreme Court decision in Roe v Wade provided an excellentopportunity to drive a wedge between the Democratic Party—the party of the“people,” after all—and white American Protestants who were beginning to feeldisenfranchised by affirma- tive action, New Age mysticism, homosexual rights,crime in the streets, and bilingual education: i.e., the whole celebration ofthe “Other.”Further, with the waning of the Cold War in the advent of perestroika andglasnost and the eventual collapse of Soviet-style Communism, the Republicansneeded another agenda. Another enemy. It was time to consolidate their win-nings and take the show on the road. Waving Bibles and shouting, “In God WeTrust,” the post-Cold War bandwagon was just starting out of the gate whenPresident George H.W. Bush was defeated in his run for a second term in officeby the youthful, draft-dodging, womanizing Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton.Governor Clinton did not come from old money. In fact, he didn’t come from moneyat all. As the years of the Whitewater investigation demon- strated, theClintons couldn’t even successfully make money in real estate, not evenillegally. They were not members of the Old Boy’s Network of oil, manufacturing,or banking. They didn’t understand what was at stake. They didn’t understand howthe game was supposed to be played. They were the poor relations, outside theClub, who should only be allowed to stare into the windows at the old mensitting in the cracked leather chairs and smoking Havanas while reading theJournal. Clinton hadn’t even been in the military, for goodness’ sake. How wereyou supposed to deal with someone like that?This is not to suggest that Clinton was a saint, or that he was blameless in hispursuit of politics and the politician’s dream job, the White House. Becoming anAmerican president virtually guarantees a resume of dirty deals, backdoornegotiations, and accommodations with the less-than-savory. The spiritual stateof politicians is one of cynicism and choosing the lesser of two (or more)evils. Yet, the accommodations made by the Clintons in their ascension towardsthe White House were like those of every politician in the country; they did notinclude guns-for-hostages, drugs-for-guns, Nazis-in- hiding, and all the othermachinery of despair. There was no background of deals with oil-rich sheikhs,negotiations with mobsters, or “missing time” during the Kennedy assassination.Hillary Clinton, the successful lawyer from Chicago suburbs, had no skeletons inher closet, try as they might to find some. (The best the Right could do was topromote a rumor of lesbianism! Another sexual angle. And even then, it wasdropped for lack of any kind of evidence at all.) And as for Bill, there wereonly rumors of women, women, and more women. It was all they had on him, andeven then it wasn’t much. But sex seemed like the way to go; it was consistentwith the strategy of the conservative Right to attack the Democrats ingeneral—and Clinton in particular—on moral grounds. The sex issue seemed like anatural partner of the abortion issue, after all, and isn’t the depth of feelingon the part of some anti-abortionists related to the idea that these unwantedfetuses are the product of frenzied, unlicensed sexual activity? Every sexualact, according to the most conservative element of the Christian Right, must befor the sole purpose of procreation. There- fore the existence of an unwantedfetus is—in the terms of this debate—an oxymoron. Every fetus is the result of asex act, and every sex act must be for the purpose of making a fetus. Q.E.D.(The ancillary doctrine is, of course, that homosexuality, masturbation, analsex, and oral sex are also forbidden according to this rubric.)The ferocity of the conservatives’ attack against Clinton was remarkable for itslack of attack of political substance; it seemed as if, early on, they haddecided that a sexually-loaded campaign against Clinton would rally theChristian Right around their cause in sufficient numbers to have the Presidentimpeached. Sex, after all, is the great unspoken issue in American politics. Sexis used to sell a political candidate, and to dethrone him. We have no troubleimagining Democratic politicians having sex—the Kennedys in all their glory,Bill Clinton, even nervous Jimmy Carter had “adultery in his heart”—but the meresuggestion of a Richard Nixon or a Ronald Reagan or a George Bush having sex islikely to elicit either groans of horror or gales of laughter. The Grand OldParty does not produce party animals. Or so it did seem, until George W. Bushbecame president, and his documented background of drunk driving became anon-issue, as was the drinking and carousing (and arrest) of his underagedaughters.If we were to consult Foucault once again—as we did in Unholy Alliance— we wouldwonder if the dichotomy between Democrats and Republicans in general was that ofsex versus blood, respectively, since the crimes of which the Democrats areaccused are those of sexuality and its side-effects (love affairs, abortions,women scorned), and those of the Republicans are of blood (war, murder, andassassination). Love and death.All of this is just a setting for what comes next; providing a spiritual or atleast theological context for the spectacle of a cabal of conservative,right-wing industrialists and religious leaders waging war against an Americanpresident as if their lives depended on it, spending untold millions of USdollars in the process.Pat Robertson is not only a Christian minister with a congregation composed oftelevision viewers who donate heavily to his cause. Robertson is also a busi-nessman. There is nothing wrong with this, of course, and the argument could bemade that if more ministers and priests were businesspeople, there would be lesscorruption in the churches and clergymen would be more understanding of theday-to-day stresses of dealing with jobs, employers, volatile markets, and thelike. The concept of the “worker priest” was popular for a while in Europe inthe years after World War II, although it gradually took on a Marxist tinge.Robertson, however, is no “worker priest.” His business deals are routinely inthe millions of dollars and involve the exploitation of the natural resources ofdeveloping nations, what used to be called “the Third World.”Investing heavily in Africa, Robertson created the African DevelopmentCorporation, or ADC. This was allegedly not connected in any way with hisreligious broadcasting operations, although it is hard to tell how thesecompanies are financed. What is known for sure is that, in 1992, the ADC enteredinto negotiations with the Zairean government of President Mobutu for thedevelopment of the diamond trade in the southern mining town of Tshikapa, alongwith projects including logging in other areas of Zaire.The idea, as touted by the Robertson organization, was that it had se- curedMobutu’s blessing to use some of the profits from these enterprises to boosthumanitarian aid projects in Zaire. The fact that Mobutu had already plunderedhis country’s economy, banking hundreds of millions—if not bil- lions—of dollarsin foreign accounts in Switzerland and Belgium, suggests the cynicism of thisself-congratulation. It has been estimated that Mobutu could havesingle-handedly solved his country’s economic and humanitarian problems with thefunds he had salted away abroad while his countrymen’s per capita annual incomewas something like $500, belying the necessity of a Robertson–Mobutupartnership.Robertson initiated Operation Blessing as a tax-exempt humanitarian mission tohelp those less fortunate in Africa, buying three Caribou aircraft in theprocess, for the ostensible purpose of flying medical supplies and doctors tothose areas of Zaire being flooded by refugees, both internal refugees as wellas those from the growing Rwandan crisis across the border. The Caribou aredesigned for short- take-off and landing (STOL): Vietnam-era aircraft ideal forshort runways in the jungle. Robertson went on the air in the United Statesextolling the virtues of his operation and showing how the poor Zaireans andRwandans were being helped by the smiling Christian American efficiency ofOperation Blessing.Unfortunately for the poor Zaireans and Rwandans, Operation Blessing was largelya sham.Pilots who had been employed by the organization revealed to newsmen that theirjob was not hauling medicine to Goma or the other regions where people werestarving to death or dying from a host of treatable illnesses; rather, they wereinvolved with moving mining and dredging equipment to Robertson’s diamond mines.It got so bad that one of the pilots had “Operation Blessing” removed from theplane’s tailfins. Out of forty flights that had been flown in Zaire forOperating Blessing, only one or two had actually had anything to do withhumanitarian aid.As the Rwandan crisis deepened in 1994, Robertson was on the air con- stantlytrying to raise money for his humanitarian efforts to help the refugees. Wherethis money wound up is anyone’s guess at this point. None of the pilots who havebeen contacted by investigators could come up with more than half- a-dozenhumanitarian flights during the entire period Operation Blessing was inoperation in Zaire, and even then the medical support was minimal. In a 1994Time magazine article, alluded to above, one aid worker complained that theefforts of Operation Blessing in Goma—the town hardest hit by the Rwandanrefugee crisis—were a joke: that they were heavy on transportation and light onaid; workers preferred to stand around and preach rather than get down and dirtywith the dead and dying, and the organization pulled its people out after onlyshort tours in the region.Eventually, in 1995, Robertson pulled the plug on the African wing of OperationBlessing (possibly due to all the bad publicity), but continued with hisbusiness deals in other parts of Africa, such as in Liberia in support ofPresident Charles Taylor, a man with a human rights abuse record at least aslong as Mobutu’s. Taylor’s use of death squads, his support of mercenary groupswho use Liberia as a staging area for attacks in other countries, and hisinvolvement in arms trading made him a ’90s equivalent to former Ugandandictator Idi Amin; he had even been known to conduct torture and interroga- tionsessions in his own home, the Executive Mansion. Corruption was rife andunapologetic in Liberia, with Taylor and his cronies pocketing at least 20% ofLiberia’s annual budget, according to a 1998 US Department of State CountryReport on Liberia.In 1998 Robertson created a company called Freedom Gold for investment inLiberia. His focus remained roughly the same: the exploitation of Liberia’s rawmaterials and natural resources—gold, diamonds, oil, lumber—with the expectationthat profits would be plowed back into the Liberian economy for humanitarianefforts. Well, Liberia—like Zaire—certainly needs humanitarian aid, of thatthere can be no question. The problem arises when dictators, consumed with greedand the desire for personal wealth, make deals with Christianministers-turned-businessmen. There is no earthly way that profits would havebeen reinvested in the poor of either Liberia or Zaire in any significantamount, when the leaders of those respective governments had control over theprofits. It would have been naïve to think so. That Robertson himself would havebeen remunerated for his assistance to these regimes goes without saying; butthat he would have been able to bring this money back to the people of Zaire orLiberia, untouched by the corrupt fingers of Mobutu or Taylor, was impossible.If nothing else, after the debacle in Zaire Robertson should have realized this(if, indeed, he was simple-minded enough not to know what was going on from thebeginning). Why he would have turned around and gotten into bed with Taylorafter the Zaire fiasco boggles the mind … unless he knew exactly what he wasdoing, and that it had nothing at all to do with humanitarian aid.Moreover, there may have been another benefit to all of this for Robertson andhis Christian ministry. Mobutu—who always waivered between African animism andChristianity—began to talk up the Christian message (even as he was murderinghis opponents). Taylor became fanatically Christian, at least on paper,proclaiming his administration blessed by God and making it mandatory for hisgovernment ministers to attend prayer services on pain of losing their jobs … orworse. Yet, as late as December 2002, Taylor (and African diamonds) would belinked to the Al-Qaeda money-laundering sys- tem, and Liberia described as asafe haven provided for Al-Qaeda operatives after the September 11, 2001 attackon New York and Washington, D.C.13And so it goes.Robertson also went on the record as supporting the regime of Frederick Chilubaof Zambia, another African country in dire need of real assistance. Chiluba, whodeclared his country a “Christian nation” in 1991, removed all vestiges ofMuslim, Hindu and African native religions from the nation’s school system, andapproved a plan to have Christian fundamentalist ministers work with the policeto identify and destroy anything they deemed obscene. This was in tandem with ananti-abortion and anti-pornography crusade, and the shutting down of radiostations and newspapers that did not toe the party lineAnother “Christian” ruler supported by Robertson on television and in his booksis Jorge Serrano, the bizarre President of Guatemala who wanted to create aPentecostal Christian government in Guatemala. The list goes on and on. Here isRobertson sitting down to dinner with notorious Salvadoran death-squad leaderRoberto D’Aubuisson. 14Here is Robertson raising two million dollars forGuatemalan military dictator General Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores. 15Here isRobertson being saluted by the Contras at their base camp in Honduras. 16Here isRobertson once again in Guatemala, this time in support of death-squad leaderand eventual president Rios Montt, a born-again Christian who suspended hiscountry’s constitution and proceeded to murder thousands of his fellow citizens.17The eagerness of Fundamentalist Christians in their support of viciousdictators simply because they pay lip service to Christianity is baffling.Perhaps it all goes back to Martin Luther, the Father of the ProtestantReformation and the church that bears his name, who declared the Epistle inwhich James claims, “Faith without good works is dead” (James 2:26) to be an“Epistle of straw.” If it is enough simply to believe, and not to act inaccordance with those beliefs, then there is no moral imperative to leading aChristian life. One simply “takes the pledge,” and then does what one likes. Idon’t believe Robertson seriously entertains this viewpoint, but it does seem heentertains a double standard. Even as he was supporting a range of sadisticpolitical leaders in Latin America, Africa and elsewhere—men with the blood ofthousands if not millions on their hands—he was simultaneously on the attackagainst the President of the United States.The story of Iran-Contra as is generally known to most Americans omits oneimportant aspect. Although the trail of deceit and treachery—especially againstthe US Congress and in violation of the Borland Amendment which forbade thegovernment from giving military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels—stretched as far asNorth, Secord, McFarlane and others sworn to defend the Constitu- tion, andwhose names became household words (and in some cases, heros) to Americans inthe 1980s, the breadth of “private funding” of the Contra rebellion has neverbeen deeply explored. The fact that the Christian Right raised millions ofdollars in aid to the Contras has been “backburnered” in most histories of theaffair. Indeed, Pat Robertson’s Christian Broadcasting Network was only onesource of aid and support to the Contras; in addition, we find the UnificationChurch of Rev. Sun Myung Moon as well as the Knights of Malta fraternal societyinvolved in fund-raising and other efforts on behalf of the rebels.The Knights of Malta participation is interesting because, at the time, its headwas J. Peter Grace, an old friend of Pat Robertson and the godfather to hischildren. It was Grace who famously hired a Nazi scientist, Otto Ambrose, towork for the W. R. Grace Corporation even though his past as a chem- ist anddirector of I.G. Farben during the war was well-documented. Grace seems to beanother of those monied Americans who feel an investment in fascism is alwaysgood for business, and who support (sometimes secretly, sometimes openly) allmanner of right-wing dictators and death-squad capos in the defense ofChristianity, democracy, and white supremacy.As for Reverend Moon and his Unification Church, this convicted felon (for taxevasion) has supported the extreme right in America for decades. The UnificationChurch itself fronts for the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, and when theauthor himself was approached by the Church in the 1970s they owned—in additionto a network of churches with a sophisticated marketing campaign aimed atscientists and other intellectuals—a rifle factory in Korea. Reverend Moonhimself believes that Jesus will return to earth as a Korean, and he has let itbe known that he believes this Second Coming involves his own person.Incredibly, with all of this clearly heretical belief openly pro- mulgated,Christian ministers such as Pat Robertson have no problem at all in sharing apodium with Moon and enjoying the international reach of the Unification Church.The main organizer of the private funding endeavor was Major General JohnSinglaub (retired), who came to brief prominence during the Iran-Contrainvestigation. Singlaub, a decorated Army veteran who had worked closely withthe CIA over the years, took control of the World Anti-Communist League (WACL)in 1984. Although mention was made of the WACL dur- ing the Iran-Contrahearings, one did not hear of the constituent religious groups that providedimportant sources of revenue for the anti-Communist and specificallyanti-Sandinista campaign.The WACL is a notorious hotbed of Nazis, pro-Nazis, and neo-Nazis from everycontinent. The number of groups involved in the WACL is almost embarrassing inits composition of ethnic organizations devoted not only to the destruction ofCommunism, but to the advancement of a neo-fascist agenda. Singlaub was able tofind support from the governments of Taiwan and South Korea, as well as fromSaudi Arabia, in his globe-trotting mission: support that went to the Contras intheir efforts to overthrow the Nicaraguan government.President Reagan’s support for both Singlaub and the WACL is alsowell-documented.18 For instance, it was Reagan who, in 1983, told YaroslavStetsko, former Nazi premier of Ukraine during the War, “Your struggle is ourstruggle. Your dream is our dream.” 19At the time, Stetsko was a leader of thesecretive Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists-Bandera (OUN-B), whichcollaborated extensively with the Nazis in their invasion of the Ukraine, and in1983 was representing the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA), partof the bewildering matrix of acronyms and ethnic subgroups that are the legs andarms of the WACL.Diamonds and uranium. Christianity and Paganism. Black versus White. Capitalismversus Communism. While the Cold War was being fought fa- mously in the streetsof Vienna and Berlin, Moscow and New York, Hong Kong and Singapore, it was alsobeing fought more savagely in Latin America and Central Africa and could hardlyhave been called a “Cold War,” when all the heat of battle and bloodshed fueledthe fantasies of the armchair war- riors in Washington and London. It was, afterall, to the Congo that Sidney Gottlieb brought his vial of death for use againsta man who Washington decided would not be cooperative. That was Lumumba’s deathsentence: he was an inconvenient man, like Frank Olson and so many others on theCIA’s “hit parade.”As the Cold War wound down, however, and enemies abroad became harder to find,Americans could take their time and identify enemies at home. The defeat ofCommunism was seen by many to be a victory for Christianity, at least for thehomegrown Fundamentalist form of Christianity. It was now time to weed out theopposition.AMERICAN SWASTIKAIf Christian people work together, they can succeed during this decade inwinning back control of the institutions that have been taken from them over thepast 70 years. Expect confrontations that will be not only unpleasant but attimes physically bloody …– Pat Robertson, “Pat Robertson’s Perspective,” Oct/Nov 1992Although civil religion has been degraded in this manner in domestic politics,the dangers of extremist versions have been most visible in Americaninteractions with the rest of the world.… Some critics have argued that thissense of mission coupled with a tendency to view international politics as aclash of moral opposites, has undermined the development of an effective foreignpolicy.– Kenneth Wald20Not to be outdone, even by financial backer and moral supporter Richard MellonScaife, Robertson identified a struggle lasting seventy years rather thanScaife’s mere fifty. Seventy years from 1992 gives us 1922, the era ofpost-World War I euphoria in America, the Roaring Twenties, and—of course—theLeague of Nations, forerunner of that right-wing boogey-man, the United Nations.In less than a decade, the stock markets of the world would collapse, and apresident was elected who would remain in power for more than twelve years, aDemocrat whose New Deal frightened the hell out of the Republicans: FranklinDelano Roosevelt.It was Roosevelt who had wanted to go to war against the Nazis, but wasvirtually forbidden to do so by all the politicos around him, until that fatefulday when Germany declared war on the US in the immediate aftermath ofJapan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. America, just starting to recover from nearlyten years of the Great Depression, had not wanted a foreign adventure and couldnot be convinced that a war against Germany held any margin for them. Many ofthe men around the President—and many others who held positions of power inAmerica—were sympathetic to the Nazis. Henry Ford is perhaps the best and mostfamous example of an American who actually donated funds to Hitler from theearliest days of the Nazi Party, and who received the Third Reich’s highesthonor for a non-German, sharing that dubious distinction with none other thanBenito Mussolini.But another Republican whose support of the Third Reich nearly cost him hislivelihood was Senator Prescott Bush. Yes, gentle Readers, the father of 41stPresident George H.W. Bush (former-Vice President under Ronald Reagan,former-CIA Director, former-Ambassador to China) and, of course, the grandfatherof George W. Bush, the 43rd President of the United States.Prescott Bush was an active Nazi supporter, whose company—Union Banking, asubsidiary of W. A. Harriman & Company—had its assets seized by the USGovernment in 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy Act. This was done by USGovernment Vesting Order No. 248, for those who think I am making this up. Thegist of the government’s case was that, for many years, Prescott Bush and GeorgeWalker (his father-in-law) had been actively raising money to support thefledgling Nazi Party, laundering the funds through Harriman and its subsidiaryUnion Banking. According to Loftus and Aarons in their Secret War Against theJews, George Herbert Walker was “one of Hitler’s most powerful supporters in theUnited States,” and was under Congressional investigation as early as 1934, whenit was believed that Walker’s Hamburg-Amerika Line “subsidized a wide range ofpro-Nazi propaganda efforts both in Germany and the United States.”Both in Germany. And the United States.Of course, by 1942 when the US Government seized the assets of Union Banking,America was already at war with Germany. The Bush family support of the ThirdReich, however, began when the Party was barely functioning. Although Hitlerenjoyed financial support from German institutions such as manufacturing giantThyssen, AEG, Siemens, I.G. Farben and other household names, there was alsoextensive financial backing from wealthy and prestigious American companies andindividuals. We do know of Henry Ford’s backing,21 and now of the Bush andWalker families’ support.Could Hitler have become as powerful as he did without American financialsupport? That question is almost impossible to answer now, more than seventyyears after the fact. What is certain, however, is that the enthusiastic supportof Hitler by Ford, Bush and Walker entails a deep moral responsibility for whathappened, for the ravaging of Europe under the swastika and for the deaths ofmillions of people in the Holocaust, as well as nearly twenty million Russiancitizens and countless millions more throughout the European theater.We cannot, of course, hold former President Bush responsible for the sins of hisfather; nor can we hold his son responsible. Yet, we can expect a higher degreeof moral responsibility in their actions as men and as political leaders. We canexpect them to repudiate the Nazi sympathies of their forebear, if not in word,ten at least in deed. Unfortunately, as we saw, in the 1988 Presidentialcampaign, George H.W. Bush was happy to accept support froma range of Nazis and Nazi-sympathizers in his quest for the White House, and wasjust as happy to keep them on in the administration even after they had beenidentified as such.Aarons and Loftus present a case that this was anti-Semitism, pure and simple;and, to a certain degree, anti-Semitism in the pursuit of Middle Eastern oil. Itend to take a different view. Anti-Semitism was certainly part of the story ofwhy these companies and individuals supported Hitler and continued to supportNazism even after the end of the war. Money (and oil) is certainly another, verypowerful, motive. Yet, I believe that the entire racial theory of Nazism was acomfortable environment for these men. They were, after all, from privilegedbackgrounds: old money, power, prestige, the right companies, the right schools,the right fraternities (such as the infamous Skull & Bones at Yale, to whichgenerations of the Bush family belonged). The Nazis embodied the secret dreamsand unspoken loyalties of these men, the public acknowledgment of all that theAmerican elite held dear.Racial (or ethnic, or familial) superiority meant that they did not have to beparticularly smart, particularly accomplished in their own right, but could relyupon the mere fact of their bloodlines to ensure the continued power ofthemselves and their families from generation to generation. After all, Americais not a monarchy, yet there burns in the secret heart of almost every Americanpolitician and businessman a desire for royal prestige, for the trappings ofnobility, for the accumulation of knighthoods and noble degrees. Skin was theuniform these men wore; the right color identified you as a friend rather than afoe. Family name was the battalion to which you belonged and owed allegiance:Bush, Walker, Mellon, Scaife, Morgan, DuPont, etc. Jews were not allowed, ofcourse, but neither were blacks, Asians, Hispanics, etc. Eugenics was the new“science” of population control, which was a code word for genocide and “ethniccleansing,” and the Bush–Walker team provided logistical support for the ThirdInternational Congress of Eugenics that was held in New York on August 21-23,1932, at the American Museum of Natural History, ensuring that Nazi eugenicistswere present at the Congress by providing free passage aboard their shippingline, Hamburg-Amerika.The flyer advertising this Congress is revealing. It shows a tree with a largeroot system. Each root is labeled with one of the sciences: anthropology, ar-chaeology, etc. The slogans say, “Eugenics is the self-direction of evolution,”and, “Like a tree, Eugenics draws its materials from many sources and orga-nizes them into an harmonious entity.” Among those sources, depicted as a rootoff to the right side of the drawing, is one labeled “religion.” Another is“politics,” and still others include “fecundity,” “mate selection,” “racecrossing” and “eugenic forces” (whatever they are). Thus, the “science” ofeugenics was seen as means of organizing the whole of human endeavor, whileweeding out those who do not fit the paradigm.But what are we to make of “religion” in this context? As heinous as we havecome to see eugenics as a whole—as it was the science proclaimed by the ThirdReich as an excuse (or a reason) for eliminating the mentally-ill, thephysically-infirm, and eventually the Gypsies, the Jews, the Slavs, etc.—we haveto wonder what the American organizers understood the role of religion to be. InAmerica, eugenics was a code-word for the subjugation, sterilization andeventual elimination of the black race. In Germany, of course, it referred tothe Jews as well as Gypsies, homosexuals, Communists, and whoever else was onHimmler’s enemies list at the time.Whatever the core beliefs of the Congress, it was enthusiastically supported bysome of the most prominent industrialists and people of “old money” in theUnited States, and support was extended to their like-minded brethren across theseas in Germany. In 1932, Hitler was on the verge of taking power in Germany andeugenics was one of the Nazi Party’s platforms, a kind of pseudo-scientificimprimatur for race hatred and the Final Solution. American financiers—such asW.A. Harriman and George Herbet Walker, founding members of Union Banking—weresending bags of money to Hitler to prop up his shaky political position, orsuccessfully laundering that money through American and European banks. It isclear that some of the most important businessmen in America felt they had avested interest in promoting the Nazi Party, and through their support ofancillary programs such as the Eugen- ics Congress, we can begin to put togethera more complete picture of this interest: America for white people, Europe forthe Nazis, forming a broad alliance of power stretching over both sides of theAtlantic and ensuring the enslavement of millions upon millions of people whowere not members of the club. In America, it was nothing less than a repudiationof everything the Statue of Liberty stands for.Fast forward to 1992.There is a religious war going on for the soul of America.-- Pat Buchanan, May 1992 22We have seen how the son of Prescott Bush, George H.W. Bush, carried on hisfather’s support for fascism by hiring numerous pro-Nazis, ex-Nazis andHolocaust-revisionists and by courting ethnic organizations that were run byformer Nazis. We have witnessed Richard Nixon’s support for specific Nazis, suchas Trifa and Malaxa, in a pattern that goes back to the days of Allen Dulles andthe early post-War years when the two men collaborated on hiding the smoking gunof government documentation that would have shown the Dulles brothers’involvement with Nazi war criminals and Nazi fund-raising. We watched RonaldReagan place a wreath at the SS cemetery at Bitberg. And now, we are forced towitness another gathering of the Klans in their desperate effort to dispatch theDemocratic Party’s presidential candidate Bill Clinton.The old money in the 1990s was represented by one of the wealthiest dynas- tiesin the United States: the Mellon family. Mellons can be found sprinkledthroughout the American experience over the last century. Heirs of a fortunebuilt by a Pittsburgh industrialist, they were at one time considered therichest family in the United States. Although their money was not quite as “old”as that of the Astors, they traveled in much the same circles. We will find Mel-lons present at the birth of Timothy Leary’s LSD crusade; we will find theminvolved in the Profumo affair in England in 1962; we will find them involved inthe skullduggery around Resorts International in the Bahamas, along with RichardNixon and Bebe Rebozo; we will find them once again financing a vociferouscampaign of print and broadcast media to unseat Bill Clinton.WILD BILL HITCHCOCKWhy Hitchcock decided to throw his weight behind the psychedelic cause is stillsomething of a mystery. Was he simply a millionaire acid buff, a wayward son ofthe ruling class who dug Leary’s trip? Or did he have something up his sleeve?—Acid Dreams23One of the principal witnesses against [LSD chemist Nicholas] Sand and twoco-defendants was William Mellon Hitchcock, an heir to the U.S. Steel fortune,who testified under immunity and acknowledged that he had bankrolled theoperation.—San Francisco Examiner, “Fugitive to face LSD charges,” June 6, 1998The Legal Attache, London, forwarded copies of memoranda prepared by AlfredWells, Secretary to Ambassador Bruce, concerning various persons involved in theinstant case. In a memorandum dated 11/6/62 Wells stated that he had attended adinner the night before at which he had met Dr. Stephen Ward and that Ward hadmade loud statements that he had been the principal liaison between the Sovietsand the British Government during the Cuban crisis.… By memorandum 6/18/63 Mr.Wells stated he had been to a luncheon on 2/13/63 with Thomas Corbally, Dr.Ward, Mrs. Robin Dalton, an Australian woman, and William Hitchcock.—FBI Memorandum 65-68218, from W. A. Branigan to W. C. Sullivan, dated 7/1/63,“Re: Christine Keeler; John Profumo”William Mellon Hitchcock was no stranger to that rareified atmosphere whereAmerican politics and American money mingle in a fuzzy miasma of intelligenceagents, crooked financiers, and secret agendas. He was one of the heirs to theMellon fortune and to Gulf Oil (founded by his grandfather William LarimerHitchcock) and nephew of Andrew Mellon (a Secretary of the Treasury for threeRepublican Presidents from 1921-32). He and his sister Peggy were close to bothTimothy Leary (and Australian film producer Robin Dalton) on the one hand, andto people like Stephen Ward, Thomas Corbally, and the American Ambassador toEngland on the other.The latter was natural, since David Bruce—the US Ambassador to the Court of St.James during the Profumo affair—was his uncle. A former and important member ofthe OSS during World War II, Colonel Bruce landed at Normandy with the head ofthe OSS: General “Wild Bill” Donovan. A roommate of Billy Hitchcock’s father atuniversity, Bruce had married (and later divorced) a Mellon. During the War,David Bruce’s OSS network op- erated behind enemy lines in France, disruptingthe German Army; at one point, Bruce had hundreds of French agents under hiscommand.Bruce would later go on to even greater glory, not only as US Ambassador toEngland, but also to France and Germany. He would also be involved, with HenryKissinger, in the Paris Peace Talks during the Vietnam Era. Bruce’s con-nections in Europe during the War included high-ranking Italian Masons who heldinfluential posts within Mussolini’s government. 24We also discover that OSSstaffer and future-CIA Counterintelligence Chief James Jesus Angleton wasworking in Italy at this very time with his father, Hugh Angleton, culti- vatingclose relationships with Masons working within the Fascist Mussolini governmentto advance a somewhat different agenda.25Thus do we begin to realize that the word “conspiracy” does not do justice towhat is, after all, merely a group of people from similar backgrounds withsimilar goals, all working to a common purpose which is hidden from the world atlarge by virtue of a Great Wall of wealth, prestige, culture and power. We beginto see that what the rest of us call conspiracy is just business-as-usual forthe people that operate above, behind and below what we know as consensushistory, consensus reality. I believe that the word “conspiracy” is over-usedand emotionally-loaded in this context. Let us instead, and rightly, use theword “cabal” to denote this gathering of sinister forces.There were other Mellons on board at OSS: Paul Mellon (Treasury Secretary AndrewMellon’s son) served with the OSS Special Operations Branch in London, moving onto become commander of the Morale Operations Branch, based in Luxembourg.According to Richard Harris Smith, “Other Mellons and Mellon in-laws heldespionage posts in Madrid, Geneva and Paris.” 26Further, as reported in AcidDreams, “After the war, certain influential mem- bers of the Mellon familymaintained close ties with the CIA. The Mellon family foundations have been usedrepeatedly as conduits for Agency funds. Furthermore, Richard Helms was afrequent weekend guest of the Mellon patriarchs in Pittsburgh during his tenureas CIA director (1966-1973).” In addition to the Mellons, members of the Morgan,Vanderbilt, and DuPont families were very active in the OSS making itessentially a “rich man’s club.” David Bruce himself was the son of a US Senatorand a millionaire even before his marriage to Ailsa Mellon.Thus, William Mellon Hitchcock’s presence at dinner in London in 1962 withThomas Corbally and Stephen Ward is highly suggestive of an intel- ligenceangle. At the time of the Profumo affair, Hitchcock was flying back and forthbetween New York and London: in London, to hang out with Ward and Corbally (thelatter will become important a bit later on), and in New York to hang out withTimothy Leary, who had just returned from an aborted LSD-commune experiment inMexico and was looking for another site. He found one at Hitchcock’s DutchessCounty, New York, estate: Millbrook.Hitchcock’s involvement with all of these people—and many more be- sides—hasalways been suspicious. Even those around Timothy Leary—full of peace and loveand lysergic acid—were sometimes, well, leery of Hitchcock. Hitchcock did notlive at the Millbrook mansion with Leary and his other guests, but insteadstayed at a much smaller cottage elsewhere on the grounds, where he conductedbusiness (he has been described as a stockbroker) and had his own guests over.He was never fully part of the acid scene, except for the trips he took withLeary and company at Millbrook, and kept mostly to himself, not sharing in themysticism and deep philosophical musings of the Leary operation.As it turns out, Hitchcock had so many ties to the intelligence commu-nity—mostly through banking circles and money-laundering operations—that itraises one’s paranoia level to a new … high. As described in The Nine, LSD wasintroduced to the American public through the CIA, which wanted to test itseffectiveness for everything from mind control to crowd control. We thendiscover Hitchcock’s involvement with the CIA and CIA-front organiza- tions,such as Castle Bank and Resorts International. We also see Hitchcock turningstate’s evidence against his old LSD chemist, Nicholas Sand, even thoughHitchcock himself admitted he had financed Sand’s operation for the manufactureand distribution of millions of hits of LSD.Probably the most accessible history of this period is the book Acid Dreams, theComplete Social History of LSD: The CIA, the Sixties, and Beyond by Martin A.Lee and Bruce Shlain, which was originally published in 1985. In those pages, weread of the strange development of Harvard professor Timothy Leary. We read ofhis salad days as a clinical psychologist at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital inOakland, California (the same hospital where Andrija Puharich got his start) inthe period 1954-59, where he developed a personality test (“the Leary”) whichwas used by the CIA human resources people to screen potential employees. 27Welearn of his growing awareness of the field of psy- chedelics during a vacationin Mexico in 1960, where he was urged by a friend to try hallucinogenicmushrooms (psilocybin) in Cuernavaca. He returned to Harvard—where by now he hada professorship—filled with the experience, and related it all to Dr. HarryMurray, with whom he developed a psilocybin research project. This was the sameMurray who had been involved with the creation of personality tests for the OSSduring World War II. (As we see, the field of early psychedelic research in theUnited States was heavily influenced by men who had more than a passingrelationship with intelligence matters.)By the time he met—first Peggy, and then—Billy Hitchcock three years later,Leary was well on the way to becoming an acid guru, having abandoned psilocybinfor the more attractive pharmaceutical developed by the Sandoz laboratories inSwitzerland, lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD-25. Peggy Hitchcock was a NewYork City socialite with tremendous energy and an interest in everything. Sheintroduced brother Billy to Timothy Leary, and it was the beginning of a fatefulfriendship.Aside from renting his vast Millbrook estate to Leary’s acid organization for amere five hundred dollars a month, he wound up subsidizing various drugoperations and secret laboratories (including that of convicted acid chemistNicholas Sand), for which he would eventually come to the attention of USCustoms and other government authorities, although he would not spend any timein prison. This is not surprising in view of the fact that he walked with thegods.One of Billy Hitchcock’s earliest recorded introductions to the world ofintelligence was his presence at that fateful lunch with Dr. Stephen Ward (whowould be convicted, unfairly, of living off the earnings of women in the nastyProfumo Affair, which threatened to pull down the British government if not alsoan American president) and Thomas Corbally. Corbally, a mysterious and elusivebusinessman who seems to live only in hotels on either side of the Atlantic,reported this lunch to the US Ambassador, David Bruce, Billy Hitchcock’s uncleby marriage. There were important intelligence ramifications to what waseventually reported to the FBI by the State Department, including the fact thatStephen Ward had been a go-between during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962,carrying messages back and forth between the British and the Soviets. This wasnot empty bragging, although it would have been better had Ward kept his mouthshut; it was his loose lip that sealed his doom, for once his reputation hadbeen ruined by the Christine Keeler prostitution scandal, he would not bebelieved on anything having to do with such lofty matters as intelligenceactivities relating to the one incident in the twentieth century that had,without question, brought us to the brink of nuclear holocaust.Rumors had it that Dr. Ward was involved in occultism, and some have tried tolink him (without documentation so far) to the Golden Dawn or to one of itsoffshoots in Great Britain. That he was involved in orgies that were attended bythe rich and famous is beyond all doubt, however, and some of these gatheringsmay have been ritualistic in nature. He was evidently very interested inoccultism and “black magic.”28Yet, the intimate lunch attended by Ward, Hitchcock, Corbally and Robin Daltonleads us to wonder what could have brought these four people together, for ofthat group at least three had intelligence connections: Ward, Hitchcock, andCorbally. Ward would commit suicide directly after his guilty verdict wasreturned. Corbally, according to his own account, was sniffing around Wardeither at the behest of the CIA or of Ambassador Bruce (depending on which storyone believes), even though he considered Ward a personal friend, one who hadonce treated him for a knee injury.29When David Bruce did not report back to the United States on this vitallyimportant information, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover became suspicious that Brucehimself was involved in some kind of international vice ring.30 Hooversuspected—as did others in the American intelligence community—that one ofChristine Keeler’s clients may have been John F. Kennedy himself. Hoover, whosedistrust and dislike of the Kennedys ran deep, spun a nightmare scenario inwhich Keeler—bedmate of a Russian military attache in London—was sleeping withthe American president, and exchanging one kind of pillowtalk for another.Hoover had reason to be nervous. A sex ring that had operated in New York Cityuntil 1961 (barely a year before the Profumo scandal was exposed)—and to whichit was believed Keeler and some of her colleagues belonged at various times—wasstaffed by at least one Chinese woman of foreign birth and assorted otherforeign nationals. When the police raided the operation, the ringleader—one AlanTowers—fled to a safe haven behind the Iron Curtain. One of his “employees,” theprostitute Maria Novotny, reportedly told police that Alan Towers was a Sovietagent and was running an international sex ring for the purpose of entrappingprominent politicians and businessmen.In spy parlance, this is known as a “honey trap,” and today many suspect thatWard was doing the same thing with Christine Keeler, Mandy Rice-Davies, and theother women associated with Keeler (including, it is said, Mary Anne de Grimstonof the Process Church of the Final Judgment) … but not for Soviet intelligence.Instead, it is believed that Ward was working for Brit- ish intelligence in anattempt to entrap such Soviet targets as Yevgeny Ivanov, the GRU (Russianmilitary intelligence) rezident whose name turned up in the Profumo affair asone of Keeler’s lovers, causing the scandal that rocked the British government.Thus, Keeler was simultaneously sleeping with both John Profumo—the BritishMinister of War—and Ivanov, the Soviet military intelligence officer assigned toGreat Britain. And this, during the time of the Cuban missile crisis! IfPresident Kennedy was also sleeping with Keeler or with one of her associates(as Hoover feared might be the case), Christine Keeler might potentially beconsidered one of the most important women in the history of the twentiethcentury.As it was, Profumo resigned (after at first denying then admitting that he hadslept with Ms. Keeler) and Ivanov was sent back to Russia. Ward, unable to dealwith the scandal and embittered with the way his friends all abandoned him inhis hour of need, committed suicide. (The cottage where he lived on the Astorestate of Cliveden was subjected to the ministrations of an exorcist, givingrise to more theories of Ward’s occult involvement). Ms. Keeler herself survivedthe episode and was interviewed a few years ago in the American and Britishpress after the release of a film about the affair entitled, naturally, Scandal.The former prize-fighter (and fiancé of Process Church co-founder Mary AnneDeGrimston) Sugar Ray Robinson had wanted to produce a film on the Profumoaffair with Keeler playing herself, but nothing had come of the project. ThomasCorbally and William Hitchcock also survived, and each went on to greater glory(or infamy): Corbally to a disastrous relationship with Connecticut conman MartyFrankel, and Hitchcock to a disastrous relation- ship with LSD chemist NicholasSand. The British government prepared an official report on the Profumo Affairknown as the Lord Denning Inquiry, which, in its essential whitewash of theepisode and its focus on Keeler and Ward, was likely the inspiration for anothersuch government inquiry a year later: the Warren Report.Why did US Ambassador David Bruce not report the details of the Ward scenario tohis putative masters in the United States? What was the role of his wealthyin-law, William Mellon Hitchcock, in the affair? Was Thomas Corbally actuallyworking for Bruce (via Billy Hitchcock?) when he began spy- ing on Dr. Ward?What was Corbally—at the time over fifty years old—doing hanging out in Londonwith William Hitchcock, who was at that time only in his twenties? The suave,urbane international businessman Corbally with a hip, young stockbroker likeHitchcock? One imagines that money would be a passion they shared; another mightbe intrigue. Almost immediately after the Profumo affair, Hitchcock is backStateside, being introduced to Tim Leary by his sister Peggy, and virtuallydonating his family’s ancestral home to Leary and his gaggle of acid heads.This might seem like just a bit of youthful folly—thumbing one’s nose at theEstablishment, as some have put it—if not for the fact that Hitchcock did notdrop his “straight” life and become a drug-entranced hippy. He lived apart fromLeary and his commune—eventually renamed Castalia in honor of the Hesse novelThe Glass Bead Game, in which Castalia represents an institute of pureintellectualism—and remained very much in charge of his business interests… and,when the chips were down, turned state’s evidence against the drug dealers hehimself employed. One is tempted to believe that Thomas Corbally was a guest ofHitchcock’s at his own, rather more mod- est, cottage at Millbrook, kept safelyaway from Leary, Richard Alpert, Ralph Metzner, Gunther Weil and visitors suchas R.D. Laing, Andrija Puharich, and Maynard Ferguson. Leary’s spiritual mentor,Aldous Huxley—whom he met in the early 1960s when he was still a clean-cutuniversity professor—had already died on November 22, 1963 (!!), while trippingon LSD to ease his way to the Other Side.One is tempted to believe that some of the LSD-25 churned out by Nicho- las Sandand others working for Wild Bill Hitchcock wound up supporting an intelligenceagenda. No matter; eventually the Millbrook commune was raided—and Timothy Learyarrested—by none other than future Watergate Plumber G. Gordon Liddy. Liddy andLeary would eventually go on the lecture circuit years later, Liddy representingthe conservative, law-and-order viewpoint, with Leary as an amiable butunfocused foil for Liddy’s sarcasm. (Both, of course, were convicted felons whohad served prison time for their separate offences.) Needless to say, it was nota marriage made in heaven, and the road show did not last; Liddy wound up as aradio personality in his own right, while Tim Leary passed away, still convincedof the righteousness of his acid cause, and dropping unsettling hints that hehad been working for the CIA at the time.While William Hitchcock’s intelligence role is not known to any degree ofcertainty except for the circumstantial evidence cited above, he certainlysurrounded himself with spooks, mobsters and … Republicans. His deep in-volvement in Castle Bank and Trust is just one such instance. A CIA front in theBahamas run by former OSS China hand (and former boss of E. Howard Hunt) PaulHelliwell, it was used as a personal bank by Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush,and Robert Vesco, as well as by an assortment of Republican mov- ers-and-shakersand the occasional drug runner and Mafia don. Those who enjoy wallowing inWatergate will recall Castle Bank, but perhaps not realize that Billy Hitchcockwas an important supporter of the institution.His similar involvement with Resorts International, a spook-front and pri- vateRepublican vault, is also well-known. The history of Resorts International hasbeen brilliantly detailed in Jim Hougan’s Spooks, and we will not go into anygreat detail here, but it is enough to say that Resorts is in the middle of notonly the Watergate affair but also a vast array of intelligence operations thatinclude anti-Castro Cubans, Mafia bagmen, illegal campaign contributions, andmoney laundering. The Nixon and Rebozo involvement with Resorts is only the tipof a very old and very dirty iceberg, and Hitchcock has managed to stay quietlyin the shadows of these infamous politicos.Alas, the same cannot be said of his relative, Richard Mellon Scaife.THE CLINTON CHRONICLESRichard Mellon Scaife’s antecedents were also intelligence-connected in WorldWar II. His father Alan Scaife was a major in the OSS. The Mellon side of thefamily, of course, included all those OSS Mellons with their cozy relationshipsextending to the modern incarnation of the OSS, the CIA. While Bill Hitchcock’sinvolvement with twentieth century American history seems divided between theLSD culture on one side and money laundering on the other—including a variety ofintelligence and high-level Republican Party cooperative efforts—RichardScaife’s politics are worn on his sleeve for all to see.He has been identified in the mainstream media as the treasure chest for theanti-Clinton campaigns of the 1990s, supporting a wide variety of efforts todestroy the Democrat. We learned of the Paula Jones scandal through Scaife’sinvestigation into Clinton’s private life, an investigation undertaken withprivate detectives and well-placed bribes, as well as with investigativereporters working for his own newspaper. It was Scaife who joined hands with PatRobertson—he of the “jewels for Jesus” investments in Zaire—to promote a videocassette purporting to tell the truth about Clinton the mass murderer entitled“The Clinton Chronicles,” a conspiracy theory wrapped in innuendo and bastedwith misdirection which, if anything, gives the very idea of “conspiracy theory”a bad name. (This did not stop Pat Robertson from promoting it through his ownChristian Coalition, however.)The story of Richard Mellon Scaife is clouded by Scaife’s own reluctance to talkto reporters, even though he controls several media outlets including theAmerican Spectator, a newspaper published in Pittsburgh that has beeninstrumental in the Clinton attacks. It was the Spectator that first publishedthe Paula Jones story, early in the Clinton campaign for the presidency. WhenSpectator editors or journalists have been slow to go to press with ananti-Clinton story that was heavy on innuendo but weak in verifiable sources,they have been censured by Scaife or fired outright.To do him justice, Scaife’s paper was also one of the first to come out with aneditorial demanding the resignation or impeachment of President Nixon during theWatergate scandal; those who watched from the sidelines, however, interpretedthis as a man distancing himself from the exposure of some of the RepublicanParty’s dirtiest secrets. Nixon, though an eager tool of the Right, was not cutfrom quite the same cloth-of-gold as his aristocratic buddies, and thus couldnot be expected to maintain (achieve?) any kind of dignity in the face of theongoing revelations.With Nixon, the Republicans learned a valuable lesson: the poor and the greedycan be manipulated far more easily than the wealthy, but that manipula- tion cancome with a price. The poor and the greedy are hired help; they are not part ofthe cabal and cannot be expected to act with the appropriate—je ne sais quoi?…noblesse oblige?—in times of stress. With the Bush presidencies, a wealthydynasty was put in place, one that could be relied upon to give the party linewith aplomb; further, the Bushes were members of that exclusive club of oilmenwhich is a venerated sect of the cabal; even further, they had enough familymembers in important positions—Governor of Texas, Gover- nor of Florida, twocritical states during an election—to consolidate power at various levels ofgovernment. The Bush dynasty was the Republicans’ answer to the Kennedys.Thus, when Clinton made a run at the Oval Office, it shook the conserva- tiveRight down to its heels. The plan had been to have George Bush serve for twoterms, during which a consolidation of power could take place: the “ideologicalforces” mentioned by Scaife in 1994. When Clinton threatened that, action wasrequired. On one level, that action would be taken by the same dirty tricksfaction that had served Nixon so well in his political campaigns.Lucianne Goldberg had worked for Murray Chotiner, Nixon’s first and virtu- allyonly campaign manager. Chotiner had worked for Nixon since his first run at apolitical office after the War, orchestrating the red-baiting and Jew-baitingwhisper tactics that helped Nixon in his California campaigns. Chotiner’sinvolvement with organized crime is no secret; his delight in dirty tricks waspassed on to his student as a virtual religion. After Chotiner’s death—in anautomobile accident ironically in front of a Kennedy residence—his mantle waspicked off the floor by one of his latest camp-followers: Lucianne Gold- berg.Ms. Goldberg had worked to infiltrate the campaigns of the Democratic oppositionin 1972, looking for specifically sexual dirt that could be used to embarrass orruin an opponent. (This was also the year of the Watergate break-in.) In 1992,she dusted off these skills and once again began seeking sexual scandal in aneffort to defeat another Democratic contender. She was, in a way, lesssuccessful this time. Her efforts in 1972 helped re-elect Nixon to office. Herefforts twenty years later did not stop or remove Clinton, but it did prove tobe a nightmare for the United States nonetheless.It was Goldberg’s relationship to Linda Tripp—a well-traveled former Delta Forcemember—that helped to unravel what would become the Monica Le- winsky debacle.Goldberg, acting as a kind of literary agent (who would go on to representformer LAPD officer and O.J. Simpson-trial celebrity Mark Fuhrman), was scoutingaround, looking—once again—for dirt on the Clin- ton administration. Tripp hadworked for the previous Bush administration, and the White House found her a jobat the Pentagon (where she made more money, incidentally) in the days after theVince Foster suicide.The Vince Foster case, of course, became a cause celebre among the Right, asthey were convinced that Foster had been murdered by the Clintons, in spite ofthe evidence to the contrary. Foster had worked for the Clinton White House, andwhen news of his death reached the administration they began a search of hisoffice and, it is alleged, removed documents before the arrival of police. Inthe days that followed, there was a flurry of activity as White House legalstaff began to assess the fallout from the suicide. Tripp became increasinglycontemptuous of the Clinton people and of the way she had been sidelined duringthe transition. When she was finally transferred to her office at the Pentagon,she wasted no time telling people of her dissatisfac- tion with the way she hadbeen treated. Even though she was working for more money and back in thePentagon, it did not compare with the prestige of working at the White House,and she was bitter and angry at the Clinton administration.Word of her state of mind reached Goldberg through another friend, and Goldbergapproached Tripp for more information. About all Tripp could come up with on herown were the shenanigans that took place around the time of the Foster suicide,and a lot of gossip about various staff people and the lack of organizationwithin the administration. Goldberg was not satis- fied with that. It justwasn’t enough to sell a book … or destroy a president. She wanted more.Tripp eventually made the acquaintance of another White House staffer, a formerintern named Monica Lewinsky. Monica claimed to have been having a love affairwith Bill Clinton. This was just what Goldberg was looking for.At this time, the Whitewater investigations had been going full-swing. TheWhitewater affair has been covered in many other books and newspaper accounts,and a full narration here would be tedious and not add very much. It is probablyenough to say that there were allegations of the Bill Clinton’s wrongdoing whenhe was still in Arkansas, long before he became president, which involved asuspicious real estate deal known as Whitewater. Whether this deal had anyrelevance at all to whether or not Clinton should have remained President is, ofcourse, for people far more knowledgeable than I to conclude. In fact, it beganas a fishing expedition by the Republican opposition to findsomething—anything—to hang on Clinton to force him to resign or, barring that,to prevent him from seeking a second term as President.An independent counsel was named, was replaced, and finally Kenneth Starr tookover the task of finding something illegal in Clinton’s background. TheWhitewater investigation was turning up nothing. While the real estate deal hadgone badly, there was never any evidence that the Clintons profited by it; infact, they lost money. There was also no evidence that the Clintons had beeninvolved in anything illegal. Forty million dollars of the taxpayers’ money hadbeen spent on chasing a chimera, and Starr was desperate for an angle. Cherchezla femme.Richard Scaife, who had been pressuring his people to find dirt on Clinton, hadplaced private detectives in Arkansas to sniff around. They came up with PaulaJones and the statements of some Arkansas State Police who claimed that theyhad, essentially, pimped for Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. PaulaJones claimed that she had been having sexual relations with Clinton for sometime, a fact that was also supposedly known to the State Police who were theGovernor’s security detail. The fact that the dates and places given by PaulaJones were later shown to be inaccurate (in one instance, she gives as the dateand time of her rendezvous with the Governor the same time that he was in frontof a few hundred people giving a speech) was inconsequential to the strategy. Itwas enough to have Ms. Jones stand in front of cameras and claim that she sleptwith Clinton.During Clinton’s campaign for the presidency, another woman—Gennifer Flowers—hadalso come forward with a story that she had been sleeping with the Governor. Ithad almost been enough to capsize the Clinton riverboat until the Clintons—bothBill and Hillary—appeared on national television, holding hands, and telling theAmerican people that if they had no problem with the “revelations,” neithershould anyone else. That well-publicized dem- onstration of matrimonialsolidarity deflected the anti-Clinton torpedo… for the moment. Clinton waselected in 1992, but the allegations of extra-marital affairs did not stop.Scaife wanted more, and he found it in Paula Jones.Jones would be called before Ken Starr as he fished for more evidence ofwrongdoing, but there was a danger that Jones would not be enough. Her testimonyhad been challenged before. But with Monica Lewinsky, the Starr investigationtook on new energy. Whitewater—in all its complexity and ultimate failure—wasall but forgotten, but here was something the Ameri- can people could really getinto. A sexual scandal, taking place in the Oval Office itself!Monica had been tricked by her “friend” Linda Tripp into relating details of hermeetings with the President over the phone … and into Tripp’s tape recorder.With that, Tripp and Goldberg could go to the Starr investigation. What hadbegun as a search through Clinton’s balance sheets ended as a search through hisbedsheets. Starr was happy that he finally had something to beat the Presidentwith, and at last the long-awaited impeachment proceedings were begun.During this time, several other events were taking place behind the scenes. Inthe first case, the anti-Clinton lobby had worked itself into a frenzy withsomething called “The Clinton Chronicles.” Financed by Scaife, this was an“exposé” of the Clinton mafia and its evil machinations—including murder—overthe years. As mentioned before, the source material for the Chronicles wasrather flimsy, largely based as it was on the “revelations” of a “disgruntledformer employee,” Larry Nichols. Nichols had been fired from his stategovernment post in Arkansas because he had been using the office facilities toraise funds for … the Contras. Embittered over what he perceived as his cavaliertreatment by the governor—Bill Clinton—he became an easy mark for the intrepidprivate investigators hired by Richard Scaife. As in the case of LucianneGoldberg and Linda Tripp, Scaife’s people found Nichols to be a good source ofgossip about the future president but they needed more.Nichols began spinning tales of drug-running in Arkansas, of womanizingpoliticians, gun deals, and assorted Contra-related derring-do. He became theGeorge Adamski of the Clinton administration: claiming he had been aboard thatspacecraft and had seen the evil aliens at work, and was only too happy to gopublic with what he knew (or could invent).In a bizarre twist, however, the core of the Arkansas revelations is theinfamous Mena episode. A small town in Arkansas with an airstrip, it was used bythe CIA to transport guns and drugs between Latin America and the United Statesas part of the Contra operation. In other words, it was the legacy of theReagan–Bush administrations and had nothing to do with Governor Clinton; indeed,as a “black op,” it was probably completely unknown to the Governor in the firstplace.Although the taped interviews were not quite ready for prime-time, they werepromoted heavily by televangelist Jerry Falwell and, later, by Pat Robertson’sown CBN, and by the Christian Coalition he founded after his unsuccessful run atthe American presidency in 1988. Also appearing on “The Clinton Chronicles” wasPaula Jones, she of the purported sexual relationship with Clinton while he wasgovernor. The Christian Right ate it up. It may not have been ready forprime-time, but it sure played well in Peoria.But that was not the end of Richard Scaife’s campaign to unseat the President.In order to ensure a most favorable outcome of the Kenneth Starr investigation,he funded a chair at Pepperdine University specifically for Starr when his roleas special prosecutor was complete. Once this arrangement be- came public,however, everyone denied the connection, and Starr was forced to refuse thechair.Scaife’s hatchet man for the American Spectator was one David Brock. Brock’sstory is by now quite well-known. Famous as a muckraker on the trail of theClintons for several years, he eventually balked at writing a story that wouldclaim Hillary Clinton was a lesbian. Scaife wanted the story to be explicit inits claims; after all, he was donating heavily to the American Spectator fromhis own pocket and felt he owned the paper. In addition, Brock’s pieces hadalways been on the mark. But when it came to Hillary as gay, Brock could notfind the evidence, and he couldn’t find the heart to go forward with theconservative program. Scaife demanded Brock be fired from the paper, and Brockwent ahead and apologized to the Clintons publically for the hatchet jobs he hadbeen doing at Scaife’s insistence, admitting that they were created largely outof whole cloth.There is no law against philanthropy, of course, and one should not hold RichardScaife’s donations against him. Yet, it is of interest to note that in additionto over $900,000 he donated to the 1972 Nixon Committee to Re- Elect thePresident (CREEP), he has substantially supported Conservative Republican causessteadily through the years since then. The fact is that the bulk of his largessein the 1990s went to organizations that represent the core of the Conservativemovement—including millions to the Heritage Founda- tion (a famous Conservative“think tank”), the Western Journalism Center and Accuracy in Media (two groupsspecializing in Vince Foster assassination theories), and the National TaxpayersUnion (which produced yet another video “exposé” of the Vince Fosterassassination theories)—is an indication of how much “old money” is allied tothe “New Right” in American politics. Like the funding of the Nazi Party bywealthy German (and American) cor- porations in the 1920s, ’30s and ’40s, thepresence of such tycoons as Scaife, H.L. Hunt, Nelson Bunker Hunt, and manyothers in the background of the Christian Right campaigns against Clintonreveals a deeper, darker purpose in the souls of these men, a moral convictionrepresenting an entire constel- lation of religious, racial, social and culturaltheories that the rest of the world might find abhorrent or even frightening.In Weimar Germany there were dozens of political parties that could have usedfinancial support from huge industrial concerns like Farben, Krupp, Siemens, andthe rest; the fact is that these companies threw their backing behind Hitler andthe Nazi Party. American companies such as Ford Motor, Harriman Brothers, ITT,and many others followed suit. Men like Allen Dulles, John Foster Dulles andRichard Nixon conspired to give aid and comfort to the enemy, pulling thestrings necessary to ensure that thousands of war criminals escaped justice atNuremberg; and that millions of dollars in German money found their way to safehaven as well.In a sense, the young inheritors of Old Money were picking up where theirparents left off. The elder Bushes, Mellons, Scaifes, Hitchcocks, etc. were dy-ing off or fading into retirement. In one year alone—1994—the obituaries of theNew York Times were reporting the demise of many old OSS men, their affiliationsburied deep within the columns memorializing their contribu- tions to society.Thus was even such a venerable institution as television chef Julia Childrevealed to have been in the OSS, which is where she had met her husband, nowdeceased.The youth and energy of Bill Clinton posed a threat to the old way of thinking,the old right-wing power politics that many claim—and with muchjustification—built the United States in the first place. The Mellons, theAstors, the Morgans, the Carnegies, the Forbeses, the DuPonts, the Hunts, allmade serious contributions to the strength and power of America. Theirindustries employed millions of Americans, even as they were building massivefortunes that would sustain generations of their own bloodlines long after theywere dead. They also built monuments to themselves, of course, with stone blockslarge enough to bury the corpses of the men, women and children who died fortheir sins. The Holocaust is but one example of what may happen when an almostreligious zeal for racial and ethnic superiority is wedded to extensive wealthand connections in high places.The wannabes—the Pat Robertsons, Jerry Falwells, and other spokesmen for the NewRight, the Christian Right—were only too eager to use these connections andthese funds to further the goals of their financial masters, meanwhile nurturingtheir own bank accounts. Whether it was tearing down an American president orbuilding up a Third World dictator, the Christian Right had managed to instillin their followers the idea that—as sociologist Sara Diamond so eloquently putit—“one’s personal redemption” was tied to “a gospel of politicalparticipation.” Pat Robertson certainly exemplified that concept, as his trackrecord of support for Mobutu, Taylor, Rios Montt, and the Nicaraguan Contrasdramatically shows.Americans in general do not have on-the-ground experience in the develop- ingnations, especially not those regions in the midst of political struggle andmilitary turmoil. They can’t be expected to know how America is perceived abroadby the citizens of these countries whose only experience of America is eitherthe politically-committed Christian missionary (like Robertson), the rapaciouscapitalist businessman (again, like Robertson), or the government spooks andsaboteurs who support first one dictator and then another. If America isdespised in some foreign countries, and if American humanitar- ian efforts aregreeted with suspicion or scorn, it is largely due to the mixed signals sent outby a combination of American businessmen, American mis- sionaries, and Americanforeign policy experts and in-country foreign service bureaucrats.We may despise the Islamic promotion of a jihad against the West andspecifically against America, but unrecognized by most Americans is the factthat their own most visible “ambassadors” to the East have been people likeRobertson on the one hand, and agencies like the CIA on the other, comple-mented by a wealth of oil men, military advisers, and cultural emissaries in thefood, entertainment, and fashion industries. If everyday Americans do notsupport, condone or participate in cultural or military colonialism, theiroverseas counterparts are not so innocent. Groups like the Christian Coalition,the Christian Broadcasting Network, the Heritage Foundation, and individualslike Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, have been busy creating a philosophi- calframework for the New Right in the absence of a credible Communist threat: theidea that personal spiritual redemption and political activism (of an approved,Conservative, variety) are mutually dependent.The Christian Right took a page from the psychological warfare book. What ismissionary work, after all, but psychological warfare by other means? SaraDiamond, who has written extensively on the phenomenon of Christianfundamentalist and evangelical political action, notes the relationship betweenhumanitarian aid and psychological warfare, a relationship hinted at in Chris-topher Simpson’s work on psychological warfare, Science of Coercion: Com-munication Research and Psychological Warfare 1945-1960 (Oxford, 1994).“Humanitarian aid” and “psychological operations” are two areas of “total war”where the Christian Right serves U.S. foreign policy objectives best. Actingeither as “private” benefactors or as agents of the U.S. government, ChristianRight “humanitarian” suppliers and promoters of anti-Communist ideology usereligion to mask the aggressive, cynical nature of “humanitar- ian” projects.…It is doubtful, however, that counterinsurgency could be effective without theuse of religion. Because the conduct of “psychological operations” relies on thesuccessfil interpretation and manipulation of a target population’s deeply heldbeliefs and cultural practices, the functional use of religion simply must beaddressed by anyone intending to understand and put an end to “total warfare.”31When Diamond first published her work, in 1989, Pat Robertson’s “hu- manitarian”efforts in Zaire had not yet begun, and were not noticed by the media until1993. As men, women and children were dying from the com- bined results of warand the Ebola virus, Robertson’s “Operation Blessing” was flying dozens ofsorties … to a diamond mine far from the scene of the conflict. When they didmanage to fly into Goma and other regions ravaged by refugees (both internal andexternal), they brought a few pounds of aspirin. No blood, no vaccines, nothingthat addressed the real problems of the sick and dying. They prayed, said awitness, and spoke in tongues, and preached… and then got the hell out of there.At the same time, Robertson was running an anti-Clinton campaign on his 700Club, watched by millions, and raising money for his obscenely cynical Africanoperations. With funding from right-wing zealots like Richard Mellon Scaife andH.L. Hunt, the Christian Right was simultaneously hailing Larry Nichols, PaulaJones, Linda Tripp, and Monica Lewinsky as political “heros” while supportingdictators in Africa and Latin America, men with the blood of thousands ofcivilians on their hands. Islamic militants may be forgiven, therefore, if theysee America as embarked on a “crusade” reminiscent of the worst excesses of thethirteenth century, promoting evangelistic Christianity with fire and swordabroad, and with rumor, paranoia and innuendo at home. The Christian Right hassupported regimes that actively used chemical and biological weapons againsttheir own people, that tortured and killed political opponents, all in thefurtherance of dubious national interests. Can America accept that some of theirmost revered spiritual leaders may be moral imbeciles, praising Jesus on the onehand while financing terror on the other?The involvement with the Nazis of the sainted forebears of these men should havetold us everything we needed to know. But most Americans are completely unawareof this long, involved history when they go to a voting booth to select ournational and local leaders. For one thing, this history is the stuff of thick,academic tomes that never find their way to a secondary school classroom. Foranother, the irrefutable evidence shown in these sources is relegated to the“crank” category by mainstream historians, since it does not fit neatly intopreconceived ideas of the American historical experience. To integrate thisinformation into our history books would be to rewrite history itself.Thus, when Hillary Rodham Clinton went on the air with her mention of a “vast,right-wing conspiracy,” no one was really listening. It did not sound like anobjective read of the situation, but as a self-serving statement designed toexonerate her embattled husband. Now, with the benefit of years of hindsight, wemay be able to see the outlines of this conspiracy more clearly. From the daysof Prescott Bush, Allen Dulles, and Richard Nixon and their enthusiasticcollaboration with Nazism to the days of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, thefascist “ethnic outreach” programs of the Republican Party courted the Nazi voteand employed hundreds of Nazis and Nazi war criminals in its political campaignsin the decades after World War II. In a more contemporary context, George W.Bush can be shown to have had connections with Islamic terrorists through hisoil businesses. Thus the weight of the evidence is such that we are forced torealize that Richard Mellon Scaife, Pat Robertson, and Pat Buchanan were allcorrect: America is truly a land where two ideological forces have been battlingeach other for generations for stewardship over the American soul. And, asusual, the Devil is better-dressed, has better public relations, and quotesScripture for his own ends.BUSH AND GODWe are in a conflict between good and evil, and America will call evil by itsname.—President George W. Bush, Commencement Address, West Point, June 1, 2002Those who believe I am heavily overstating a case for which the evidence iscircumstantial need only look at the cover of Newsweek for March 10, 2003, witha cover story entitled, “Bush & God: How Faith Changed His Life and Shapes HisAgenda.” While giving us a tale of how George W. Bush found Jesus in hisforties, stopped drinking, and got serious, there is a deeper, more unsettlingmessage that may be summed up in these lines:The presidential campaign was Texas on a grander scale. As he prepared to run,in 1999, Bush assembled leading pastors at the governor’s mansion for a “layingon of hands,” and told them he’d been “called” to seek higher office.32 Theentire article—and series of accompanying, shorter, articles—describes the Bushpresidency as a “faith-centered” administration. To further quote,…this president—this presidency—is the most resolutely “faith-based” in moderntimes, an enterprise founded, supported and guided by trust in the temporal andspiritual power of God.33It would sound mean and petty to complain about a presidential adminis- trationthat was spiritual, if it were not for the fact that the Bush adminis- trationpicks and chooses its scriptural texts with its own agenda in mind. Theadministration—as admitted in the Newsweek articles—has ignored the clergymen,the priests, the mullahs in coming to its current state of spiritualenlightenment. The combined voices of Protestants, Catholics, Jews and Muslimsagainst war does not move George W. Bush at all. Obviously, he considers himselfmore spiritually enlightened than the professionals, and having a circle ofChristian evangelical sycophants around him—and the backing of wealthyFundamentalist political action groups hailing from the days of Robertson,Falwell, Scaife, and others—means that he never need hear a discouraging word.There is no spiritual debate in the White House. Instead, what moti- vates anddrives this president—at least, insofar as we are able to tell—is a belief inhis own position (he claimed he was “called” to the presidency by God), asimplistic understanding of good and evil (Saddam Hussein is evil, those who donot support United States’ foreign policy are evil, etc.), and the fact that heis now the leader of the world’s last remaining superpower. If the Islamic worldis afraid that Bush is on a Crusader-like rampage to Christianize the MiddleEast, though, they need not worry too much. When Saudi Arabia was beingchastised by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom for its humanrights abuses, especially in terms of its persecution of foreign Christianworkers on Saudi soil who are thrown into prison for practicing their faith,they were not censured by the US government. The support of Saudi Arabia isconsidered too important to alienate in this fashion.One must also remember the practical parameters of this brand of spirituality.When George W. Bush was Governor of Texas, the rate of executions of prisonerson death row was at an all-time high. This is the “old time religion” of aSavanarola or a Torquemada, molded to fit the realpolitik of twenty-firstcentury global confrontation. It is the British film The Ruling Class, performedon a world stage with George W. Bush in, alas, the Peter O’Toole role: thewealthy scion of a moneyed dynasty who believes himself to be Jesus Christ andis battling against another mental patient—this time played by Osama Bin Ladenor Saddam Hussein, take your pick—who believes he is the Creator God. In thefilm, the Peter O’Toole/George W. Bush character is “cured” of his delusion thathe is Jesus Christ … only to wake up one morning and “realize” he is Jack theRipper.And so it goes.The utterances of the Divine Name, which was supposed to make the devils trembleand place them at the will of the Magus, was at least equally powerful, it wasargued, to enforce their obedience for a purpose in consonance with their ownnature. Behind this there lay also the tacit assumption that it was easier tocontrol demons than to persuade angels. Then seeing that prayer to God and theinvocation of the Divine Names presuppose a proper spirit of reverence, devotionand love as the condition upon which prayer is heard, it became a condition inGoetia. The first impossibility required of the adept in Black Magic istherefore that he should love God before he bewitches his neighbor; that heshould put all his hopes in God before he makes pact with Satan; that, in aword, he should be good in order to do evil.—The Book of Ceremonial Magic34--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Mark Aarons & John Loftus, Unholy Trinity, St Martin’s Press, NY, 1991, p. 98 2 Russ Bellant, Old Nazis, The New Right and the Republican Party, South EndPress, Boston, 1991, p. 22 3 Russ Bellant, Old Nazis, The New Right and the Republican Party, South EndPress, Boston, 1991, p. 22 4 Sara Diamond, Not By Politics Alone: The Enduring Influence of the ChristianRight, Guilford Press, NY, 1998, p. 30 5 Sara Diamond, Spiritual Warfare: The Politics of the Christian Right, SouthEnd Press, Boston, 1989, p. 6-8 6 John Marks, The Search for the “Manchurian Candidate,” Times Books, NY, 1979,p. 75 7 Michela Wrong, In The Footsteps of Mr Kurtz, HarperCollins, NY, 2002, p. 80 8 Ibid., p. 82 9 Ibid., p. 82 10 Charles Higham, American Swastika, Doubleday, NY, 1985, p. 251 11 Ibid., p. 251 12 Ibid., p. 251-252 13 As reported in the Washington Post, Dec 28, 2002 14 Diamond, 1989, op. cit. p. 17 15 Ibid., p. 17 16 Ibid., p. 17 17 Ibid., p. 164-168 18 Bellant, op. cit., p. 65-68 19 Ibid., p. 72 20 Kenneth Wald, Religion and Politics in the United States, Washington DC,1992, p. 65 331 21 Peter Levenda, Unholy Alliance, Continuum, NY, 2002, p. 101-102 22 Diamond, 1998, op. cit., p. 93 23 Martin A.
