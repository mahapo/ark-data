It is as if something larger than oureducations, our sense of good and evil, our lives themselves, seems to beconstricting our existence, and this anxiety illumines Unholy Alliance like anight-light in some recess of the wall down a very long corridor.If magic is composed of a good many of those out-of-category forces that pressagainst established religions, so magic can also be seen, in relation totechnology at least, as the dark side of the moon. If a ( ator exists in companywith an opposite Presence (to be called Satan, for short), there is also themost lively possibility of a variety of major and minor angels, devils anddemons, good spirits and evil, working away more or less invisibly in our lives.For some, it is virtually a comfortable notion that magic is a practice that canexist, can even, to a small degree, be used, be manipulated (if often with realdanger for the practitioner). For such men and women, the proposition isassured—magic most certainly does exist as a feasi ble process—even if theaffirmative is obliged to appear in determinedly small letters when posedagainst technology: (How often can a curse be as effective as a bomb?)Nonetheless, given the many centuries of anecdotal and much-skewed evidence onthe subject, it is still not irrational to assume— even if one has never feltits effects oneself—to assume, yes— phenomena of a certain kind can be regardedas magical in those particular situations where magic offers the only rationalexplanation for events that are otherwise inexplicable. Indeed, this is probablytheForeword to the Second Editioncommon view. One explanation for the aggravated awe and misery that inhabitedAmerica in the days after the destruction of the Twin Towers was that the eventwas not only monstrous, but brilliantly effected in the face of all the factorsthat could have gone wrong for the conspirators. The uneasy and not-to-be-voicedhypothesis that now lived as a possibility in many a mind was that the successof the venture had been fortified by the collateral assistance of magic. Fewhappenings can be more terrifying to the modern psyche than the suggestion thatmagic is cooperating with technology. It is equal to saying that machines have aprivate psychology and large events, therefore, may be subject to Divine orSatanic intervention.So let us at least assume that magic is often present as a salient element inthe very scheme of things. Anyone who is offended by this need read no further.They will not be interested in Unholy Alliance. Its first virtue, after all, isin its assiduous detail, its close description of the events and ideas of theoccultists who gathered around the Nazis as practitioners, fellow travelers, andin the case of Himmler and the SS, as dedicated acolytes, fortified cultists.What augments the value of this work is the cold but understanding eye of theauthor. Since his knowledge of magic and magicians is intimate, one neverquestions whether he knows what he is writing about. Since he is alsoconsiderably disenchanted by the life practices of most of the magic workers, heis never taken in by assumptions of grandiosity or over-sweet New Agesentiments. He knows the fundamental flaw found in many occultists—it is thevice that brought them to magic in the first place—precisely their desire toobtain power over others without paying the price. The majority of occultists inthese pages appear to be posted on the particular human spectrum that runs fromimpotence to greed. All too often, they are prone, as a crew, to sectarian war,all-out cheating, gluttony, slovenliness, ill will and betrayal. Exactly. Theyare, to repeat, at whatever level they find themselves, invariably looking forthat gift of the gods—power that comes without the virtue of having been earned.The irony, of course, is that most of them, in consequence, pay large prices inill health, failure, isolation, addiction, deterioration of their largerpossibilities, even personal doom. Goethe did not conceive of Faust for toolittle.Foreword to the Second EditionPeter Levenda captures this paradox. What he also gives us is a suggestion thatcannot be ignored: The occultists on both sides in the Second World War(although most particularly Himmler and the Nazis) did have some real effect onits history, most certainly not enough to have changed the outcome, but enoughto have altered motives and details we have been taking for granted. What comesthrough the pages of Unholy Alliance is the canny political sense Hitlerpossessed in relation to the separate uses of magic and magicians. Lev-enda'sdispassionate treatment of charged evidence is managed (no small feat) in a wayto enable us to recognize that Hitler almost certainly believed in magic, andalso knew that such belief had to be concealed in the subtext of his speechesand endeavors. Open avowal could be equal to political suicide.He was hell, therefore, on astrologers—and packed ofl many to concentrationcamps especially after Rudolf Hess' flight to England in 1941, did his best (andwas successful) in decimating the gypsy population of Europe, sneered publiclyat seers, psychic gurus, fortunetellers, all the small fry of the occultmovement. He saw them clearly as impediments to his own fortunes, negativebaggage to his reputation. Yet Hitler gave his support to the man he made intothe second most important Nazi in existence, Heinrich Himmler, an occultist ofno small dimension.It was as if Hitler lived within a particular Marxist notion. It was Engels'dictum that \"Quantity changes quality.\" One potato is something you eat, athousand potatoes are to be brought to market, and with a billion potatoes,corner the market. In parallel, a little magic practiced by a small magician canprove a folly or a personal enhancement, a larger involvement brings on thecannibalistic practices to be expected of a magicians' society, and a huge butcamouflaged involvement, the Nazi movement itself, with its black-shirted KnightTemplars of SS men, becomes an immense vehicle that will do its best to drivethe world into a new religion, a new geography, a new mastery of the future.All of this is in Levenda's book. It is an immense if obligatorily compressedthesis—the economies of publishing would never permit a one-thousand-page tomeon this subject by a new author—and the potentially large virtues of the worksuffer to a degree from over-compression—one feels the need to expand being heldin much tooclose rein by the writer, but then, there are few daring and ambitious worksthat do not generate sizable flaws. Literature may be the most unforgiving ofthe goddesses!In any event, I am delighted that Unholy Alliance is being republished because Ihave always found it a most provocative and valuable work on each of the threetimes I have read it, and have never come away without returning in my mind tothe rich ore brought forth at the pit-head of virtually every page.— Norman MailerPreface to the Second EditionIn the years since 1995 when this book was first published, the author has hadoccasion to see some of his anxieties—predictions would be an overstatement—cometo sad fruition.The very ending of this book's final chapter, the quotation from Charles Mansonthat America's children were \"coming right at you/ came hideously to life withthe Columbine High School massacre in 1999 in which children slaughtered theirclassmates with firearms. These same children had idolized the Nazis, and hadselected Hitler's birthday—April 20—as the day to launch their sickeningoffensive.In a note more harrowing than thrilling, author Stephen King reminded us in theNew York Times Magazine of September 23, 2001, that the next phase of theColumbine children's crusade was to hijack an airliner and fly it into the WorldTrade Center in New York City.Out of the guns of babes . . .Religious fanaticism and mystical identification of the political body with theGodhead has led to increased terror attacks all over the world, mostparticularly of course the events of September 1 1, 2001. I he ostensible reasonbehind this series of attacks was the removal of non-Muslim forces from thesacred soil of Saudi Arabia and the cessation of American support for Israel,both politico-religious goals reflective of intense mystical convictions.In addition, we are just learning of the depth of the horror that has beentaking place in the Balkan states—in Serbia, Croatia, Kosovo, and elsewhere—asthe perpetrators of religious and ethnic cleansing and virtual genocide arebrought to some form of justice at the Hague.Preface to the Second Edii ionIn Southeast Asia, the prime minister of a predominantly Muslim nation blamedthe Asian economic crisis of 1997 on a Jewish conspiracy masterminded by GeorgeSoros.In thai same- nation today, one ean purchase reprints of I lenry Ford's rabidami Semitic polemic, The International Jew, at newsstands everywhere.

As mentioned in both the Introduction and the final chapter of thisbook, I was the unwilling beneficiary of Schafer's hospitality one Sundaymorning in the Chilean winter of 1979. Sc hafer has managed to evade capture, itis thought, by taking advantage of the- elaborate tunnel system he had builtunder the Colony, a system designed in part by an American neo-Nazi andmastermind of the assassination of Orlando Letelier, Michael Vernon Townslcy.(Ironically, Townslcy's father was a ford Motor employee in Santiago.)Then, in the- spring of 1999, I was invited to Germany for a taping of atelevision documentary on evil. The venue was the- spiritual headquarters of I[immler's SS, the castle at Wewelsburg which is described at length in ( JiapterSix. I spent several pleasant days in the company of the film crew at our basein Paderborn, and made the acquaintanceof a (lerman filmmaker—Dr. Kerstin Stutterheim—whose documenon Nazi occultism is essential viewing for anyone interested in thesubject.

Calling magic a \"pseudo-science\" is also setting up a straw manfor burning at the stake. Magic does not pretend to be chemistry or physics. Onemight as well call Roman Catholicism, the paintings of Picasso, or the films ofMarilyn Monroe pseudo-science, if one wishes to devalue them speedily and doesnot have the intellectual gifts to do so on their own terms. One might as wellcomplain about the unnecessary complexity of Rube Goldberg machinery: confusingform with function is often a characteristic of the cultural critic as it is ofthe devout scientist, a case of wondering why roses are red and violets areblue. And as much as the scientist scoffs at magic, in equal terms does thepolitician, military commander, and terrorist mastermind employ magic as one ofthe weapons in a specialized arsenal of the arcane, alongside psychologicalwarfare, disinformation, Vi-etnamization, and assassination. War is the ultimateproof of utility: if a weapon works, it stays in the arsenal. Magic has beenpart of the arsenal of politics and of war (the continuation, after all, ofpolitics by other means) for millennia, alongside the club, the siege engine,gunpowder, advertising campaigns, and dirty tricks.Far be it from this author, however, to wrestle with such complex issues in thislimited space.

It was profoundlydark, as only a poor village of sleeping farmers can be. But it was not silent.From every side came the endless crowing of roosters and the unnerving howlingof dogs like a sound track from hell.There is something biblically ominous about a rooster crowing in the night and,when compounded by the braying of unseen hounds, one's composure is shaken intosplintery fragments of old horror films. Monster movies, yes; and documentaryfilms as well, for the twentieth century has given us a surfeit of both and it'ssometimes hard to tell the difference between them. I remembered grainy scenesof goose-stepping soldiers, military vehicles groaning through the streets,civilians murdered in their homes. On television, when I was a child, it hadbeen World War II in black and white. Today it was the Republic of Chile, inliving color.It was cold. I shivered. Under other circumstances I might have welcomed theblue-steel chill of anxiety as a tickle from the feather of Maat, the Egyptiangoddess who measures the weight of the human soul against it. But there was,that night, even more at risk than the teasing promise of eternal life and thesoul's weary passage through the gloomy domain of Anubis, the dog-faced God ofHell.After all, there was more than hounds' teeth waiting for me in the dark.The animals themselves were mysteriously invisible as I made my way on brokenpavement past the shuttered windows of the town's bakery, grocery, stationerystore; tiny buildings huddled together for warmth and succor beneath the belltower of the village church. I supposed the dogs were tethered in yards and theroosters locked in coops behind the high, whitewashed stone and brick walls thatlined the dismal streets. To the east behind me rose the Andes Mountains in alltheir brooding splendor, black against the black night sky. It was two days pastthe new moon, and the sky was full of stars.There was menace in the air that winter. The papers had been full of storiesabout cells of resistance to Pinochet's fascist regime—the brave Miristas—beingdiscovered by the army and wiped out with characteristic brutality. There was nopolice force in Chile; the army was the police. There was no Congress. The Armywas the Congress. There were no courts. None were considered necessary. Evennow, nearly six years after the violent and bloody overthrow of Allende'sgovernment, there was still martial law in the streets of Santiago. Only theevening before, I had to be certain to rush back to my hotel before curfew beganas if I were a character in Casablanca. The Wehrmacht-style uniforms and goosestep march of the Chilean soldiers did nothing to ameliorate the feeling that Iwas in a time warp, living in a German city sometime in 1939 instead of in aSouth American city in 1979. The recruiting posters for the army that depictedthe Chilean officer's engraved dagger reminded me that I was in a country whoseleader admired the SS. A nervous young man of perhaps eighteen in a greatcoatand Sam Browne belt, the distinctive helmet with the ear guards like somethingout of Hogans Heroes pulled down over his forehead, had aimed his M-16 at mefrom the guardhouse of the military academy because I had tried to take hispicture. The architecture of the academy itself was like something out of thewet dream of a Bavarian sadomasochist, but it was subdued when compared to theaggressively alpine motif of the Santiago Country Club.And La Moneda —the Presidential Palace where Salvador Allende spent his finalhours—was, like Chilean democracy, still in ruins.So why had I gone deep into the South American interior far from Santiago orindeed any other sizable city—to find myself unarmed and alone in the villagesquare of Parral at four o'clock in themorning? If anything had happened to me there, no one would haw-known. Therewould have been no witnesses. No official reports. No body flown back to theUnited States for burial.In fact, if things had gone just a bit more badly than they did, there wouldhave been very little body left to send back.I was in Parral, in central Chile, at the foot of the Andes Mountains that lateJune of 1979 because I was probing the heart of the Chilean darkness, a neo-Naziencampment, cult and torture center known as Colonia Dignidad.The Colony of Righteousness.Mark my words, Bormann, I'm going to become very religion— Adoi f HitlerLike many people, I was shocked to learn of the Catholic Church'scomplicity in helping Nazi war criminals escape Europe and certain death at thehands of the Nuremberg Tribunals. The Church had provided them with visas andpassports in false identities, an underground railroad out of Europe composed ofmonaster) \"safe houses along the way, and—in some cases—religious costume:dressing up the various butchers and torturers in the robes of Catholic priests.That the Church would be involved in aiding and abetting these fugitives fromjustice was shocking enough; that they were helping some of the most rabidanti-Catholics the twentieth century had ever known was beyond comprehension.And the man in charge of this now infamous operation, called by various namesCaritas or Aktion Undid, was none other than the future Pope Paul VI.These were some of the allegations made in a book by the best-selling author ofPatton and The Game of the Fo.\\r>: Ladislas Farago. The book was calledAftermath: Martin Bormann and the Fourth Reich. With meticulous detail, Faragoreported his search for el gran fugitive Martin Bormann—former Reichsleiter andHitlers right-hand man— who, Farago claimed, had escaped to South Americadressed as a priest. Farago even went so far as to claim that Bormann, using thename \"Father Augustin,\" had celebrated Mass and performed at least one marriageceremony in Argentina. Farago even had Bormann attending the funeral for formerPresident Juan Peron, his alleged protector in Argentina.The Nazi/South American connection is so well known it has become part of thefolklore of World War II. Whether Bormann really made it to South America ordied in Berlin in 1945 is still a matter for speculation. When Farago's book waspublished, there was a general reaction among establishment historians that hehad been fooled and manipulated by unscrupulous Latin police departments andshadowy \"informers\" who had lied to him pathologically . . . and profitably. Forsome reason, it was anathema to believe that Bormann had escaped even though weknew Adolf Eichmann had made it to South America (where he was captured by theIsraelis) and that Dr. Josef Mengele, the Angel of Death at Auschwitz, was infact hiding in Brazil.Heretofore a well-respected popular historian, Farago found himself attacked onall sides for daring to suggest—albeit with careful documentation—that MartinBormann, the highest-ranking Nazi in the world after Hitler, had actuallysurvived into the 1970s. Those of us who were familiar with the success of SimonWiesenthal, among others, in hunting down Nazi war criminals through alabyrinthine maze of underground safe houses, secret societies, and foreigncountries, were willing to at least credit Farago's research, which was asextensive, scrupulous, and thorough as one had come to expect of thisHungarian-born specialist in World War II history. But some of what he discussedseemed so outlandish that critics felt Farago was being had.Like many others, I bought Aftermath and read it cover to cover in almost asingle sitting. It was, after all, the height of Watergate paranoia those days,a time when anything was possible and when any criminal conspiracy by governmentleaders entirely credible. While his story read like any of the best politicalthrillers of the day, one statement in particular caught my eye. It concernedBormann's living accommodations in Chile when he—according to Farago and tovarious Argentine and Chilean security officials—had to leave Argentina afterthe death of his friend, Juan Peron. It seemed he spent his time between afriend's estate outside Santiago and a small town south of the city. A town bythe name of Parral:Located in the latter region is the weirdest Nazi encampment of the postwarworld, housing a sect that combines Nazism and voodooism. Enormously rich frommysterious sources, it maintains a heavily forti-Introduction \\ Jfied estancia called Colonia Dignidad. It is virtually extraterritorial,enjoying privileges and immunities otherwise reserved only tor diplomats. It wasto the hacienda of Colonia Dignidad, called \"El Lavadero,\" eighteen miles fromParral, camouflaged as a \"cultural dnd welfare society,\" that Martin Bormannwould move when, fatigued by his restless lite in exile, he sought a place wherehe could he at peaceNazism and voodooism? Weird encampment? Wealthy from mysterious sources? Itsounded like something out of a Ludlum novel, dnd I began making arrangements tosee it for myself.Farago's book was published in 1974, the year after General Au-gusto Pinochet'soverthrow of the Allende government in Chile, with its resulting dissolution ofthe Chilean Congress and the suspension of all civil liberties following theestablishment of martial law. As the book by Thomas Hauser and later theCosta-Gavras film, Missing, made abundantly clear, Chilenos were not the onlyones subject to arrest, interrogation, torture, and murder by government forcesin Chile. Americans were also vulnerable. At least two American citizens weretaken from their homes, tortured, and murdered in the days immediately followingthe coup.Living in New York City, I was able to keep abreast of developments in Chilethrough a wide circle of emigres and political refugi some of whom were ongovernment hit lists. Through them I was able to learn of the actual existenceof Colonia Dignidad, although no one I spoke with knew very much more about itthan was published in Farago's book. Chile was in turmoil; people were beingrounded up and \"disappeared\" for years after the initial coup. It would be fiveyears before I was able to venture into the Chilean hinterlands myself, but whenI did I was to find that nothing there had changed. Nothing at all.As I boarded the Lan Chile flight from Kennedy Airport in New York to Santiago,Chile, I was frisked for the first time in my liie. My youthful, beardedappearance must have given the security people pause. Yet, a few minutes earliera crew-cut, blond-haired American man in front of me had very kindly opened analuminum carrying case and displayed his rifle with telescopic sight to thecounter people prior to having it tagged for our flight.The scene came back to me as I boarded the plane, knowing that at least oneperson—and an American at that—was taking a firearm with him, even if it was inthe luggage compartment. So (I asked myself for the hundredth time that week)what was I doing traveling to that most frightening of potential destinations, aThird World military dictatorship?Writing a book, as it turns out. A potentially soporific study of how religiousand cult organizations have influenced political movements since the MiddleAges. The occult has rarely been a topic of serious study by professionalhistorians; yet occultism and secret societies devoted to the occult have beenknown to wield a disproportionate influence over political events in manycountries. While academic historians may agree that this has been the case inthe past, no one seriously wants to entertain the notion that cults stillfunction effectively—if somewhat haphazardly—in the present day. Because thebasis for occult beliefs is often what historian James Webb has called \"rejectedknowledge,\" 3 academics tend to reject occultists as history's sideshow freaks:gullible, wide-eyed, and crazed naifs floating in a twilight world ofschizophrenia and paranoia. Whatever one thinks of the beliefs of theoccultists—I thought—one must credit their basic courage and their unusuallyhigh levels of intelligence. Courage, because they have chosen to live outsidethe \"system\": of religion, of custom, of all those things with which societyidentifies itself and its members. Intelligence, because the occultists onecomes across in the few histories available are generally well traveled, speakseveral foreign languages (including a few dead ones), and have doneconsiderable reading in a variety of disciplines, both mainstream andunderground. In effect, occultists share many traits in common with JFKconspiracy theorists; and, yes, paranoia does seem to be a prerequisite formembership in either community but then, as the late literary critic AnatoleBroyard once remarked, \"Paranoids are the only ones who notice things anymore.\"4 I knew the occult was a major factor in the Nazi Weltanschauung, but this factwas being ignored both by most historians and by those people who consideredthemselves well read on twentieth century history.As 1 write these lines, the Skinheads have become a menace both in America andin Europe and the rise of racist violence on both sides of the Atlantic seems tobe taking social critics by surprise. No one seemsable to understand what attraction the defeated Nazi Party holds for adolescentwhite males; certainly no one understands the dimensionsof the potential threat to world peace a resurgence of Nazism has in store forus and for our children. To fill this gap—and to satisfy those smug critics ofoccult \"histories\" who insist that the evidence for .1 Nazi occult conspiracy isvirtually nonexistent or at best irrelevant and trivial—I was busy developing amass of source material that would show not only how the Nazi Party wasessentially the product of a mystical and peculiarly occult vision, but that theweight of previous centuries of religio-political history would demonstrate justhow pervasive is the relationship between politics and occult ideas.So, to counteract the drowsy accumulation of dense references to forgottenfraternities and lunatic philosophies, Colonia Dignidad seemed like a natural:Nazis in hiding, weird voodooistic rites in the mountains, unlimited sources ofincome. It would be the crowning achievement of an otherwise dry, academic studyof right-wing fanatics, fundamentalist Christian, Jewish, and Muslim sects,spiritual corruption and corporeal violence at all levels of society. Coloni.iDignidad would represent relevant, up-to-date, man-on-the-scene research.I had already spoken with Klan leaders and the members of several neo-Naziorganizations in the United States, most of whom were really pathetic groups ofmen who lived somewhere on the border of abused child and serial killer. Iwatched convicted Klansman Roy Frankhouser literally kick his mother down thestairs of his Reading, Pennsylvania, \"church.\" I helped a Volkswagen van full ofAmerican Nazis find their way out of a small town when it turned out that noneof the Master Race could read a road map. I stood on line at a McDonald's in NewJersey as a half-dozen crazed hypoglycemics, sporting outlandish black SS-typeuniforms with red, white, and back double-thunderbolt armbands—the elite guardof James Madole's rabid National Renaissance Party—loaded up on Big Macs, fries,and shakes while I tried to appear as if I was traveling alone.Now I was about to investigate the real thing. Real Nazis. Escaped warcriminals. Pagan idolators. Screaming psychos in the Andean forests. Little didI know that at that very moment events were being [nit in motion ten thousandmiles away that would have an effect on myactivities in Chile and which would, in the final analysis, actually save mylife.Farago's book was roundly, even viciously, attacked. \"It wasn't true. Itcouldn't be true. Bormann's body was found in Berlin, wasn't it? There wereeyewitnesses who said that Bormann had been shot crossing a bridge, weren'tthere?\" Therefore, the rest of the book had to be flawed. The troublingimplication for me was that perhaps there was no Colonia Dignidad, or that thewhole thing had been exaggerated beyond recognition. Perhaps Colonia Dignidadwas nothing more than a community of old European immigrants, living out theirlives growing the grapes from which the excellent Chilean wines are produced.Perhaps they were—as Penthouse editor Peter Bloch would later tell me to myastonishment—merely some unpleasant people who only happened to be German, andnot Nazis-in-hiding.Perhaps there was no Colonia Dignidad at all.When I landed in Santiago I immediately tried to make reservations on a flightback to the States for the following week, but found that all seats were bookeda month in advance. Nonetheless, I put my name on a waiting list and gave theairline the name of my hotel—the gravely misnomered Grand Palace, two floors ofan office building in downtown Santiago. I phoned in every day and visited theticket offices, but there were no seats, a situation that would soon change inan unexpected way.I spent the first few days in Santiago seeing the sights, reheating my Spanish,and looking for a few of the locations identified in Farago's book as Nazifronts. The house and gift shop of Mark Biichs was there, in the Providenciasection on Calle San Pablo, just as Farago described it. Mark Biichs was afriend of Bormann, according to Farago, and a devoted Nazi. His gift shop was onthe main street—with a large sign that said, simply, \"Mark Biichs\"—and Ibrazenly went inside and bought a small trinket. A souvenir, you might say, ofmy days of Nazi-hunting on a budget. Then, I followed Calle San Pablo down tothe house at the cul-de-sac, which had several burly men standing around, doingnothing, staring at everything. There were two Mercedeses in the driveway; anice touch.I went back across the street from Mark Buchs's and took a few surreptitiousphotographs from behind a lamp post.So far, none of this was earning me a Pulitzer. In the midst of all myNazi-hunting paranoia, however, there was also sadness. After all, I was walkingin the very footsteps of Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral ... for that countryhas given the world two Nobel Prize-winning poets. Chile had been the mostliterate country in the Western Hemisphere until the coup d'etat that putPinochet in power. Chile had also boasted the longest continuous democracy inSouth America. Unlike its neighbors, it had never succumbed to the peristalticintervals of civil war and revolution that stereotype Latin governments in theeyes of most North Americans. Salvador Allende had been a democratically electedpresident who had also survived a confidence vote later in his administration.It would take a CIA-ITT-financed truckers' strike, punitive World Bank actionsinstigated by the United States, and a junta of Chilean military power—aided,abetted, and gleefully encouraged by the United States government under Nixonand Kissinger—to put an end to democracy in Chile for many years. And PabloNeruda, Chile's most beloved poet, would die only days later; some say of abroken heart but the truth is much grimmer: his home was surrounded for fivedays by Pinochet's troops so that Neruda—gravely ill with cancer of theprostate—could not receive the vital medical attention he needed.Later, a much-admired former Chilean statesman—Orlando Lete-lier—would bemurdered in the streets of Washington, D.C., by agents of the Pinochet regime;victim of a conspiracy masterminded by an American assassin: a morally bankruptpsychopath and electronics freak who had designed the torture chambers ofColonia Dignidad.In the end I managed to make arrangements to go to the tiny town of Parral,where the infamous Colonia was supposed to be located. I rode a very comfortablePullman bus that took the Pan American Highway south through the village of SanFernando (a rest stop where I ate a cold hot dog on a stale bun: a localdelicacy called una vienisa, a \"Viennese\") and then into the province ofLinares. As we drove further south the sun began to set, and in the waning lightat one stop I could see a small crowd of people—old men and a few women—in apoor, ramshackle village, huddling around a fire in an oil drum in the muddydirt road that served as their Main Street. Small children, dressed in littlemore than rags, were coming from all directions carry-ing planks and odd lengths of lumber to feed the flames. It was as if they weretearing down their village, piece by piece, for warmth.I arrived at Parral in the middle of the night. Other than the sounds of thehowling dogs and crowing roosters, the streets were absolutely empty. There wereno lights on in the homes, or around the square with its obligatory statue ofBernardo O'Higgins, the oddly nomencla-tured Father of his Country. The Catholicchurch in the square was dark, its only illumination the deep red glow of thetabernacle lamp that affirmed the lonely presence of God somewhere in themysterious heart of this remote village. In the distance, I could make out thetrain station and decided to walk in that direction and perhaps find someplacewarm to sit until the sun came up.June in Chile is the beginning of winter. It was quite cold, and I was gettinghungry, but there was nothing for it but to wait until I could find someone todrive me out to the Colony. As I made my way down the deserted calles to thestation, a bizarre figure from out of a Fellini film suddenly appeared in thedull wash of a streetlamp at the far end: a man, wrapped in a dark woolen ponchoand wearing a beret, riding on a bicycle, and carrying a large greasy stick,with a mangy dog attached to his bike by means of a heavy chain.He bade me stop and identify myself, claiming that he was the \"night watchman\"{el vigilante) for the town. He appeared old and grizzly, with a three-daygrowth of stubble, but he was the only human being abroad in the night and hisdog looked vicious, so I dutifully handed him my passport.\"North American, huh? We've never seen a norteamericano down here before. Whereare you from? Chicago?\" He grinned at me in my trench coat, visions of Al Caponeand bathtub gin dancing in his eyes.\"No. New York.\"Almost as good.\"What are you doing here?\"\"Waiting for a train.\"At this, he laughed.\"A train? In the middle of Parral in the middle of the night? I don't think so.You had better tell me the truth.\"As he was trying to find out what I was doing in his town, we were approached bytwo more men drawn by the sound of our voices.These wore the uniforms—and carried the rifles—of the army, and my newfoundfriend made the introductions.They also asked to see my passport, and they passed ii among themselves,shifting their weapons from hand to hand as they did so. Now I was nervous.Would I be arrested? Would I be \"disappeared\" like my American predecessors?Would I be tortured first, then killed?At that point, the night watchman, Senor Francisco Molinas, invited us all tohis house for a drink.The pickle jar of homemade aquardiente went around a few times, and I wasobserved drinking the stuff and eating a grape that had been marinated in thatcrystal-clear, overproof moonshine for what must have been more years than I wasalive if the mule kick it gave me was any indication. The two soldiers leanedtheir rifles up against the wall of the one-room shack, warm in the heat of asmoky, wood-burning stove, and we all sat around talking.I was well aware of my position, and I most certainly did not want to get drunk.I feigned shock at the tremendous alcoholic content of the moonshine, coughingand gasping, which brought smiles of approval from my companions along the orderof \"that gringo has never tasted really good, strong liquor before, not like wehave in Chile.\" And eventually the topic of conversation turned to what exactly1 was doing in their tiny town in the middle of a rural Chilean nowhere.It was then that I realized I could not keep it a secret any longer. It wasfoolish to insist that I was simply waiting for a train, although that was thefirst thing that came to mind when I saw Mr. Molinas and his dog. I told themthe truth, that I had come to Parral to seek Colonia Dignidad.It was as if a cold wind had just gusted through the room straight from thesnowy peaks of the Andes. My hosts sobered up Immediately. It was their turn tobe shocked, for it seemed as if they had truly not expected me to be there on sofoolhardy a mission.The troops warned me repeatedly not to go. That it was dangerous. That thepeople of La Colonia were hated and despised throughout the region. That theyfunctioned as an independent state, completely separate from any localauthority. That they operated a medical clinic that was free to the locals twodays a week, but that it was a last resort for most Chileans because they didnot trust the German doctors andespecially not a particular German nurse with a sadistic gleam and brutaldisposition. That they were all foreigners, not a Chileno among them. That theyreceived checks for large sums of money that came in the mail from all over theworld. Including the United States. That they were well armed. That if I wentthere, I would probably not return.That they practiced strange rites in the forests on holidays that were unknownto the Christian calendar.Whether it was the false courage of the aguardiente or the realization that Ihad come this far and wasn't about to return empty-handed, or the immortalconfidence of a twenty-eight-year-old weekend warrior sitting around hobnobbingwith armed soldiers in an alien land as if he belonged there ... I decided that,as soon as the sun was up, I would go.We parted amicably at dawn. The troops would not prevent me from going to theColony. It was not against the law to go there, to voluntarily enter where manyhad tried to escape, only stupid. After the soldiers left, Senor Molinasintroduced me to his young and beautiful wife and three children in aneighboring hut where they had been sleeping, wrapped in woolen blankets on thefloor. Blinking in the light of a kerosene lantern, they stirred awake andsmiled at me: a weird apparition in trench coat and camera. Molinas had toreturn to his mysterious occupation, and left me temporarily in the care of hisbrother, who insisted that I visit his house. Dawn was just breaking, and therewas no transportation anyway, so I followed the shorter Sr. Molinas hermano tohis home, whereupon he disappeared for a moment into another room.Looking around, I could see that the people of Parral lived quite simply. Therewere religious pictures on one wall, and a heavily carved and painted woodencrucifix—that looked at least a hundred years old—on another. Finally, my hostappeared and in his hand was a rifle.It took me a moment to realize it wasn't pointed at me. He offered the rifle formy inspection—a surprisingly lightweight, bolt-action model of uncertainmanufacture—and asked me if I wanted to go hunting with him and his friends. Iswallowed, and then politely declined, saying that I had to go to La Colonia. Hesmiled a little ruefullyand took a good, long look at me as if for the last time. 1 le shook his head,and then my hand, and led me out the door and directed meback to the town square.It still being deserted, I made my way on foot to a gas sua ion on the highwayoutside of town that had a cafe, and 1 ate what 1 reasonably assumed could verywell be my last meal, of steak and onions in an otherwise-deserted restaurant.Then I returned to the square and, finding a cabdriver waiting around in frontof the church—it was now Sunday morning and 1 could see preparations for Massbeing made through the open doors—we agreed on a price and made for ColoniaDignidad with all haste.In 1979, the Colony of Righteousness was reached by a dirt road off the PanAmerican Highway, south of Parral, that wound up and around a series offoothills of the Andes Mountains. At one point there is a fork in the road. Aleft turn will take you to a popular hot spring resort. The right road takes youpast something called La Colonia Italiana, a poverty-stricken estate of starvingburros and emaciated farmers, before you reach the higher ground and the mainentrance to Colonia Dignidad. I thought it ironic that the German colony shouldbe situated cheek by jowl with an Italian counterpart, as if the Axis powers hadfelt it necessary to reproduce themselves in microcosmic form in thisout-of-the-way section of South American forest.But as we climbed higher into the mountains, passing a pair of huasos or Chileangauchos on horseback, their Clint Eastwood hats and serapes making them seemlike noble lords of the hills, I noticed a striking difference between ColoniaItaliana and Colonia Dignidad. The latter smelled of money. The veryforests—mostly dark and evergreen, like some kind of displacedSchwarzwald—seemed manicured. Finally, we crossed a small, decorative bridge anddrove through an open gate to a parking area in front of a rustic woodenbuilding that I guessed housed some sort of reception facility.At this point my driver became very agitated. He urged me to take my photographsquickly so that we could get the hell out of there. 1 didn't need to be warnedtwice. I jumped out of the car and took perhaps ten or twelve shots in rapidsuccession, covering 360 degreesaround me, elated that I had what were probably the only photos of ColoniaDignidad in honest (that is to say, civilian) captivity. It was then that Iheard muffled conversation coming from behind the door of the wooden receptionbuilding, a building that I had thought was unoccupied. From the bursts ofstatic that accompanied the voices, I knew that someone was talking on a radio.In German.I ran back to the car and my driver hit the gas pedal . . . and then the brakein rapid succession. Before us, the gate we had driven through so brazenly onlymoments before closed electronically, and a car—a white Mercedes with Venetianblinds in the rear window— appeared from nowhere to block our escape. All fourcar doors opened, and some of the largest human beings I have ever seen left theMercedes and came over to surround our car. My driver's hands were frozen,white-knuckled, to the steering wheel, and he kept saying, over and over, \"Oh,no. Oh, no.\" From every angle around us, more men appeared, some dressed inersatz fatigues with Sam Browne belts and others in surgical blues. Visions ofMengele in his lab, or of the mad dentist in Marathon Man, fought for control ofmy heartbeat. All the men were running, panting, out of breath.We had caught the Nazis with their pants down on a beautiful, sunny, Sundaymorning . . . and now they had caught us.The By-Paths to Chaos*The German soul has passages and galleries in it, there are caves, hiding-placesy and dungeons therein; its disorder has much of the charm of the mysterious;the German is well acquainted with the by-paths to chaos.— Friedrich Nietzsche# 1 #Of Blood, Sex, and the Rune MagiciansPrologue: Christmas Day, 1907. A Castle in Upper Austria, on the Danube. Againsta backdrop of snow-covered hills and ice-blue sky, church bells and Christmascarols, a flag is raised over Burg Werfenstein and, for the first time, theworld sees a swastika banner fluttering in the breeze over Europe. Men dressedin white robes emblazoned with red crosses — Rune Magicians — raise their armsand voices in pagan chant to Baldur, the Sun God, Lord of the Winter Solstice.The Order of the New Templars is proclaimed, while, only a few miles away, youngAdolf Hitler has just buried his mother.Most of us live in a world that is neatly organized around several basicprinciples. Like medieval serfs who lived secure in the knowledge that there wasa God in heaven and a Satan in hell, that humanity was the battleground betweenthese two forces, and that God was winning, we twentieth-century serfs bask inthe comfort of a world that (we are told) is the product of purely scientificprinciples. Genesis lias given way to The Origin of Species and the Big Bang. Wehave landed on the moon, rather than drawing it down with incantations and ritesof witchcraft. We heal with lasers and sterilized instruments to a backbeat ofthe blips and beeps of electronic monitoring equipment; the frac-tured rhythms of the witch doctor's drums are but a faint echo of old fears andtainted memories.Thus, we assume, all sane men and women are guided by scientific principles intheir daily lives; and this is especially true, we sometimes like to think, ofour politicians. What more prosaic a lot of people can there be but the House ofRepresentatives or the House of Commons? A debate on the Senate floor—althoughtelevised in all its stultifying detail on something called C-SPAN—is rarelygripping; not quite the stuff of Becket or Richard III. There is little in theway of poetry or vision in American politics anymore, and that is largelybecause the Romantic ideals of our ancestors have been discredited with thepassage of time. We are nations of laws, and these laws are constantly changingto reflect new \"realities\" created—not by philosophers or metaphysicians ortheologians—but by scientists and technicians. The very fact that Americans cantune in their television sets and watch live coverage of a debate in the Houseover funding allocations for a program they've never heard of is somewhatcomforting. It means, in fact, that the wheels of government grind on, in theopen, with boring, peristaltic regularity, aided and abetted by scientificinvention and technological achievement. A bureaucracy on Geritol.While, outside on the streets, civilization is breaking down so fast Westernsociety is on the verge of a catastrophe of major proportions.A Communist might say the reasons for the decline of the Western way of life arepurely economic and that the warring factions are economic classes strugglingfor dominance over the means of production.But there are few Communists abroad in the land anymore; fewer still who couldcarry that argument with any conviction, no matter how reasonable it might seemtoday. After all, an L.A. street gang performing a drive-by shooting on rivalgang members to enforce their control of the drug trade on some bleak city blockseems hardly what Mao had in mind when he wrote \"All power comes from the barrelof a gun,\" or what Marx and Engels meant by \"Workingmen of all countries,unite!\"The polarity within which so much of the twentieth century was written—Communismand Fascism—has crumbled. The Soviet Union—Hitler's greatest enemy after theJews—has fallen. The mapof Europe has been redrawn, with a reunified Germany as its centerpiece. Itscapital is Berlin, once again.Who had reason to celebrate the most when the Berlin Wall came down?And who is celebrating now that the races have become, if anything, even moredivided; when we read once again about a \"Jewish-Masonic conspiracy\" as therationale for \"ethnic cleansing\"; when the potential for racial violence allover the world has escalated to heights unheard of thirty, forty years ago?While science is humming along nicely inside our homes, just what the hell ishappening outside, and why?If we are honest with ourselves we know we can't answer all these questions witha few canned explanations about the decline of the nuclear family or the failureof the social welfare system. There is clearly something more going on here. Ourpoliticians are not men of science; they never were. They live as dangerouslyclose to the Beast Within as the rest of us; perhaps even more so. In the end,the difference between a seasoned politician and a gang-banger with a machinegun is very slight, a difference of style rather than substance. If that seemsto be overstating the case, just ask anyone who lived in Berlin in 1919. Or inMunich in 1923. Or Vienna in 1938. Poland in 1941.Santiago in 1973.Or Sarajevo in 1994.Ask anyone on the receiving end of Nazi occultism.The epigraph from Thomas Mann at the beginning of this book is taken from DoctorFaustus. The author thought that both quotation and source were apt selectionsto christen this discussion. Doctor Faustus, after all, is a novel that takesplace in Germany during the rise and fall of Hitler. Its title comes from a longGerman tradition of Doctors Faustus: magicians and occultists who have soldtheir souls to Satan in the next life for personal power and glory in this one.Thomas Mann himself lived to see his books burned in great bonfires throughoutGermany in that impotent gesture by the Nazi government during the war of ideasthat has characterized our century.Even more apt, however, is Satan's own explanation for the \"secret delight ofhell\": as Mann understands it, hell's delight is that it cannot be discussed ordescribed, that \"it is not to be informed on.\"It is the author's intention, therefore, to steal some of hell's secret delightand security; to shine a light, however feebly or inexpertly, on that corner ofhistory's basement few professional historians have dared to visit, and to showthe reader why. We will trace the history of a cult so lethal nosensationalistic tales of satanic serial killers hacking women to death insuburban cellars can come close to matching the horror, or the evil; a cult thatstill exists to this day, its activities aided, abetted, and protected by avariety of the world's governments.And to do that, we must begin with a scene of utter chaos; with the breakdown ofcivilization; with rooftop snipers and roving gangs with guns; with terror andmadness; with mystical diagrams and pagan rituals in ruined castles; with avision of hell itself.We must begin with Munich in 1918.Descent into HellThe city is in turmoil. The Kaiser's republic has collapsed with the defeat ofGermany in the First World War, and the whole country is up for grabs. Itappears as if Germany is about to fall apart into the warring city-states fromwhich it had been assembled nearly fifty years ago. The victorious Allies aredemanding enormous concessions from Germany. The Russian Revolution has been infull swing for a year, and German soldiers returning from the front are beingcajoled into helping midwife the same type of Communist regime amid the ashes ofthe Second Reich.Kurt Eisner—an intellectual and a Jew, a defender of the League of Nations—takesthe initiative and proclaims a Socialist Republic in Munich on the seventh ofNovember, 1918. It looks as if there is going to be a Communist regime inGermany—or, at least, a Socialist one in Bavaria—after all. Hysteria grows amongthe nationalists, and with it despair that their nation is on the verge ofrealizing the dreams of Marx and Engels as codified in their famous Manifesto.Germans are bewildered, shocked . . . stunned into a kind of nervousstupefaction. They have lost the war, their country may be broken up once againinto many separate bickering pieces, and there will soon be Communists callingthe shots in Berlin and in the capital city of Bavaria: Munich.Within forty-eight hours there is a meeting of the Thule Gesellschaft. TheThule, a mystical society based in part on the theosophical writings of Guidovon List and Lanz von Liebenfels—which is to say, an amalgam of Easternreligion, theosophy, anti-Semitism, C irail romance, runic mystification, andNordic paganism—meets every Saturday in spacious rooms at the elegant FourSeasons Hotel in Munich. There are roughly 250 members of the Thule in Munich .. . and over fifteen hundred in Bavaria. On that day, November 9, a bizarreindividual, an occultist, an initiate of the Eastern mysteries in Turkey as wellas of Freemasonry, and the leader and founder of the Thule— the self-styledBaron Rudolf von Sebottendorff—makes an impassioned plea to the assembledcultists for armed resistance to the Reds. This plea eventually degenerates intoa monologue on runes, German racial theory, Nordic mythology, and other arcanelore. No matter. Most of his listeners know what to expect. They are, in fact,members of the supersecret, superracist, and superoccult \"German Order Wal-vaterof the Holy Grail,\" or Germanenorden, which is using the name Thule Gesellschaft—or Thule Society, a \"literary-cultural society\"—as a cover to confuse Munich'sfledgling Red Army, which is on the lookout for right-wing extremists.Sebottendorff himself is Master of the anti-Semitic Germanenorden^ Bavariandivision under its leader and founder, Hermann Pohl.The Thule cultists—whose symbol is a long dagger superimposed on a swastika—needno encouragement. They begin stockpiling weapons in secret supply dumps in andaround Munich, anticipating a counterstrike against the new Socialist Republic.They make alliances with other nationalist groups, such as the Pan-Germans undereditor Julius Lehmann, the German School Bund, the Hammerbund . . . and anorganized resistance movement is born. All the mystical and clandestine laborsof the past twenty years involving a series of secret and occult organizationswith elaborate initiation ceremonies and complex magical rituals, from the ListSociety's inner HAO (Higher Armanen Order) to the Order of the New Templars,will soon culminate in a pitched battle in the streets of Munich between theneo-pagan Thule Society and the \"godless Communists.\"February 21, 1919. The idealistic but hapless Kurt Eisner—who preceded politicalspeeches with symphonic concerts—is assassinatedby a young count and would-be Thulist. The police descend upon Thuleheadquarters, looking for inflammatory leaflets and other evidence of ThuleSociety involvement in the plot. Was the notoriously anti-Semitic Thule Societysomehow responsible for Eisner's assassination? Sebottendorff stonewalls, andthreatens to instigate a pogrom if the police don't leave the Thule Societyalone. The police comply.April 7, 1919. A rebel Bavarian Soviet Republic is proclaimed in Munich as thelegitimate minister-president of Bavaria flees north with his council to thetown of Bamberg to prevent the Communists from taking over the government. TheThule organizes among the anti-Communist factions in Munich and Sebottendorff(together with his friend, the racist priest Bernhard Stempfle) beginsconspiring with the \"exiled\" Bavarian government in Bamberg for a counterrevolt.April 13, 1919. The Palm Sunday Putsch. An abortive attempt by the ThuleGesellschaft—with other anti-Communist groups—to take power in Munich. There isbloodshed. The Putsch fails. Munich explodes into anarchy. The Communists seizecontrol of the city and begin taking hostages. The Red Army is on the march . .. and hunting for the Thule Gesellschaft.April 26, 1919. Sebottendorff is away at Bamberg, busy organizing a Freikorps(Free Corps) assault on Communist headquarters, when a Red Army unit raids ThuleSociety offices and arrests its secretary, the Grafin Hella von Westarp, andseizes the Thule membership lists. Six more Thulists are arrested at theirhomes, including the Prince von Thurn und Taxis, a well-connected aristocratwith blood relations among the crowned heads of Europe.April 30, 1919. Walpurgisnacht. The High Holy Day of European Paganism andWitchcraft. The Red Army executes the captured Thulists and other hostages,shooting them against a wall in the courtyard of Luitpold High School.It is probably the worst mistake they could have made.The next day, an obituary appears in Sebottendorff's Miinchener Beobachter —anewspaper which a year later becomes the official Nazipropaganda sheet, the Volkischer Beobachter —giving the names of theseven murdered cultists and laying the blame on the doorstep of the Red Army. 1The citizens of Munich are finally outraged, shaken out or their lethargy.Thulists continue their well-organized campaign ofagit-prop against the Communist regime. The people take to the streets.The Free Corps—twenty thousand strong—marches on Munich under the command ofGeneral von Oven. For the first time in history, storm troopers—members of theEhrhardt Free Corps Brigade— march beneath a swastika flag with swastikaspainted on their helmets. singing a swastika hymn. As they enter the city, theyfind that the Thule has managed to organize a full-scale citizen rebellionagainst the Soviet government. They join forces.When the dust settles on May 3, the Communists have been defeated in Munich,politically and militarily. Hundreds of people, including many innocentcivilians, have been senselessly slaughtered in their streets and homes by thecrusading \"Whites\" with the swastika banners. But there will be no Socialist orCommunist government in Germany until after World War II, over twenty-five yearslater, and even then it will rule over only half of the country and will takeits orders from Germany's most despised enemy, the Soviet Union.But now, so soon after the victorious march of the Freikorps through the streetsof Munich, the threat of a Soviet regime in the rest of Germany is still veryreal. Units of the navy are in mutiny, raising the red flag over Germany'sbattleships. France will march into the Ruhr valley, Germany's industrialheartland. But the spectacular success of the Freikorps has aroused theadmiration of anti-Bolshevik forces all across Europe. In Riga, the newly formedLatvian Republic begs for Freikorps assistance to defend their country againstthe Bolsheviks and even the British support this decision. Hence, Freikorpsunits move to the defense of Latvia until the British themselves have tointervene to free Latvia from the death grip of these rabid proto-Nazi brigands.2Even Germany's own right wing is divided into two camps: those in favor ofrestoring the monarchy and separating Bavaria from the rest of Germany, andthose in favor of a unified Greater German Reich, without a monarch but with aleader, a leader with vision. A German messiah. A Fuhrer. Where is that Fuhrerto be found?Unwittingly, the Thule Gesellschaft provides the answer. Meeting in theexpensive Four Seasons Hotel, the leading industrialists and aristocracy of thecity, along with a generous helping of local police and military officials, aredesigning a two-pronged strategy of political activism. The Thule Society willdo the organizing, will make the right connections among the society figures,the wealthy capitalists, the intelligentsia. They will stockpile the weapons.They will organize units of the Free Corps, particularly the Ehrhardt Brigade(which will become an official unit of Germany's navy as the Ehrhardt NavalBrigade and, eventually, subsumed into Himmler's SS) and the FreikorpsOb-erland.But another arm of the Thule has already begun recruiting—not among Munich's\"beautiful people,\" the rich and the powerful—but among the working people, thelower- and middle-class citizens who have been hit hardest by the civil wars,the enormous rates of inflation, the chaos and confusion. There will be no overtinvolvement of the Thule Society in this group, which is to be called insteadthe German Workers Party and which will be led by a serious, humorless, railroademployee and locksmith named Anton Drexler. They will meet in a beer hall.Perhaps between the two groups—the Thule with its academics, nobles, and factoryowners meeting at the Four Seasons, and the German Workers' Party with itsrough-and-tumble factory workers meeting in beer halls—they will be able to forma united front against Communism, international Freemasonry, and world Jewry.Within a year, this project of the Thule Gesellschaft will become the NSDAP: theNational Socialist German Workers' Party. The Nazi Party. It will sport aswastika flag and a swastika armband, and its leader will be a war veteran, acorporal who had been sent by the German Army to spy on the organization: AdolfHitler.And by November, 1923, the tiny German Workers' Party will have grown toenormous proportions with many thousands of members, and will attempt to takeover the country in the famous Beer Hall Putsch. The Putsch will fail, but AdolfHitler the Fiihrer will be born—not in a manger like the Son of God he oftenbelieved himself to be—but in a jail cell at Landsberg Prison.What was the Thule Gesellschaft? What were cultists doing fighting Communists inthe streets of Munich? What did they believe? How did it influence the NaziParty?A Philosophical DigressionThe once-fashionable and still-controversial French philosopher Michel Foucaultonce described two major impulses in European culture and its dynamics of power.3 The first of these he called \"the blood/ This impulse was directly related toold-fashioned concepts of political sovereignty. According to Foucault, thedeath penalty was important and indulged in heavily during this period becauseit represented the monarch's divinely given power to cause the death of enemies;i.e., to rob them of their blood. One pledged to defend a monarch to the lastdrop of one's blood. People became rulers owing to their consanguinity with theprevious ruler (they shared the same blood, were of the same family). And, ofcourse, although Foucault does not say it so baldly, an essential element of thedominant European religion, Christianity, is the idea of the redemption ofhumanity through the spilled (and sacred) blood of Christ.This cultural conceit existed in the West well until the advent of thenineteenth century, at which time it was gradually replaced by the second of thetwo impulses, that of \"sexuality.\" \"Sanguinity\" gave way to \"sexuality\" aspolitical attitudes shifted from the importance of blood (and, hence, of themystical value of death, the spilling of blood) to the importance of lifeitself: to the regulation of life's processes, the (selective) preservation oflife, and the survival (or destruction) of entire populations. Power, therefore,was no longer a mystical quality of kingly blood—i.e., of an individualsovereign—but inherent in the control, manipulation, and interpretation of thesex act and its product. Power shifted—according to Foucault—from the symbol orsign of the blood toward the object of sex; Machiavelli moving down the talkshow couch to make room for Freud, who will take it with him when he leaves.The author has imposed this seeming digression on the reader because it soperfectly describes what will follow in the remainder of this book; we will bewatching how these twin forces—blood and sex— came to be epitomized in theoccult struggles, the mystical agon, of the Third Reich. Rather than remain anabstract philosophical problem, however, the themes of blood and sex become veryreal, very conspicuous in the writings, acts, and preoccupations of themagicians whogave birth to the Nazi Party and of those who carried out the gruesome policiesof the SS. (Robert J. Lifton, who has written extensively on the psyches of theNazi doctors, has also recognized this mystic obsession with \"the blood\" thatcharacterized the Nazi phenomenon. 4 ) The reader is asked to remember thisbrief encapsulation of Foucault's observations as we follow the argument downthe last hundred-odd years since the birth of the German Theosophical movementand its illegitimate offspring, the sex-and-blood rune magicians List,Liebenfels, and Sebottendorff.Before we get ahead of ourselves, however, let us begin where most Westerntwentieth-century occultism begins, with the birth of the Theosophical Societyin New York City in 1875 and the subsequent occult revival that spread toEngland and the Continent with such powerful (and often dire) consequences.Secret Chiefs, Secret DoctrinesMadame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831-1891) was born in what is now Ukraine.She would be forty-four years old before creating the Society for which she isbest remembered, but her most important achievements still lay ahead of her.In 1877—two years after starting the Theosophical Society—she would publish IsisUnveiled, an energetic blend of Eastern religion and mysticism, Europeanmythology and Egyptian occultism, whose rambunctious style would pave the wayfor her even more ambitious The Secret Doctrine in 1888. Some authors havewritten that the popularity of Blavatsky's writings in the late nineteenthcentury was evidence of an antipositivist reaction among the middle classes tothe effect that science was having on religious belief. 3 In other words,science was going so far toward \"proving\" the errors of faith that the averageperson—suddenly up the existential creek without a paddle or a prayerbook—embraced the quasi-scientific approach toward religion represented in TheSecret Doctrine.Darwin had published The Origin of Species in 1859 and this was followed by TheDescent of Man in 1871; both books offered evolution as the means by whichhumans were created, as opposed to the Biblicalaccount found in Genesis. The effect of the theory of evolution on religion wasas great then as it is now; the controversy over Darwinism caused many people toquestion the existence of God, the possibility of redemption, life after death,etc. People were startled to discover that Biblical myths were at odds withscientific theories, and thus began to doubt everything they ever believed. Theyfound themselves spiritually—and, perhaps, morally—adrift.Blavatsky provided a much-appreciated antidote to Darwin even as she wasbrazenly appropriating (and reversing) his theory of evolution. As bizarre asher theories appear today, they were actually quite brilliant for her time, forthey enabled intelligent and educated men and women to maintain deep spiritualbeliefs while simultaneously acknowledging the inroads made by scientificresearch into areas previously considered beyond the domain of mere humanknowledge. Blavatsky outlined a map of evolution that went far beyond Darwin toinclude vanished races from time immemorial through the present imperfect raceof humans, and continuing on for races far into the future. Based on anidiosyncratic selection of various Asian scriptures—including a few she made upherself— The Secret Doctrines message would later be picked up by the Germanoccultists, who welcomed the pseudoscientific prose of its author as the answerto a dream. The smug and condescending attitude of scientists and their devoteestoward the \"unscientific\" had proved contagious among many in the newly createdmiddle class, and mystics began to find themselves in the ridiculous position ofhaving to satisfy the requirements of science in what are patently unscientific(we may say \"nonsci-entific\") pursuits. Modernism in general was seen as beinglargely an urban, sophisticated, intellectual (hence \"Jewish\") phenomenon, andthis included science, technology, the Industrial Revolution, and capitalism.The only wholesome lifestyle was that of the peasant on his \"land,\" and thenaive beliefs of the people of the land, the pagan us or pagans—with theirsympathetic magic and worship of ancient gods in the form of such superstitiouspractices as fertility rites, the lighting of bonfires on particular days sacredto the old calendar, and the whole host of cultural traditions that can bediscovered by consulting Fra-zier's The Golden Bough —were set up in oppositionto \"science,\" with its suspect lack of human warmth and its cold indifference tothe \"gods.\"Science in its hubris was treading dangerously close to the territory claimed byreligion (the origin of life, the creation of the universe, even the existenceof God), and in order to get there it would have to dance a jig all over theoccult \"sciences.\" Science still smarted from the religious furors caused byGalileo and Copernicus; so rather than mount an all-out attack on God, it was alot safer to conduct a rearguard action and go after the ghosts.But then along came Blavatsky, who took new scientific attitudes as they werepopularly understood and gave them a mystical twist. Taking her cue from Darwin,she popularized the notion of a spiritual struggle between various \"races,\" andof the inherent superiority of the \"Aryan\" race, hypothetically the latest inthe line of spiritual evolution. Blavatsky would borrow heavily from carefullychosen scientific authors in fields as diverse as archaeology and astronomy tobolster her arguments for the existence of Atlantis, extraterrestrial (orsuperterres-trial) life-forms, the creation of animals by humans (as opposed tothe Darwinian line of succession), etc.It should be remembered that Blavatsky's works—notably Isis Unveiled and TheSecret Doctrine —appear to be the result of prodigious scholarship and wereextremely convincing in their day. The rationale behind many later Nazi projectscan be traced back—through the writings of von List, von Sebottendorff, and vonLiebenfels—to ideas first popularized by Blavatsky. A caste system of races, theimportance of ancient alphabets (notably the runes), the superiority of theAryans (a white race with its origins in the Himalayas), an \"initiated\" versionof astrology and astronomy, the cosmic truths coded within pagan myths ... allof these and more can be found both in Blavatsky and in the Nazi Party itself,specifically in the ideology of its Dark Creature, the SS. It was, after all,Blavatsky who pointed out the supreme occult significance of the swastika. 6 Andit was a follower of Blavatsky who was instrumental in introducing the Protocolsof the Elders ofZion to a Western European community eager for a scapegoat. 7This is not to imply that Theosophy is inherently \"fascist,\" or that MadameBlavatsky is somehow responsible for the horrors of Auschwitz. AlthoughBlavatsky herself did not become overtly involved in political campaigning orintriguing, many of her followers and self-appointed devotees could not help butuse their newfound faith as aspringboard into the political arena. In this context it is interesting to notethat Blavatsky's successor as president of the Theosophical Society—Annie Besant(1847-1933)—became an important figure in Indian politics during World War I andwas the first woman elected to serve as president of the Indian NationalCongress. She served as mediator between various warring factions, and made theTheosophical Society (a magnet for intellectuals and Brahmin-classEnglish-educated Indians at Theosophical Society headquarters in Advar, outsideof Madras) prominent in the Indian Nationalist Movement. (Later, the Nazis wouldattempt to exploit the Indian Nationalist movement for their own ends, sinceIndia then was still under British control, making the Indian Nationalists andthe National Socialists seem like natural allies.) 9The fascinating mixture of armchair archaeology, paleoastronomy, comparativereligion, Asian scriptural sources, and European mythology that can be found inBlavatsky's writings was enough to cause a kind of explosion of consciousnessamong many women and men of her generation, including the scientists who wouldone day direct entire departments within the SS. Blavatsky's \"creative\" methodof scholarship inspired admirers and imitators throughout the world, whoconsidered the theories put forward in such books as The Secret Doctrine to beliterally true, and who used her writings as the basis for further \"research.\"In a way, this was understandable. In ancient times, alchemists were the onlychemists; as the centuries went by and science developed a philosophy andmethodology of its own, the alchemists and chemists split off from each otherand went their separate ways. So it was with the rest of academia. In thenineteenth century—bereft of a unified vision of humanity and cosmos, cosmos andGod—it was no longer easy to be an expert in every field of science andphilosophy; by the twentieth century, it would become impossible. The writingsof people like Blavatsky and her spiritual descendants represent the last gaspof the \"Renaissance Man\" before science, medicine, the Industrial Revolution,and mechanized warfare made specialization a necessity and the medieval image ofthe all-powerful and all-knowing Magician a bitter-sweet memory.German InitiatesThe German Section of the Theosophical Society was founded in the town ofElberfeld on July 22, 1884. Blavatsky was staying there at the home of MarieGebhard (1832-92), nee L'Estrange, a native of Dublin who married a well-to-doGerman and, moving to elegant surroundings in her new homeland, devoted herleisure time to a study of occultism and ritual magic. Frau Gebhard hadcorresponded regularly with the famous French magician and author of severalpopular books on magic, Eliphas Levi (the Abbe Louis Constant). 10 She is knownto have visited the Master at least once a year in Paris for ten years until hisdeath in 1875 in order to receive personalized instruction in the occult arts. Aroom at her estate in Elberfeld was completely devoted to these pursuits, and itwas there that the German Section of the TS was inaugurated with a Dr. WilhelmHlibbe-Schleiden (1846-1916) as its first president. 11Although Hiibbe-Schleiden would become well known as the publisher of theinfluential German occult magazine, Die Sphinx, prior to his occult career hewas an outspoken supporter of German nationalism and colonialism. This ismentioned only to show how early on in the game occultism and politicaladventurism—specifically an elitist, racist adventurism—were linked. While notexactly a proponent of an early Lebensraum policy, Hiibbe-Schleiden had oncebeen the manager of an estate in West Africa and was at the time of his tenureas president of the Theosophical Society in Germany a senior civil servant withthe Colonial Office, energetically promoting the expansion of Germany's coloniesabroad.In all fairness, however, it must be admitted that Die Sphinx was one of thefirst, and also more upscale, occult periodicals of its time. It catered to anintellectual audience and its contributors included scientists, philosophers,and other mainstream academics writing on a variety of topics, from theparanormal and psychical research, to archaeology and Christian mysticism. Assuch, it was firmly in the Theosophical camp, which required some sort of(one-sided) accommodation with mainstream science.One man of science who would come to personify this uneasy truce was a Blavatskyenthusiast who became influential in the Germanmovement. Dr. Franz Hartmann (1838-1912;, the prolific author of a wide range ofoccult books, first studied medicine at the University of Munich. V/hilespending seventeen years as an eye doctor (and sometime coroner) in the UnitedStates, he became interested in the Spiritualist movement and began readingTheosophical tracts. In 1 he traveled to Theosophical Society headquarters inAdyar, India, to sit at the feet of the Masters, evidently impressing his hostsgreatlv. He was trusted so highly that, while Blavatsky was in Elberfeld helpingjump-start the German Section, Hartmann was in Adyar as acting president of theTheosophical Society and remained in India until 1885.Hartmann is of considerable interest to this investigation as it was he whohelped create the Ordo Templi Orientis, a German occult society formed aroundthe idea of sexual magic. Other illustrious members of the OTO will includeanother Theosophist, Dr. Rudolf Steiner, who will go on to form theAnthroposophical Societv in 1912: Gerard Encausse, who—under the norn de phoneof Tapus\"—had written the first definitive text on the Tarot as a book ofconcealed illumi-nism; i: and Aleister Crowley, whose A.-.A.-., or ArgentumAstrum (\"Silver Star\"), was founded in 190\", the same year as the Order ol NewTemplars mentioned above. (The OTO will be discussed in greater detail inChapter Four.)Another personal friend of Mme. Blavatsky was Dr. William W'vnn Westcott(1848-1925), another coroner and a Theosophist who founded the Hermetic Order ofthe Golden Dawn in England in 1888, the same year as The Secret Doctrine waspublished. Westcotl claimed that the Golden Dawn was in reality the Englishbranch of a German occult lodge, a claim that would later be proven a hoax andwhich is, for that very reason, highly suggestive; for why would anyone claim aGasman origin for their occult society when so many other cultures are much moreconsistent with popular mystical stereotypes, such as those of India or Egypt?Whatever the reason, we have the Theosophical Society, the OTO, theAnthroposophical Society, and the Golden Dawn all intertwined in incestuousembrace. These are the organizations most familiar to a casual reader of occulthistories, and we will come back to them later on, for they all bear directly onour story. For now, though, let usfollow the careers of the German Theosophists to see where they will lead us.Upon his return to Europe in 1885, Hartmann took up residence at a town nearSalzburg, and the directorship of a Lebensreform sanatorium. Lebensreform (or\"life reform\") was a back-to-nature movement that espoused a wide range of\"clean living\" practices that would be the envy of any New Ager of today.Vegetarianism, abstention from alcohol and tobacco, homeopathy, and even nudisminformed this movement, and Hartmann saw it as a vehicle for the more overtlymystical program of Theosophy.Like most occultists who are inveterate \"joiners\" and collectors of paperdignities, Hartmann was not content to confine his spiritual search to theleadership available in the Theosophical movement or any other movement. MostWestern occultism is long on text and short on practice (contrary to forms ofoccultism found in the East, which rely on strict discipline, rigorous mentaland physical exercises, and the constant supervision of a teacher or \"guru\"),and occasionally a Western seeker—starved for genuine accomplishment—willaccumulate vast quantities of initiations into wildly disparate organizationswith awesome-sounding titles, hoping thereby to satisfy his ego if not hisspirit. In this way, occultism becomes a hobby—rather like stamp-collecting, orbird-watching—but with the added benefit that the seeker elevates himself in hisown eyes to stratospheric levels of arcane wisdom beyond the feebleunderstanding of mere mortals. That is, until the next occult order is formedand another—more formidable—initiation becomes available. (This phenomenon is byno means limited to occultists, of course; it is to be discovered among thehighly elevated and multiply consecrated \"bishops\" of a wide variety of distaffEastern Orthodox and Old Roman Catholic denominations, some of whom also becomeinvolved with occult secret societies, such as Theosophist HugoVollrath—mentioned below—who became \"Bishop of Erfurt\" under the jurisdiction ofMetropolitan Abdul Bahai, head of the Gnostic Church of Haifa.) ,3Thus Hartmann will become involved, in 1902, with one John Yarker whose Masonicorder, the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis and Mizraim, would claim manyotherwise-sincere individuals as members. It would be from among the Germanleadership of thisorganization that the future founders of the OTO—including Han mannhimself—would be selected. Hence, it is Franz 1 [artmann who provides us withsome excellent connections between the seemingly apolitical Ordo Templi Orientisand the rest of the German occult community, which was, more or less, alignedwith either the Lebenste-form movement or directly with the Pan-German,anti-Semitic move ment which gave birth to Nazism. Thus Hartmann is the axle onwhich this peculiar Wheel of Life will turn. Wherever we pick tip the thread oftwentieth-century Western occultism and ritual magic, we can follow it backalong a trail that leads to Hartmann.A few years later, Hartmann became involved with another Lebens-reformcommunity, this time at Ascona, in Switzerland, where we will eventually findhis associate and fellow OTO initiate Theodor Reuss sitting out the First WorldWar in 1917.There Hartmann began his own journal, the Lotusbliithen, [Lotus Blossoms) in1892, which printed translations of many Theosophical and related writings.Lotusbliithen 's logo included the ubiquitous sw.is tika. Among Hartmann's manyother publications were translations oi the Bhagavad-Gita (one of Himmler'sfavorite texts), and the Dao De Jing, the sacred text of Taoism. It is a measureof Hartmanns popularity and reputation that some of his writings have beentranslated into English and are available today under a variety of imprints. 1 'Little oi what Hartmann wrote, however, could be said to fall under the OI ()'sdomain of \"sex-magic.\"Hartmann would eventually take on as a kind of disciple and amanuensis a youngTheosophist, Hugo Vollrath (born 1877). In 1899, Hartmann picked up thisuniversity student as a personal secretary and the two would go on speakingtours together, trumping up business for the Theosophical Society. Vollrath, anintense young man whose peculiar appearance dovetailed nicely with that oi hismentor (nicknamed \"Dirty Franz\" because of his slovenly deportment), eventuallybecame involved with the Leipzig branch of the Society, and soon found himselfembroiled in one scandal after another. !t quickly became evident to the othermembers that Vollrath saw Theosophy as a potential cash cow. He began a seriesof publishing ventnrcs, introducing Theosophy and, later, astrology to theGerman-speaking public. The Theosophists complained about Vollrath's apparentlack of sincerity to the General Secretary of the German Section of the Soei-ety, who at that time was Dr. Rudolf Steiner. Steiner, a friend of Dr. Hartmann,had become involved with both Theosophy and the OTO only to eventually leavethem both to found his own group, the An-throposophical Society (which alsoexists to this day). In 1908, Steiner was forced to expel Vollrath from theGerman Section but the damage had already been done. The Theosophists hadcreated a monster, and Vollrath would go on to become a Theosophical publisherto be reckoned with, providing a forum for the men who were laying thefoundations of a New World Order.An associate of Vollrath will be Johannes Baltzli, a Theosophist and thesecretary of yet another mystical organization, the List Society. 15 Baltzliwould contribute articles to Vollrath's new Theosophical magazine, Prana, andsoon the bizarre ideas of racist and rune magician Guido von List would fill thepages of this otherwise-bland outlet previously devoted to the writings ofBlavatsky, her successor Annie Besant, and wandering \"Bishop\" Leadbetter. 16And, as if to emphasize how inextricable German occultism was with Germanracism, it is through his astrological journal, Astrologische Rundschau, thatVollrath has additional impact on our story, for in 1920 he turned it over tothe editorial ministrations of no less a historic personage than the BaronRudolf von Sebottendorff: mystic, Freemason, initiate of the Eastern mysteries,and now astrologer. The Baron needed a new career. After all, his last occultexperiment—although an unqualified success in the political arena—had turned onhim. He needed new pastures, and editing Astrologische Rundschau from therelative safety of Switzerland seemed just the ticket. Maybe there—with acompletely new audience of adoring fans—he could forget about the ThuleGe-sellschaft.And about Munich in 1919.To hear most historians speak of the Thule Gesellschaft, one would think that itwas a slight aberration, an anomaly that does not deserve close scrutiny. Oh, itis mentioned (almost in passing) in John To-land's Adolf Hitler and in works byJoachim Fest and other historians of the Nazi episode. Its founder, the sameRudolf Sebottendorff, wrote its story himself in a book he published in 1933, abook that was suppressed by the Nazis. But to understand the nature ofneo-Na/ism today it is necessary to investigate the origins of the Nazi Partyitselfmuch more thoroughly than has been done to date, lor the Nazi Party was nevermerely a political party; it was always much more. Hitler himself warned hiscritics that if they understood National Socialism as a political party only,they were missing the point. Main observers have since agreed. Politics alonedid not create such an engine of destruction, such a willing collaboration inmass murder of citizens from every walk of life. As Robert G. L. Waite says inhis The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler:The hard historic fact about the genocide is that it was not caused bv theexigencies of war, nor was it a political maneuver to cope with internal unrestand domestic conflict. These people were killed as ihe-result of one of Hitler'sideas: the idea of a superior race and the nucd to exterminate what heconsidered to be the vermin thai were attacking it.This was an \"idea\" that can be traced to Hitlers early, student days in Viennaand to the influence of racial tracts published by the leading occult,anti-Semitic lights of the day: Guido von last And I an/ von Liebenfels. Andfrom there, directly to the occultist .\\nd Eastern initiate Rudolf vonSebottendorff and his brainchild, the Thule Gesell-schaft. In this century, inEurope, racism had its roots in occultism. Racism is, after all, an expressionof irrational fears (often, as we shall see, with sexual components) and theirrational often finds a home in the milieu of primordial, preconsciousarchetypes that is the environment of both religion and occultism. Racism andthe occult were often found sharing the same magic circles in the early days ofthis century, and therewith hangs a tale.The Protocols of the Elders ofZionIt has been the refusal of historians to view the Nazi Part) as a religious—orat least a mystical—organization, a cult, that has contributed to so muchconfusion over the problem of nco-Nazism, \"ethnic cleansing,\" the whitesupremacy movement, and the Skinheads.Indeed, yet another Blavatsky protege—during the time of I lart-mann,Hubbe-Schleiden, and Vollrath—was the mysterious Ytihana Glinka, a Russiannoblewoman who donated enormous sums ofmoney to spiritualist mediums and their circles and who was instrumental inpromoting that notorious forgery, the Protocols of the Elders ofZioriy which,along with Mein Kampf can be considered one of the sacred texts of Nazism andneo-Nazism. As Norman Cohn illustrates at some length in Warrant for Genocide,™the Protocols were largely the product of a conspiracy between the Okhrana (theCzarist secret police) and occult circles operating in Paris and St. Petersburg.Originally, this pamphlet was a smear against both the Jews and the Freemasons,and was probably created around 1895 to discredit enemies of the head of theOkhrana in Paris, one Rachkhovsky. It was the occultist Mme. Glinka who \"leaked\"the manuscript to the press (after first attempting to convince a journalistthat she was able to speak to the dead!). The newspapers seized upon it in theheyday of the Dreyfus Affair and the first-ever Zionist Congress presided overby Theodor Herzl in 1897. Here was \"documentary\" evidence that the Jews,operating through the lodge network and secret rituals of the Masonic Society,were putting the final touches on their program of world domination. As is wellknown by now, the Protocols are a forgery, an old satire using an imaginaryconversation between Machia-velli and Montesquieu to draw attention to thepolicies of Napoleon III; but at that time the authenticity of the Protocols wasa matter of faith among some of the most influential political and intellectualleaders of Europe and would eventually become one of the sacred scriptures ofNazism.Thus, this single most inflammatory and crucial document of the Third Reich hadits origins in that strange twilight world where occultism and espionage meet, aworld we will visit again and again in the course of this study. And it isimportant to realize that the Masonic Society was considered just as culpable asthe Jews; that it was, in fact, a Jewish \"front\": for the Elders sign themselvesas thirty-third degree Masons. The plot as described in the Protocols involves aschedule for world domination that was believed to be well on its way to fullimplementation. By taking over the reins of commerce and by fomenting worldrevolution, the Jewish-Masonic conspiracy against Christian monarchies wasnearly successful. With the destruction of the Second Reich, the last bastion ofAryan supremacy was removed and victory virtually assured. Using the twin toolsof Democracy and Communism, the Jewish-Masonic cult had emasculated thepotentially trou-blesome populations of America and Russia. The rites of Judaism and Freemasonrywould soon replace those of Jesus and Odin.To the volkisch believers, their only hope of salvation was to be found—not inany revived Christian Fundamentalism, for Christianity (as a Jewish creature,after all) was also suspect—but in the redis< ered faith of their fathers, theOdinist religion that had been stolen from them by the fire and sword of theInquisition. The Protocols implied that the Jews had \"infected\" all governments,all commerce, all of the arts and media; everything was suspect. Only the purefaith of the Old Ones—abandoned for centuries and thus beyond reproach—couldoffer salvation.The Rune MagiciansOn the Continent there existed a gaggle of purely German nationalistic cultsthat were the result of this underground surge of neo-pagan-ism. These cultswere usually linked in some way with the more overtly political \"Pan-German\"movement, which sought to unite all the German-speaking peoples of Europe into asingle, coherent nation. The \"Pan-German\" movement can be seen as analogous tothose oi the \"Pan-African\" or \"Pan-Arab\" variety, except that the latter areattempts to form unified fronts among individual nations for economic orpolitical purposes, whereas the Pan-German movement envisioned a single, Germannational and racial entity that would abrogate or dissolve sovereign boundariesand unite the German speakers all over Europe wherever sizable numbers could befound.In order to provide a solid philosophical or ethical framework tor thispeculiarly German lust for monolithic statehood, some sort of precedent wasrequired to show that much of what is now Europe was actually once part of agreater German Reich, even if that Reich was in the remote—evenprehistoric—past. If it could be proved that everything from the Ukraine to theAtlantic was at one time part of an ancient Teutonic Empire, then the Germanpeople would have historical justification for the acquisitive urges they weresuddenly experiencing, as well as a seemingly rational excuse for the exerciseof their right to bear arms against all and sundry. What was required,then, was the assistance of the twin sciences of archaeology and linguistics andwhere better do these two rational arts combine but in their bastard child, therunes?The obsession with runes that was enjoyed by a certain minority of Germans atthe turn of the last century has been discussed by other authors in other books,but usually as a kind of crank occupation not fit for serious academics. Beforewe go on to study the contributions to Nazi ideology by such famous runepromoters as Guido von List and Rudolf von Sebottendorff, it would behoove us topause for a moment to observe to what extent this arcane lore was—and is— makingits effect on traditional academia. After all, nothing devalues otherwise-usefulinformation and research so much as to link it with the Nazis. So let usextricate the Black Order from the runes for a moment so that we can see whatthey are and why rune studies exerted the influence that they did.Runes are simple alphabetic symbols. They owe their odd and distinctive shapesto the fact that they were designed to be carved on wood, stone, or metal, asopposed to written with a pen; thus, only straight lines are used to form theletters. The words formed by the runes that concern us are generally in someform of Nordic tongue, and thus belong to that class of things purely Teutonic,pre-Christian, and German. (At least, that is the Party line.) In the new,urban, middle-class world where a multiplicity of words, books, ideas, andphilosophies seemed to contend in a violent thunderstorm of polysyllabicchatter, the clean simplicity and bare prose of the runes and their sagas stood(to the Pan-Germans, the anti-Semites, and the Aryan mystics) for a saner time,an honest time, when the questions were few and the answers as clear and naturalas the light of the sun.They are also tangible relics of an ancient legacy—landmarks of historicaccomplishments. Unlike words printed or written on paper (a German proverbreminds us that \"paper is patient\"), runes were inscribed with earnestdeliberation using iron implements on solid rock; serious messages from the pastintended to survive the centuries. The effort required to carve these messageswas quite different from the ease with which pen slides over paper; theimplication being that whatever was written in runes was not the mindless staticof superficial minds, chewing up the forests with self-absorbed monologues.Further, if runic inscriptions could be (bund on stones buried or standing insuch faraway places as Minsk or the Pyrenees, then theassumption was that Minsk and the Pyrenees were once German territories.And, if the sounds represented by the runic symbols could be discerned in placenames from other parts of Europe, then it followed that Germans had oncecolonized and settled in those places. This was much more convenient thanactually finding runic petroglyphs in situ, for it meant that merelytransliterating the name of a French town or a Russian river into appropriaterunic words (which a clever runic scholar could do given virtually any clusterof native phonemes from China to Chile) was equivalent to proclaiming that townor river a domain of the once—and future—German Reich.The alphabet was therefore abandoned for mystical purposes by the Pan-Germancults in favor of the runes. What was the alphabet, after all, but some sort ofSemitic invention? The runes, on the other hand, were the pure expression ofpeople of German blood. If a rune were discovered carved into a stone foundlying in a field in Tibet, tor instance, it was simply further proof of Teutonicmigration and domination. And once the swastika—a sacred symbol in many parts ofthe world that never knew a rune—was identified as a \"rune,\" the Nazis were wellon their way to proclaiming the entire globe German territory.Although this concept seems a little farfetched, many academics of the dayplaced a great deal of importance on runic studies and on the use of runes toestablish the extent of Nordic migrations. For instance, as late as 1932 and1940 Hjalmar R. Holand was publishing his analyses of the famous KensingtonStone, 19 analyses that were later examined by some of the leading German runeexperts in Nazi Germany, including Richard Hennig in the Zeitschrifi fiirRassenkunde [Magazine of Race Science) in 1937, Wolfgang Krause in an issue ofGermanien (the official organ of the Ahnenerbe-SS: see Chapter Six) of the sameyear and Eilert Pastor in Wacht am Osten, also of 1937. If his analyses weredetermined to have merit, then the presence of Nordic peoples in America as farback as the fourteenth century (over a hundred years before Columbus) could beestablished, with rather sobering political ramifications considering Nazipolicy regarding former Teutonic territories!Briefly, the Kensington Stone is a slab carved with runic characters found on afarm in Minnesota in 1898. The runes describe an Indian massacre said to havetaken place in the year 1362. While some scholars have considered the Stone tobe a hoax, others disagree. Mr. Ho-land went even further, however, bysuggesting that various Indian tribes may have intermarried with Nordic peoplesat that time; a circumstance that would account for the presence of blue eyesand fair hair among the Mandan population, for example. 20 (Wouldn't this also,after all, explain how the swastika turns up in North America as a NativeAmerican symbol?) While Holand himself does not take all this to its illogicalconclusion, it is clear that some in the Third Reich would have considered thisjust one more proof of ancient Teutonic expansion. More importantly, this workis not a Nazi propaganda tract or the crazed scribblings of a volkisch mediumunder the influence of peyote or Wotan. It is the sober offering of acollege-educated American author of Scandinavian descent, representing hiscarefully considered contribution to the growing literature of rune studies.Today, similar studies have been undertaken by American and European epigraphersand by the Diffusionists led by Harvard Professor Barry Fell. 21 Theseprofessional and amateur archaeologists have made substantial contributions tothis neglected field, and labor to preserve from vandalism and neglect thoseancient stone inscriptions wherever they might be found. Runic inscriptions areevidence of ancient voyages otherwise unrecorded, and refer to vast tracts ofunexplored history for which few documents remain. They have also demonstratedsophisticated advances in astronomy and navigation that may require significantportions of world history to be rewritten.Books and research like the foregoing provide the \"missing link\" between thefanciful and outlandish works by authors such as von List on the one hand, andthe regular academic community that considers the rune scholars to be nothingmore than a cabal of proto-Nazis on the other. It was too easy for an unwittingpublic to slide from the serious research of a Hjalmar Holand, for instance, tothe \"channeled\" discoveries of a Guido von List.The notion of a hidden science of runes wis given hteai by the writings ofBlavatsky, in which the runes are discussed in connection with her peculiarracial theorieFor example, if there truly is a caste system of races, and it' the presentMaster Race is the Aryan, and if the Aryan is a blond-haired, blue-eyed Nordicrace, then it stands to reason thai the Germans arc the Master Race. If runicsymbols, such as the swastika, are evidence of a secret Aryan science ofsymbols, and if the ancient German (Teu tonic) method of communication was thissame runic system, and it runes can be discovered all over the known world, then(a) that is further evidence that the Germans are the Master Race and (b) it isalso mrther evidence that Germans once ruled the entire world; from which itfollows that Germany has a \"legitimate\" stake in such prop erty. HeuteDeutsebland, Morgen Die Welt.Even more importantly, the runes themselves have mystical as well as practicalapplications. They are not merely alphabetic symbols thai identify their usersas Aryans: within the construction of the individual runes themselves arecertain potent designs—like printed electronic circuitry—that can connect onedirectly to God. Coded within then stark diagrams are secret formulae forachieving telepathic power, fore telling the future, and peering into the past:innate magical abilities that the Aryans—through inbreeding, neglect, andruthless suppression by the Christian authorities—have lost. The remains ot thiso< cult science are to be found in an \"initiated\" interpretation ot the runesand, in conjunction with an aggressive eugenics program, the careful applicationof rune magic will enable the Aryan race to walk once more with Odin, Frigga,and Thor in the sterile, frozen halls ot Valhalla.Thus the Aryans are not simply a superior race in a strictly 1 darwinian sense;they are also the Chosen People, divinely ordained supermen locked in cosmiccombat with a race of subhuman beings— red, brown, black, yellow—under thecommand ot the Jews, the (lommu-nists, and the Freemasons: worshipers all of thedemon Jehovah. I his satanic conspiracy has robbed the Aryan male of hismanhood, has leeched from him his birthright, his mystical powers, the very landthat once was his; it has enslaved him in chains made of debts to Jewishbankers, of twisted ideas of democracy and freedom learned from the Masons,under a dictatorship of the proletariat imposed by the Bolsheviks. The Aryan manis Samson, his beard shorn by .1 mitic Delilah and his strength, his potency,utterly drained from him as he now strains helplessly against the wheel otcommerce.But then, how to explain the sad condition of this once and innately superiorrace? Divided, conquered, bereft of all its old territories, in enormous debt .. . what happened? And how to rectify the situation? For the answers to thesequestions, we must resort to the literature of the volkisch apologists,specifically to Guido von List and his student, the former Cistercian monk anddarling of at least one modern \"sa-tanic\" cult, Lanz von Liebenfels.#2#Volk MagicThere is no religion without magic any more than there is magic without at leasta trace of religion. The notion of a supernature exists only for a humanitywhich attributes supernatural powers to itself and in return ascribes the powersof its superhumanity to nature. '— Claude Levi-StraussReturn of the TeutonsIn 1902, the Austrian novelist, poet, folk-historian, and philosopher Guido vonList underwent cataract surgery. He was blind for almost a year. Like Hitlerover fifteen years later—himself blinded by mustard gas during World War I—itwas during this period ol darkness that he received his greatest illumination.It was an experience that would transform his life, and that would later have anindirect effect on Hitler.Guido von List (1848-1919) had begun his career as a nature worshiper and loverof ancient German folk myths and culture, a man who believed in thereunification of his native Austria with Germany, and who came to despise bothJews and Christians as alien forces in Europe who had robbed Germans of theirspiritual and territorial birthrights. He wrote a series of romantic novelsabout the ancientTeutons, and dreamed of reestablishing the ancient priesthood of Wotan, anorganization he called the Armanenschaft either after the Teutonic warriorArminius who defeated the Roman Legions under Varus at the Battle of TeutoburgForest (a.d. 9), or after a qabalist bowdlerization of the name of one of thethree Teutonic tribes mentioned by Tacitus in Germania, the Hermiones.In 1875, the same year that Blavatsky founded her Theosophical Society in NewYork, List was invoking Baldur, the Teutonic Sun God, on a hilltop outsideVienna. In Baldur's honor, he buried eight wine bottles there in the shape of aswastika and pledged himself to the worship of the Old Ones, Baldur and Wotanbeing prominent among them. At this time, the Armanenschaft —the priesthood ofthe sun—was but a gleam in his Aryan eye.He took up journalism when his family's fortunes went awry, and begandaydreaming in print about the prehistoric Teutons, a hypothet-ically pure racefree of the taint of spiritually retarded blood.However, during his convalescence after cataract surgery at the age offifty-four—dwelling in a temporary but nonetheless unnerving state ofblindness—he understood that his main preoccupations of politics and race werebut two halves of a single coin. Always interested in the past more than thepresent (what anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, quoted above, might haveinterpreted as a morbid interest in death: an interest that is central to most,if not all, occultism as well as to the detective story), List had developed anintense fascination with the signs and symbols of heraldry as well as those ofthe proto-Aryan language he believed could be found in runes and ancientinscriptions. He was not alone in these ruminations. Like his contemporary, S.L. \"MacGregor\" Mathers (1854-1918) of the British secret society, the GoldenDawn, he had a desperate desire to represent himself as of noble blood (inMathers's case, he saw himself as an heir to the old Scottish noble houses). Hewas joined in this obsession by his young colleague, Lanz von Liebenfels, who,like List, adopted the aristocratic \"von\" even though there was little evidencein either case that it was deserved. And all three of these men—List,Liebenfels, and Mathers— were set upon developing (or \"rediscovering') acomplete, internally consistent, quasi-qabalistic system of interpreting theworld, each in his own way.For Mathers, the story of the Golden Dawn requires a whole separate study and asthis has already been done by several scholars, u will not be repeated hereexcept as it bears upon our story. 1 [owever, let's point out at once that thenames List and Liebenfels soon became synonymous with the Pan-Germanic Vblkischmovement thai eventually gave birth to the Nazi Party: they wanted to resurrectwhat they perceived to be the genuine Teutonic orders of knighthood and priesthood, a mission that included many occult and pagan teachings; at the same time,Mathers—who had military as well as aristocratic pretensions—was desirous ofrestoring the House of Stuart and once claimed to have rejected\"politico-military\" work solely on the grounds that it would have meant severinghis connections with the Golden Dawn. 3 In fact, much of his correspondenceduring the late 1890s from Paris is concerned with just such matters. (Mis firstpublished book was entitled Practical Campaigning Instruction in InfantryExercise, a translation from a French original.) Curiously, one of his closefriends in Paris was the German author Max Dauthendey (1 SS^ 1918) who wroteoccult novels, among them the provocatively entitled Die Frau von Thule (1898).4 The author has been unable to find an) more concrete link between Mathers andhis German counterparts, however, although the occult underground is always asmall world\" and it would be highly likely that Mathers was at least aware of Iisi and Liebenfels (possibly through some mutual Theosophie.il or Masonic link,via Hartmann for example). As we shall see. List adopted the Golden Dawn systemof hierarchical and initiators degrees so it is likely that he at least knew ofMathers even if Mathers did not know of List.And just why it is that occultists yearn toward polities and titles ol nobility,as well as to military campaigns and even espionage, is a problem quite beyondthe scope of this book. Quite possibly, they have a perfectly understandableneed to duplicate in society, i.e., in the \"real world,\" what dignities andpowers they have accumulated in the secret world of the occult Orders. Afterall, its no particular sans faction to a reasonably intelligent person if theonly ones who know you are practically God are fellow cult members. In the eyesol society, you remain whatever you were when you began your spiritual Quest, orperhaps have become even less: considerably poorer, distracted in personalityand appearance, abandoned by family and friends. 1 hisdisparity between inner attainments and outer accomplishments can strain eventhe noblest of intentions. At any rate, the situation hasn't changed much in thelast hundred years since Mathers strode about Paris in complete highlandcostume, Aleister Crowley called himself the Laird of Boleskine or dressed inthe guise of a Russian nobleman or an Eastern potentate, and List and Liebenfelssported spurious heraldic emblems on their letterheads.By the spring of 1903, List's thesis on the common origins of an Aryan language,runes, heraldic emblems, epigraphic and other inscriptions as evidence of asecret store of knowledge concerning the creation of the world has been written.Vaguely theosophical in nature—List had been quite familiar with the works ofMme. Blavat-sky—his magnum opus also expounded on the occult significance of theswastika. 5Satan and SwastikaList had been fascinated with the swastika since his early youth, recognizing itas the Ur-symbol of the Teutonic (read \"Ayran\") peoples; a pagan sign equivalentin power and emotional meaning to the cross for Christians or the Star of Davidfor Jews. He first pointed this out in a series of articles published about1905-1908, 6 and thereafter this symbol began to take on more than just acosmological or theosophical significance and would soon come to represent anentire body of ideas—both occult and political—that would eventually culminatein the formation of the Thule Gesellschaft nearly two decades later.Called hakenkreuz (or \"hooked cross\") in German, the swastika is an ancientdesign, much revered in India and the Far East. The very word swastika isSanskrit, formed of the words su and asti meaning \"it is well\" or \"it isfortunate.\" The arms seem to spin around a central axis and, depending on thedirection of the spin—clockwise or counterclockwise (deosil or widdershins)—theswastika in question is either male or female, yang or yin, positive ornegative. In many Hindu and Buddhist paintings and Tibetan tangkas—as well as intemple architecture in China, Tibet, and India—the swastika appears in bothforms as if to emphasize the necessity of the polarization of bothforces. It has been asserted by some authors chat a counterdockw turningswastika (the type eventually adopted as the symbol of the Nazi Party) issomehow a representation of Evil, but this would be unknown to the Easternpeoples who probablv gave the world theswastika in the first place. As an example, a wooden statuette in the author'spossession—purchased in 1991 at a curio shop in Shanghai—is of a kindly KuanYin, Goddess of Mercy, with a counterciock wise swastika carved on her breast.Thus the swastika was not a Nazi invention, nor was its association withoccultism solely a figment of Mme. Blavatsky's imagination. As early as 1869 theBritish astrologer \"ZadkieP (Richard James Morrison, 1795-1874) had alreadyannounced the formation of something called the Ancient Order of the Suastikafthe swastika symbol was also a common decoration for the covers of books byRudyard Kipling . . .. . . and in 1897 the young Adolf Hitler, attending school at the BenedictineMonastery at Lambach, would pass every day beneath an archway which bears themonastery's coat of arms cast in stone. Its most prominent feature is theswastika.While an educated perspective on the swastika reveals the symbol as an ancientEastern symbol of good fortune, words themselves have their own intrinsic power.Thus, when a German calls the swastika by the term hakenkreuz he is calling it a\"hooked cross\" To a German ol the twentieth century (as for a German of thethirteenth century) the word cross has decidedly Christian overtones; a hookedcross therefore implies some deviation from, or modified form of, Christianity.In this way, the link between the inherently amoral swastika and questionablereligious beliefs is made by way of the emotionally loaded term \"hooked cross.\"When the various vblkisch and German cultural societies began adopting thehakenkreuz as their emblem, then, they were just as conscious of itsanti-Christian potential as they were of their own anti-Semitic intent. This wasnot paganism as a pure. Earth-Mother-worshiping cult (such as the modern Wiccaphenomenon) but paganism as a movement set up in opposition to Judeo-(Christianity as well as to Communism, Capitalism, and Democracy, which were allcreatures of the Jewish-Masonic conspiracy. In the Listian mode. therefore, theswastika as hakenkreuz identifies the volkisch, Nazi movement as an ideologicalenemy not only of the prevailing politicalforces of the time but also of the majority religions of Western Europe. WhereasCommunism set itself up in opposition to all religion, Nazism supported a paganrevival to replace the existing religions. It is perhaps this strategy more thanany other that has allowed Nazism in various forms to survive its calamitousdefeat in World War II and to continue to exert an influence over young peopleand old down the years into our present decade. Political systems come and go asthey are useful or not; religions (in part because their immediate utility isnot easily proven or disproven) can survive for centuries after their creation.After all, even Christianity itself survived hundreds of years of an undergroundexistence before coming into its own.The List SocietyAlthough the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna did not take List's occultresearches seriously and rejected his thesis (as the Academy of Fine Arts inVienna would later reject Hitler's applications), many other groups andindividuals took him very seriously, indeed. A List Society was formed in 1907to finance his work, and the roster of members and founders of this Societyreads like an anti-Semitic Who s Who of early twentieth-century Austria andGermany. Clearly, the idea that there existed a \"scientific\" rationale for bothracism and nationalism was very attractive to a certain element among the NewAgers of the day, for science—the new religion—could thus be relied upon toprovide moral support for a position that would otherwise seem either absurd orrepugnant. The same motivation that prompted List, Liebenfels, and even Mathersto \"prove\" they had aristocratic blood also served to define the efforts of thevolkisch supporters to prove that German blood in general was superior to thatof the other races. And, in order to obtain an even greater degree ofrespectability, it was necessary to go deeply into the past in order to\"discover\" an aristocratic ancestor. For List personally, it was hisgreat-grandfather who, he claimed, had been of gentle, if not noble, birth. Forthe volkisch movement in general, it was the mysterious race of Teutons from themists of ancient European history who gave the German people— the Volk —theirpedigree and excluded all other races.It is difficult to give a perfect translation of the term vdlkisch. To dnEnglish ear, the term sounds suspiciously like \"fblkish\" and, in a wa). that istrue if we do not make the otherwise-inevitable associations with \"folk music,\"for instance, that somehow devalue the term \"folk\" for certain generations ofAmericans. For vdlkisch means not only \"folkish\" but also \"national\" or\"popular\" in the sense of \"the People,\" similar to the Spanish concept of kl laRaza\"\\ especially in the context of the vdlkisch movement in Germany. Thismovement was nationalist in the extreme, for it extolled a perceived commonheritage that was believed to go back over several (even hundreds of) millenniaand which included everything from art to science, from medicine to communalliving, from religion to magic. The German vdlkisch movement had all of these,and it was also inextricably linked to the Lebensreform (or \"life reform\")movement which sought to purify the German people by a whole program of \"cleanliving\" practices. (With the possible exception of nudism—although he wasseriously attracted to paintings of nudes, and the more erotic thebetter*—Hitler Incorporated all of these tenets into his own belief system. Asis generally known, he was a vegetarian who did not smoke or drink; and heidentified himself as the physical and spiritual incarnation of the Volk itself.As the virtually untranslatable Nazi-era slogan would tell us: Ein \\ oik, EinReich, Ein Fiihrer. Perhaps: \"One People, One Empire, One lead,According to List, the German people—the Volk —could trace their spiritualancestry by careful reading of the Edda, that compilation ol Old Norse lore andlegend from Iceland which became particularly sacred to Hitler. This belief wasso pervasive that the Ahnenerbt would later devote a whole category of itsresearch to Icelandic studies in concert with its runic investigations, evidenceof which can be found among the captured Nazi documents microfilmed in theNational Archives. 9 (The enigmatic Grail scholar and SS officer Otto Rahn wouldeven make a special pilgrimage to Iceland in search of the legendary Thule.) 10The ancestral links to the past through (iuido von List were thus kept intactuntil well after lists death in Berlin in 1919.The style and nature of List's writings would be familiar to anyone who had readBlavatsky's The Secret Doctrine back-to-back with de Santillana's Hamlet's MillIn fact, the latter could be said to represent (with abject and profuse apologyto Professor de Santillana) I.istianneo-Aryan philosophy taken to its logical conclusion: that the Edda, the runicpoems and spells, the tree Yggdrasil, and all the Norse myths do represent asecret, sacred knowledge about the origins—not only of the Teutons or mythicAryans—but of the entire human race, as these motifs are present everywhere andin many cultures from Africa to the Middle East to the Far East to the WesternHemisphere; except that, for Professor de Santillana, that origin lies not in asunken hyperborean continent but in the stars.(Some American Nazis actually became converts to this point of view, at leastpartially. The author is reminded of William Dudley Pelley, the leader of thefascist Silver Shirts organization of the 1930s, who eventually abandonedorganized Nazism and went on to help found the \"I AM\" movement: a cult thatbelieves in ongoing human contact with alien space creatures, and Soulcraft, asimilar movement. To Pelley, the \"Aryans\" are descendants of an alien MasterRace.)Ultima Thule and the Secret ChiefsThe ancient homeland of the Aryan race was believed to be the legendary Thule:the northernmost point on earth, an entryway into a subterranean landscapepeopled by giants. A kind of Teutonic Eden, Thule or Ultima Thule was the mythicorigin of all \"Aryans\": an equally mythic white-skinned, blue-eyed, blond-hairedrace of wise giants who were once the masters of the Earth but who lost theirbirthright due to sexual liaisons with the irresistibly seductive members ofinferior, subhuman, half-animal races.It should be mentioned now that, according to science (and the dictionary),there is no such thing as an Aryan race. The term Aryan refers to a languagegroup—what has been called the Indo-European language group—and not to a race ofpeople. Obviously, speaking any of the Indo-European languages does not make onea member of the Indo-European \"race.\" There is no such thing. Yet, this isexactly the type of reasoning that led the early \"Aryan\" promoters into one ofthe worst blunders of twentieth-century history. 11 They confused a languagegroup with a race. They claimed that language was somehow a function of theblood. Indeed, the bulk of List's researches were basedon interpretations of the ancient writing systems of the Celtic and Nordicpeoples, the runes; i.e., they were etymological and linguisticstudies, yet they steered him and his followers onto a disastrous course wherebythe modern day residents of Germany and Austria were somehow the pure-bloodeddescendants of a master race of ancient Teutonic godlings, the Ur-Volk.He was not alone in this, of course. The movement to isolate the German-speakingpopulations of Europe from all other \"races\" and to unite them into one cohesivenational unit—the Pan-German mo ment—had begun much earlier, and there were manyanti-Semitic political parties and discussion groups abroad in the land in the 1880s, a full fifty years before Hitler came to power. Some groups formed aroundacademic types who claimed to have proved their racial theories based onlinguistic research—such as List—and others on physical characteristics such asskull size or eye color (factors which would later figure so prominently in themembership requirements for the Get-manenorden, later in SS racialidentification programs and in experiments carried out at the death camps).During the same era ot the Indian wars in the American West—which were quitereasonably understood by the Nazis as a federal (and therefore legal) program ofgenocide against the Native Americans in pursuit of a Yankee Lebens-raumpolicy—Germans and Austrians were plotting its equivalent in the exterminationof the Jews and, it is said, actually taking their lead from the blatantlyracist American war on the Native American tribes. 12Unfortunately for the anti-Semites, the difficulty of forming an entirepolitical party around the single issue of anti-Semitism made it necessary tocontinue the offensive by other means. Magazines, pamphlets, and books werewritten and widely disseminated on the subject of the heroic, blond-haired,blue-eyed Aryan peoples fighting the dark-skinned Semitic, Mediterranean, andAfrican hordes. The pornography of anti-Semitism would eventually take the formof future Nazi Gauleiter Julius Streicher's obscene broadsides againsteverything from miscegenation to psychoanalysis. But a constant theme of thissubculture was the rape and murder of beautiful blond women by (he bearded,crazed, dark-haired mongrel races. Psychoanalysts would understand it as a themeof blatant sexual insecurity and, indeed, the anti-Semitic journalists and\"academics\" would constantly and openlyrail against the sexual prowess of the inferior peoples and of how theSemites—through various means, but especially including the fledgling \"Jewish\"science of psychoanalysis—had nearly succeeded in emasculating the Aryan male!13(One may jump a few generations to Los Angeles in 1969, and ponder the murder ofSharon Tate—a beautiful, blond actress who was nine months pregnant—by a band of\"mongrels\"; one may match the famous photos of the day of Charles Manson to thecaricatures of the crazed, bearded Mongrel murderers of the anti-Semite's darkfantasies; one may scan the interviews and transcripts of the case, and discoverthat a proposed motivation for the killings was to instigate a race war betweenwhites and blacks; one may then reasonably jump to the present day and wonderabout the conversion of neo-Nazis and members of the Aryan Brotherhood toManson's \"cause,\" and of Manson's adoption of the swastika as his \"emblem.\" Thisis a problem we will deal with in a later chapter, but for now it is importantto realize that this type of thinking is by no means alien to our times or toour culture.)At one point the Aryan homeland, Thule, was actually believed to be in Iceland,for Iceland is also the repository of the most ancient Teutonic legends extant:the Edda. Nazi apologists and racial theorists pored over the Edda endlessly,looking for clues as to their own origins, the appropriate pagan rituals toperform to appease and summon the gods, and for justification for theirpolitical and racial theories. Prehistoric Nordic sites all over Scandinavia andEurope were investigated, and no stone was left unturned. Literally. There arepages and pages of documents and photographs of megaliths, dolmens, and standingstones from all over Europe, and their interpretation by Nazi academics, in thefiles of captured German documents in the archives of Germany and America. 14Thule was a siren song to these early German occultists. It was a pagan Eden;not a Semitic, Judeo-Christian paradise in the sweltering deserts or marshes ofIraq, but a cool Nordic landscape of virgin snows and evergreen trees in the farnorth. A place not of warm sensuality and Mediterranean seductiveness, but of acold, uncompromising purity. Similar to today's romantic notion that the humanrace somehow originated in the stars—that the stars are our \"home\"—Thule was\"home\" CO the Pan-Germanists and to the lonely, alienated, impover-ished, and disenfranchised anti-Semites and vdlkisch sympathizers . . . and justas inaccessible. Further, just as today's romantics believe in ourextraterrestrial origins and in continuing contact with beings from otherplanets (our forebears?), the vdlkisch romantics of List's day believed incontinuing contact with the Supermen. It was a theme that vibrated subliminallythroughout a lot of anti-Semitic literature and in more open form among theirBritish counterparts in the Golden Dawn, who posited a race of \"Secret Chiefs\":superhuman beings who, they said, live secretly among us, and in theTheosophical Society, which held that Hidden Masters (the Great WhiteBrotherhood) were guiding the world's destiny. Among the vdlkisch cults it wasbelieved that—as soon as the Germans had purified the planet of the pollution ofthe inferior races—these Hidden Masters, these Supermen from Thule, would makethemselves known, and the link which had been lost between Man and God would beforged anew. lsThis is not quite as absurd as it seems at first glance, since a constant themein much Jewish and Christian eschatology is that of the coming of a Messiah whowill purify the world and destroy the \"not-chosen.\" This Messiah always seems tobe a rather militaristic being, whether the armed Deliverer of the Zealots andother pious Jews who await the New Jerusalem, or the Messiah of the Book ofRevelation—the Apocalypse—who will lay waste with fire and sword in a global, ifnot galactic, conflagration. The German version is not so far afield from thesecherished beliefs of the Judeo-Christian fundamentalists, hut is based on racialqualifications (and thus is beyond the realm of personal choice and ethicalbehavior) rather than on individual moral or spiritual worthiness.The tradition of Hidden Masters is not restricted to occult Aryan-ism, ofcourse. Some Muslims believe in the \"Hidden Imam, an Is maili concept similar tothe \"Secret Chief\" idea of the (.olden Dawn. The Strict Observance Masonicsociety of eighteenth-century ( many also claimed a tradition of Secret Masters,and there is the tradi tion of the Nine Unknown Men of India, secret Masters ofthe worlds various sciences who invisibly guide the fortunes of the human i ThatHimmler believed in this idea is revealed by his masseur, kli\\ Kersten, who—inhis memoirs—quotes the Reiehsfiihrer-SS on just this point with regard to theFreemasons. uAnd then, of course, we find ourselves back on familiar ground with the ancientlegend of Agartha—or Arktogaa—the subterranean kingdom of an alien race burieddeep within the Himalayas or somewhere in the far North (at any rate, in theappropriately Nordic frozen wastes), another Aryan \"Thule.\" Years before H. G.Wells described a similar race of beings in his novel The Time Machine y theEnglish author and Rosicrucian Bulwer-Lytton (1802-73) was writing of asubterranean master race in his celebrated novel, Vril. All of this is mentionedonly to show that these concepts of secret master race and subterranean kingdomsare not peculiar to German or even Nordic legend and myth, and certainly not toNazi ideology, but form part of a global tradition that may have some basis inreality; a basis that is now dimmed by the passage of too many millennia toplace it clearly and authoritatively into a modern perspective. The vblkischtheorists were merely drawing on a bank of myth and tradition familiar the worldover, and sculpting from selected pieces a cosmological world-view that placedthe German-speaking peoples at the top of a pyramid of power.Lanz von Liebenfels and the Templar RevivalThe eccentric ideas of Guido von List were carried to another extreme by hisyoung follower, Jorg Lanz von Liebenfels (1874-1954), who created the Order ofthe New Templars as a secret society bent on reviving the chivalric brotherhoodof knights, but in an aggressively Teutonic—and anti-Semitic—format. WhileList's sympathies were clearly already pagan and anti-Christian, von Liebenfelssought to restore a non-Christian, Teutonic Grail Order to its rightful place inthe world. He used those of List's racial and linguistic theories he found mostappealing; but it should be remembered that von Liebenfels was a Cistercian monkwho abandoned his vows but who never, in his heart, abandoned the Church ... atleast, not his idealized, medieval version of it. While von Liebenfels had nosympathy for the Catholic Church as such—for its beliefs —he had unboundedadmiration for its pomp and ceremony, its elaborate ritual. He managed tocombine this fascination with stately ceremony with a peculiar understanding ofthe Templar Order. To von Liebenfels, the Templars were an Aryan brotherhooddedicated to the establishment of a greater Germany and to the purification ofthe race. The Grail, in his estimation, was symbolic of the pure German blood.Even modern historians of the Grail legends disagree on the meaning of the term\"Grail.\" To a linguist, the phrase Sangraol or Saint Graal (\"Holy Grail\") maysimply be a pun on Sang Real or \"Royal Blood.\" Indeed, the British research teamof Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln offer just such a theory in their best-sellingHoly Blood, Holy Grails except that for these gentlemen the Holy Blood is notthat of an Aryan super race, but the very blood of Christ himself, preserved ina dynastic lineage kept secret for two thousand years and protected by a secretsociety with the unfortunate name of Prion' of /ion, a title which, combinedwith mysterious purpose, has perhaps too many resonances to those fictionalElders and their famous Protocols.The ambivalence of men like List and Liebenfels toward the Christ figure isrevealing. Hitler himself would later insist that Christ couldn't possibly havebeen Jewish. 18 For all their hatred of Christianity and Judaism, many Nazis andanti-Semites were loath to throw the Baby out with the bathwater. That may havebeen simple pragmatism in the land of Luther; but it also may have been evidenceof deep uncertainty over ingrained concepts like heaven and hell, retributionand salvation. As the title character in the movie version of The Man in theGlass Booth tells us, a Christian is \"a nervous Jew with an insurance policy.\"19 To turn one's back completely on Christ may have seemed unsettling to theseSupermen. A serious exception to this would be, ol course, Heinrich Himmlerwhose unabashed paganism we shall discuss in a later chapter.This hearkening back to a glorious German past was what united List andLiebenfels, although in many other ways their paths diverged. It was vonLiebenfels's notorious magazine, Ostara, that so attracted Hitler in thelatter's early days as an impoverished artist in Vienna, and we now know thatHitler—so inflamed by the wild occult, racial, and anti-Semitic theories hefound in Ostara —actually paid an unannounced visit to the editor's offices andcame face-to-face with Liebenfels himself. 20 This information comes from aninterview with von Liebenfels after the war, when he was struggling with thede-Naziltion process and would have had no ulterior motive in describing this meetingsince the revelation of a personal relationship with Hitler could conceivablyonly hurt him.Who was Lanz von Liebenfels, and how did he manage such an emotional impact onyoung Hitler?If all one had to go on were back copies of Ostara, we would have to say that hewas a cross between Pat Buchanan and Henry Lee Lucas, with a little JimmySwaggart thrown in to provide the Biblical and sexual references. Actually, vonLiebenfels was a bit more complicated than that.His Order of the New Templars was an occult lodge that met at a ruined castlehigh on a cliff over the Danube—the eerie Burg Wer-fenstein in Upper Austria, afew miles upriver from Hitler's childhood home—among other sites. The memberswore white, surplice-style robes emblazoned with the red cross of the Templars,a cross that von Liebenfels believed was formed of two, superimposed andcounter-rotating, swastikas. At the same time, another such lodge was operatingin Germany: the Ordo Templi Orientis (Order of the Eastern Temple), which hadnothing to do with Liebenfels's ONT but everything to do with Aleister Crowleyas we shall see in a later chapter.Von Liebenfels—in Ostara and in other publications, such as his weirdly entitledTheozoologie oder die Kunde von den Sodoms-Aefflingen und dem Gbtter-Elektron(1905), which we may translate as \"Theo-zoology, or the Science of theSodom-Apelings and the Electron of the Gods\"—prescribed sterilization andcastration for inferior races and, of course, denounced miscegenation owing toits pollution of the pure-blooded German Volk. He also sounded a theme that wasto occupy all other racist ideologues, including Hitler, and that was the forcedsubmission of women to Aryan men. To the Nazis and their ideologicalpredecessors, feminism was an evil on the same level as Freemasonry,international Jewry, and Bolshevism. In fact, the Nazis believed feminism (likeBolshevism) to be a creation of international Jewry for the express purpose offinishing off the Aryan race. The irony has come full circle, of course, for theterm \"feminazis\" has become a staple of Rush Limbaugh-style, talk radioagit-prop.But von Liebenfels did not stop at sweeping political indictments. He includedoccult biology in his repertoire, with a concentration on the pineal andpituitary glands. He believed—as did Blavaisky and asdo many current mystics and theosophists—dun a space between these glands in thehypothalamus of the brain was formerly a supercharged area thai gave Aryans thetwin powers of telepathy and omniscience:the third Eye; but that—because of the pollution of Aryan blood withthat of members of the inferior races—these two glands had so aim phied thai theAryan people had lost their psychic abilities. I Ins is asomewhat liberal borrowing from the teachings of legitimate Eastern adepts whotrain their devotees in methods of awakening this innate potential (regardlessof their racial background).According to von Liebenfels, however, the solution to the problem of theincipient physical and spiritual degeneration of the Aryan race was not hathayoga or Transcendental Meditation but the creation of a new priesthood of theHoly Grail; a new Knights Templar of the German Blood (for that was, accordingto von Liebenfels, what the Grail represented). As for the inferior races? Theywere to be deported; or incinerated as a sacrifice to Clod; or simply used asslave labor.All of these proposals—from Knights Templar to slave labor, from Holy Grail tocrematoria—were to be accepted, incorporated, and e\\ panded upon by Adolf Hitlerpersonally, and by the Third Reich as official policy. It was also vonLiebenfels who proposed that the finest specimens of Aryan males should mateindiscriminately with the finest specimens of Aryan females in speciallycontrolled and tightly mom tored villages in order to create the super race. 21Ibis would, of course, be a cause taken up by Himmler's Lebensbom organizationto which every SS officer was expected to belong.Lanz von Liebenfels and his mentor Guido von list can be viewed as archetypalSocial Darwinists and the Third Reich as Social 1 )arwm ism carried to itslogical conclusion. Similar to the rationale behind the race eugenics programsin the United States (which also influenced American immigration policies, bothof which the Nazis regarded with admiration and approval), it was an ideology olthe survival ol the-fittest, and the enslavement and destruction ol the weakest,from lews to women, from the mentally and physically handicapped to the aged,from Slavs and Gypsies to Communists. Gradually, the distinction between raceand ideology became so blurred thai the Soviets v viewed as race enemies as muchas political enemies. I his explains the ferocity with which Russian Communistswere slaughtered by loving bands of Einsatzgruppen during the war, notably undersuch racistideologues as Dr. Franz Six and onetime Theosophist Otto Ohlen-dorf. To supportthis program, they enlisted the aid of history, of romance, of legend, and ofthe occult significance of alphabets, geometry, ancient architecture, ritualmagic . . . and the Knights Templar."},{"pageContent":"During the early twentieth century in Europe, the romance and lure of theKnights Templar myth was strong. The original Order of the Knights of the Templehad been destroyed by an agreement between the king of France (Phillipe le Bel)and Pope Clement V in the fourteenth century. Their leader at the time,Grandmaster Jacques de Molay, was burned at the stake in a.d. 1314 and theOrder's assets seized all over Europe (primarily in France). One reason for allthis bloodshed and chaos was the fact that the Order had become notoriouslywealthy by loaning money to the king ... so much money that the king now had nohope of repaying it. The official reasons given by Church and State for thesuppression of the Templars were much different, however, and it is the mysteryof this Order that has given rise to so many myths and legends, and which hascontributed to the creation of several occult societies in the twentiethcentury. The works of Louis Charpentier in France 22 and Michael Baigent,Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln in Great Britain 23 may be consulted for a moredetailed discussion of pop Templar literature, but for now all we need to knowis that the Templars were believed to be the heirs of a mystical tradition ofwhich Lanz von Liebenfels considered himself the modern incarnation.Created by the mystical philosopher St. Bernard of Clairvaux—and thereforecorresponding to von Liebenfels's own Cistercian background—the Templars wereoriginally nine Knights who abandoned all they owned and ventured off to theHoly Land to \"protect pilgrims\" who were on their way to the various Catholicshrines. How nine recently impoverished men were expected to accomplish thismission—especially while there were already large, fully funded knightlyorganizations in Palestine doing just that—was never explained. However, aboutthe year a.d. 1118 they found themselves bivouacked at the site of KingSolomon's Temple in Jerusalem and spent their days there in relativeobscurity—nine knights in charge of the entire Temple site—until their return toFrance ten years later, no pilgrims having been especially protected.The legend states that these nine men returned with something important.Something discovered in the ruins of the Temple. Whatever it was, it made theTemplars unbelievably rich and powerful virtually overnight. They began buildingcathedrals all over France and— according to the legend—not a singleTemplar-built cathedral (and this includes the famous Chartres Cathedral)contained a crucifix anywhere as part of its original design. The author shouldpoint out 10 any non-Catholics that a crucifix is, strictly speaking, arepresentation of Christ crucified on a cross. The Templar buildings did containcrosses; they simply omitted depicting the crucified bodv of Christ on them.This was seen as evidence that the Templars did not believe in the crucifixionand by extension did not believe in the resurrection of Christ after death;that, in fact, the Templars had somehow ceased being Christians entirely andbecome heretics, or worse.What did the Templars find in Jerusalem that exerted such a profound ifpernicious effect? Some say the Templars had located the Holy Grail itself.Others, that the Templars had found the Ark of the Covenant with its famouscontents: the stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were inscribed, andthe magical Rod ot Aaron. Whatever it was, it revealed a secret so shatteringthat a thousand \\ ears of Christian teachings lay helpless in the face of it.And whatever it was, it could not protect the Templars indefinitely. TheCrusades proved to be a catastrophic series of campaigns for Church and Stateand eventually the Holy Land was \"lost\" to the Muslims. At home, the Church wasworried about the wealth and influence of the Templars and suspicious abouttheir onetime cozy relationship with the Saracens: Muslim warriors with whom thetemplars might have exchanged \"initiations.\" Then there were the rumors that theTemplar initiation itself included a ceremony in which the postulant wouldtrample upon a cross; or in which obeisance was paid to an idol called Baphomet(a suspiciously Arabic-sounding name). There were even rumors that homosexualitywas being practiced on a wide scale among the knights—a charge that would laterbe brought in the twentieth century against Ernst Rohm and many other SA men asan excuse for their destruction.These rumors—including some \"eyewitness' testimony—were used as evidence in anInquisition against the Templars; the ()rder was destroyed; and whatever membersmanaged to escape the bonfires oithe Church wound up in Germany, Portugal, and, it is theorized, in Scotland.Oddly enough, during the eighteenth century the Templar legend enjoyed a kind ofrevival during the development of speculative Freemasonry. Templar degrees wereadded, and a tradition grew up around them that the Freemasons had been somehowTemplars in disguise, heirs to the same mystical tradition surrounding theTemple of Solomon. This is odd because the Nazis would later persecuteFreemasonry and arrest many of its members even though the Nazi Party itself washeir to the Order of the New Templars created by its early theoretician andHitler mentor, Lanz von Liebenfels, and in fact borrowed its swastika emblem. Aswe shall see, Liebenfels himself and other Templar organizations were alsopersecuted, notable among them the Ordo Templi Orientis or OTO of Theodor Reuss,Karl Germer, Franz Hart-mann, and Aleister Crowley.Thule GesellschaftMany followers of List and Liebenfels were not satisfied with the metaphysical,meditational, essentially passive and academic nature of the List Society andthe Order of New Templars. While they devoured Ostara and similarpublications—and professed to read the longer, more complex books of both Listand Liebenfels—they found themselves inflamed by their wild rhetoric and thecountless attacks on Jews, Freemasons, Jesuits, Bolsheviks, and Capitalists. Itwas no longer enough to perform pagan rituals at the summer solstice or todecode a particularly interesting series of runes found on a rock or describedin a forgotten book.If the theories and proposals of List and Liebenfels were right—if a war was, infact, taking place between the forces of Light and Darkness and the fate of theentire human race was at stake—then why wasn't someone doing something about it?Why wasn't there a program in place to weed out the Jews and otherMinderwertigen: \"beings of inferior value\"? Where were the Germans of pure Ayranblood? Why weren't they taking charge in the political arena? And why weren'tall (icrman peoples united in a single great Reich?To that end, and following the lead of a wealthy if small-time industrialist bythe name of Theodor Fritsch—whose publishing hobby included an inflammatoryanti-Semitic periodical, the Hammer, and oneof the first German editions of the Protocols of the Elders of/.io)r\" — severalmembers of the List Society and the ONT formed their own, ultrasecret andultra-right-wing society, the Germanenorden (or \"( ! man Order\") in concert witha more overt propaganda effort called the Re'ichshammerbund based loosely on theanti-Semitic diatribes to be found in Fritsch's Hammer magazine.The Germanenorden had an impressive series of initiatory rituals, replete withknights in shining armor, wise kings, mystical bards, and forest nymphs. Thedesire of the founders was to implement a Masonic-style program of secrecy,initiation, and mutual cooperation to counter the imagined conspiracy of Jewsand Freemasons with their see ret meetings and hidden agendas. What theGermanenorden became was, essentially, an anti-Masonry: a Masonic-style societydevoted to the eradication of Freemasonry itself; an anti-Judaism: a mutual helpand support network based on racial principles (one had to prove one's Aryanheritage by providing birth certificates going back several generations) thatwas committed to the destruction of the Jews. (As offbeat as this all soundstoday, the Germanenorden would be spiritually reborn decades after the war asthe Italo-Argentine P-2 Society, which we will discuss later).The Germanenorden was formally established—along with the Reichshammerbund —inMay of 1912 at the home of Fritsch/' Things went along fine for a while untilWorld War I broke out and many Germanenorden members found themselves called tothe front. At that time, the Order began to weaken and split into schismatic(actions until the arrival on the scene of Baron Rudolf von Seboitendorff.Sebottendorff had an exotic past. Initiated into a Masonic society in Egypt andcommunicant with a variety of secret societies in the Middle East and Turkey—forwhom he fought in the Balkan War of 1912—Sebottendorff was another self-styledaristocrat in the tradition of List, Liebenfels, Mathers, and Crowley. Born AdamAlfred Rudolf Glauer to a locomotive driver on November 9, I875i young Rudolfwould take to sea at the age of twenty-two. After some misadventures inAustralia, he fetched up in Alexandria in 1900, visited the pyramidsat Giza and witnessed the rites of the Dervishes. Later in Constantinople helearned Turkish from a Muslim imam and worked for a Sufi initiate at a town nearBursa, becoming initiated into Freemasonry therein 1901.Although he returned to Germany for a short while, he would find himself back inTurkey in 1908, studying Islamic alchemy, mysticism, and the practices of aDervish sect with Janissary lineage known as the Baktashi. It is said that hefounded his own mystical lodge in Constantinople in 1910, eventually winding upback in Germany in 1913.During the war, Sebottendorff made contact with the head of the Germanenorden,Hermann Pohl, with whom he shared a fascination with Nordic runes and Easternmysticism. Pohl enlisted his aid as a recruiter for the Order in Bavaria andSebottendorff became a very successful promoter during 1917, even going so faras to publish his own Order magazine, called Runen (Runes) in 1918. By the endof 1917, Sebottendorff was admitted to the exalted rank of Master of the Order'sBavarian section.It should be recognized from the above that Sebottendorff's interest in theGermanenorden was obviously of a strongly occultist nature. His background wasthat of a mystic and Orientalist (as Arabists then were called); his contactwith Pohl was made on the basis of rune symbolism and other arcane lore.Although he served in the Turkish Army, he managed to avoid conscription intothe German Army because he claimed Turkish citizenship. Therefore, we do not seeSebottendorff as a fanatic German nationalist or political activist first;rather, he comes upon his politics somewhat later in the game.By 1918, the Germanenorden in Bavaria had grown to over fifteen hundredmembers—an astonishing rate of growth particularly considering the number ofable-bodied men who were fighting World War I at the time. In need of space,Sebottendorff would rent rooms at the upscale Four Seasons Hotel in Munich.These rooms would eventually become known as the meeting place for the ThuleGesellschaft. The Thule Society was originally conceived as a cover identity forthe Germanenorden which, at this time, was becoming identified with the type ofright-wing extremism and virulent anti-Semitism that the various Germanrepublican and socialist groups were seeking to weed out and destroy. In short,the Germanenorden —another magic-oriented, occultVolk Magic ~Ssociety with its secret initiation rituals patterned after Masonic ceremony andits Theosophical-style philosophy encompassing everything from Eastern mysticismto runic lore to a rabid, pseudoscientific racism—was considered a subversive organization and a threat to society. The ThuleSociety, while ostensibly a \"literary-cultural group,\" had as its emblem thefamous swastika superimposed on a dagger. The Thule Society front fooled no one,probably—certainly not its members, who, in the beginning were all Germanenordeninitiates, and which included the Justice Minister Franz Gurtner (who wouldretain thai title in the Third Reich), Ernst Pohner, the police chief of Munich,and various titled aristocrats. 2 ^Sebottendorff enlisted the aid of young ex-soldier and art student WalterNauhaus. Another occultist and a follower of Guido von 1 ist, Nauhaus joined theGermanenorden in Berlin in 1916 and in 1918 made contact with Sebottendorff (theOrder's Bavarian master) after moving to Munich. The two magicians decided todivide the responsibilities of attracting new recruits to the cult by havingNauhaus devote himself to university-age prospects. Nauhaus was about twenty-sixyears old at the time.The membership restrictions of the Germanenorden /Thule Gesell-schaft make thoseof the New York Athletic Club or any typical American \"whites only\" golfinggesellschaft pale by comparison (no pun intended). Aside from proving one'spurity of Aryan blood as iar hack as the Thirty Years' War, there were physicalexaminations that had to be passed (measurement of skull, foot; color of hair,eyes; etc.). In addition, the deformed or simply unattractive were also refusedadmittance. Those uncertain of where they stood in relation to these draconianrequirements were advised to refer to past issues of von Liebenfels's Ostara.It was directly due to this screening out of potential members thai theminister-president of Bavaria's first Socialist government—the oddly sympaticoKurt Eisner—was assassinated, thus precipitating a national crisis. Theassassin, a young count, was refused admittance to the Thule Society because hehad Jewish blood. Angry at the rejection, and consumed by a desire to prove hispro-German bona fides, he shot and killed Herr Eisner while the latter wasactually on his way to quit his post, letter of resignation in hand.What happened next is detailed in the pages that begin Chapter One. The youngart student and occultist Walter Nauhaus was one of the seven Thulists captured,and later murdered, by the Red Army during the debacle of April 30, 1919. Munichwas \"liberated\" from the Reds in May and Sebottendorff—stinging from charges hehad let the Order down and was indirectly responsible for the deaths of theseven Thulists by failing to conceal the membership lists—officially resignedfrom the GermanenordenlThule Society organization in June of that year anddevoted the following years to a serious study of the stars. The Germanenordencontinued to operate until well into the 1920s and actually carried out severalpolitical assassinations— including that of Matthias Erzberger, 28 one of thesignatories of the Armistice and hence a \"November criminal\"—making the nameGermanenorden synonymous with political terrorism as well as occult conspiracy.As for the Thule Society itself, there is documentary evidence in the diaries ofThule member Johannes Hering to show that it lasted at least until 1923, theyear of Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch. 29Its foremost creation, however, took place while Sebottendorff was still incharge in Munich, and that was the formation of the \"workers' society\" arm ofthe Order. Heretofore, the Germanenorden and the Thule Society were virtuallythe exclusive domain of the wealthy, educated, and prominent among Bavariansociety. There was no room for the lower-middle-class elements who were hurtingthe most from the effects of war, revolution, and inflation. The enemies of theGermanenorden, the Communists and Socialists, were actively recruiting amongthese elements, however, poisoning them against their aristocratic leaders andpromising them a heaven on earth, a \"workers' paradise.\" The monarchists andindustrialists understood the need to counter this threat, or else theirpopulation base—a given for a thousand years of royal rule over the peasantpopulations of Europe—would wither and die. The arcane occult theories andsnarled academic prose that characterized the meetings and publications of theGermanenorden, the Thule, the List Society, and the Order of New Templars wasnot likely to be easily understood—or warmly embraced—by the largely Christianmasses. The Thule, it was recognized, was an elite society, attrac tive only tothose who had done the reading; to those who could afford the initiations andthe leisure time to devote to occult studies;and to those who had already abandoned their traditional Christian faith or whowere on the verge of doing so.Thus, in order completely to unify the German population in opposition to thethreat of Bolshevism and international Jewry, Sebotten-dorff formed a workers'circle with a few handpicked men, among them Anton Drexler. This group did notmeet at the fancy four Sea sons Hotel but at a tavern, and was called the GermanWorkers' Party, the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or DAP, a consciouslySocialist-sounding title. It was this group that Hitler was sent to spy on inSeptember, 1919, and which, five months later, became the National SocialistGerman Workers' Party, the NSDAP or Nazi Party.As we shall see in more detail in Chapter Five, Rudolf von Sebot-tendorff wouldeventually return to Germany in the 1930s with a mission to revitalize his oldOrder, calling upon his former colleagues and even reissuing his old magazine,Runen. He wrote a book— Before Hitler Came —describing the early history of theThule Gesellschafi and the Nazi Party, showing how the occultists had virtuallycreated both the Party and Hitler. This book—consulted with appropriatecaution—has become invaluable to researchers tracing the lineage of many of theprincipal actors and organizations in this drama and in providing a time lineagainst which the history of the Nazi Party can be established.However, his revelations aroused the ire of the Party—and particularly ofHitler, who would take steps to ensure that no one who knew of his early dayswould be around to talk about them. SebottendorH was thrown into a camp for awhile, and then released to make his way to Turkey, where he worked for GermanIntelligence as a perfectly useless agent until the war ended. (The degree ofhis ineptitude as a spy may be judged by the fact that Schellenberg, chief of SSForeign Intelligence, never mentions the illustrious Sebottendortf in hismemoirs even though he wrote at some length about his visit to the Naziintelligence apparatus in Turkey.) The new Thule Gesellschafi never got off theground, and died aborning, divided by petty squabbles among its members(including an acrimonious attaek on I ran/ Dan-nehl) and increasingly underpressure from the Nazis to disband. But the damage had already been done, manyyears before.It should be pointed out that there is a great deal of controversy over theearly days and connections of the DAP with the Thule Society. Some historiansinsist that there was no direct connection between them—although many DAPmembers were also Thulists, such as Franz Dannehl, Karl Harrer, and FriedrichKrohn (who designed the swastika flag for Hitler), and although the adoption ofthe swastika as Party symbol is a virtual admission of the link between theList, Lie-benfels, and Sebottendorff groups and the DAP and NSDAP. Indeed,during the \"troubles\" of 1918 when the German revolution was in full swing withthe collapse of the Second Reich, Pan-German groups were shut down all overGermany with the exception of the Thule Society (which was, we remember, purelya \"literary-cultural\" society); and its premises at the Four Seasons Hotel wereused as a meeting place—and sometime hiding place—for such notables as RudolfHess and Alfred Rosenberg, not to mention the poet Dietrich Eckart who was theDoctor Frankenstein to Hitler's Monster. (It was only Eckart's fast talking andfancy footwork that kept him and Rosenberg alive when the Red Army beganarresting—and shooting—Thulists.) So, while we cannot show a document statingthat the DAP and NSDAP were subsidiaries of the Thule Gesellschaft or theGermanenorden, the author believes it is safe to say that the DAP (and, byextension, the Nazi Party) was originally a creature of both the Thule Societyand Sebottendorff (as claimed by Sebottendorff and as admitted by To-land), 30and, certainly, the wildest, most extreme aims of the Thule Society would alleventually become official policy of the Third Reich, while its purelymetaphysical and occult characteristics were adopted wholeheartedly by the SS.Between them, Guido von List—an elderly man in flowing beard andquasi-Renaissance attire—and Lanz von Liebenfels (a younger, clean-shaven,somewhat more imposing sort photographed in the ritual vestments of his Order)created the atmosphere of \"rational\" anti-Semitism in Vienna that was based onsuspect scholarship in a number of fields, from etymology and linguistics toanthropology, astronomy and astrology, archaeology, and the occult.Sebottendorff, with his initiations into Eastern cults and his background inMiddle Eastern mysticism and Freemasonry, personified the Aryan Mystic. As anaristocrat, a proven man of action who fought with Turkish forces in the BalkanWar, and with his political connections and his activism at thetime of the 1919 Putsch, he showed what a serious occultist could accomplishwith a few hundred men and a stockpile of weapons. Scb-ottendorff was an idealfigure, a perfect combination of mystic .\\nd militarist, an echo of the timeswhen kings were initiates. And when priests raised armies.Although he was held responsible by the Thule for the murder of the sevenhostages held by the Red Army by allowing the Thule membership lists to fallinto enemy hands, it was Sebottendorff who had tirelessly organized—first forthe Germanenorden, of which he was a Master, and then for the ThuleGesellschaft, which he founded—and who had created an armed cult andsophisticated intelligence apparatus in the midst of pre-Weimar Munich. HisSociety had received such distinguished guests as Alfred Rosenberg, DietrichEckart, and Rudolt\" Hess. His Society had created the German Workers' Party,from which the Nazi Party would be born. And his Society bestowed the singlemost important symbol of the Third Reich upon the fledgling Nazis: the occultsign of the swastika, inherited from Liebenfels, Hitler's early mentor.Sebottendorff and the Thule Society were both ultimately and directlyresponsible for the collapse of the Soviet regime in Bavaria, both from force ofarms and from force of ideas.And it was an amazing time, no matter who was responsible; for an occultorganization—a secret society based on Theosophical, runic, and magical concepts(a kind of redneck Golden Dawn with guns)— had fought an armed conflict in thestreets of Munich against the purely political forces of a Soviet state . . .and won. Today, this would be considered the stuff of science fiction or, atworst, sword and sorcery fantasy. But in Munich, in 1919, it was reality.#3 #The Occult Messiah. . . this idea of himself as the German Messiah was the source of his personalpower. It enabled him to become the ruler of eighty million people — and in thespace of twelve short years to leave his ineradicable mark on history. ]SCHELLENBERGThat Hitler was fascinated by the occult is proven: the Bercht-esgaden library,discovered in a mine after the war, contained many volumes on occultism. 2 Hissmall collection of books as a student contained works on mythology and acollection of von Liebenfels's racist-occult magazine, OstaraS and he evenvisited with the Templar Master (as seen in Chapter Two). Friends of his fromthe early days recall long conversations on occult themes—everything fromreincarnation to yoga to paganism and magic'—and his later biographers, such asSir Allan Bullock, record Hitler's familiarity with occult topics in the daysprior to the Second World War. sThat Hitler ever actually belonged to an occult lodge has never been proven and,in fact, probably never will be. While 1 iitler appreciated the \"scholarship\" hediscovered in the occult magazines and books he devoured, he never took .1particular liking to the type of people whocomposed occult lodges. The occultists who were members of his inner circle—suchas Hess, Rosenberg, Gutberlet, and Eckan lived on the periphery of the Thule andGermanenorden lodges; while Eckart and Rosenberg may have been members of the Thule, it is clear to the authorthat they would have been exploiting that membership for their own, hidden,agenda. The leadership and influence of men like Sebottendorff was strong, andit is doubtful whether Hitler would have willingly accepted a role subservientto an occult (or political) master. History has shown that no occult order cansurvive two masters.Hitler was an activist. Almost any action was better than sitting around a roomin a robe and meditating on Thor. 1 litler was a pacer. He couldn't sit stillfor long. And he was a demagogue, almost from the beginning. He had to lead; andif he couldn't lead, he would absent himself from the action and theconversation altogether. 1 litler was a paranoid, and the occult holds specialattractions tor the paranoid. But Hitler as cultist? As a black-robed,ritual-performing, invocation-chanting priest of Satan? Probably not.But Hitler as tool of other cultists?Probably so/'The basic details of Hitler's life story are so well known, au^\\ so welldocumented in other sources, that to repeat them here would cheat the reader whois, after all, looking for the occult angle to the mystery of the Third Reich.Let us concentrate then on those aspects of 1 [ider's life that reveal occultinterests and involvements, all the while remembering what has been said herebefore: that there is no evidence that Hitler ever actually joined an occultsociety per se, but that the evidence for his fascination with occult themes andsubjects is extensive and that a great portion of the program of the Third Reichconcerning race, Jews, Freemasons, genetic engineering, etc., was the veritableplatform of the volkisch and Pan-German occult lodges carried out in actualpractice, a platform Hitler inherited from I.iebenfek Rosenberg, and Eckartduring his early days in Vienna and Munich. Indeed. his major argument with theoccult lodges was only that they had been unable to carry out their programs inthe real world. Hitler, in a sense, had mastered himself and the \"real world toan extent th.u men like Mathers and even Crowley had not, but wished to. I hatis—not satis fied with phony titles and the accumulation of pedigrees and inin.itions that typified the fin de siecle occultist—he was able to take his occultbeliefs and enact them on the world stage to a degree undreamed of by mainstreamoccult philosophers. In that sense, then, he was a tool of the occultists. More,he was their Creature.Hitler was born on April 20, 1889, to an Austrian civil servant in the town ofBraunau-am-Inn, a locale said to be famous at the time for its large proportionof native mediums. 7 It is even claimed that Hitler shared the same wet nurse astwo famous \"channelers\" of the day: Rudi and Willy Schneider. 8 That Hitlerhimself might have been a medium was a contention made by a great many of hispersonal friends and other observers, who described the Fiihrer in terms rangingfrom \"hypnotic\" to \"demoniacally possessed\" to the \"Prince of Darkness\" himself.9 As this is a rather subjective judgment, for which no proof is available, letus pass over it in silence as there will be ample opportunity to examine theoccult influences on Hitler's life from a variety of other sources.Instead, we will begin with Hitler's childhood schooling at Lam-bach Monastery,from 1897 to 1899, under the guidance of Catholic monks. It is so indicative ofthe atmosphere in which the Nazi Party would later take root in Germany andAustria that, as mentioned earlier, the coat of arms of this monastery is aswastika before which Hitler would pass every school day and which even nowadorns the chapel where Hitler would attend choir practice, and in several otherplaces, and which was even visible from his apartment window.Hitler (like Heinrich Himmler, Dr. Mengele, Joseph Goebbels, Klaus Barbie, andso many other prominent Nazis) was born and reared a Roman Catholic, a fact thatis often forgotten. 10 His mother was devout, his father rather less so; and itis important to recognize that Hitler never got along well with his father butidolized his mother.Like all good Catholic children of a certain age, Hitler was confirmed in theChurch. The Roman Catholic Confirmation ceremony is one in which young Catholicsreaffirm the sacrament of Baptism: that is, with their own voice they confirmtheir acceptance of the vows made for them by their godparents when they wereinfants. They officially reject \"Satan, and all his pomps, and all his works,\"in a ceremony which evidently left the young Hitler either totally unimpressedor strangely tense, for he was distracted and restless that whole after-The Occult Messiahnoon until some neighborhood children came by and invited him to a game ofcowboys and Indians, which he joined with unbridled en thusiasm. We may wonderat what point Hitler lost his interest in the Church or, indeed, if he ever hadany interest to lose. Main ( hristian organizations enthusiastically supportedHitler in the early years of his dictatorship, choosing not to believe that thevirulently ami (!hristian stance of his neo-pagan Nazi Party was sincere. Theywere accompa nied in their tolly by many Jewish people and organizations whichcould not accept that the anti-Semitism of the Party was anything more than acheap political ploy.Germany, of course, was the birthplace of the Lutheran Reformation, the laststronghold of the Holy Roman Empire and a country of Christians of whateverpersuasion. Germany was also the country of Walpurgisnacht, that famous paganfestival celebrated on April 30 every year, traditionally at the top of MountBroeken in the Mar/ Mountains, where the Witches' Sabbath supposedly takesplace. (rer many was also the scene of what we might call \"Christianrevisionism,\" an attempt to describe the resurrection of Christ as a mythperpetrated by his disciples: a thesis promulgated by Professor Reim-arus ofHamburg in the eighteenth century, who insisted that Jesus was nothing more thana Jewish rebel, and that his body had been stolen from his tomb by hisfollowers. Eventually, German scholarship would prove that the Gospels werewritten much later than anyone had previously realized, a position representedby no less than the esteemed Biblical commentator and professor of theUniversity o( Marburg, Rudolf Bultmann who, in his Jesus and the Word —published before Hitler came to power—came to the conclusion that the life ofJesus was virtually unknowable.\" Thus we have a land where scientific researchand religious fervor meet; a country that will occa sionally engage in an almostmasochistic turning-inward upon itself and its cherished ideals, devouring itsown children in the process.We have a nation where fierce religious beliefs live cheek by jowl with fiercereligious dissent; a land where Lutherans and Catholics, Christians and pagans,each lay claim to the country's psyche. 1 he Holy Inquisition was founded therein 1231 in response to the ( athar threat to the Holy See; yet Germany was alsothe birthplace of Rosi-crucianism, the core documents of that movement—the lamaInner nitatis and the Confessio —having been published there in 161a and1615. The infamous bugaboo of right-wing conspiracy buffs—the II-luminatenOrden, the dread Illuminati of Adam Weishaupt—began in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, in1776 (the birthplace of Ernst Rohm and once the home of Heinrich Himmler and nowof BMW, Ingolstadt is also well known as the city where the fictional Dr.Frankenstein created his Monster). And Germany became the country where theAnthropo-sophical Society of Rudolf Steiner was founded less than 150 yearslater, an organization that was banned and persecuted by the Nazis resulting inSteiner's own untimely death in 1925.So it was perhaps inevitable that the type of occultism which would develop onsuch fertile soil would be the syncretist type represented by List andLiebenfels: an anti-Papist neo-Templarism mixed with Teutonic mythology andanti-Semitism, blended in a mind-boggling metaphysical stew and spiced with afanatic desire to prove the undiluted \"purity\" of the blood. It also comes as nosurprise that the ultimate British secret society of that era—the GoldenDawn—was traditionally said to have originated, not on that \"blessed isle,\" butin Germany itself with the forged \"cypher manuscript\" of a nonexistent FraiileinA. Sprengel in Stuttgart. It was somehow important to the Chiefs of the GoldenDawn—Dr. William Wynn Westcott, Mac-Gregor Mathers, and Dr. William R.Woodman—to demonstrate a German origin for their Society, even though laterscholarship has shown that the forged documents were in a grammatically poor,error-ridden German. So why not a British or a Celtic origin? Or French orItalian, for that matter? Or Middle Eastern? Mathers's command of Latin was goodenough to enable him to perform the first ever English translation of the Seferha-Zohar, the central text of Jewish Qabalism, from the Latin version by Knorrvon Rosenroth, a translation still in use today. 12 Indeed, Qabalism is a majorelement of the Golden Dawn system of initiation. So why strain for a Germanorigin for the Golden Dawn when Mathers could have forged an ancient Latinpedigree from anywhere else in Europe or the Middle East much more easily?Because the late nineteenth century occult revival was taking place—not inEngland or France or anywhere else on the Continent— but in Germany itself: theland of the first Rosicrucians, the Teutonic Knights, Paracelsus, JohannesTrithemius, the notorious Vehmgtricht (the secret tribunal to exact vigilantejustice that was revived in Nazi Germany), M and other famous figures ofmedieval mysticism, bothreal and mythical. And it was from Germany, alter all, that Aleister Crowley'smost famous import originated, one still in existence today: the Or do TempliOrient is, or OTO.We have noted how Hitler was influenced by the writings of rolhisch occultistslike Liebenfels. This had happened at a time in his life when everything aroundhim was railing apart. In 1907, his beloved mother died in an excruciatingmanner: diagnosed with breast cancer, she submitted to the painful applicationof iodoform to her chest. This was a method by which—it was believed—theacidlike characteristics of iodoform would literally burn out the cancerouscells. She succumbed, however, on December 21, dying in the light of a Christmastree near her bed. (Four days later, Lanz von Liebenfels would raise hisswastika flag over Burg Werfenstein, not far from the Hitler home in UpperAustria.)That this experience would have figuratively burned itself into her son andthereby affect his psyche in profound and disturbing ways particularly inrelation to women and, possibly, to Jews (his mother's doctor was Jewish)—hasalready been discussed at length by oilier authors; 14 we may take a littlelicense here ourselves, though, and call to mind another man whose earlyexperience of the barbaric medical treatment of his mother would also affect himprofoundly: Peter Mich Tchaikovsky, the Russian composer, who at the age offourteen watched his mother die at the hands of doctors who were trying to cureher from cholera by submerging her body in boiling water. In Tchaikovsky's case,he managed to channel a great deal of this traumatic episode into his music(while suffering from an ambiguous ual identity in the process). In Hitler'scase, there is similar evidence that his mother's gruesome death may haveaffected his sex life but, being rejected as an artist—his first careerchoice—no less than three times, he abandoned the humanities for politics andthereby came to vent his anger and frustration on the whole world. It has beensaid that Hitler's problem in terms of art was his inability to draw the humanbody; perhaps, then, his inability to purge himself of the trauma of watchinghis mother die in such a horrible fashion on the eve of the winter solstice.Thus orphaned, estranged from most of his family, impoverished, continuallyrejected in his quest for acceptance at the Academy of FineArts in Vienna, sleeping in men's dorms and living on the dole, this lover ofgrand opera—reduced to prostituting what he believed was his great artistictalent by painting picture postcards for tourists—was prime material for theparanoid screeds of the German and Austrian occultists. In another age, oranother country, Hitler might have blamed his gross misfortunes on a plague ofevil spirits and sought the assistance of an exorcist or witch doctor. Instead,the perfectly scientific-sounding jargon he found in Ostara provided him withanother— equally occult and nefarious—enemy: an evil race whose very blood, andcells, and genes were slowly possessing and dispossessing the entire Germanpeople. Hitler would not have to burn sacrifices at the altars of pagan gods toobtain release from his demonic possession; he would only have to build thecrematoria. Authors like Liebenfels took the racial theories of Blavatsky—withher innumerable root-races and her pyramiding evolutionary scheme—and mixed themwith the programs of Social Darwinists and crank eugenicists, and took theresulting mixture to a logical conclusion: exterminate the subhumans and soavoid polluting the gene pool with their recessive traits.Hitler was not completely credulous: that is, he did not surrender his entirelife to a blind acceptance of occult beliefs; otherwise, he would have spent hisremaining years sitting around seance tables and invoking spirit guides likemany of his contemporaries, in Europe and America. Instead, Hitler was nothingif not pragmatic, and not easily fooled by fake mediums and other occultcharlatans. He sought real-world solutions to the problems posed by mystics suchas Liebenfels. That is, he agreed with occult theory and seemed to take much ofit as accepted fact; it was occult practice—particularly the occult practicestaking place in his own environment of self-deluded albeit self-proclaimed magiand bishops and seers—that he couldn't stomach, although he loved to read aboutoccultism and to discuss it with those of his friends who had done some of thesame reading. In this, he was not so different from millions of other people whoenjoy being entertained by tabloid tales of true occult rituals and occultcrimes but who would never actually perform an occult ritual.To Hitler, the occult was possibly a further refinement of the Roman Catholicismhe was brought up with. According to Schellen-bcrg and other Nazis around theFiihrer, Hitler did not believe in an afterlife or a personal god. 15 Theauthor, however, submits that it laythere in the back of his mind like the faint buzz of a mosquito. Hecouldn't ignore it completely; as it was for Himmler, the concept of anafterlife was probably simultaneously real and threatening to him, but notsomething around which he would arrange his life. He paid attention to omens andprognostications from a variety of sources, and was not averse to having otherswork magic for him (as we shall » but, like a Mafia don, he kept his hands cleanof the actual bloodletting itself.In the years before World War I and after the death of his mother. Hitler livedin poverty in Vienna. (This would make him a typical occultist, even today. Asthe congenial author of many respected histories of secret societies and occultpersonalities—Francis King—once remarked in the author's presence, \"It seems tobe a requirement of great and powerful magicians that they live on publicassistance.\") 1 le eventually had his own space at a mens dormitory where—afterhaving been deloused—he was given a small, clean room or his own dnc\\ managed tobuy some watercolors. He would paint scenes of churches and local landmarks, anda friend would hawk them on the streets for a cut of the proceeds. It was inVienna and during these tough times that Hitler made the personal acquaintanceof Lanz von Liebenfels at the latter's office, sometime in 1909. Liebenfelsremembered that Hitler appeared so distraught and so impoverished that the NewTemplar himself gave Hitler free copies of Ostara and bus fare back home, liwould be von Liebenfels who would greet the ascension of Hitler to Germany'sthrone with tremendous enthusiasm as a sign ot the great occult power that wassweeping through the world under the sign oi the swastika (before he wassilenced by that same regime after Anschluss in 1938).Hitler was also fascinated by the opera, particularly Wagner (1 <S 1 3-1883).The four operas that compose the famous Ring Cycle were a favorite, of course,and Parsifal Lohengrin . . . virtually all of Wagner's mythological and mysticalwork. One Wagnerian opera that stands out as an early favorite of Hitler's is alesser-known and infrequently performed work called Rienzi. Hitler wascaptivated by this opera and took a childhood friend to see it several times.They had to stand during the performance since they could not afford seattickets. It is an intriguing footnote to the story of the occult Reich thatRienzi 5libretto was based on an historical novel of medieval Rome by the celebratedEnglish occultist and best-selling author Lord Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873). Rienziwas a patriot who attempted to reform the Roman government, but who eventuallyfailed and went to his death. Rienzi—whose real name was Niccolo Gabrini—wasoften called \"the last of the Romans.\" As for Bulwer-Lytton, who is probablybest known for his The Last Days o/Pornpei, he was the author of the popularoccult novels Zanoni and Vril: The Coming Race, the latter having inspired thecreation of a German secret society by the same name. (Bulwer-Lytton's namewould also be lumped together with those of Byron, Moore, Shelley, Rousseau,George Sand, and Victor Hugo as a member of the \"Satanic School\" of literature:a trend of certain Romantic poets towards the anti-Christian, unconventional,and occasionally obscene in literature.)It would be Wagner's peculiar vision of cosmology and world history—that findsits most perfect expression in Parsifal, with its moving, if peculiar, paganspin on the Christ mythos—that would influence Hitler and an entire generationof Germans who were cutting their milk teeth on Teutonic mythology as Germanprehistory and on the writings of erstwhile Wagner devotee Friedrich Nietzsche(1844-1900), the philosopher who popularized the concept of the \"superman.\" Theheady combination of Nietzsche and Wagner provided an atmosphere in whichstrange pagan societies could develop among the otherwise fastidious members ofpolite society. Groups such as the Thule Society, the Edda Society, the ListSociety, the Ger-manenorden, and the Order of New Templars would include nobles,military officers, college professors, and wealthy industrialists among theirranks. It was also the influence of Wagner to which we can attribute thatfascination for orders of knighthood, the quest for the pagan Grail, Teutonicgods, and blond-haired heroes that would eventually dominate the Weltanschauungof Hitler's most ardent supporter, Hein-rich Himmler.About the year 1911 Hitler made the acquaintance of one Josef Greiner—anotherresident of the men's hostel, an unemployed lamplighter—and they would spendhours discussing such arcane lore as astrology, religion, and the occultsciences. 17 According to Greiner in his published memoirs, 18 Hitler wasfascinated by stories of yoga and the magical accomplishments of the Hindufakirs. He read with en-thusiasm the travel books of Swedish explorer Svcn 1 [cdin, who blazed trailsthrough the Himalayas in search of Tibetan Shangri-las.But in 1913, defeated in his dream of becoming an ailist and thereby redesigningthe great public buildings of Vienna, 1 in/, and other Austrian cities, Hitlerfinally left his homeland for Germany, crossing over the border fromAustria-Hungary on May 24 and arm ing in Munich the next day.A year and a month later, Archduke Ferdinand would be assassi nated at Sarajevoby a member of a Serbian secret society called the Black Hand. In July 1914,Austria will declare war on Serbia. Three days later, on August 1, Germany willmobilize against ( /ansi Russia; on August 3, she will declare war againstFrance; on August 16, 1 lit lei will enlist with the 1st Bavarian InfantryRegiment. The young art ist—broke, his artistic efforts constantly rejected, andliving a humiliating life on charity—embraces war with glee.If there is still any doubt about Hitler's enthusiasm tor occult and vblkischthemes, the following should put all objections to rest.Obsessed by some of his occult ideas, Hitler wrote a poem in the autumn of 1915,while in the trenches. Reproduced in part in To land's biography of Hitler, 20it sings the praises of Wotan, the Teutonic Father God, and of runic letters,magic spells, and magic formulas. Had it been printed today in any of a dozenoccult and New Age journals of the author's acquaintance, it would have raisedleu brows so consistent is its theme of magic, mystery, and esoteric paganism.Adolf Hitler is twenty-six years old; by the time the war ends in 1918, he willhave been awarded the Iron Cross, 1 irst and Second Classes, and will haveproven himself an exceptionally brave combat soldier.But in October of 1918, he is blinded by a mustard gas attack in Belgium. Hetemporarily loses his sight, and is sent to the sanitorinm at Pasewalk. Thedoctors, not familiar with this type of condition, believe it to bepsychosomatic. While they may he wrong, he does eventually regain his sight,only to lose it again .is word ^ (.ermanv s surrender reaches his ears on MartinLuther's birthday: November l J. 1918. (On that same day, in Munich, BaronSebottendorff would callthe Saturday meeting of the Thule Gesellschaft to order and his cult-ists wouldbegin to forge identity papers, spy on the Reds, and stockpile weapons.)Yet it is during Hitler's blindness that he receives a kind of mysticalenlightenment, like that experienced by Guido von List many years before duringhis own temporary blindness (or like that of Saul, blinded on the way toDamascus) for, from that point on, Adolf Hitler has changed. He has beenillumined, perhaps. Spoken—as the Golden Dawn would have said—to his HolyGuardian Angel, his higher Self. He has been blinded fighting the Allies indefense of his adopted country, Germany, only to regain his sight to witnessGermany's capitulation and the abdication of the Kaiser—whom the Allies hadalready characterized as the Antichrist—and the resulting collapse of the Reich.After the successful overthrow of the Soviet Government by the Free Corps underThule Society leadership, the Thulists recognize that they need to organize theworkers into a coherent political party, else the Communists will return with avengeance. Sebottendorff has already formed the Political Workers' Circle out ofhis base at the rather expensive and exclusive Four Seasons Hotel. From thisCircle will be spawned the German Workers' Party with rail worker and locksmithAnton Drexler at its head. It is this Party that Hitler will infiltrate—on theorders of a Captain Mayr, who reports to a clique of wealthy industrialists andofficers operating coincidentally (?) out of the Four Seasons Hotel—in Septemberof 1919. 21 Drexler will give him a small pamphlet that he has authoredcontaining explosive phrases like \"National Socialism\" and the rather sinister\"New World Order.\" Hitler is captivated by these concepts, and decides that hisspying days are over. Drexler is equally captivated by the brash and outspokenyoung Austrian corporal, and urges him to join the Party.Adolf Hitler becomes German Workers' Party member 555.Later, perhaps for superstitious reasons, Hitler will annoy the Old Guard byclaiming that he was member number 7; this will be proven wrong when it isrevealed that the Party began its numbering system at 500 in order to appearlarger than it really was. (Hitler was actually member number 7 of the executivecommittee of the Party, formedlater.) In a bizarre coincidence, the number SSS will come up again a littlelater as the numerological value of the word Necronomicon, a book of blackmagick that was first introduced to the Western world in a short story by H.P.Lovecraft entitled \"The Hound\" ll c )~~). Lovecraft was also an anti-Semite andan ethnophobe, as main of his writings and letters attest. During the years thaiNazism rose to total power in Germany, Lovecraft was writing stories about anunnamable evil that could be conjured using the formulas of the Necronomicon andalong the way introduced yet another \"black book,' 1 the I ;/ sprechlichenKulten (\"Unspeakable Cults\" or, alternatively, \"Unpronounceable Cults\"!) of themythical German anthropologist von Junst. He wrote about the mysterious andabhorred practices of Asians and Arabs in his short story \"The Horror of RedHook' 1 among other tales and—save for the rather high literary quality of hisstories when compared to the articles of a von Liebenrels—their racist naturecould have easily promised him publication in select copies ot Ostara, While theactual nature and extent of LovecrafVs anti-Semitism and ethno-phobia havebecome the subject of much debate, it is safe to say that many of his stories donot meet the criteria set down by our faithful watchdogs of the PoliticallyCorrect.(To followers of Aleister Crowley, the number SSS is the qabalistic equivalentof an ancient Hebrew term meaning \"Darkness,\" An appropriate connotation from aJewish perspective of what Hitler represented. But then, of course, 555 is alsothe number used by Hollywood for nonexistent telephone exchanges in movie andtelevision scripts; one may also dial 555-1212, preceded by an area code, to getthe information operator for that area code. I leave it to qabalists moreadvanced or more creative than I to interpret these \"synchronic!-ties. )Gradually, Hitler—carrying out his own, mysterious agenda spawned at thesanitorium in Pasewalk—begins to assume total eon trol of the German Workers'Party (Deutsche Arbcitcrfutrtci or DAP). He changes its name to NationalSocialist German Workers Party or Nazionalsocialistische Deutsche Ar betterparte v or NSDAP. Me will also design its emblem with the help of a ThulcSociety member, the den tist Dr. Friedrich Krohn, and the swastika will becomethe official symbol of the new Nazi Party.Still broke, Hitler lives in a tiny rented room in Munich. His bookcase has afew, well-thumbed volumes, including the memoirs of a famous Swedish explorer,Sven Hedin, (already mentioned) whose principal destination has always been Asiawith an emphasis on Tibet. Sven Hedin will later become deeply involved with theinfamous Ah-nenerbe: a research organization within Himmler's SS which wasresponsible for some of the worst atrocities of the Reich.Dietrich EckartAlthough hungry, poorly (some say, ridiculously) dressed, and uncomfortable inhigh society, Hitler comes to the attention of one of Germany's most famouspoets, the eccentric genius Dietrich Eckart (1868-1923). Eckart, encouraged byhis friends in the Thule, went to hear him speak at DAP meetings and, like somany people after him, became entranced by the hypnotic, wild-eyed Austrianfanatic. He takes Hitler under his wing and introduces him to the elite ofMunich society.Dietrich Eckart was a drug addict who owned his own newspaper. Famous for histranslation into German of Peer Gynt, Eckart was one of Munich's coffeehousedarlings, as well known for his biting wit and sarcasm as for his felicitous useof the German language in poetry and plays. He was also a former mental patientand a rabid anti-Semite. With a circulation of some thirty thousand, hisnewspaper— AufGut Deutsch (\"In Good German\")—ranks with the VblkischerBeobachter and Ostara as a racist sheet with intellectual pretensions. Hisprotege was none other than Alfred Rosenberg, the Baltic-born anti-Semite who islater to become one of the architects of official Nazi pagan policies. Eckart,Rosenberg, and, later, Rudolf Hess become Hitler's closest companions andcoconspirators in the first years of the 1920s in Munich. It was Eckart who, onhis deathbed after the failed Beer Hall Putsch of November 8-9, 1923, was widelyquoted as saying \"Hitler will dance, but it is I who plays the tune. . . . Donot mourn for me, for I will have influenced history more than any other(lerman.\" 22Eckart—it will be no shock to learn—was an occultist. An intimate of the ThuleSociety, he was as well versed in its beliefs (and, hence,of those of the Germanenordeti) as any other member. I le was also an earlyadmirer of the weird cosmological theories of Hans Hbrbiger, and introduced themto his Austrian corporal. His cozy relationship with both Rosenberg and Hesswould have provided fertile ground lor any number of wide-reaching discussionson mystical subjects. It has even been claimed that Eckart and Hitler attendedseances in which ghostly ectoplasmic forms were seen; but, alas, there is noevidence fbi this. 23There is evidence, however, that Eckart was approached by none other than theeminent occultist Rudolf Steiner himself. Sterner was interested in forming analliance with Eckart as the latter was known to be a mystic and as Steiner hadhis own politico-mvstical agenda. During the \"troubles\" of the spring of 191 c), Steiner sought out Eckafl in an attempt to get coverage for his \"ThreefoldCommonwealth\" idea in the pages of Eckart's Aufgut Deutsch, an attempt that wasdoomed to failure. Eckart considered himself a \"Christian mystic\" And spurnedSteiner's advances as a result of the latter s membership in the OTO, attackingSteiner in articles published in his newspaper in July and December, 1919.According to Eckart, Steiner was a crazed sex magician and a member of theJewish-Masonic conspiracyAn article, written by Alfred Rosenberg and published almost a war afterEckart's death, asserts that Eckart was steeped in the lore of ancient India andwas as well versed in the mystical concepts of Maya and Atman as he was in thepoetry of Goethe and the philosophy of Schopenhauer and Angelus Silesius. Thisis extremely relevant, for it shows that Eckart believed in the idea of CosmicConsciousness (Atman) and in the concept that the visible, tangible world isillusion (Maya). The term \"atman\" has also been used, and abused, by a varietyof occultists to mean a higher Self and to refer to the next stage m humanevolution, which was, of course, virtually a strategic goal of the Nazis and atenet of their basic beliefs. The eulogy also describes another crucial elementof Nazi ideology, and that is the alleged usurpation by the Jews ofChristianity; for Rosenberg mentions that the Jewish Jehovah is corrupting the\"so-called Christian churches.\" 2 I his is an essential part of the Nazi mythosthat we will return to m a later chapter.As for Eckart himself, most histories give him very little print space. Hisinfluence over Hitler is downplayed, perhaps owing to the factthat there is insufficient documentation of the type needed to expand upon theirrelationship. Yet, for the last three years of his life, Eckart was Hitler'sconstant companion and the man who helped propel him into the public spotlight.It was Eckart who first introduced Hitler to all the right people, to thewealthy and powerful movers and shakers of Bavaria. Eckart clearly groomedHitler for the role he was later to play and spent those three yearsorchestrating his rise to power. It was Eckart who helped arrange financing forthe nascent Nazi Party from European and American industrialists, includingHenry Ford. And it was Eckart who, along with Rosenberg, accompanied Hitler toUpper Bavaria with fifteen hundred Storm Troopers to \"liberate\" the town ofCoburg from the Reds in what was arguably Hitler's first real military victory.Hitler's popularity and influence in Germany was growing at a speed that musthave amazed Hitler himself, considering that only a few years earlier he hadbeen cold and hungry, living on charity. But his anti-Communist, anti-Capitalistplatform was winning him converts from all over Germany's political spectrum.The old guard— those members of Germany's defeated army that came home to findtheir nation unrecognizable, in shreds from the hundreds of wars taking placebetween dozens of private armies and political parties, and in absolute economicchaos—drank in Hitler's speeches like cool steins of draft in the very beercellars where the Nazi Party met. And on February 24, 1920—at the meeting duringwhich his Twenty-Five Point program for saving Germany was proclaimed,introduced by Marc Sesselmann (a Thulist and member of the DAP)—he told themwhat they wanted to hear: that the war was lost because of Capitalists,Communists, Freemasons, and the ever-present bugaboo, international Jewry, whichwas behind them all. That the Germans were enslaved by punitive interestpayments. That swift and violent action was needed if Germany was to be snatchedfrom the jaws of a satanic conspiracy. The speech was welcomed by thunderousapplause from the approximately two thousand listeners, and the die of the NaziParty was cast.At this time the Protocols of the Elders of Zion was being widely disseminated,and raising alarms about a grand conspiracy of Jews and Freemasons bent ondestroying Germany as they were at that moment destroying Russia. If Hitler werein power, his listeners believed, hewould throw out all these undesirable elements—by force of arms, ifnecessary—and the country would be right again. Of course, subtractall the Capitalists, Communists, Freemasons, and Jews from the population (andeventually all the Christians) and one wonders who would remain.Eine Arte Menschenopfer (A Kind of Human Sacrifice)As Hitler was tramping around Germany, raising consciousness and gatheringrecruits, a secret organization within the Ehrhardl Freikorps Brigade wasitching for revolution. They eventually carried out (on June 24, 1922) the mostfamous assassination of the era, one that is still remembered today by those wholived through it, as Americans remember where they were when Kennedy waskilled/' The society was called Organization Consul and its members includedErwin Kern, Hermann Fischer, Ernst von Salomon, and Ernst-Werner Techow.Organization Consul was a terrorist cell within the Ehrhardl Brigade, dedicatedto carrying out bombings and assassinations against leftist targets and\"Versailles\" politicians, i.e., the \"November criminals\" who were believed tohave sold Germany down the river at the Armistice and later at the VersaillesPeace Conference. While the Freikorps marched openly and provocatively throughthe streets, their brothers in Organization Consul stuck to the alleys.Their target for June 1922 was none other than Walther Rathenau, foreignminister of the Weimar Republic. Rathenau's father had founded what later becameAEG, Germany's version of (reneral Electric, by purchasing Edison's patents onthe electric light bulb. Rathenau himself, a sensitive, artistic soul who becameenmeshed in high finance, industry, and politics almost against his will (he was.1 lover of poetry and music who had written volumes of aphorisms under .1pseudonym) was Jewish. But that was not his only crime. 1 le was also wealthy,admired, powerful, and a man with far-ranging vision. Ik-had virtuallysingle-handedly ensured that Germany would he able to wage a continuous warunder the Kaiser by arranging to bring all of Germany's raw materials undercentralized control in 1914. He hadsuccessfully negotiated the famous Treaty of Rapallo with the Soviet Union whenFrance was frantically trying to isolate Germany from the European communityafter the war. He had written books describing the political and culturalsituation in Germany with insight and wit. In short, he was a man of manyaccomplishments and, what is more, a sympathetic and elegant figure whom eventhe conspirators admitted \"unites in himself everything in this age that is ofvalue in thought, in honor, and in spirituality.\" 27So naturally these Freikorps thugs were committed to his destruction.We might not be discussing Rathenau at this point were it not for a peculiarphenomenon surrounding his death that is referred to by historian Norman Cohn.Of course, the Freikorps (and particularly the Ehrhardt Brigade, as we haveseen) was heavily influenced by vol-kisch and other Pan-German occultism. And itwas the Ehrhardt Brigade, remember, that marched into Munich that May Day in1919 wearing the swastika as their symbol and singing the hakenkreuz hymn.But Rathenau was identified with the most legendary conspiracy of all time, andwas numbered among its members in the crazed imaginations of desperate men.Walther Rathenau, they believed, was one of the actual Elders ofZion. Hisassassination would be a blow against the internationalJewish/Masonic/Communist/Capitalist cabal to dominate the world. He did unite inhimself all those qualities and values recognized by the Organization Consulitself, and thereby symbolized the success of the Zionist conspiracy.Therefore, according to Cohn:. . . Rathenau was not simply assassinated as an Elder of Zion, he was offeredup as a human sacrifice to the sun-god of ancient Germanic religion. The murderwas timed to coincide with the summer solstice; and when the news was published,young Germans gathered on hilltops to celebrate simultaneously the turning ofthe year and the destruction of one who symbolized the powers of darkness. 28In later years, Ernst Rohm would deliver a eulogy at the graves of two of theassassins, saying that their spirit \"is the spirit of the SS, Himmler's blacksoldiers.\" 2 ' ;The Occult Messiah <)7The human sacrifice of Walther Rathenau—timed to occur on a pagan holiday or\"sabbath\" that was observed by Nazi cultists throughout Germany—was the signalthat the new Aryan faith was increasing in strength. It certainly must haveseemed thai way to Hitler.The Liberation of Co burgWith Eckart and now Rosenberg at his side, Hitler strode all over Germany likean avenging angel on a budget, seeking out targets of opportunity. With himcould be counted upon a contingent of six hundred oddly dressed former FreeKorps men who had sworn an oath of loyalty to the cause, a kind of bodyguardthat was now known as the dreaded SA, the Sturmabteilung, the brown-shirtedStorm Troopers.The SA at this time was dressed in a motley of uniforms, many with patched andmismatched clothing, but their unifying symbol, of course, was the swastika,which they wore as armbands and which they flew as black-red-white flags after adesign approved by 1 liiler. 1 he\\ were also accompanied by a brass band thatplayed rousing marches ai every public meeting of the Nazi Party and, at theevent scheduled tor Coburg, even had a van full of beefy Bavarians in lederhosenand alpenstocks for a little local color . . . and brute force.Hitler himself had presided over very little actual armed conflict up to thistime, but was ready for battle when they reached the town of Coburg in UpperBavaria on October 14, 1922, for a \"< ierman \\)a\\\" celebration. This time, theywere met with opposition in the form of a crowd of anti-Nazis of variouspersuasions who began by jeering and shouting epithets, calling the Nazismurderers and criminals, aik\\ who proceeded very shortly to throw rocks at themarching Storm Troopers.Hitler gave a signal with his whip, and the Troopers fell upon the crowd withmerry and reckless abandon. (Hitler had often pictured himself as Christthrowing the money-changers out of the temple, and the whip was his favoriteweapon at this time. Even Eckafl was growing tired of it, and began to thinkthat maybe his protege utrifle insane.) The hostile crowd was forced back, and the march continued, butthe talk on the street was that the Communists had only fallen back to regroupand that a major confrontation would take place in twenty-four hours.The following day, in spite of a call to all leftists to throw out the Nazis,Hitler—who anticipated a full-scale battle with an opposition numbering close toten thousand, and whose own SA contingent (swollen with newly arriving membersand converts) now numbered only fifteen hundred—found himself greeted insteadwith wild approval by the people of Coburg and surprisingly the rest of the daypassed without conflict. Hitler—-his friends the poet-mystic Eckart and thearchitect-mystic Rosenberg in tow—had actually liberated the town of Coburg.And now they were ready for the rest of Germany.The Combination of Stellar InfluencesIn a letter written to Hitler by a female admirer in Munich a little over amonth before the famous Beer Hall Putsch of November 1923, the future leader ofGermany was advised of certain astrological predictions made by Frau ElsbethEbertin, the dowager empress of an impressive line of German astrologers whoseinnovative techniques are still employed today in Europe and America. The authorbelieves that this is the first time that the entire letter has been publishedin English translation:Munich, 30 September 1923Highly honored Mr. Hitler,Allow me, as an old member and a fanatical adherent of your movement, to pointout to you a matter that would surely interest you. I have in front of me a workof an expert of scientific astrology who is famous and popular in all ofGermany, E. Ebertin Publishers, 1914.The following is an excerpt of the article in question. No name is given in thearticle, but it can only be your esteemed person who is referred to therein(Ebertin, p. 54).\"A fighter born on April 20, 1889, at whose birth the sun stood at 29° of Aries,might, by his all too daring actions, place himself in dangerand possibly soon contribute to the impetus which will start the stone rolling.\"According to the stellar constellations the man must definitely be takenseriously and is destined for the role of a leader in future struggles.\"It almost seems as if he whom I have in mind has been chosen by fate, underthis strong influence of Aries, to sacrifice himself for the German people andto bear everything courageously and bravely; even if it should be a matter oflife and death; but at the least to give the impetus to a German liberationmovement, which then will erupt quite suddenly in an elementary way.\"However, I don't want to preempt late. Time will tell, but as things are goingat the time of my writing they cannot continue!\"The German people can only come to itself again in the political and religiousfield through some spiritual leaders sent by God, namely by the agency ofindividuals who believe in God and have a cosmological sensitivity, and who areabove party polities, several of whom I have discovered among April natives(that is to say only if the star constellations are favorable).\"Once the right point in time will have come, i.e., once the Versailles peacetreaty will have proved to be impossible to fulfill and will have beenoverturned, then the stars—which are now still shining in hidden places—willbeautifully appear as shining meteors, similar to the heavenly bodies which arenow newly discovered or become visible etc. etc.You must forgive me if I could not help but inform you of the foregoing.Most respectfully, Heil undSig! Most devotedly,Maria 1 leiden, MunichThis author felt it worthwhile to quote the entire text as it illustrates boththe self-professed \"fanatical\" devotion of the letter writer as well as thepolitical sentiments of Frau Ebertin at this time. Frau Heiden quoted thecomments from Ebertin's own book of predictions, Ein Blick in die Zukunfi (AGlimpse into the Future) lor the year 1 ( * which was published in July of 1923.it was brought to Hitler's .men tion by a number of other admirers as well, and1 rati Ebertin herself sent a copy of her book to the Nazi newspaper,Vtilkischer Beobachter. . . but according to Ebertin her predictions only served to irritate theFiihrer. 31 Hitler was not one who was willing to believe that his fate was outof his hands and written in the indelible ink of the stars, at least not when hefelt he had the future—and Germany's—in his grasp, as he did that September of1923.But it all came to an end with the failed Munich Beer Hall Putsch of November1923. An ill-planned and poorly executed attempt to take over the Bavariangovernment by force resulted in a major setback for the Party. Hitler wasarrested; Hess—who had escaped to Austria—was being sought by the authoritiesand would eventually surrender himself; and Dietrich Eckart—Hitler's mentor andprotector and the man who midwifed the Nazi Party into prominence—died atHitler's mountain retreat, Berchtesgaden, on December 26 of that year, hisprotege in prison but his optimism unbounded. Eckart knew where Hitler washeaded, because it was he who had pushed him in the right direction.To rebut those who claim that Eckart's influence and effect on Hitler was notrelevant, one merely has to indicate the memorial services that were held everyyear in his honor by the Nazi Party, including the lavish ceremony on December26, 1933 (the year Hitler came to power); the monument put up over his grave inBerchtesgaden; the eulogies written for him by such important contemporaries asRosenberg (who would later become enormously influential in the Third Reich);and the speeches made on the anniversary of his death by such men as Baldur vonSchirach (the head of Hitler Youth). Hitler owed a great deal to Eckart, and theevidence left behind shows that he knew and understood that; after all, thefinal words of Mein Kampf show that Hitler's infamous memoir was dedicated tohim.A Mark, a Yen, a Buck, or a Pound . . .Another contribution of Eckart, and one that is frequently missed even by OCCullhistorians, is his connection with I lenrv lord.I ( Lin was approached by agents of the American automobile man ufacturer .isearly as \\ ( )2() 1921. lord was a notorious anti-Semite,and had actually written a book— The International Jew —which was enormouslypopular in Germany where a German-language versionwith the title The Eternal Jew was a best-seller. Hitler had read it beforewriting Mein Kampf, and some authors insist that whole S tions of Hitler'smemoir were lifted, practically verbatim, from Ford's book.'2 Hitler even had apicture of lord hanging in his office at Part) headquarters (the Brown House)and stacks of The Eternal lew piled up on a desk outside along with other Naziliterature. (Consider the surreal nature of that image. Imagine ousted Ugandandictator Idi Amin with a framed portrait of Lee [acocca . . .) It is worthwhileto note that the German publisher of The Eternal Jew (as well as of an earlyGerman edition of the Protocols of the Elders ofZion) was none other thanTheodor Fritsch, the man who (bunded the Germanenor-den in 1912 for which theThule Society served as a front. (See (lhap-ter Two.)The support of Henry Ford was vital to the survival of the N.1/1 Party in theearly days, and one of Hitlers proudest achievements. 1 le would award thatquintessential American with the highest Nazi honor it was possible to bestow toa non-German, the (irand ()ross ol the Supreme Order of the German Eagle, in1938. He was the first American and only the fourth person to be given theaward. And why not? Even Baldur von Schirach would credit Henry Ford's writingsfor having converted him to anti-Semitism. An earlier recipient ol the award wasBenito Mussolini that same year.Thus it was Eckart who handled some ol these early cash contributions from HenryFord, and Eckart who, among others, dealt directly with the Ford representativesin Germany. As we continue along in our catalogue of this century's mostunspeakable evil we must pause now and again to fully appreciate the depths towhich some honored American heroes— industrialists, after all, like Ford;suentisis. engi neers, and technicians—have stink, a\\\\c\\ to resurrect thesememories (no matter how painful or simply distastelul) tor they are crucial to afull understanding of who we are and of how we came to this mip.isse. Eckart,the drug-addicted occultist, raust, anti-Semite, and borderline psychopath asHenrv lord's bag man and 1 iitler's Bebc Rebozo, is one of those trafficaccidents of history that merit .i lew moments ol silent contemplation.Money, connections, ideology. Perhaps no single other human would come to exertthat type of influence over Hitler until Hanussen, the psychic and astrologerwho honed Hitler's public-speaking skills . . . and who performed occult ritualson Hitler's behalf. As Eckart's ghost piped an infernal melody from beyond thegrave, Hitler would indeed dance; and in that danse macabre Hanussen would lead.HanussenIn the last days of 1932, Hitler was contemplating suicide.Released from prison in 1924 after the Beer Hall Putsch got him a light sentencefor what was, after all, high treason, his Mein Kampfd, best-seller, and hisNazi Party back and stronger than ever, he nonetheless was losing ground in theReichstag. Hindenberg—the much-respected and very popular president of theRepublic—was not pleased with the rough-and-tumble crowd that seemed to composeHitler's voting bloc, and various ministers were conspiring against Hitler tokeep him out of government altogether.In 1932, they were succeeding. Hitler was facing a crucial election. Members ofthe Nazi Party were in danger of defecting to other political organizations. Hisown trusted disciples were dividing the Party into warring factions that couldnot be controlled.And on Halloween night—the pagan Sabbath of Samhain—his mistress Eva Braun shotherself.Although Eva survived what the doctors would later characterize as a serioussuicide attempt, Hitler himself knew he was politically dead. It appeared as ifhe had lost the will to fight, and he began to speak more and more of his owndeath. He entered the political campaign a distracted, depressed leader whoseemed unable to hold his fractious Party together. They lost heavily in theReichstag five days later— losing seats to the hated Communists—and the pressbegan publishing the Party's obituary.At this nadir of his career, he turned to an old friend whom he had met yearsearlier, in 1926, in Berlin. This was Erik Jan Hanussen, a famous astrologer andmaster of several occult disciplines who had—itwas said—taught Hitler even-thing from the body language and c tures to use inpublic speaking to what friends and associates he should cultivate.The Viennese Hanussen—whose real name was Herschcl Stein-schneider, the son of aJewish vaudeville performer—began his career as what Americans call a \"carny,\"doing odd jobs in a traveling circus, until he began his own newspaper andthreatened to publish vile things in it about people he knew unless they paidup! This small-time blackmailer soon became interested in hypnosis andmediumship and published several books on the subject, eventually becoming thedarling of the international socialite set, a man who never failed to entertainat parties but who also provided more serious assistance to those of his hostswho needed a horoscope drawn up or a spell cast. 1 le dved his hair blond to fithis new persona as a Danish aristocrat, and dived into the frantic, headyatmosphere of early 1930s Berlin competing with astrologers, clairvoyants, andmediums of ever)' description. Although he had never cast Hitler's astrologicalchart before, now in the late days of 1932 with Hitler morose and on the vergeof doing himself damage, Hanussen erected his natal and probably a transit orpro gressed chart and appeared before Hitler with an eerie prognosis.Hanussen told his host that there were good times ahead, hut that a few\"obstacles\" remained that had to be eliminated. The implication was oddlysurreal. The \"obstacles\" were not actual people or circumstances. Instead,Hanussen claimed, Hitler was the victim ot some sort of hex or magical spell. 33History has not recorded who might have been responsible lor this, and it ispossible that all Hanussen knew—or claimed—was that \"evil occult influences\"were around Hitler, causing him to lose his edge. We may fantasize about a lodgeof German magicians, summoning angelic forces to thwart the attempts of Hitlerand his Nazi Party to gain power in Germany. We may wonder if a witch orsorcerer— operating alone in some mountain fastness in the Obersalzberg,perhaps—was casting a spell against Hitler for something as relatively trivialas a broken promise or unrequited love, and thereby altering the course ofEuropean history forever. We will certainly ulwv know the actual dimensions ofthis baneful influence around the liihrer. but the outcome of Hanussen'smeditations was nothing short of special ular.In order to rid himself of this evil spell, he said, one would have to go toHitler's hometown. At the time of the full moon. At midnight. In a butcher'sbackyard.And remove a mandrake from the ground.Now a mandrake is the man-shaped root famous throughout European folklore forits occult and medicinal properties. According to some traditions, one had tostop one's ears with cloth or cotton before pulling the root from the earth, asit would emit a piercing scream that would shatter the eardrums. A dog wassometimes used to pull the root from the earth as the magician kept his handsclasped around his own ears. The resulting shriek—it is said—normally killed thedog.The mandrake is also known for its powers as an aphrodisiac, and as an amulet ofprotection. We must assume that Hanussen was thinking of this last property inconnection with Hitler. Also, the significance of the butcher's yard should notbe ignored: such a place would have given the surrounding earth the peculiarquality of a veritable Teutonic orgy of blood, dismemberment, death, and pain,which would have been mystically absorbed by the root itself.Hanussen decided to perform the necessary rituals himself and set off forHitler's birthplace in Austria, returning on New Year's Day 1933 with theamuletic root and with a prediction: that Hitler's return to power would beginon January 30, a date roughly equivalent to the pagan Sabbath of Oimelc: one ofthe four \"cross-quarter\" days of the witches' calendar.It seemed an outrageous prediction but—after a series of bizarre coincidencesand half-baked conspiratorial machinations on the part of his opponents—Hitlerwent from washed-up political has-been to chancellor of Germany with dizzyingspeed in thirty days and, on January 30, 1933, he assumed power.Hanussen s impossibly optimistic prediction came true to the day.That was not the end of Hanussen's ability to predict the future, however, foron February 26 of that same year—during a seance held that evening at his ownlavishly furnished \"Palace of Occultism\" on Lietzenburger Strasse and attendedby Berlin's movers and shakers—he predicted that the Communists in Germany wouldattempt arevolution, signaled by the destruction (by fire) of an important go>ernment building/'The next day, the Reichstag was in dames and Hitler had all the excuse he neededto go from chancellor of Germany to Ftthrer of the Third Reich. European historyhad been changed forever, and once more the Society Seer was right on target.But, six weeks later in April of 1933, Hanussen would be dead; murdered in aforest outside Berlin by agent or agents unknown. There was speculation thaiHitler 01 dered the execution since Hanussen \"knew too much' 1 or perhaps mighteven have had connections to the Communist Party (hence Ins accurate predictionof the Reichstag fire; some mediums and psychics—and Hanussen was noexception—are known to \"enhance\" their abilities by gathering intelligence ontheir clients ahead of time or by bugging the rooms in which seances are held,etc. In fairness. however, no amount of dirty tricks could have explained 1[anussen's accurate prediction of Hitler's enormous success in January). Anotherversion had it that Hanussen's murder enraged the Filhrer, and thai he orderedthe death sentence for its perpetrator, Karl Ernst, who was executed during theRohm purge with a bewildered \"1 leil I lit lei' on his lips. 3S Another story,that SA leader Count Wolf Heinrich von Helldorf had Ernst arrest and murderHanussen because the count owed him money, is also current/ 0 Hanussen was saidto have thrown orgies at the count's Wannsee villa, where attractive youngladies— usually \"actresses\"—were thrown into hypnotic trances and made to mimeorgasms. The count was a rather degenerate sort who went through money likeschnapps, and wound up owing a greai deal to Hanussen, who carried the count'smarkers with him wherever he went. Needless to say, the markers were never found(which either proves that the count killed Hanussen and removed the [OUs fromthe body, or that the story is completely fictitious and never happened; takeyour pick).And then, of course, Hanussen's father was Jewish, which would have been reasonenough to execute the inordinately influential seer. Unfortunately, we willnever know what happened, for I lanussen died as he had lived: the Count St.Germain of Weimar and early Nazi Germany, a complete and compelling mystery.The Master of the Sidereal PendulumAnother occultist in Hitler's inner circle was the Thulist, astrologer, andpendulum expert Wilhelm Gutberlet (born 1870). Gutberlet first comes to thehistorian's attention as a shareholder in the Volkischer Beobachter,Sebottendorff's former newspaper. Franz Eher Verlag was a publishing companythat Sebottendorff purchased in 1918 for about five thousand Reichsmarks (RM).It consisted of a newspaper, the Miin-chener Beobachter, that had ceasedpublication with the death of its founder in June. Sebottendorff picked it upand moved its offices to the Thule meeting rooms at the Four Seasons Hotel,turning it into an anti-Semitic organ that was eventually taken over—after aseries of intervening ownerships by other parties—by the German Workers' Partyafter Sebottendorff left Munich. In 1920, Wilhelm Gutberlet owned shares worth10,000 RM, or about 8.5 percent of the total value of the paper. It was renamedthe Volkischer Beobachter, and as such became infamous as the propaganda machineof the Nazi Party.As mentioned, Gutberlet was a Thulist. He was also one of Hitler's earliestfollowers. A medical doctor, he was present at the first meeting of the GermanWorkers' Party that Hitler attended and had remained a close friend andconfidant since then. In other words, since 1919.Gutberlet virtually disappears from most official accounts of the Nazi Partyuntil he reappears in Schellenberg's memoirs. Walter Schel-lenberg was chief ofthe Foreign Intelligence section of the SD (Sicher-heitsdienst or SecurityService), and survived the war to write about his experiences as spymaster inEurope. According to Schellenberg:Hitler's racial mania was one of his characteristic features. I discussed thisseveral times with Dr. Gutbarlett [sic], a Munich physician who belonged to theintimate circle around Hitler. Gutbarlett believed in the \"sidereal pendulum,\"an astrological contraption, and claimed that this had given him the power tosense at once the presence of any Jews or persons of partial Jewish ancestry,and to pick them out in any group of people. Hitler availed himself of (.utbarlett's mystic power and had many discussions with him on racial questions.Thus, in Gutberlet, we have an occultist, a Thulist, an astrologer, aracist, a pendulum expert, and a confidant ol 1 litlei, all wrapped intoone. The matter of the \"sidereal pendulum\" itself will conic up in a laterchapter, but for now we can agree that Gutberlet's Influence over Hitler'sthinking must have been profound, for the Flihrer himself constantly ridiculedthe volkisch occult groups in his official speeches . . . while secretlysoliciting their advice and counsel away from the prying eyes of both the pressand the superstitious Christian public. And it is revealing to know thatGutberlet, the astrologer and mystic, was consulted by Hitler on racial mattersas well as on mystical subjects, thus providing additional evidence—albeitcircumstanti.il thai Hitler's racism was fueled by his occultism.List, Liebenfels, Eckart, Hanussen, Gutberlet. These are only five of the manyoccultists whose influence surrounded the Flihrer from his early days as an artstudent to his last days as leader of a ruined nation. To complete the story, wehave to investigate Haushofcr, 1 less, Himmler and many others for—as the Reichconsolidated and became more powerful—other occult lodges in Germany were activeand were seen to pose a threat to the new regime. While drawing upon some of thesame traditions as the Order of New Templars, the Germanenor-den, and the ThuleSociety—Eastern religions, weird rituals associated with astrology andmythology, sexual formulas for becoming powerful and casting spells—they hadother associations which made them suspect.#4#The Order of the Templeof the East: Sex, Spies,and Secret SocietiesHeydrich was informed about the smallest detail of Hitler s private life. He sawevery diagnosis made by Hitler's doctors and knew of all his strange andabnormal pathological inclinations. . . . They showed that Hitler was so ruledby the daemonic forces driving him that he ceased to have thoughts of normalcohabitation with a woman. The ecstasies of power in every form were sufficientfor him}SCHELLENBERGThe Silly SeasonThe British sometimes call periods of chaos in which the unpredictable alwaysseems to happen the \"silly season.\" Certainly, the years between the two worldwars constituted a Silly Season for Europe. In 1920, Aleister Crowley startedhis ill-fated occult commune in Cefalu, Sicily, at the same time that D.H.Lawrence's novel Women in Love was published. In October, V)ll, as Hitler\"marched\" on Coburg, Mussolini and his black-shirted Fascists marched on Rome.(One of their first official acts will be to ban occult orders and secretsocieties.) On December 16, 1 c )22, the partners in archaeology Howard Carterand Lord Carnarvon officially opened King Tut's tomb, thus instigating aworldwide fad of everything Egyptian and simultaneously giving birth to thelegend of the Mummy's Curse. That same year, the Necronomicon made its sinisterdebut in the pages of Weird Tales magazine. A year later— inspired byMussolini's success in Italy—Hitler will attempt his own putsch in Munich, andrail.By the end of 1923, Hitler was stewing in Landsberg Prison, writing Mein Kampfwith the help of his good friends Rudolf Hess and It. Bernhard Stempfle, andenjoying a little geopolitical input from Professor Karl Haushofer.The EntourageWe will discuss Father Stempfle in more detail in Chapter Five, and RudolfHess's flight to England (and its occult ramifications) will beanalyzed fully in Chapter Nine. But a few words about both 1 less And Haushoferand their relationship to the Fiihrer will do well here.Rudolf Hess was an early confidant and friend of Hitler, one ot his fewcoconspirators arrested after the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. 1 less acted asHitler's secretary while they both served prison terms. It was Hess whotranscribed Hitler's dreary memoir Mein Kampf. From all accounts, Hess wassomething of a puppy dog around men like 1 lit let and Haushofer: blindly loyal,eager for any scrap of attention or .it fection, and fanatically devoted tothese personalities (to a greater degree than to the ideas they represented).But he adopted their ideologies as his own, and ran with them as far as hecould. 1 less was the type of man that Hitler seemed to enjoy most, for Hesswould never disagree with him; rather, he lived for every word that fell fromthe Fiihrer's mouth.Once the Nazis gained power in Germany—nine years after the Putsch—Hess becameHitler's right-hand man, ahead of all other Nazis and next in line in successionto the Fiihrer's throne. He wasone of the signers of the infamous Nuremberg Laws, which deprived Jews of theirGerman citizenship and which paved the way for the Holocaust. Naive, credulous,and always ready for a new faith to believe in—as long as it didn't interferewith his love affair with the Fiihrer—Hess was easily influenced by a widevariety of astrologers and occultists and read avidly anything having to do withEastern mysteries and the power of the mind. He had been an intimate of theThule Society along with Eckart and Rosenberg, and his wife was as mysticallyinclined as he was. But in 1933 Hess found himself in a position of great powerin Germany; his easy access to Hitler made him very popular with the wheelersand dealers in the Party, men with their own (usually hidden) agendas.Among the latter could be counted Professor Karl Haushofer and his son,Albrecht. Hess had studied under Haushofer at the University of Munich and hadbrought the geopolitician to Hitler's attention while they were both servingtime in Landsberg. Although there is still a great deal of controversy over justwho influenced whom with regard to the Hess Affair, it is likely that theHaushofers had something to do with Hess's flight to England and thatastrological advice (as well as what was essentially a conspiracy against theFiihrer) also played an important role.Hess had been a keen student of Haushofer (1869-1946), the inventor ofLebensraum, at the University of Munich. Professor Haushofer, a general in theKaiser's army who had spent considerable time in the Far East as militaryattache for the German government and who could speak and write Japanesefluently, was believed to have been initiated into some secret society or otherin Asia. This story of Haushofer's occult initiation has appeared several times,most notably in Le matin des magiciens by Pauwels and Bergier, 2 and hissurviving son Heinz has denied it vigorously. However, some evidence does existthat Haushofer had an abiding interest in astrology and even claimed a certaindegree of clairvoyance. It is certain that Haushofer eventually came to wieldconsiderable power in the Third Reich, through both his Deutsche Akademie andthe Institut fur Geopolitik at the University of Munich—a kind of thinktank-cum-intelligence agency—of which he was director. His early associationswith influential Japanese businessmen and statesmen were crucial in forming theGerman-Japanesealliance of World War II. He was also the first high-ranking Nazi to formimportant relationships with South American governments in anticipation ofmilitary and political action against the United Stales, relationships thatwould eventually be exploited by war criminals— and Nazi cultists—fleeing thereach of the Nuremberg prosecutors.In Hess he found an adoring, fawning student and true believer (lor whom heactually had rather little respect) and 1 less wasted no time in bringing theprofessor to the attention of Hitler at Landsberg Prison, where the three ofthem discussed Haushofer's Lebensraum concept and other ideas concerning globalpolities.Haushofer deserves an entire book to himself and, indeed, the amount ofavailable documentation on his life and work is considerable, so we shall not gointo it here. It is enough for our purposes to say that, until he dropped out offavor, Haushofer was 1 litler s most valuable political and military adviser,responsible for many foreign policy coups. His Deutsche Akademie had branchesall over the world—including the United States—where information on localography, economics, politics, military preparedness, food supplies, industrialcapability, cultural affairs, media influence, etc was collected and analyzed byteams of well-paid professional scholars, engineers, meteorologists, historians,psychologists, agricultural specialists, m\\c\\ advisers in virtually every aspectof human life. Blended with all of this otherwise scientific informationgathering was a heavy dose of astrology, mysticism, and occultism which causedHaushofer, geopolitics, and the German Academy to be ridiculed in the worldpress . , . even as many governments were trying to set up geopoliticalinstitutes of their own.But it is the Lebensraum policy for which 1 laushofer is generally known in theshort histories of the war that can be found in any library. Lebensraum—literally \"living room\"—is the doctrine that gave Hitler the \"right\" to seek toexpand the Reich as far as possible into neighboring countries, seizing the landand deporting (or exterminating) the local residents and replacing them withGermans. It was a doctrine that was adopted enthusiastically by the Japanese,who v. Haushofer's close friends, and which gave them the ideological basis fortheir invasion of China, the Pacific, and Southeast Asia, Lebens-raum was thesimple statement of policy which said that a sovereign nation, to ensure thesurvival of its people, had a right to annex theterritory of other sovereign nations to feed and house itself Japan wascertainly a nation that could appreciate this idea, crowded as it is on a set ofrather small islands that is poor in natural resources and which has to importnearly everything it needs to survive. The Lebensraum concept was crucial toHaushofer's general theory of \"geopolitics\" and was embraced by Hitler in thoseearly days in Landsberg Prison. After all, if an esteemed professor at theUniversity of Munich, and a former statesman and military theoretician for theKaiser at that, said Germany would be justified in expanding its nationalboundaries at the expense of other nations, it was tantamount to a seal ofapproval from the intelligentsia for Hitler's wilder ambitions.If the patient reader remembers what was broached in Chapter One concerning theideas of Michel Foucault, it may be perceived that Haushofer's concept ofLebensraum is a manifestation of the \"sexuality\" impulse as an implement ofnational policy. While wars of conquest were conducted in the old days forreligious reasons, or for sheer glory, or to avenge an insult real or imagined,Haushofer put forward the idea of \"living room\" as a kind of natural law thattranscended sovereign boundaries and national agendas: the necessary expansionof a human population into whatever space could be found to feed and house it.Lebensraum was not presented as a plan of mass murder or as a weapon of the willof an individual despot, but as the natural expression of the need of a peoplefor \"living room\": i.e., for the survival of an entire nation or race. In thatsense, Lebensraum was the twentieth-century \"sexual\" (to use Foucault's term)extension of Hitler's nineteenth-century \"sanguine\" Messiah-complex entailinghuman sacrifice. The twentieth century thus became the battleground of the\"blood\" versus \"sex\" ideologies, and when no means of accommodation could befound between the two impulses it was only natural that Haushofer—whoseLebensraum theory was a twisted version of the sex impulse—should later come todoubt Hitler and to actively plan to destroy him.After the flight of Hess to England, Haushofer came under attack from theFiihrer. Blamed for a baleful influence over I less thai contributed to Hitler losing his right-hand man and Jose companion Irom the olddays— his dear little Hesserl —Haushofer and his eldest son and colleague,Albrecht, rapidly fell out ol lavor with (he Reich.The Hess flight was seen as a debacle for Nazi Germany, causing allsorts of political problems for Hitler. He did not want Russia or Italy to thinkhe was making a separate peace with England, and his secret plan for the Russianinvasion (code-named Barbarossa) was known to Hess. If Barbarossa should berevealed to the English, all would be lost, for Hitler wrfj double-dealing, butwith the Soviet Union and not with England.Hitler quickly issued statements characterizing Hess as a sick individual with ahistory of mental problems; a strategy that was not entirely successful, for theman in the street wondered why Mess had remained the second most powerful man inGermany for so long if he was insane? Hitler also ordered the suppression of allfortune-telling practices and establishments, including astrology, palm- andtea-reading, seances, and the like on the assumption that occultists hadbrainwashed Hess into committing this treasonous act. Everyone knew that Hesstook astrology and the occult arts very seriously, so this seemed to be alogical step to take. This \"occult conspiracy\" angle would he thoughtfullyexamined by elements of British Intelligence, which would consider usingAleister Crowley as a tool in an occult counu fensive. (See Chapter Nine.)Many historians have pointed to this general ban on occultism as evidence thatHitler did not believe in the black arts. They also Lite references against thevblkisch secret societies in a leu of his speeches as further proof that theFiihrer was—even if somewhat insane —not as crazy as the stargazers ordemon-summoners. However, as anyone who has had anything at all to do withoccult societies knows very well, the internecine warfare that takes place amongoccultists at every level of sophistication is furious, spiteful, and altogethernasty. I he stories about Crowley's own \"magical war\" with his mentor, MacGregor Mathers, are well known, as are many of the fights that took placebetween various French lodges of the nineteenth century (which can be consultedin Richard Cavendish's thoroughly enjoyable The Black Arts). 1 ' Occultists ingeneral have no difficulty distancing themselves—with appropriate invective andastral curses—from othei cultists with whom they disagree on philosophicalgrounds; and virtually even' \"serious occultist\" that the author has everencountered has had nothing but disdain for tea-leaf readers, palmists, andcut-rate astrologers. Thus, in light of the foregoing, the author finds nocontradiction at all in Hitler's fascination with occultism on the one hand andhis order to ban \"popular\" occult practices on the other.While Professor Karl Haushofer was not arrested or otherwise physically abused,his son Albrecht Haushofer was arrested and taken to Gestapo Headquarters at 8Prinz Albrechtstrasse, an address with a reputation as dire and forbidding tothe Germans as Dzerzhinsky Square and the Lubyanka are to the Russians. There hewas interrogated for days about his relationship to Hess and about how muchadvance knowledge he had concerning the flight. Albrecht survived thisinterrogation more or less intact, and was released. What Hitler and the Gestapodid not discover, however, was that Albrecht and his father had developedconnections to the German Resistance movement against Hitler. This would all betragically revealed a few years later when, after the failed July 1944assassination plot against Hitler in which Albrecht was a coconspirator,Professor Haushofer himself was sent to Dachau, the concentration campconveniently close (nine miles) to Munich where the Ahnenerbe-SS had someunusual interests. Son Albrecht was sent to prison, and later executed at thelast minute on the streets of Berlin as the city was falling to the Red Army.Upon the collapse of the Reich, Karl Haushofer was questioned by Alliedinvestigators working for the Nuremberg Tribunal eager to learn of hisrelationship with Hess, a relationship to which Haushofer— mourning theexecution of his eldest son—freely confessed. Before he could testify in opencourt against his old student and comrade, however, he committed suicide bytaking arsenic.The rest of Hitler's entourage included, of course, the pagan ideologue AlfredRosenberg (whom Hitler made head of the Nazi Party pro tern during his residencein Landsberg). Rosenberg—a native Bait with an abiding hatred of Soviets, Jews,and Freemasons—had appeared one day at Dietrich Eckart's apartment in Munich andoffered him his services as a \"fighter against Judah.\" The two soon becameinseparable and it is believed that it was Rosenberg who introduced Eckart tothe Protocols of the Elders ofZion. Rosenberg agitated for the creation of astate religion based on Odinic paganism and Teutonic magic, and could be reliedupon to appear at the meetings of every major Nordic, Teutonic, and Aryansociety in Germany both beforeand after the Nazis' seizure of power. It was Rosenberg who ordered thatFreemason temples in the Occupied Territories be looted by I m satz commandosand their contents shipped back to him in Berlin, an order cheerfully carriedout by Franz Six and Otto Ohlendorf, both men known for their abiding interestin cult activity. Rosenberg's Jose associate and fellow pagan, Richard WaltherDarre—a native of Ai gentina—was made Agriculture Minister of the Third Reichbill I hi re's interest was less in animal husbandry and crop rotation than itwas in the mystical doctrines of the runes and the Blood and Soil. We havecovered runic mysticism already; the Blood and Soil doctrine is too tedious toexamine thoroughly here but the reader can immediately grasp its essentials ifit is understood that, if it had been left up to Darre, pure-blooded Germanpeasants would have reverted to fornicating in the fields on Walpurgisnacht toensure fertility of the crops.The team of Rosenberg and Darre picked up in Nazi Germany where the team ofRosenberg and Eckart left off in Weimar. Rosenberg, with his impeccablecredentials dating back to the early days of the formation of the Nazi Party andits baptism of blood in the Beer Hall Putsch, was a high-profile Reichsleiterwith a blatantly pagan and anti-Christian philosophy, a philosophy whichreceived wide coverage in the German press. Darre was there to support thisplatform a\\k\\, if possible, to do him one better on occasion. Together, they ranaround the nation drumming up support for an official state religion based onthe worship of the Old Gods, a religion that included purifying the Aryan raceof elements that were in the process of polluting it and diluting the strengthof its Blood. To these True Believers, sex was .it once fascinating andrepellent; the danger of the Jews to the Aryan man and woman was theirsensuality, their ability to seduce the pure bloods away from their duty toprocreate only blue-eyed Teutons. The Jew was the Serpent in the pagan Garden ofEden.One pagan and occultist who was not bothered with sexuality, h< ever, and whomade it a cornerstone of his philosophy w.is the English magician andtabloid-crowned \"Wickedest rvlan in the World' (this, in the age of Mussolini,Hitler, and Stalin!): Aleister ( aowlev. ( row ley—whose life has been well andthoroughly discussed by a wide variety of authors, including himself—provides ussome entree intothe German occult scene of the 1920s and 1930s. Indeed, at one point Crowley wasactually roughed up by a roving Nazi SA gang in what is arguably the singledocumented instance of a good deed in the entire history of the Nazi Party: theStorm Troopers stopped Crowley from beating his girlfriend!Crowley will take us to such important German sex cultists as Theodor Reuss,Karl Germer, Eugene Grosche, Heinrich Tranker, and Marthe Kiintzel, not toforget the British Army officer Maj. Gen. C.F. Fuller, who was once a guest ofHitler himself at the latter's Berchtes-gaden retreat to celebrate the Flihrer'sfiftieth birthday on April 20, 1939; Fuller—an anti-Semite and contributor toOswald Moseley's Fascist Quarterly, a devoted Thelemite (that is to say,follower of Crowley's own religion) and an intimate of Crowley—was said to bethe \"only Englishman that Hitler actually liked.\" 4 Crowley will take us on atour of Leipzig, Munich, and the province of Thuringia, where a secretconvocation of German occultists was held in 1925 to determine the futureleadership of the Ordo Templi Orientis, the German sex-magic occult lodge thatwould eventually be suppressed by the Nazis, its members thrown into the camps.So, in order to understand what the \"subversive\" German sex cults were doing,and why, we must start with Aleister Crowley and what he was up to in Germany in1912.The Great BeastCrowley was born on October 12, 1875, in England, not far from the town ofStratford-on-Avon where Shakespeare was born and only a few weeks before BaronSebottendorff's own birth near Dresden that November. Raised in an oppressivelyfundamentalist Christian environment, he came early on to regard himself as theBeast of the Apocalypse, the one branded with a 666 and with the Whore ofBabylon for aid and comfort. He became an initiate of the Golden Dawn—thatfabulously complex jewel of European occultism—on November 18, 1898.The Golden Dawn had been created ten years earlier by the team of Mathers,Wesieott, and Woodman. As we have seen, ihe officialstory had it that the Golden Dawn was a branch of an order thai existed inGermany, and that a charter from the parent lodge had been granted to theEnglishmen horn a Iranian Anna Sprengel of Stuttgart. At the time that Crowleywas initiated into the Golden Dawn, that would have been accepted as truth andCrowlev would probably have believed that he was indeed being initiated intowhat was the British section of a German secret society. Since then, the Germanorigins of the Golden Dawn have been more or less demonstrated to be a hoax. Itis quite likely that the entire ritual and initiatory structure of the Dawn wasnothing less than the brilliant invention of Mathers himself, an invention forwhich, sadly, he could never claim credit since a major element in theattraction of occult societies rests on their having a long and distinguished—ifcovert and underground— pedigree.Interestingly enough, the degree structure of the Golden 1 )a\\\\ n was based onthe famous Tree of Life symbol: a complex diagram ot ten spheres connected by atotal of twenty-two paths (each path representing a letter of the Hebrewalphabet) that can be consulted in any one of a variety of books on qabalism andWestern occultism. This same Tree of Life diagram was used by the old WotanistGuido von Last to represent the hierarchical grace structure in his own idealAlio Germanic society and, like the Golden Dawn, he reserved the top threedegrees as being inaccessible to the average human being. (( tow ley, of course,would eventually assume all three after leaving the Golden Dawn and forming hisown organization, the A.\\.\\.\\.) It is entirely possible that List—writing aboutthese ideas in 1 c ) 1 1—had adopted this degree system from the Golden Dawn,which had put it to use as early as 1888 based on \"Anna SprengeTs\" instructions.It the only way in which List could have discovered this degree system waseither through initiation into the Golden Dawn or from another initiate who(breaking his oath of secrecy) described it to him. 1 hai the unregenerateanti-Semite and godfather of the Nazi Party, Guide von List, might have been aGolden Dawn initiate is an amusing it unsettling proposition but, thankfully,there is no evidence tor this. However, there was much communication takingplace at this time between England and Germany involving such occult celebrities.is Golden Dawn initiate Dr. R.W. Felkin (who was actually looking fbi FrauleinSprengel in Germany), Dr. HObbe-Schleiden (whom we metin Chapter One as the first president of the German branch of the TheosophicalSociety) and Dr. Rudolf Steiner (who was involved at this time with FranzHartmann's Masonic lodges as well as with the OTO). Felkin, intent on forginglinks with legitimate Rosicrucian lodges and acting under mediumisticsupervision of a discarnate Arab entity by the name of Ara Ben Shemesh, wasdesperately seeking Sprengel and hoped that either Htibbe-Schleiden or RudolfSteiner could assist in that regard. Needless to say, the search came to naught,but the fact of these three occultists communicating and exchanging informationon cult activities is provocative. 5Historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke opines that List got the idea of a Tree ofLife initiatory system from the inescapable Dr. Hartmann, who possibly heard ofit from the energetic Dr. Westcott. If so, we have the leaders of theArmanenschaft (List's name for his own secret society), the Golden Dawn, and theOTO exchanging details on their secret initiations. That List would have basedhis hierarchy on the patently Jewish Tree of Life and borrowed the concept fromthe Golden Dawn—by way of the OTO—would seem merely ironic to a layperson butpositively frightening to an occultist, for what it implies about therelationship between the anti-Semitic List organizations and the ostensiblyapolitical Golden Dawn and OTO lodges. In any event, List amended the qabalisticcorrespondences to suit himself and essentially developed his own—Aryan—versionof the Golden Dawn initiatory system. 6Another element of the Golden Dawn which is relevant to our case is that thestructure of many of its rituals, the peculiar language in which its invocationsare made, and the odd designs of many of the magic seals and insignia are allbased on a system of occult correspondences known as Enochian, and codifiedwithin the writings of Elizabethan mathematician, philosopher, and spy, Dr. JohnDee.Crowley would become so conversant with the \"Enochian\" language that he wouldtranslate medieval spirit conjurations into that tongue for use by his own cultmembers. Having its own alphabet and its own rules of grammar, its veryexistence is a technical impossibility: an artificially created languagedeveloped by one (or at most two) men in the sixteenth century, John Dee and hisassistant Edward Kelley. According to their story, it was given to them by anangel who communicated the language, the alphabet, and all the magic squares,invocations, etc. by means of a laborious process thai took months of \"scrying\" inthe equivalent of a crystal ball. The massive amount of manuscript that resultedfrom these bizarre efforts has been largely ignored by historians of theElizabethan period, or cited as evidence of Dee's emotional instability. Infact, the existence of these writings was used for many years to discredit Dee'sgenius altogether. (This is a pattern of thought that exists to this day: occultpractices arc evi dence of either insanity, emotional instability, or simplecredulous ness.)However, recent research into the Elizabethan period and particularly concerningDee's relationship to Sir Francis Walsingham (1 5 v 1590), Queen Elizabeth'ssecretary of state, suggests thai Dee was on a secret mission for the Britishgovernment at the time ot the angelic revelations (which took place in Prague).Further, as the pseudon} mous historian Richard Deacon has pointed out/ theAngelic language itself may have been devised as a particularly effectivecode—based on the work of famed German cryptographer Johannes Trithemius(1462-1516)—for communication between Dee in Prague and Walsingham in England.In other words, the entire basis of the famous occult order known as the GoldenDawn may well have had its origins in espionage work, from the coded language ofElizabethan spy and mystic John Dec to the \"Cypher manuscript\" of a nonexistentGerman lodge.Some years later, following his various and several initiations into the GoldenDawn, Crowley found himself in position to help a lodge brother, Gerald Kelly.Kelly, a distinguished member and president ot the Royal Academy, had a sisterby the name of Rose, who was engaged to someone she did not wish to many.Crowley rushed to the aid of Rose Kelly, and proposed that—in order to thwartthe fiance she elope with Crowley himself. It was to be purely a marriage ofconvenience, of course, whose only purpose was to ensure th.it she would nothave to marry the unfortunate gentleman who was pursuing her. She agreed. Theyeloped. Fell madly in love. Consummated the union. And went on a honeymoon.This, much to the consternation of her brother (.crald.The honeymoon took the blissful couple to Cairo in 1904, where the event was totake place that would change ( lowlev s life and thelives of thousands of his followers down the years—forever, for Rose, who hadnever before evinced any signs of mediumistic powers, suddenly began to\"channel\" an alien entity who demanded to speak directly to Crowley. To beexact, she began receiving impressions that the Gods wanted to speak withCrowley on an urgent matter and, for verification, she led Crowley to an exhibitat the Cairo Museum which bore the fateful number, 666. Rose, not aware of herhusband's personal identification with that number and the Great Beast itrepresents, was obviously in contact with divine forces, and Crowley took herimpressions seriously.For three days in April, 1904, Aleister Crowley communed with a spirit calledAiwaz, an entity that Crowley had claimed at times to have been theDevil—Shaitan—itself. Aiwaz communicated a scripture to Crowley in the voice ofthree Egyptian gods—Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit—that became known as The Bookof the Law: the gospel of the New Age, the Aeon of Horus.Crowley himself has written that the book initially repelled him; 8 that he putit away and actually lost track of the manuscript for five years until one dayhe found it in an attic and reread it for the first time since 1904. At thatpoint, he suddenly realized he was holding the key scripture of the next Aeon (amagickal age of two thousand years). While Hitler would eventually proclaim aThousand Year Reich, Crowley was doing him a thousand years better.The Book of the Law attacks most modern religions, from Judaism to Christianityto Islam to Buddhism, and thus would have been an interesting document to theinner circle of the Reich. It also proclaims—in a book written in 1904—''I amthe Warrior Lord of the Forties,\" 9 an eerily prescient prediction of thegreatest military conflagration ever to hit the planet.Crowley's occult career did not end with The Book of the Law. In due course hepenned many hundreds of tracts, pamphlets, articles, and books, all on the themeof \"Magick\": spelled with a \"k\" to differentiate it from all other types. Whenit came to Magick, Crowley was a genius. His command of mythology, religion,philosophy, the arts, and foreign languages was (and remains) legendary. He wasthe English version of a Guido von List with at least one important distinction:Crowley had a sense of humor, and it is through this sense of humor that thefull range of his intellectual brilliance shines. Whateverone thinks of Crowley as a human being or of Thelema—the cult he founded on thebasis of The Book of the Law —one thing is certain: Crowley was an inspired andengaging author on the whole field ofoccultism.Sex MagickCrowley accepted initiations into a variety of occult lodges and K> ties in histime, and eventually picked up an initiation into something called the OrdoTempli Orientis, or the Order of the Eastern Temple. This was the brainchild ofone Karl Kellner, a wealthy German Freemason of high rank in a rather distaffbranch of Freemasonry (the Rite of Memphis and Mizraim of John Yarker), whoclaimed that he was instructed in the techniques of sex-magic by a Hindu adeptand two Arab magi during his travels in the East. He introduced this concept tohis associates, Theodor Reuss, Heinrich Klein, and the ubiquitous Dr. FranzHartmann, all of whom were also high-ranking Masons in Yarker's sect.\"Sex-magic\" is a loaded term with all sorts of connotations, and it is perhapsbest that we discuss what Kellner—and later OTO initiates—meant by it. It is,quite simply, a method of sublimating sexual energy to the will of the magicianin a variety of rituals, lor a variety of purposes, using the sexual practiceappropriate to the desired end. Thus, everything from the missionary position tosodomy to masturbation has a magical analogue and refers to a different qualityof occult power. The choice of partner is also a matter for some concern, ai^\\the practice of sex-magic has become so refined by later initiates of the Orderthat even the specific days of a woman's menstrual cycle (for instance) each hasits own occult correspondence. While this concept may seem somewhat scandalousto the casual reader, one should member that a core doctrine of alloccultism—from the highest qabala to the meanest sympathetic magic—is that ofcorrespondences. In this doctrine, everything that exists in the \"real\" worldhas a counterpart in the astral world. Thus an object made of gold can be usedto represent the sun, which is itself representative of a host of ideas(vitality, warmth, the Male principle, action, ego, etc.). On this is magicbasedFollowing that line of reasoning through, every conceivable sort of sex act mustalso have its analogue in the astral domain, where magic works its mysteriouswonders.Obviously, this dimension was hard to find in the generally available teachingsof the Golden Dawn, the Freemasons, and other like organizations with theirheavy emphasis on formal ritual alone. The sex magicians also used a great dealof ritual—much of it familiar to magicians of other disciplines—but with someversion of the sex act as the central feature. Magic is, after all, about power;about directing energy and will to a given end. Sex is the natural companion tothis doctrine of power, for it is arguably the most potent of all humanexperiences. Wed sex to magic and theoretically one would obtain a dynamo ofvast occult potential.In India, this combination was already well-known as a form of worship called\"tantra\": a Hindu religious practice in which members of both sexes wouldparticipate in various rituals (not all of them overtly sexual by any means)designed to invoke the gods and to imitate the union of the two forms of polarpower in the universe, the male and female energies referred to in China as Yangand Yin, respectively, and in India as Shiva and Shakti.Traditionally, there are two forms of tantric ritual: right-hand and left-hand.Right-hand tantric ritual is that which takes place when the female participantsits at the right hand of the male. In this instance, actual physical contactbetween the partners will not take place.It is left-hand tantra that gets all the attention, however, because of themistaken notion that it is somehow \"evil.\" The term \"left-hand path\" has becomesynonymous in the West with black magic and with evil sorcerers who have soldtheir souls to the Devil: a manifestation of the superstition thatleft-handedness itself is a sign of aberration. However, \"left-hand\" tantricritual is simply that in which the female participant sits at the left hand ofthe male in the ritual. In this case, physical contact takes place between thetwo partners but this in no way mandates sexual intercourse every time, in everyrite.Certainly, among some practitioners in the East, the left-hand tantric circlehas become a sexual one and there is a small library of techniques, rituals,invocations, chants, etc. appropriate to this type of magic. But the point to bemade here is that all tantra is inherently sexual in nature as it is concernedwith the activities of both the maleand female gods and goddesses and their relationship to each other in theeternal play of creation. Whether or not actual sexual intercourse takes placeon the physical plane or not is a matter tor tantric \"engineers\" to decide,depending on the path chosen and the means agreed to by all parties. In allcases, the sexual act is considered subordinate to the ultimate goal ofspiritual liberation. It is a means to an end, a\\k\\ nothing more.As we have seen, Hitler was (probably unconsciously) putting this same knowledgeto good use. As Schellenberg pointed out in the quotation that begins thischapter, Hitler had so sublimated his sexual urges that he found relief in therabid speeches he made to the assembled, adoring masses and had long ceased tobe interested in normal sexual intercourse with women. On the other side, hisspeeches were so mesmerizing that even foreigners who spoke no German at allwere captivated by Hitler's oratory. In other words, the magical, tantrictechnique worked. Hitler wanted power more than anything else and was willing tosacrifice friends and lovers to that end. He transformed his sexual desire intoa tool for obtaining power . . . and became the leader of Germany (a country hewasn't even born in). Schellenberg— who is no fool—even credits the storiesabout Hitler's \"powers of intuition and personal magnetism,\" 10 in effect givingcredence to what a medieval audience would have called Hitler's abilities as asorcerer. A modern, twentieth-century occult audience would call Hitler a sexmagician.But to return to Crowley, in post-Victorian England this was racy stuff. Sexmagic was certainly far and away from anything the Golden Dawn was teaching, andCrowley became intrigued by it all when Theodor Reuss—the Outer Head of theOrder (OHO) of the OTO—visited Crowley in London in 1912 (during the height of aflurry of occult activity in Germany involving everything from the death ofTheosophist eminencegrise Franz Hartmann, warring I hco-sophical societies vyingfor members and recognition, and the ere ation, by Rudolf Steiner, of hisAnthroposophieal Society that same year, not to mention the founding of theGermanenorden that May) and accused him of revealing the core secret of theOrder in a publication of Crowley's called the Book of Lies. Crowley, takenrather aback, replied that he could not reveal the secret of the OTO since hehad not attained the appropriate degree in the Order and had thereforenever been told what the secret was. When Reuss pointed out a revealing phrasehaving to do with a \"Magick Rood\" and a \"Mystic Rose,\" (elements which, in aFreudian sense, could be understood as representing the male and femalegenitals, respectively) Crowley had a flash of satori and the two men came to amutual understanding.Crowley visited Berlin later in 1912 to obtain a charter making him the head ofthe OTO for Great Britain and all of the English-speaking peoples of the world,in the process choosing as his magickal name the title of that infamous Templarstatue: Baphomet.He then descended upon the rituals of the OTO with relish, rewriting them tomake them more overtly sexual and incorporating his own newly minted religiousideas—which he called Thelema after the Greek word for \"Will\" (shades of LeniRiefenstahl!)—into the liturgy. It was as if a whole new world was opened up tohim, for now he could make his favorite pastime—sex—not only compatible withmagick but central to it. He began to see that the whole universe of magick—therituals, techniques, specialized language—was merely a means of presentingsexual information in a coded form. With this sudden illumination came aprofusion of small articles on sex-magick that were translated into German byReuss's people and published there for the first time. Until relativelyrecently, in fact, they had not been available in English at all. 11 Thesetreatises discuss the occult methods to be employed during autoerotic,heterosexual, and homosexual sex acts, and concern everything from uniting withone's god or goddess through masturbation or intercourse, to making talismansfor various purposes, and even using sex to achieve enlightenment. These fewbooklets can stand as the West's answer to, and interpretation of, Hindutantrism, particularly of the Kaula Shastra variety, with a little distaffSufism thrown in for good measure. Quite simply, we are dealing with thesubordination of the sex act to the Great Work by the magician and mystic ofevery age. The Christian eremites who suffered intense sexual fantasies in thedesert as they strove to transform their desire for sex into a desire for Godwould have recognized the singular purpose in these Crowleyan tracts while atthe same time abhorring the practices described. Crowley maintains that everysex act of an Adept is a sacred act and should not be the result of a lasciviousappetite; the papal encyclical Humanae Vitae is in essential agreement on this.Yet, while Crowley—and the members of the German occultlodges who were following this regimen—believed that every sexual act was amagickal expression of the Will and had to he performed with procreation insight, it is not the type of procreation the Church has in mind. Crowley's idealchildren were magickal children, such as described in his entertaining andrevealing novel, Moouchdd. Ever) magickal act—and this includes sex—has apurpose that must be tablished beforehand. With Crowley—as with the Pope—thereis (officially) no sex for pleasure only.This attitude of Crowley's has been underrepresented in the main books andarticles written about him. Most authors view Crowley's description of hissexual antics as \"magickal rites\" with a huge amount of derision; yet, hisdiaries are full of just such occult annotations as he meticulously recordedhundreds of sexual acts that he performed along with a careful description oftheir occult purposes: whether they were to consecrate talismans, obtaininformation through divination, commune with a spirit or a god, or whatever.Crowley was at great pains to find a way to indulge a tremendous sexual appetitein a manner that was free of any hint of the \"baser\" nature of sex. In this, hemay have been searching for a way to satisfy subconscious elements of his psychethat were linked to his fundamentalist Christian upbringing: a way of havingone's cake of light and eating it, too.Whatever the purpose, and however successful or not he may have been, Crowley'sinitiation into the Ordo Templi Orientis is the source of much of the literatureby and about Crowley today. The discovery of the existence of a sexual occultismwas all the (use this brilliant if eccentric Englishman needed to detonate thevolatile compound ot his great intelligence mixed with a sincere—ifoutlandish—spirituality.That there existed a higher form of sex, perhaps the application ot the sex act,sexual positions, sexual fluids, and even sexual pleasure to spiritual goalslike illumination and unity with Godhead, appealed to Crowley immensely for itmade of sex a magickal laboratory wherein any experiment was justified if notactually demanded by the rigors of scientific method.The occultists of the OTO had applied \"the art of German engineering\" to the sexact, taking it, in effect, out of the bedroom and into the lab. (One isirresistibly reminded of Tim Cum as Dr. 1 r.in kenfurter in the Rocky HorrorPicture Show.) Of course, the use of sex in rituals was nothing new to Europe.The use oi sexual rites to insurefertility of the crops was known thousands of years before the word \"tantra\"became a commonplace on European tongues; and the witches were accused by theHoly Inquisition of conducting sex orgies on the top of Mount Brocken. The Ritesof Eleusis were almost certainly sexual in nature, and sex in general formedpart of many ancient mystery religions in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia (towit: the voluminous evidence available in Frazier's The Golden Bough).It could be argued that the advent of Christianity changed all that with itsbachelor God, its virgin Mother, its celibate priests and nuns, and its generalhostility to sex of any kind. It is probably for this reason that we find nodiscussion of \"sexual secrets\" in Freemasonry, for example, and the sexualdiscussions around Rosicrucianism are almost always hidden behind the heavilyveiled symbolic shorthand of the alchemists.In short, the mystification of sex has always been with us; so has themystification of eating and drinking (in the Mass, in various pagan festivals ofharvest time) and the mystification of respiration (in the pranic exercises ofthe yogis, in the meditations of the Eastern Orthodox \"Jesus Prayer,\" etc.); inother words, all the senses and most physical functions have been the subject ofmagical or mystical practices at one time or another and sex is no exception. Inthe modern Western world, however, with the sexual act pushed into thebackground by a fastidious Christianity and not discussed in polite company, itwas inevitable that only the most outrageous occult societies would have fixatedon sex as the key to all other magical rites and powers. Thus, the popular imageof the satanic altar in the Black Mass as being a nude virgin or prostitute isapt: to be anti-Christian was to be pro sex.The Politics of SexBut how does one maintain an anti-Christian stance in an environmentunremittingly pro-Christian? Either by going underground—as the occultists didand still do—or by going overboard. The German lodges—such as the OTO and theBrotherhood of Saturn—opted for the former, but the Nazis chose the \"left-handpath.\"Let us read the words of SS officer Otto Rahn, the reluctant Nazi andenthusiastic Grail-seeker, who defines the problem for us towards the end of hisLuzifers Hofgesind:Whereas Christianity is occupied above all with Man and condemns Nature asantidivine by abandoning it to the atheistic realms of science and technology,Paganism believed that nature was full of gods. All phenomena were words oractions attributed to Genies dnd Spirits. In this sense one must consider itmore pious, more \"religious,\" more \"Christian\" than Catholicism andProtestantism which both display a desire for domination and the imposition ofan implacable Law, ideas which permeated Christianity more due to the influenceoi Rome a\\k\\ Judaism than due to the influence of Christ. 1 '(It should be noted that this view—in a book by an SS officer published inGermany with, it must be assumed, Nazi imprimatur— anticipated the controversial1967 article by Lynn White in Science magazine, 14 which blamed Christianity forthe world's ecological crisis by calling our \"arrogance towards nature\" theresult of \"Christian dogma.\")So, there we have the \"overboard\" solution. Simply claim that you are morepious, more \"religious,\" and more \"Christian\" than the Church. Claim you havepenetrated to the deepest mysteries of Christianity and that, in your oppositionto the organized Church, you are only doing what Christ did to themoney-changers in the Temple and would do today had he been around and was theone with the whip. For this is what Hitler believed, and what Himmler carriedout.For example, the Lebensborn organization of the SS—which every SS officer wasobligated to join—put some of this into practice. It was inevitable that someonelike Hitler, who had grown up reading the pornographic occult newsletters of vonLiebenfels and, later, ol Julius Streicher, would have agreed to the institutionof a cult brothel for the propagation of the Aryan race. In this organization,women selected for their racial purity and adherence to the Teutonic ideal olwomanhood in physical appearance as well as in spiritual composition weremaintained for their impregnation by equally Aryan SS men. 1 I he Lebensborncommunities were, in a sense, farms where Aryan babies were bred like blue-eyedcattle. There was even a plan to do away with the whole idea of matrimony as itplaced an undue burden on the Aryan race, whose mission was to colonize theentire world with perfect racial specimens. There were, after all, many morenon-Aryansin the world than Aryans, and it would take time and manpower to exterminatethem all. Besides, healthy Aryan stock was needed to cultivate the fieldsappropriated during the drive to the East mandated by Haushofer's Lebensraumpolicy. Although the Lebensborn concept was never openly discussed as ananti-Christian policy—and anyway the Nazis in general and the SS in particularwere the repository of the real secrets of Christianity and were on the verge ofobtaining the Holy Grail itself—it was generally understood that the CatholicChurch would not approve. The christening or baptismal ceremonies which tookplace in the Lebensborn communities were pagan rites devised by Nazi occultiststo replace those familiar to these husbandless Lutheran and Catholic mothers;thus there could be no doubt among even this, the most militarily uninvolvedsegment of Nazi Germany, that Nazism was paganism, and that Christianity was tobe eventually replaced as surely as Judaism was on the list for immediateextinction.In this, however, the Nazis were close to their sometime brothers in arms, theanti-religious Socialists, for does not the Communist Manifesto describe thedesirability of putting an end to marriage and the nuclear family? 16 And ifthis goal were to be reached, what role does sexuality play in the new society?For the occult lodges, this was not a problem. Marriage was, indeed, a bit petitbourgeois and destined for the junk heap of history but, in the meantime,sexuality was still a powerful occult tool, the manifestation in the visibleworld of the flow of energy in the unseen dimensions. Magicians had \"magickalchildren\" on those planes, and could even create familiars andhomonculi—artificial humans—using these techniques, thereby rendering theinstitution of marriage as a means of ensuring the future of the race ratheroutre. Magicians already lived in the world the Nazis were trying to create. Itwas a vast one, with a multiplicity of dimensions in endless space, and to theircredit they did not require the use of crematoria or mobile gas vans to pursuetheir particular Lebensraum.We have taken all this space to discuss the official Nazi attitude to sex andmarriage since it can be seen as an indirect result of ideas current in Germanyfor many years before Hitler came to power: ideas concerning sexuality that wereostensibly alien to pious, anti-Semitic Germany and its organized religion andwhich had to come from somewhere. Hitler, with his hit-and-miss street educationin the pagesThe Order of the Temple of the Hast \\ 1\")ofOstara and at the feet of men like Eckart and Hanussen, took a verybroad-minded view of sex. Indeed, he is said to have known about S \\ LeaderErnst Rohm's homosexuality for years and tolerated it ... a rather astoundinggenerosity for that man in that time and place. In fact, a great many SA menwere homosexuals, which should give the-nervous nellies in the Pentagon pause:for the Brownshirts—the dreaded Storm Troopers; the brawling, two-fisted beerhall fighters; the drunken, angry mob of volunteer militiamen who defeatedCommunism in Germany and who propelled Hitler to power—were the epitome ofmilitary machismo . . . and Rohm, their leader and queen, was the ultimatefighting man.Crowley went to America during World War I after being rejected for militaryservice by his own government (or so he claimed), and when Hitler was fightingthe Allies as an enlisted man in the trenches of France and Belgium, writingWotanist poetry full of magical symbolism, Crowley was writing pro-Germanpropaganda for The Fatherland, a journal published in New York by one GeorgeViereck, who had known Crowley slightly from years before. 17 Crowley needed ajob, and agreed to take over as editor of The Fatherland. He claimed to beIrish, which would have made him a natural enemy of the English if true (whichit wasn't). He even went so far as to row out to the Statue of Liberty one dayand mime burning his British passport, an event that was duly recorded by noless an astute observer than the New York Times.™Later, when confronted by all of this, he would claim that he was really workingfor the British cause since he had turned The Fatherland into something of ajoke. Reductio ad absurdum was the technique he employed: in other words, hisarticles were so outlandish that the joui nal was reduced to absurdity, acaricature of serious political discussion, which would help the British causemuch more than harm it. In one such article, for instance, he compared KaiserWilhelm II to Parsifal in search of the Grail, and claimed that the Celts weredescended from the same race as Osiris and Isis. 19 In another, an article datedNovember, 1917, for a sister publication of The Fatherland called TheInternational he wrote that the world's press was responsible for the war andthat the aftermath of the conflict could only brin^ about \"bankruptcy,revolution, and famine,\" which was certainly true but did not require thespecial skills of a master magician to fores*Incidentally, the above topics were quite in keeping with Listian sentiments andwould have been familiar to any volkisch audience.George Viereck himself is something of a minor legend. He is probably the sameViereck whom Freud mentions as a \"journalist, politician, writer, quite ahandsome fellow\" who supplied him with some food during the terrible shortagesin Vienna at the end of 1919. 21 The same George Sylvester Viereck interviewedFreud years later, in 1926, on the subject of anti-Semitism and included theinterview in a collection entitled Glimpses of the Great, that was published in1930. 22And it was certainly the same George Sylvester Viereck who was implicated in oneof America's most famous spy cases of the Second World War. Viereck—who was theillegitimate grandson of the Kaiser—became an enthusiastic admirer of the ThirdReich and essentially its chief publicist in America from his posh apartment onManhattan's Riverside Drive. The Kaiser had a son in the Gestapo, and Viereckused this connection to get close to Himmler, whom he saw as a kindred spirit: aroyalist who admired the old Teutonic kings and who wished for nothing so muchas a restoration of the Hohenzol-lern monarchy. Himmler, with his mysticalworship at the shrine of King Henry I, with whom he identified, seemedsimpatico; a door into the corridors of power for the scheming journalist.Crowley's German Case OfficerDuring the First World War, Viereck became implicated in a plot to sabotageAmerican factories as early as 1915 (in other words, two years before Americaentered the war). This would have been about the time he encouraged Crowley totake over as editor of The Fatherland. A briefcase full of plans for espionage,sabotage, and the invasion of the United States had been left, forgotten, by oneof Viereck's agents on the Sixth Avenue El in Manhattan in plain sight of anAmerican secret agent who had been sent to follow them. He picked up thebriefcase and blew the story wide open. Oddly, Viereck never spent a day in jailfor his role in the elaborate plotting against his adopted country.With the start of the Third Reich, Viereck oversaw an extensive pro-Hitlerpropaganda campaign and was central to Nazi efforts togenerate support among German-Americans for the Hitler regime. Through his\"Board of Trade for German-American Commerce\" hewas also able to provide an underground railroad tor German agents fleeing SouthAmerica when they became unmasked.But by far the most sensational aspect of Viereck's career was the revelationthat a United States Senator, Ernest Lundeen of Minnesota, was in his employ. OnAugust 31, 1940—one step ahead of an FBI arrest—Lundeen took a flight fromWashington, D.C. to his home state, ostensibly to confess all to his wife. Henever made it. Lundeen, an FBI agent sent to tail him wherever he went, andeighteen other passengers died when their plane went down in a severe storm amidsuspicions of Nazi sabotage.Two days later, and Lundeen's wife Norma was in Washington, demanding possessionof the \"Viereck files.\" These files revealed the full extent of Lundeen'scomplicity in Viereck's massive propaganda campaign, even to the extent of usingthe senator's franking privileges to send Nazi literature through the mailwithout ever paying postage.Money is always a problem in espionage campaigns, and Viereck's was nodifferent. Although he was being handsomely paid for his services by the Nazigovernment, the expense of importing propaganda materials past the censors wasdaunting. It is reported that Viereck received additional funds from the fascistand pro-Nazi dictator Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. But,eventually, Viereck brought off the brilliant plan of using the government ofthe United States to do his propagandizing for him. He paid Senator Lundeenthousands of dollars at a time for the privilege of writing his speeches forhim, speeches which were delivered in the Senate and printed in theCongressional Record.Eventually, Viereck was arrested, tried, and convicted, and managed to serveonly about a year or so in prison before having his sentence reduced; but hiseffectiveness as a Nazi agent was thereby diminished. 23 What is not known isthe extent to which Crowley would have been able to provide information onViereck to British Intelligent if he could have been used to infiltrateViereck's circle in New York City. Quite possibly Crowley's cover had been\"blown\" by this time: that is, perhaps he really was working for American andBritish intelligence services during the Great War, as he claimed.In a written defense of his actions, published in 1929, Crowley insisted that assoon as America entered the war in 1917, the US Department of Justice employedhim as an agent-in-place at his Fatherland and International editorial offices.24 The author has so far been unable to verify this, butother—unbiased—researchers claim that Crowley was, indeed, telling the truth(see Chapter Nine).To British Intelligence, however, Crowley was officially just \"a small-timetraitor\" 25 who had no connection with any British Government intelligence orcounterintelligence operation taking place in America. Or anywhere else. But thefact that they even had an opinion to express indicates that someone in BritishIntelligence was keeping an eye on Crowley, as indeed they were. In 1916,apprised of his pro-German propaganda effort in New York, agents of the LondonPolice raided OTO headquarters and confiscated Temple paraphernalia. Whetherthis was for the purpose of conducting an actual investigation into possiblecriminal activity or simply as a means of retaliation against Crowley, is notknown. But this would not be the last time Crowley would come to the attentionof the Intelligence services."},{"pageContent":"Appropriately enough, during his tenure as editor of both The Fatherland and TheInternational Crowley's romantic interests revolved around several German womenin New York. Perhaps the most famous to Crowley enthusiasts was the ghostly LeahHirsig, the younger sister of the Swiss-German Alma Hirsig, who had attended oneof Crowley's lectures on occultism in 1918 (and who would later become involvedwith Pierre Bernard, the founder of the Oom the Omnipotent love-cult). Sheeventually moved in with Crowley in his Greenwich Village studio and became his\"Scarlet Woman\" (a reference to the consort of the Great Beast of the Apocalypseand a title Crowley used for many of his female lovers). Leah eventually becamepregnant and bore a child—Anne Leah—in February of 1920. Shortly thereafter,Crowley decided to set up an occult community in Italy, on the island of Sicilyand near the village of Cefalu. This was to become the famous Abbey of Thelema,the object of so much attention by the world press and, eventually, by thegovernment of Benito Mussolini.The Occult SpiesWhile Crowley was writing German propaganda in New York, some of his colleaguesin the German and British OTO lodges and theGolden Dawn were employed in actual military work. His former brother-in-law andfellow Golden Dawn initiate, Gerald Kelly, was working as a British secret agentin Spain. Karl Germer (whom we will meet at the great convocation of occultleaders in Thuringia in 1925) was probably a spy for the German secret serviceduring the Great War, and was awarded the Iron Cross, First and Second class (aswas, it will be remembered, Adolf Hitler, except that Germer entered the army asan officer while Hitler was an enlisted man). Was Crowley, therefore, supplyinginformation on Garner's activities to the British and American intelligenceagencies? [f so, that would seem to exonerate him of any claims of treason byhis government, but it would also seem to make him a traitor to his own Order. I)id C iermer ever discover the extent to which Crowley might have been spying onhim for the British? Or was there a \"gentleman's agreement\" between the twomagicians that enabled them to act as \"double agents' 1 against each otherwithout anyone doing the other any real harm?Theodor Reuss—Kellner's successor as head of the Order when the latter died in1905 \"in mysterious circumstances\"—was also a mem ber of the German secretservice, but not during World War I. I )uring the height of that war he can befound living at the Ascona vegetarian community at Monte Verita in the Ticinoprovince of Switzerland (where we found Franz Hartmann almost thirty yearsearlier), and which then became the headquarters of the OTO for a while.Years previously, however, Reuss had infiltrated the fledgling Social istmovement in England, where he spied on the family of Karl \\1ar\\ for GermanIntelligence. 28 He did this in the guise of an admirer of Marxism, and most ofhis intended victims were actually emigre Gei mans living in London. This wouldhave been in the yean immediately preceding the founding of the OTO by Kellner,which was supposed to have taken place in 1895. By that time, Mathers— cofounderof the Golden Dawn—had already moved to Pans with his wife, Mina Bergson, sisterof the famous philosopher and onetime president of the Society for PsychicalResearch, Henry Bergson (1859-1941). From about this time until Mathers s deathm 1918, there is a lot of speculation abotit the involvement of the (.olden Dawnwith everything weird and Continent.il from the Edelweiss So ciety (ananti-Semitic front group operating out of Sweden) to an occult group supposedlyorganized around Karl I [aushofer and called variously (by various authors) thelumen Club or lumen Lodge orLuminous Lodge of either Berlin or Vienna (possibly confused with the Lumenclubof Vienna, an organization founded by a follower of Liebenfels which promotedNazi ideology in pre-Anschluss Austria). While the Golden Dawn certainly had theEnglish-speaking world covered—with lodges from England to America to NewZealand— there is very little evidence for genuine Golden Dawn activity takingplace anywhere else, with the exception of whatever Mathers was up to in Paris.After Mathers's death he would have been unable to continue strategizing withGerman and Scandinavian occult groups, at least on the physical plane. TheEdelweiss Society was at its heyday in the 1920s, and the existence of somethingcalled the Luminous Lodge is debatable. While it would have been physicallypossible for Haushofer to have met Mathers when both were living on theContinent at the same time, there would have been no earthly reason to do so.Mathers was an impoverished occultist living in France; Haushofer, a respectedprofessor of geopolitics at the University of Munich. The likelihood of theirhaving met on common ground is virtually nil. While there is evidence thatHaushofer was interested in astrology and related forms of mysticism, Matherswas not selling horoscopes or doing the medium circuit, unlike people such asHanussen. If there was any connection at all between Mathers and the Golden Dawnon one side and German occult lodges on the other, it would have been througheither Hartmann or Crowley and there we have the two, verifiable links.However, once the Nazis began to crack down on the occult groups operating inGermany and the occupied territories, the Golden Dawn—under the German versionof its name, Hermetische Orden der Goldene Ddmmerung —was included on the list,along with Crowley's A.-. A.*, and Reuss's OTO. 29 The Nazis were nothing if notthorough; thorough . . . and paranoid. The list of banned societies was probablycompiled by one Dr. Gregor Schwartz-Bostunitsch, a self-proclaimed authority onoccult societies who entertained a consuming hatred for Freemasonry, Theosophy,and Anthroposophy, and who once counted a youthful Adolf Eichmann among hispupils.The Weida ConferenceEstablished at the Abbey of Thelema at Cefalu, Sicily, after the war in thespring of 1920, Crowley found himself chronically short of fundsand made several trips to Paris and London in an attempt to raise money andgather disciples for his commune. One of these disciples was the unfortunateRaoul Loveday, whose botching of an occult ritual (it is said) resulted in histragic death. It was this incident involving Loveday—an Oxford undergrad, whoarrived at Cefalu accompanied by his friend Betty May—that eventually closeddown the abbey. \\K. May, appalled at the degenerate goings-on and generalsqualor of the abbey and distressed at the death of her friend, returned toEngland after the occult funeral and told some rather hair-raising stories tothe London papers. The resulting furore in England (human sacrifice,cannibalism, satanic rites, etc.) soon spread to Italy, and the Fascists decidedto deport Crowley. 30 He left Cefalu in May, 1923, never to return. (Hisfollowers stayed behind for a while, but they eventually abandoned the abbey andit fell into general oblivion until a visit one day by filmmaker Kenneth Angermany years later.)Crowley wound up in North Africa with Leah, wondering what to do next. Theirdaughter had died shortly after their arrival in Cefalu in 1920, the second ofCrowley's children (both daughters) to have died young. In the summer of 1925the acting head of the OTO—one Heinrich Tranker—invited Crowley to Germany todecide the fate of the Order; that is, Tranker (who had initially opposedReuss's decision to have Crowley succeed him as OHO) had had a vision in whichhe saw Crowley as the new head of the Order. 31 Most of the German initiates hadopposed Crowley on at least two grounds: the imposition of his personality andpersonal religion on the rituals and general philosophy of the Order, and thefact that he was an Englishman and not a German like themselves. While there isno evidence to suggest that the OTO was a volkisch or Pan-German or neo-Teutonicsociety, this was still Germany, after all, and Germany in the grip of apolitical fever with Hitler out of jail and Mein Kampfon the best-seller lists.Yet, OTO initiate Karl Germer (\"Frater Uranus\") was prevailed upon to providethe funds necessary to transport ()rowley to (rermany from France, where he hadbeen staying with a small group ol disciples, and the Great Beast himselfarrived in Thuringia in June of \\ ( )l z ) for the conference that would decidethe fate of the Order.Unfortunately, Crowley had sent a copy of The Hook of the Law ahead of him forthe chiefs to digest. It was quickly translated into German by one Max Schneiderand all was more or less acceptableuntil the infamous third chapter, which contains the diatribe againstChristianity, Judaism, etc. aforementioned. At this point, there was a flapamong the chiefs and even Herr Tranker of the mystical vision demurred.Heinrich Tranker was a Leipzig bookseller specializing in occult works, who hadhis own occult imprint in the pre-World War I days. 32 Also attending theconference were two Theosophists, Otto Gebhardi and the elderly Marthe Kiintzel,as well as Germer, Eugene Grosche, two others (members of Crowley's entourage),and Crowley himself. It was held in the small town of Weida, near Gera, whichwas then evidently the headquarters of the OTO with Tranker as its acting head,or OHO.After several days of politicking, although Tranker came around to seeing TheBook of the Law in a slightly more favorable light, he still wound up opposingCrowley's stewardship of the Order. Eugene Grosche (\"Frater Saturnus\"), acceptedCrowley as an important occult teacher but not as the OHO. It was left to KarlGermer to accept Crowley completely and unconditionally, and thereby the OTOsplit into three warring factions: the largely German, anti-Crowley group underTranker, the new Brotherhood of Saturn under Eugene Grosche, and the OTO underCrowley, with Germer as his financial sponsor and devoted disciple.Tranker's OTO was concerned with working the sex-magic degrees as created andrefined by Kellner and Reuss without, however, having to accept either the Lawof Thelema or Aleister Crowley as the occult messiah. Crowley, it should beemphasized, was the perfectly legitimate head of the OTO for Great Britain andthe English-speaking peoples, anointed as such by Reuss. The question of whetheror not Crowley was actually the head of the entire Order is a debatable one,since Crowley claims that Reuss appointed him as his successor. If that weretrue, however, why then the conference in Thuringia? It seems there was at leastsome room to debate Crowley's position as international OHO, and Tranker—who hadthe vision that Crowley should be the head—reneged and removed his supportduring the conference. As Tranker was acting head of the Order, it can beassumed that he held such position legally and with the approval—not only of theother members—but of Crowley himself, if only up until the Weida (Conferencewhen the OTO began to splinter in typical occult fashion.Although Crowley, for all practical intents And purposes, lost the bulk or hisGerman constituency, he left Thuringia with sonic new friends, among them KarlGermer, who would become OWi) upon Crowley's death, and Marthe Kiintzel whoaccepted the Liw of'Thel-ema and its Bible, The Book of the Law. It would be Ms.Kiintzel who would wind up caring for some of the fallout from Crowley'srituals, in the persons of Leah Hirsig and her new companion Norman Mudd, atKuntzel's residence in Germany, until Leah returned to the States and Muddcommitted suicide in the waters of the English Channel in June, 1934,coincidentally at the time of the Rohm Purge taking place in Germany. 33And it would be Ms. Kiintzel who, full of approval not only for Crowley but foranother occult messiah, would claim that Adolf Hitler's views were virtuallyidentical with those found in the The Book of the Law; Kiintzel, interrogated bythe Gestapo because of her connections to Theosophists, Thelemites, andFreemasons galore, remained a devoted Nazi and a devoted follower of Crowley toher dying <\\a\\ . It is interesting that she found no conflict of interestbetween the two. Karl Germer would even claim that the Fuhrer was, quiteprobably, Crowley's Magickal Son/*Of the third group to leave Thuringia that summer, we may say a little more thanhas been mentioned elsewhere, for Eugene Grosche's Brotherhood of Saturn alsomanaged to survive the war and to continue its own version of the sex-magic thatwas taught in the secret councils of the Ordo Templi Orientis.Grosche's system took the rather Masonic outlines of the () I O a step furtherand created a whole system of sex-magic based on astrology. This was not ahoroscope magazine approach to selecting one s spouse based on sun signs, butrather a complex method of determining sexual positions and partners accordingto the purpose of the ritual and the actual location of the planets asdetermined by reference to .» common ephemeris and table of houses.For the curious, the most important astrological aspect (according to this cult)is the square; that is, when two planets are ninety degrees apart on theecliptic as viewed from the earth. This is supposedly an aspect of great tensionbetween the planets, and those planets specifically related to sexuality (Venus,Mars, Neptune, and the Moon ae-cording to the Brotherhood) are particularly powerful for this type of working.All heterosexual and homosexual couplings have been accounted for in thissystem, as well as the specific positions to be used according to either thenatal horoscopes of the individuals involved or actual transits, or both.Conjunctions of the planets were also considered appropriate, but the squaresseemed to dominate the sex-magic practices of this group.While it would take too much space to discuss the theory behind all of this andwould perhaps bore the reader not willing to wade through some of the rathersurreal jargon of the modern occult movement, suffice it to say that the squareaspect was believed to represent a gate, open into the hidden dimensions. Ingeneral Western astrology, a square is often considered an unlucky or \"hard\"aspect: one that represents obstacles to success or illness, accidents, lossesof various types. The magicians of the Brotherhood of Saturn saw it, therefore,as a gate opening upon this world from the domain of daemons; and daemons werethought to be nothing more than powerful forces which—to theuninitiated—appeared fearsome and evil but which the initiate (with propertraining and discipline) could tame to more productive ends. 35This mystification of the sex act among the German occult lodges was perfectlyconsistent with later Nazi fashions regarding sex and power. As Susan Sontagpoints out in her essay, \"Fascinating Fascism\":The fascist ideal is to transform sexual energy into a \"spiritual\" force, forthe benefit of the community. The erotic (that is, women) is always present as atemptation, with the most admirable response being a heroic repression of thesexual impulse. . . . Fascist aesthetics is based on the containment of vitalforces; movements are confined, held tight, held in. 56While no one would accuse Crowley of repressing his sexual impulses, thetransformation of sexual energy into a spiritual force was— and remains—the goalof the Ordo Templi Orientis and the other German sex-magic lodges, as it was apersonal practice of Hitler himself. The vital force was worshiped as tantamountto magical power and—with the precise instructions of Eugene Grosche and othersforthe timing of the moment of orgasm to coincide with the passage of some star orplanet over a hypothetical point in space—we can sal that this vital force wasrestricted in its flow, subject to the conscious direction (the will) of themagician. Like the Nazi art thai Sontag brilliantly describes, the German art ofsex-magic is also \"both [Mini ent and idealizing.\" 3 ^ While the Office of theHoly Inquisition used guilt by association to equate sexuality with the practiceof witchcraft and devil worship (because sexuality was already considered baseand animalistic by the Church) and thereby confirmed the evil of lust as acreature of Satan, the German lodges acknowledged this relationship of sex withdarkness, sex with demonic forces, but cynically manipulated it toward variouspersonal ends. One might reasonably agree thai the Nazi ideal was to sublimatethe sexual urge for the \"benefit of the community\" as Sontag has pointed out;but the German sex magicians were not concerned with the community at all. Theirgoal was their own benefit, the entirely personal one of spiritual enlightenmentand individual power.Sex and spies. And secret societies. The great sex magicians— Crowley, Germer,and Reuss—were enthusiastically involved in all three pursuits at various timesof their lives. All had worked lor (ier-many's benefit, even though Crowleyinsisted that he worked as a spy for the US Department of Justice and wouldlater work for MI5. All were leaders of the Ordo Templi Orientis, a. Germansex-magick occult lodge. And when, in 1922, Theodor Reuss suffered a stroke andhad to step down as OHO of the Order, it was Crowley—fellow spy and sexmagician—who rushed in to fill the space. And when Crowley died, it was Germer(veteran secret agent) who took over as OHO.Crowley has claimed that Reuss appointed him his suceessor as OHO of the Order,but that ignores the tremendous flap that took place when a German translationof The Book of the Law was made available to lodge members in Germany. It canhonestly be said that most OTO members in Germany at that time disapproved of (n ley's taking over the OTO. They objected to the way he rewrote their ritualsto deify himself and to enshrine his new religion of 1 helema in their lodgework. Many initiates defected ... or, it can be said, the Crowley factiondefected from the original OTO organization. In theThe By-Paths to Chaoslate 1970s, the author received a communication from a traditional (that is tosay, non-Crowleyan) OTO lodge operating out of Frankfurt; evidence, if slim,that an OTO continued to function that had not accepted Thelema and was stillworking the original grades. In Germany.#5#Cult War 1934-1939It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of mytoils. x— Victor Frankens i i inHitler came to power—as Hanussen predicted—on January 30, 1933, in the shadow ofthe ancient pagan feast of Oimelc. A more important, if less pagan date, is thaiof November 9; possibly a date selected with premeditation by the ( K cultMessiah—or else, arrived at without much contemplation at all, just a weirdlittle wrinkle in history.First, of course, comes Germany's most famous contribution to world religion:Martin Luther, for November 9 is his birthday.But November 9 was also the birthday of the founder of the Thule Gesellschaft,the man who organized Munich into a full-scale rebellion against the Communists,and who synchronized the Bamberg government and its regular and irregular troopsfor the final assault on the Bavarian Soviet: Baron von Sebottendorff. It wasalso the day thai the Second Reich collapsed with the abdication of the Kaiser.It was the day that Sebottendorff called the Thule/ Germanenorden brethren toarms. It was the day Adolf Hitler lost his eyesight for the second time at thePasewalk sanatorium.And so it was the day of the Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, a day that Hitlercommemorated forever after with speeches and festivities, and sanctified withthe creation of the Blood Order: a society of those men who marched with him onthat fateful day, and symbolized by the Nazi flag that they carried and withwhich all other Nazi flags were \"blessed\" by being touched with it in impressiveceremonials presided over by Hitler himself. It was the day of a failedassassination attempt in 1939 on Hitler's life at a meeting commemorating thePutsch. (Co-incidentally, November 9, 1939, was also the date the trial ofAmerican Nazi and Bund leader Fritz Kuhn began in New York City, a trial thatresulted in his conviction on various charges and his sentencing to Sing Sing.)And it was also the day of Kristallnacht, when roving Nazi gangs went on arampage in 1938, smashing shop windows and destroying Jewish homes, businesses,and temples. If anyone in Hitler's Germany believed in numerology, they wouldhave spent considerable time in analyzing this most pregnant of dates for theThird Reich.As he bent to the task of solidifying his position as absolute dictator ofGermany—using the Reichstag fire in February 1933 as the excuse for assumingvirtually total control of the government while waiting for the president todie—Hitler also began ensuring that very little of his past would be revealed tothe public by his friends from the old days in Vienna and Munich. The \"November9\" days.Dietrich Eckart was already dead; Eckart's disciple Alfred Rosenberg was safelyon board with the Party, as was Rudolf Hess. Hanussen will be murdered in thewoods near Berlin only weeks after the Reichstag fire.And May 10, 1933, would witness a quintessentially barbaric act of the newGerman ruling party: the burning of hundreds of thousands of books that wereconsidered dangerous to the regime. Significantly, these massive bonfires markedthe first time the word \"holocaust\" was used by the Western press in associationwith the Nazis; 2 it would be eight years before the same word would be used todescribe the mass extermination of the \"non-Aryans.\" This first, frenziedauto-da-fe— which took place all over Germany, in thirty cities—symbolized allthai was wrong with the Third Reich and all that is still wrong with itsadmirers on both sides of the Atlantic: the anti-intellectualism thatis born, not of an educated disagreement with particular philosophical ideas,but from a primitive's fear of what it cannot comprehend.And there was one book in particular that really attracted everyone's attentionin the newly Nazified Reichstag.The Return of the BaronJust when everything seemed set to allow Hitler to stride onto the globalpolitical scene with a minimum of personal embarrassment and domesticopposition, who should reappear but the one man who had the most to do withsetting that very stage—Baron Rudolf von Sebot-tendorff!He was probably the last person Hitler wanted anyone to hear from, forSebottendorff knew where all the bodies were buried. The self styled Baron wasproud of his participation in the early days of the Nazi Party and of hisstruggle to free Munich from Communist control in 1919. Although the ThuleGesellschaft had died a slow death, Sebottendorff was back to revive it.And not only that. The Baron had written and published a book. Entitled BevorHitler Kamm (\"Before Hitler Came\"), it outlined the entire early history of theThule Society and the first days ol the Nazi Party.Sebottendorff's whereabouts after the successful putsch against the Communistsin Munich in 1919 are well known. He left active membership in the Thule Societybecause his brethren held him responsible for the deaths of the original SevenThulists who were executed by the Reds. For several years, the Baron published aseries ol astrological works which were very well received, and in 1923 he madefor Lugano in Switzerland. There he wrote another occult treatise, comparing subjects as diverse as alchemy, Rosicrucianism, and Nuhsm. 1 his com pleted, in1925 he made for his occult 'alma mater\": Turkey.For a while, Sebottendorff managed to convinee the Mexican government to accepthim as their honorary consul in Istanbul. I his en abled him to travelthroughout Central America and the I nited Si for several years, but he returnedto Munich after Hitler came to power in 1933. Perhaps he thought he could obtaina position withthe new Nazi government based on his credentials with the Thule Society.Whatever his motivations might have been, they didn't keep him out of jail.At a time when the Fiihrer was trying desperately to win world recognition ofhis stature as statesman and Chancellor of the Reich, here was the oldOrientalist, Pan-German, and occultist Sebottendorff virtually giving the gameaway in black and white. Hitler would not have been able to survive having thisbook on the reading list of those heads of state with whom he was most anxiousto negotiate. Also, revelation of his connections to a patently occultorganization like the Thule Gesellschaft might have resulted in an erosion ofsupport from the middle class and in the renewal of opposition from otherpolitical blocs within Germany and even within his own political party. (Themid-1950s was a time of great upheaval within the country as various Nazifactions tried to gain the upper hand in the government, resulting in the famousBlood Purge of 1934 and the execution of SA leader Ernst Rohm and many others.)And then there was the attempt to blackmail the Fiihrer, which proved to be thelast straw.The Blackmail PlotA typed letter dated September 15, 1933, on Thule Gesellschaft stationery showsSebottendorff inviting one \"Professor Stempfle\" to a Thule Society meeting thatSaturday evening. 3 It can be seen from this note that the Thule Society hadreturned not only to Munich but to its old headquarters at the Four SeasonsHotel, and to its old schedule of Saturday meetings, as if nothing had happenedin the last fourteen years.Even more interesting, however, is the addressee. Quite possibly it is the sameBernhard Stempfle who was the Catholic priest who had edited an anti-Semiticnewspaper in the old days before the Beer Hall Putsch. A friend andcoconspirator of Baron Sebottendorff, he had helped design the framework forarmed resistance to the Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919 by the legitimategovernment in Bamberg. He was a guest of Hitler's at Obersalzberg after thelatter's release fromCult War 1934-1939 usLandsberg Prison, along with Hess and Hitlers indefatigable press retary \"Putzi\"Hanfstaengl. This bizarre trio helped Hitler to complete the first volume ofMein Kampf'm the spring of 1925. (It would be published in Munich on July 18 ofthat year.) Stempfle was included for his editorial services, and it wasprobably this access to information on the early days of Hitler—includingHitler's reminiscences about his youth in Austria and Munich—that led to one ofthe most scandalous episodes of the early days of Hitler's rule in Germany.Stempfle was a friend not only of Sebottendorff but of a strange littlegentleman by the name of J.F.M. Rehse, who owned what was probably the largestsingle collection of Nazi memorabilia in captivity. Rehse collected every scrapof paper he could find concerning the Nazis, Dietrich Eckart, the Thule Society,etc., and meticulously catalogued each item and stored them in boxes. He and theanti-Semitic priest Stempfle were close friends.'In 1929, Father Stempfle made an astonishing claim. He professed to own a letterthat Hitler had written—but never mailed—to the one true love of his life, GeliRaubal. Ms. Raubal was Hitler's nieo daughter of his half sister, Angela) andthe Fiihrer was infatuated with her, saying on at least one occasion that shewas the only woman he could ever conceive of marrying. According to Stempfle,Hitler had written an alarming, sexually explicit letter to Ms. Raubal.The nature of the sex being discussed in the letter was of a rather debasedtype, involving both masochistic and what the psychologists term \"coprophilic\"fantasies. Obviously, it would spell political and personal disaster for Hitlerif this scatological letter were ever made public. It had probably been stuck insome forgotten corner ot his rented room in Munich, for it fell into the handsof his landlady's son and from there into the possession—or so it was said—ofMr. Rehse.The existence of the letter became known to Hitler, who sent the Party'streasurer—a discreet and trustworthy aide by the name of Franz X. Schwarz—toobtain it from Rehse. Stempfle saw this as a means of insuring the existence ofRehse's invaluable \"Archive, and convinced Rehse to extort enough money from theNazis to enable his archival pursuits to continue. Although it was blackmail,pure and simple, Hitler agreed to assume financial responsibility for theloIIcl-tion, and in return Father Stempfle gave the purloined letter to theParty treasurer.Geli Raubal, to whom the famous letter had been addressed, had eventuallycommitted suicide in Hitler's Munich apartment in 1931, during Adolf's failedrun for president of Germany. The reason is unknown. (Eva Braun would attemptsuicide during his next campaign in 1932. It seems Hitler shared AleisterCrowley's abysmal track record with women. Several of Crowley's mistresses,wives, and Scarlet Women committed suicide or wound up in mental asylums. Six ofHitler's mistresses attempted suicide: at least three succeeded, four if youcount Eva Braun's final attempt in Berlin in 1945.)Rehse probably never had the Geli Raubal letter in his possession in the firstplace, for the integrity of the Rehse Collection remained intact and can beviewed today on microfilm at the Library of Congress (the originals were\"returned\" to the Bundesarchiv in Koblenz).Father Stempfle, however, did his penance for the sin of blackmailing AdolfHitler, for he was murdered—terminated with extreme unction—in the woods outsideMunich during the famous Blood Purge of June, 1934. His assassin pumped threerounds into his heart. 5These were the types of people Sebottendorff was calling to his side in 1933.It's possible that the Baron knew of Stempfle's blackmail scheme regarding theFuhrer, but the author has been unable to find proof of this. In any case,Sebottendorff was a dangerous man with dangerous friends and an equallydangerous flair for publicity. He, like Stempfle and that other troublemaker,Rohm, had to be stopped.After his brief attempt at reviving the Thule—possibly with even more occulttrappings and arcane rituals than before—he was sent to prison early thefollowing year and released soon after, thus managing to avoid the Blood Purgein June, which might have resulted in his going the way of piously prurientFather Stempfle. Instead, he found himself back in Turkey, where he managed toconvince the local head of German Intelligence to take him on as a secret agent.. . yet another occultist-turned-spy.He did not cover himself with glory in this position.The end of the war would find the hapless Sebottendorff broke, disillusioned,and thoroughly depressed. All that he had worked for since the early days ofNational Socialism had come to nothing. His own party—that is, the party he haddone so much to create—had seen fit to imprison him at the moment of itsgreatest triumph. And now Hitler was dead and the Reich was in smoking ruins.Sebottendorff committed suicide by jumping into the Bosporus.The date was May 9, 1945.Cult WarMeanwhile, Hitler was on the rampage against dissident tactions in the Party.June, 1934, saw the Blood Purge take place in which the head of the SA, ErnstRohm, a longtime comrade in arms, was arrested and executed and the SAeffectively shorn of its previous position and power in the Party. Many otherenemies of the Reich—real and imagined—were targeted for death that summer, andthe bodies piled up. Among those who escaped the Fiihrer's wrath were Himmler,Hess. Rosenberg, Haushofer, and the other cultists around the dictator.The death of Rohm was seen by many to be the key event, giving Heinrich Himmlerand his SS virtually unlimited power in German) and, eventually, in the occupiedterritories as well. But in order to consolidate this power a number of othersteps had to be taken. The opposition had to be crushed. Himmler, the guard dogof the new Reich, was told to round up the usual suspects.As early as May 26, 1934 (and therefore a month before the Blood Purge of Rohmand other enemies), an order of the Reich War Minis ter (1 p 90 J (I a) Nr2066/34) quite bluntly stated:\"I forbid any member of the Wehrmacht, including workers, employees, andofficials, from membership in Freemason lodges and similar Organizations.\" 6This was followed by more explicit instructions on behalf of the Party,instructions that were updated and expanded even' few months and then everyother year or so. To understand the official opprobrium in which the Freemasonswere held, it is only necessary to read that section of the law which lumpsFreemasons in with violators of the \"race laws.\"~ Also, a certain special hatredwas reserved for those Masons who had the temerity to advance to the III degreeof the ( rati These men were forbidden from participating in any but the lowestforms of labor and, in many cases, were subject to penalization of varioustypes, punishment, and even a term in the camps.This obsession with Freemasonry did not begin with the Third Reich but was aby-product of the first wave of twentieth-century anti-Semitism that took placeduring the First World War with the publication of the Protocols of the Eldersof Zion, which described a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to take over the world. TheJews—thought to be operating through the Masonic lodges of Europe—were believedto be planning world conquest beginning with the collapse of the monarchies.They had already \"succeeded\" with the American and French revolutions and werenow well on their way to complete success with the destruction of the Kaiser andof the Czars of Russia. The Masonic lodges were believed to be fronts for theJewish world government that was forming; their secret initiations, handshakes,code words merely a continuation of politics by other means: a way of operatingclandestinely in their host countries. This was taken quite seriously by a largesegment of the otherwise well-educated population, including universityprofessors, lawyers, doctors, etc. The revelation of the \"Judeo-Masonic\"conspiracy \"is presented as a turning point in the spiritual history ofmankind.\" 8 The Germans were finally able to identify who and what had destroyedtheir country, brought them into war, and made them lose the war: a cabal ofJews and Freemasons bent on world domination.In fact, Adolf Eichmann's first job as an SS noncom in Berlin in 1934 (afterpreliminary training at Dachau) was as a clerk working with ProfessorSchwarz-Bostunitsch, an \"expert\" on Freemasonry who had once worked for the Czarof Russia and who then became the scientific director of the Information Sectionof the SS Security Service, the SD or Sicherheitsdienst? (Schwarz-Bostunitschhad been the author of various anti-Masonic polemics in his time and was quitepossibly the Reich's preeminent expert on everything from regular Freemasonry toRudolf Steiner and his Anthroposophy to the various cults that comprised thelist of banned organizations used by the Gestapo.) The future head of the Bureaufor Jewish Affairs of the Reich's Security Headquarters (RSHA), who would beultimately responsible for implementing the Final Solution, Eichmann firstworked in Berlin maintaining a card catalogue of information on the Freemasons.Later, he was transferred to the Freemasonry Museum proper. This museum,directly under the authority of the SS, was visited (\"inspected\") two to threetimes a week by Himmler himself. It consisted of materialconfiscated from Masonic lodges all over the Reich, everything from aprons andritual implements to seals, photographs, documents, etc There was a roomdecorated as a St. John's Temple and another as aSt. Andrew's Temple. Eichmann's desk was in the St. Johns room. where hecatalogued thousands of Masonic seals and medallions, until his transfer to the\"Jews\"— Judenamt —Department of the SD.One may obtain a rather intimate glimpse of the ferocicv with which the imaginedthreat of the Freemasons was fought by looking over the shoulders of the Reichofficials responsible for keeping the souls of the German vblk free from anytaint of this ancient brotherhood. As an example, we have before us a letter onthe stationery of the Reichsbetriebsgemeinschaft Druck (The Reich PrintersManagement Union) of the German Labor Front (Die Deutsche Arbeitsfront) datedMay 17, 1935. It shows the head of that organization requesting confirmationfrom the Information Office of the German Labor Front that severalemployees—Messrs. Strowigk, Buchhorn, and Kickel-hahn— were Masons and that oneMax Fischer was a Christian Scientist. 10A reply from the head (Amtsleiter) of that office—dated May 1 1, 1935—shows thatone of the gentlemen in question, the unfortunate Hans Strowigk, was indeed aFreemason, and furthermore gives the dates of his initiations into the threegrades of the Golden Plough Lodge beginning in 1931 and culminating in January1933, about four weeks before Hitler came to power. 11The actual wording is suggestive. Strowigk is described as \"a distinct enemy ofNational Socialism\" (ausgesprochener Gegner des Na-tionalsozialisumus) forhaving advanced the three basie degrees of Freemasonry!As for Buchhorn and Kickelhahn, the Amtsleiter had no information, but requestedbirthplace, dates, etc. to enable him to more thoroughly research the files.This letter ends with a \"Heil Hider\" and the stamp of the German Labor Front.One wonders if the young Eich-mann had been responsible for maintaining the cardfiles that ultimately branded Strowigk a \"distinct enemy.''More evidence regarding the Reich's anti-Masonic drive is represented by aletter addressed to the office of the keichsfiihrer-SS in Berlin. 12 DatedFebruary 25, 1935, it is from the Central Office of the German Labor Front andconcerns a rule book of the St. John s Pyra-mid Lodge (possibly containing membership lists) that is being enclosed.According to the letter, it was obtained by one of their workers whose fatherhad been a former member of the Lodge. Accompanying this letter in the file isanother, dated April 1, 1935, 13 acknowledging receipt of the book and signed byan SS-Obersturmbannfiihrer-SS (the equivalent of a lieutenant colonel in theU.S. Army) at the office of the Reichsfiihrer-SS.This is the type of material that would have wound up in Eich-mann's Sectionand, indeed, the dates in all the above cases seem to match the time ofEichmann's employment at the Freemasonry Museum, for he was not transferred tothe Juden Department until the latter half of 1935.Among other evidence that has been collected and microfilmed on the same roll atthe National Archives in Washington, D.C. is an inventory of confiscated Masonictemple furniture and ritual objects; 14 a clarification of SS regulationsconcerning the employment of former Freemasons in the Luftwaffe (in which thoseholding III degree are considered, of course, the worst offenders along withthose holding any important office in the Lodge); 15 and much other material.Some of these communications are both to and from the Gestapo, the Secret Policeorganization of the Third Reich that was eventually subsumed into the SS, andare marked \"Geheiml\": Secret.One of the major anti-Masonic personalities in Nazi Germany— aside fromSchwarz-Bostunitsch—was Rosenberg himself. Convinced that the notorious forgery,the Protocols of the Elders ofZion, was authentic and supplied with all theparanoid literature of the day linking a clandestine Jewish government with theoperation of the Masonic lodges (after all, the Protocols are signed by an Elderor Elders with the obviously Masonic title of \"33 degrees\"), Rosenberg wascertain that the Masons were a genuine enemy to be feared. On the first of May1941, Hermann Goring confirmed that official policy by instructing all units ofthe Wehrmacht in the Occupied Territories to support Rosenberg's Einsatztab inthe seizure of Masonic ceremonial objects, books, and temple property, theseitems being considered cultural objects representative of anti-Nazi ideology.These would have wound up in the Freemasonry Museum, or in Rosenberg's personalpossession.The entire list of proscribed organizations can be found in the Zu-gehorigkeitvon Beamten zu FreimaurerlogeiL anderen Logen oder logen-ohnlichenOrganizationen (Membership in the Offices of Freemason Lodges, other Lodges, orLodgelike Organizations of the Reich's 1 Ionic Office of June 6, 1939 (II SB2212/39-6190 a*)). A swift glance down the names of Section B,\"Freemasonlodge-like Organizations\", will show the Theosophical Society, theAnthroposophical Society, the Golden Dawn, the OTO, and the Brotherhood ofSaturn, check by jowl with the Odd Fellows, the Ancient Order of Druids,Christian Science, and something called—in English—the Independent Order ofOwls! While it might seem that the Nazis were simply banning all fraternitiesand sects, one should remember that this was considered the \"anti-Freemasonry\"law and that all of the above-mentioned groups were lumped together under therubric \"Mason-like Organizations.\" The real enemy was Freemasonry. The otherswere considered—at least on paper—to be fellow travelers.This was cult war, pure and simple.There Is a Specter Haunting Germany . . .Why this persecution of the Masonic societies?The Nazis were not alone in history in their fear of Freemasonry. The Masonshave always been much maligned since their creation over two hundred years ago.There was even a Masonic \"scare\" in the United States in the mid-1800s when theywere believed to be infiltrating every level of government and conspiring to robAmericans ol their democracy. And there was another Masonic scare much morerecently in Italy, involving the infamous P-2 Society and members ol the Italianparliament.The Masons are, of course, a secret society. That is, there is a set ol ritualphrases and handshakes that identify Masons to one another and which representinitiatory steps taken behind the closed doors ol the Masonic temple. There aresecret rituals of an initiatory nature (though most, by now, have beenpublished), and secret doctrines thai form the rich and varied tradition ofMasonic lore.And then there are the oaths.These are blood oaths, taken with great solemnity, which guarantee that theinitiate will not reveal any of the secrets of the lodge under pain of quiteterrible punishment involving torture, dismemberment, and death. The existenceof these oaths alone would be enough to attract the attention of theauthorities, for the governments of most (if not all) nations really don'tapprove of their citizens having secrets. (The author is quite certain that,were he to take an oath to keep secret his late grandmother's recipe for poppyseed strudel, some government somewhere would find it necessary to beat it outof him.)In a dictatorship, the citizens can have no secrets since possessing a secretmeans withholding something from the Fiihrer and this is not consistent with theidea of a dictatorship. In Nazi Germany, the citizens took oaths of loyalty tothe Reich and to the person of Adolf Hitler himself. How could a secret legallyexist in such an atmosphere, where everything is the property of the Fiihrer?Secrets held by members of the polls imply dissent, and dissent can only legallyexist within some form of democracy.The secret societies, on the other hand, relish their secret oaths because theyinstill in the new candidate a sense that something really important is hiddenbehind all the veils of the temple. This, of course, is not always true.Aleister Crowley once wryly pointed out that, after taking a similar, terribleoath upon entering the Golden Dawn, the secrets that were revealed to him werenothing more than the Hebrew alphabet!More importantly—and more dangerously, in the eyes of the Reich—a secret makesits keeper an individual. The Indo-European (\"Aryan\") root for the word \"secret\"gives us related words, like \"self\" and \"secede.\" 16 Keeping a secret is a meansof separating oneself from society at large, of seceding from the group, thegovernment, the Reich. In Nazi Germany, there was no \"self\"; the slogan EinVolk, Ein Reich, Ein Fiihrer told you that, even if the Nuremberg Rally of 1934didn't.Also, the Masons believe themselves to be in possession of secret knowledgeconcerning the creation of the cosmos and thus ol the truth behind the worldsreligions. Outsiders, therefore, came to believe that the Masons had setthemselves up .is higher than the Church and independent of the local laws,marching to a heat consistent with theseesoteric rhythms. Certainly, if the Masonic oaths were to he enforcedlo the letter it would mean that the M.isons would he conducting theirown trials based on their own laws and executing their own judgments againsttransgressors—in effect, by-passing all branches of civil (andespecially religious) government and becoming a law unto themselves. For thisreason, certainly, membership in the Society of Freemasons was forbidden by theCatholic Church: an organization which already had a history of supersedingcivil legislation. And, secret knowledge ol an occult kind has its parallels insecret knowledge of a political kind. Men (and women) adept at keeping one kindof secret and living oik kind of secret life might be equally adept at keepinga\\k\\ living the other.In fact, the membership of some early Masonic lodges reflects the attraction thecult of secret handshakes and costumed rituals had for some of the most famousfreethinkers and rebels in history. Several studies have been published onMozart's life as a Mason; Goethe mu\\ George Washington (and Franklin Roosevelt,Hitlers bugaboo) were Masons. The infamous Illuminaten Orden of Adam Weishauptpel another frothy Bavarian confection of political conspiracy lightly foldedinto an Enlightenment attitude toward organized religion (and also on the Nazis'hit list of banned organizations) infiltrated Masonic societies in Germany,France, and Switzerland with political in tent. Masons in the eighteenth centurywere largely aristocrats. intellectuals, adventurers, and artists; by and largpthey were the influential persons of the societies in which they lived, notunlike the Thule Society of later years, which thrived in the heads atmosphereof wealthy industrialists, idealistic nobles, and the Prussian officer class.Add to this the romantically styled history of Freemasonry, which traces itscovert lineage back to King Solomon and later through the Knights Templar—thatother much-maligned and much-abused tr.i ternity of crypto-occultists—and onehas a conspiracy theory that transcends centuries and the globe. A conspiracytheory isn't much fun unless it reaches wide and deep, and the Freemasons In thehill.Several books that helped frame 1 limmler's early view of world his tory—andtherefore wound up influencing the entire scope of the SS—were popular studiesof Freemasonry in the- style of the m< rabid conspiracy theory books of today.These included World Freemasonry, World Revolution, World Republic(Wehfreimauerei* Wekrevolu-tion, Weltrepublik) by Fricdrich Wichtl andFreemasons and Ann-Masons in Struggle for World AL Freimaurer und Gegenmaurerim Kampfum der Weltherschaft) by Franz Haiser. 17 These were books spawned fromthe great controversy over the Protocols and were based, in part, on\"revelations\" contained within that forgery. From these books Himmler borrowedthe concept of the Kshatriya warrior caste of \"Aryan\" India, a concept to befound in the writings of Blavatsky and other theosophical authors and which madeits way into the vbl-kisch and conspiracy literature popular at that time, andenthusiastically adopted it as his own. He drank in the paranoid fantasies ofWichtl, who exculpated the Germans for any responsibility in having started thewar, and instead blamed it on the Jewish-Masonic syndicate which includedTrotsky, no less, as well as Lenin and George V! 18 Although Himmler may haveneeded a new Aryan Secret Society, he did not need another Thule Society aroundto foment discord. The Nazis knew all too well how much power a secret societycould wield in Germany. The Thule was, after all, a front for the Germanenorden,and that organization had been conducting high-level assassinations for yearswhen it wasn't organizing resistance against the Communists. The Masons had arather vast underground network by comparison, and the benefit of two hundredyears of organized activity from Germany to the rest of Europe, the Americas,the Middle East, and even Asia. By comparison, the Freemasons made the ThuleSociety look like the kindergarten of secret societies, at least insofar as theprestige of antiquity and international membership was concerned. Besides, therumors had it that Masons were responsible for every political upheaval from theAmerican Revolution to the French Revolution to the Russian Revolution. (Asearly as 1919, Alfred Rosenberg's articles for the Volkischer Beobachter werefull of references to a worldwide conspiracy of Jews, Bolsheviks, and Masons totake over the globe.) 19 To the Nazis the Masons were a well-organized,hierarchical society with members in virtually every nation on earth which hadenthusiastically taken part in revolutions and armed conflicts everywhere.Worse, they were seen as staunch supporters of democracy, and the word\"democracy\" to the Nazis carried u distaste almost as had as \"Jew.\" In fact,democracy was believed to be the weapon of Jewish interests, created to keep thecommon man living in .i fool's paradise of equality and brotherhood while thecynical, conniving |ew reachedinto the worker's pocket and took all his money.Democracy. Freemasonry. Judaism. Secret societies. The Nazis were bent onremoving all trace of any philosophical opposition to their cause, for they knewthe power of ideas and—the quotation of Chair man Mao notwithstanding—it was farstronger than the power of a gun.The Nazis were not simply a political party. As has been mentioned before, theywere a cult, and as such had every trapping of the typical cult, from aspiritual Master to a brotherhood of identically clad discipies, secret rituals performed in remote castles, and a sign—a totem — thatsummed up their ideology as effectively as the Cross and the Star. The swastikais the single, most obvious, even glaring piece of evidence to support thisview, and yet calling the Nazi Party nothing more than a cult on steroids hasyet to become an accepted and legitimate point of view.Yet, as with any typical cult, its chief enemies were other cults.Karl Germer Speaks to an AngelOne of the cults on the list of banned \"Freemason-like\" organizations is theOrdo Templi Orientis, which appears under the German translation of its name:Orientalischer Templer-Orden (OTO), number la on the list. The author has so farbeen unable to discover what happened to specific members of the anti-Crowleyfaction of the O 1 () that remained loyal to Tranker, but the Eugene Groschebranch (the Brotherhood of Saturn) is number 15 on the list. Its interesting tonote, however, that something calling itself Thelema Verlag was still publishingCrowley material in Leipzig as late as 1937.Karl Germer was Crowley's chief disciple in Germany at the time Hitler came topower. He and Marthe Ktint/.el were holding down the fort while Crowley—who hadvisited (icrmany again briefly in the spring of 1930—was busy drumming upsupport abroad for I helema. Ms. Kuntzel had grown so infatuated with I litleras early as 1 l )2S thai she had sent him a copy of The Book of the Law in(icrman translation. Crowley had told her that the first country to accept theLaw would become master of the world and Ms. Klintzel was determined that itwould be Germany.Some years previous, Crowley had attracted the attention of Scotland Yard. Thereis a record of a meeting taking place between Crowley and one Colonel Carter ofthe Yard concerning Crowley's activities on the Continent. He had just beendeported from France—a move that was recorded in the world press—for theauthorities felt that Crowley was in fact a spy for Germany, and that the OTOwas nothing more than either a front for a German spy ring or a blind with whichto confuse the intelligence services. As it happens, the meeting with ColonelCarter went well and Crowley was not subject to any prosecution by the Britishgovernment.That same year (1929) Crowley had married a Nicaraguan citizen— Maria Theresa diMiramar—in Leipzig in a marriage of convenience so that his new Scarlet Womancould obtain a visa for England, but he soon tired of her there and returned toBerlin, taking up with a series of German women. One of these, thethirty-six-year-old Gertrude \"Billy\" Busch, was the woman the Brownshirtsrescued in 1931 when Crowley was slapping her around on a street corner. 20 Hehad met her while standing bemused in front of a travel agency on Unter DenLinden and soon thereafter consecrated her as one of his Scarlet Women, much tothe consternation of Frater Uranus. The storm troopers found Crowley beating heron the street, and—according to John Symonds—\"trod Crowley's face into thegutter.\" 21 Whether this was simply wishful thinking on Mr. Symonds's part, weshall never know. One thing is for certain, however; at the same time as Crowleywas engaged in this peculiar form of worship of his Scarlet Woman, Gertrude, hewas spying on the German Communists for British Intelligence. Living with thenotorious espionage agent and avowed Communist, Gerald Hamilton—the onetimecompanion of Sir Roger Casement—he was able to spy on him in return for fiftypounds sterling, courtesy of MI5. 22But in 1935, the cult war began in earnest and the Nazis banned the Freemasonsand similar Lodges. This included the OTO and the Golden Dawn, and KarlGermer—who had occult connections everywhere and was a high-grade Masonhimself—was finally arrested by the Gestapo in 1935 and thrown into solitaryconfinement at the Alex-anderplatz prison. 23 Prior to 1 C HS, he had beenlargely responsible for Crowley's many debts and a letter survives to Crowleyfrom Germer's wife complaining about the sum of fifteen thousand Americandollarsthat Crowley evidently frittered away on red wine and ScarletWomen. 24 Fifteen thousand dollars was ail enormous sum of money in pre-WWIIGermany. This kind of largesse from a ranking German Freemason and leader of theGerman OTO to an English occultist —if indeed the financial transactions wereknown to the Gestapo—would have made Germer's punishment particularly harsh.Further, Germer was a known associate of Eugene Grosche, whose Brotherhood of Saturn was also on the list, and of the elderly Marthe Ktintzel, the erst whileTheosophist (now an enthusiastic member of the OTO and follower of the accursedEnglishman, Crowley) whose personal papers and Order documents were seized. Fromall this, the Gestapo must have thought that Karl Germer was Satan incarnate.As it was, he spent several weeks in solitary confinement and was cruellytortured. Once the Gestapo were through with him, he was shipped off for tenmonths as a reluctant guest of the SS at the Ester wegen concentration camp. 2SWhat happened to Germer during that year of internment, torture, and unspeakableinhumanity can only be the subject of conjecture. 1 [e wrote a memoir of histime in the camps which has so far remained unpublished, but it is to thespiritual transformation of Germei that the author refers; for KarlGermer—Frater Uranus, to give his Order name—claimed that it was while atEsterwegen that he attained Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy GuardianAngel.This is a technical term in the lexicon of twentieth-century ceremonial magic,and was used to denote a particular state of enlightenment in the Golden Dawnand in Crowley's expanded version of the (!olden Dawn, the A.-.A.*.. In a way,it denotes conscious \"contact\" with one's higher Self except that the Self asunderstood by modern psychoanal) sis is woefully short of what the occultistsmean by it. Imagine thai there is an aspect of one's personality which hasalread) attained the ultimate spiritual apotheosis it is possible to attain,that the eternal element of one's self—that element beyond space and timealread) sits at the right hand of God. Between one's self and one s Self thereexists a chasm so wide that most people never even know a Self exists; yet,after much concentrated effort in that direction suddenly, and perhaps all toobriefly, there is a moment when the self becomes con scious of the Self: the twomeet in a lightning flash of absolute awareness in which it is safer to say that there is a \"before\" and an \"after\" ratherthan a \"self\" and a \"Self.\"If all this sounds like so much hyperbole, that is perhaps more due to the lackof a proper vocabulary in the English language to describe an event that liesbeyond the scope of normal experience. The Golden Dawn—borrowing the term from amedieval grimoire (book of magician's rituals) called the Sacred Book of MagicofAbra-Melin the Mage — used the rather cumbersome title \"Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel\" to represent that moment of awarenessthat comes only after much meditation and psychological preparedness throughritual. The Holy Guardian Angel is, of course, what a Jungian might—for lack ofa better term—call the Higher Self.While this event is spiritually momentous, it is not the ultimate goal of themagician. Once Knowledge and Conversation has occurred, it requires more workand concentration to achieve a gradual union of self and Self and there are moreobstacles to be overcome and trials to be survived before this can take place.Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is no guarantee ofimmortality or enlightenment, but this phase—no matter what one calls it—musttake place before higher states are reached.The Masons and the OTO are similar societies in that they offer a series ofgrades of initiation in which certain \"secrets\" are imparted or revealed to theinitiate. The basic number of grades in Freemasonry is three, although thereexist as many as thirty-three degrees in American Freemasonry and there arecertain illegitimate and distaff branches that add degrees with recklessabandon. The Masonic society that Ger-mer belonged to—that of Memphis andMizraim (also banned by the Nazis)—boasted as many as ninety-seven degrees.However, these organizations are not \"teaching\" Orders in the sense of theGolden Dawn curriculum, which was quite complex and which was designed graduallyto bring a person to spiritual enlightenment through a series of initiatoryrituals that were complemented by private ritual and academic study. The A.\\A.\\,however, was just such a \"teaching\" Order, as it followed the Golden Dawn gradeswith the addition of three degrees on top of the eight created by Mathers, etal. Germer's experience in the concentration camp at Esterwegen can beunderstood in that context, then, as he was also a member of Crowley's A.'.A.*..A word about Esterwegcn: this camp was built in 1933, shortly aftci Dachau andin tandem with Sachsenhausen. Its purpose was dearly the internment andpunishment of the ideological opposition, from Communists to Church leaders,from Freemasons to Jews. Ik- prison ers were beaten and tortured daily in therelatively spacious camps (relative to their condition by 1943), and within arather liberal time schedule. These first years of the camps were the worst inmain cases. for individuals were easily singled out for brutal and bestialbehavior. Once the camps became crowded far beyond capacity, the ability of SSguards to inflict specific torture on each individual became reduced. (Instead,the great masses of prisoners were subjected to inhuman and nightmarish livingconditions in which corpses were left to decay in the barracks for lack ofspace—or time—to bun' them. Those who were selected for medical experimentation,however, experienced the worst the human mind could conceive. More often thannot, these experiments were carried out under the auspices of the Ahnenerbe-SS,an organization we shall study in the following chapters.)In order to preserve his sanity during his incarceration and torture, Germerrecited to himself those of Crowlev s writings he had memorized; a set ofscripturelike texts entitled the Holy Books thai Crowley had collated back in1907 (the year Liebenfels raised the swastika flag over Burg Werfenstein, andthe year the A.*.A.*, was founded) and published about 1909. Naturally, thesetexts are to be understood in light of The Book of the Law and reflect Crowley'scommunication with his own Holy Guardian Angel, Aiwaz: the Being ol whom ( rowley was made aware those three April afternoons in ( airo in 1904.One of the texts included in that collection— Liber Libert rcl Lapis Lazuli —issubtitled \"These are the birth words of a master ol the Temple,\" a fairlyobvious reference to the spiritual transformation undergone by Germer, as aMaster of the Temple is the degree attained by those who have just \"crossed theAbyss,\" i.e., undergone what psy chologists and poets alike refer to as the\"dark night of the soul.That Germer should have attained spiritual illumination in a concentration campsounds at first blush to be entirely inappropriate. Yet, a study of theliterature of spiritual processes would demonstrate that the terrible anxietyand stress of the camp -when accompanied by constant meditation and spiritualexercises could very well haw suited in just such a satori-like episode.Masonic initiation in the first degrees is concerned with simulating physicaltrials. A blindfolded candidate for initiation is bound and brought before agroup of men at the point of a sword. These days, this can be understood by mostpeople as a lot of mumbo jumbo and few candidates would take the ritualseriously. In the early days of Freemasonry, however, being bound andblindfolded and dragged before a mysterious council and made to swear an oath atthe point of a sword would have been seen as serious business, indeed.For Germer, being thrown into a concentration camp, tortured, and threatenedwith extinction provided him with a natural initiatic scenario. He is said tohave recited Crowley's Holy Books to preserve his sanity; what actually tookplace, however, was a Zen-like self-initiation in which the unnatural stress ofthe situation was further complicated by constant meditation on a spiritualpath, resulting in a psychic explosion; similar to what the Zen teachers call a\"satori.\" Ironically, this took place under the eyes of the SS, a rival cultdedicated to the eradication of just such independent initiatory experiences asGer-mer's.Shortly thereafter, Germer was surprisingly released from the camp and made hisway to Belgium, from where he managed to keep an eye on what remained of the OTOin Germany and particularly on Thel-ema Verlag in Leipzig. He was arrested onceagain in Belgium and deported to France, spending another ten months in aninternment camp, before finally emigrating to America in 1941, thus escapingcertain extinction in the last years of the war.So perhaps he had a Holy Guardian Angel, after all.To Defy the StarsOthers were not so lucky. In the insanity that followed the flight of RudolfHess to England in May of 1941, regulations were drawn up to forbid the practiceof astrology. As it was known that Hess had consulted frequently withastrologers, the casting of horoscopes suddenly became a matter of nationalsecurity and it was considered best if all astrologers were thrown into thecamps.The role of astrology in the history of the Third Reich is fascinating in itsown regard, and several books have been published that describe it in somedetail.One of the most fascinating of these—because told from a first personperspective—is that of Himmler's astrologer, Wilhelm Wulff,entitled Zodiac and Swastika\" In it, Wulff discusses the early days ofpost-World War I Germany and the gradual growth of the Nazi Party, leading up tothe eventual ban of astrology by the government. This ban took place over aperiod of years, beginning with a formal law against the practice of astrologyin the Greater Berlin area mk\\ gradually extending to the entire Reich. Peoplewho consulted astrologers could expect—it was believed—a visit by the Gestapo.Wulff himself wound up in Fuhlsbiittel concentration camp for four months of interrogation and hard labor in June, 1941 (one month after 1 less\\ flight toEngland). His books, files, and card indexes were seized And later returned onlyafter he met with the Reichsfiihrer-NS, Mimmler himself.(An indication of how sophisticated the Gestapo had become on the occult isevidenced by the type of questions they asked Wulff, including whether or not hehad ever cast mundane horoscopes. The term \"mundane\" horoscope refers to thosecast not of individual per sons, but of countries, political parties, and othergroups ot people.)After the flight of Hess, of course, a scapegoat was necessary and theastrologers were the unlucky victims. Prior to May, 1941, how ever, the reasonfor the initial ban remains murky, even today. 1 tainly, many astrologerspredicted a doomed future for 1 litler And the Reich and this was bad propagandathat had to be stopped. Also, the practice of astrology implied access to asource of information that the Nazis could not control: the stars themselves. Itwas as it the old stories about God keeping a big book in which everyone s sinswere recorded was literally true; a good astrologer could perhaps consult thestars and reveal the secret machinations of the Nazi leadership.But another problem the Nazis had with astrology was perfectl) consistent withtheir primary obsession: race. I low could a horoscope not take intoconsideration the rare of an individual, but only the time and place of birth?Was the horoscope of a Jew, therefore, the same as that of an Aryan? If so, thiswas a good (if somewhat bizarre) argument against the \"inferior race\" and\"subhuman race\" dogma ol the Reich.Also, astrology's origins were suspect.The first Western astrologers might have been Semites, ai least according to thestate of archaeological knowledge at the time. In anyevent, astrology was seen to be inextricably linked with various Asian sourcesthat seemed racially impure. Did the ancient Teutons practice astrology? Mostprobably these hunter-gatherer-warriors held only the most tenuous notion of themovements of the sun and moon. (This would later prove erroneous, as recourse toProfessor de Santillana's Hamlet's Mill w\\\\\\ verify.) But as far as dividing theecliptic into twelve zodiacal signs and assigning values for signs, houses,angles, etc., this was considered just too non-Aryan for words. If nothing else,it was egalitarian—virtually democratic—and seemed to argue against the Cult ofthe Will that was so necessary to the self-image of the Reich.Wulff's approach, however, gave the interested parties among the Nazi elite away out. Wulff had studied Sanskrit in order to read the ancient astrologicaltexts of India. The system of astrology he used was based on a rather differentmethod of computing planetary positions and rulerships than is generallypracticed in the West. This \"Hindu\" form is known as Sidereal astrology, and isbased on the actual positions of the planets and luminaries as seen against thebackdrop of the ecliptic rather than on the traditional positions used by themore common (in the West) Tropical astrology. Thus, Wulff's system was both morescientific (the actual positions of the planets) and \"politically correct\": itwas based on an Aryan system of astrology as translated from that ultimate Aryantongue, Sanskrit.Wulff's arguments in favor of the practice of astrology within the Reich areinteresting in themselves. Wulff claims the reason he wrote the book was toanswer a description of him by historian Hugh Trevor-Roper in The Last Days ofHitler, in which he says that \"Schel-lenberg found that in politics Wulff wassound.\" 28 (Schellenberg was Himmler's counterespionage chief, the head of AMT(section) VI of the SD.) Wulff, angered that he was being perceived as a goodNazi, answered by writing his version of the period (a version, by the way, inwhich Himmler's famed masseur, Felix Kersten, comes out looking like the perfectcad).Wulff's response to Himmler's objection that astrology did not figure race intothe equation is interesting. Himmler complained thai any system which applied inequal measure to members of every race was ideologically opposed to Nazi racialdoctrine. (This was actually the Party line; during the Aktion Hess, in whichastrologers were ar rested all over Germany, they were asked a specific questionfrom aprinted form concerning this very issue.) Wulff answered, \"Bui in theastrological manuals of the Aryan Indians . . . constellations have beendescribed which reflect the diversity of racial characteristics and which havefound practical expression in the caste systems of ancient Indian culturallife.' 29Excuse me?Based on the above explanation alone, we can conclude thai WulfFs politicswere—if not sound, then—at least presented in such a way that no reasonableobjection from one of the most despised racists in world history would have beenpossible. What Wulff described above and in his own words was essentially theblueprint for a Nazi astrology. What Wulff does not discuss in his autobiographyis his membership in something called the \"Swastika Circle'' in Berlin circa1920 group which included Ernst Issberner-Haldane, the famous palmist. Wulffcontributed to a magazine issued by the ardent New Templarist Herbert Reichstein(von Liebenfels's publisher) in company with such noted—and pro-Nazi—astrologersas Reinhold Ebertin,(We may also find reasons to object to the manner in which Wulff fought withKersten. While Kersten seems, from Wulff s account, to have been an obnoxiousand thoroughly objectionable human being who was interested in feathering hisown nest more than in actually saving Jews—despite his seal of approval from theWorld Jewish (!on gress after the war—Wulff might have swallowed his disgust andworked with Kersten to save a few more prisoners from the gas chambers. Instead,Wulff saw through Kersten's program of self-promotion and self-enrichment at theexpense of these same prisoners and decided to work instead \"for the end of thewar.\" This, from a man who attacked both Kersten and Himmler for living in adreamworld and being too confident of their own capabilities!)To be fair, Wulff was walking on thin ice. 1 le had been released from a campand could go easily once again into thai dark night. 1 lis very life was at themercy of the men he found himself working for. Whatever his personal ideology,Wulff eventually wound up calculating charts for the exclusive use of theReichsfiihrer-SS, Heinrich Himmler himself, right up to the very end of the war.1 le had a ringside seat at the Byzantine machinations of various SS leaden andtheir confidants (including Schellenberg and Kersten) to save themselves, saveprisoners, and/or save as much of Germany as they could. I hosewho don't believe that Himmler would be calling on Wulff the astrologer at everyhour of the day and night—through bombing runs by Allied planes, strafedconvoys, the arrest of Goring, the negotiations with Bernadotte and the WorldJewish Congress, the onward Russian advance—hysterical for advice on what to doon virtually every decision he had to make, have never known otherwise normalpeople in desperate straits. The account is quite believable in most parts, andbears a foreword to the English edition by Walter Lacqueur, not a man known forhis gullibility. Further, Schellenberg did give Wulff the credit he was due and,in Trevor-Roper's account, verifies that \"Himmler seldom took any steps withoutfirst consulting his horoscope.\" 31 Wulff survived the war to befriend respectedoccult historian Ellic Howe, and to write Zodiac and Swastika, his memoir of thewar years. We will come back to Wulff in Chapter Eight.His colleagues, however, were not so lucky. Dr. Karl-Giinther Heimsoth was awell-known and popular astrologer in Berlin, and a close friend and confidant ofthe old Nazi hand Gregor Strasser. Heimsoth had written several letters to ErnstRohm, while the latter was in Bolivia training troops, dealing with issues suchas astrology and homosexuality; 32 these letters were used as evidence of thevile nature of astrology (guilt by association) in a 1932 attempt to discreditRohm's SA. In a rehearsal for what would happen seven years later, after theHess flight, selected astrologers and \"fortune-tellers\" were rounded up duringthe Rohm Purge using the official ban on the practice of astrology in theGreater Berlin area as a pretext. Dr. Heimsoth—the gay astrologer—was one ofthose arrested, and executed that year.picture0 [images/picture0.jpg]The Black Order*/ can most highly recommend the Gestapo to everyone.SlGMUNI) FW ID#6#The Dangerous Element:The Ahnenerbe and theCult of the SSThe hierarchical organization and the initiation through symbolic rites, that isto say, without bothering the brain but by working on the imagination throughmagic and the symbols of a cult, all this is the dangerous element, and theelement I have taken over. '-Adolf HunkWhile the Gestapo was busy mopping up cultic opposition to the Third Reich, fromFreemasons to astrologers to Thelemites, Himmler was fully engaged in turningthe SS into the official state cult, with all the \"dangerous elements\" thaiHitler described in the above extract from his tabic talk concerningFreemasonry. In this chapter, we will not only review the history ol thisbizarre organization but we will also examine sonic documents oi the Ahnenerbe:the Ancestral Heritage Research and Teaching Society which became incorporatedentire into the SS. These documents have never before been published in theEnglish language.BackgroundThe SS (initials that stand for Schutzstaffel or Guard Detachment) wasoriginally intended to be Hitler's personal bodyguard. The early history of theParty was such that the SA, or Brownshirts, were really the first shocktroops—\"Storm Troopers\"—of the Nazis: brutal enforcers and street gangs inuniform that intimidated the opposition and acted as a kind of private army forthe Party (a type of Free Korps, such as that supported by the Thule; indeed theleader of the SA, Ernst Rohm, had been a Free Korps leader well known aroundThule headquarters). As the SA grew in importance and size it became an actualthreat to Hitler's complete control of the state apparatus. Elements within theParty wanted Rohm out of the way and presented Hitler with enough trumped-upevidence to warrant Rohm's arrest and speedy execution on June 30, 1934. On July1 the entire SA was to go on a month's holiday to prove that they had nointention to overthrow the government; Hitler's advisers, however, counseled apreemptive first strike against the SA anyway. As we have seen, the bloodlettingdid not stop with Rohm but was extended to include a wide range of persons andorganizations (both of the Left and the Right) deemed hostile to thetotalitarian regime Hitler and his disciples had envisioned. It was not thefirst time, nor the last, that the existence of an alleged conspiracy was usedas the excuse for wholesale slaughter.Before this time, the SS functioned as a kind of elite corps of pure-bloodedAryan supermen. Himmler joined the SS when it was still a bodyguard unit with nomore than about three hundred members and he marched with Hitler's men duringthe Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, carrying a flag. After he became the head of theSS in 1929, however, he began to reform it along lines that can only bedescribed as cultic, while its membership rose from three hundred to fifty-twothousand by 1933. The very selection of the twin Sig rune as its emblem had itsroots in the doctrines of List and Liebenfels. (German typewriters manufacturedduring the Nazi era included the twin Sig rune as one of their keys.) Even thegraves of dead SS men were adorned—not with crosses or other more traditionaltombstones—but with a German rune symbol (the \"mensch\" rune) made out of wood.This same rune was used on the cover of the articles of the Lebensborn society,2The Dangerous Element U> c )the \"human stud farm\" operation of the SS, thus making a curious statement aboutthe life and death cycle as perceived by the officialpagans of the Reich.Once Rohm was out of the way, however, Himmler came to a position of evengreater importance. Eventually even the Secret State Police— GeheimeStaatspolizei, or Gestapo—came under his jurisdk tion, making Himmler one of themost powerful men in Nazi Gei many and second only to Hitler himself inauthority and enjoying the fear which the black uniforms of his elite SS arousedin the populace.While it is known that he consulted astrologers dnd was interested in variousforms of alternative medicine, alternative science, and alter native religion,what is not generally known is the extent to which the Nazi government becamecommitted to serious support of such practices. Nor is it generally understoodjust how thoroughly Him-mler's eccentric ideas of race, ritual, and mysticismcame to infuse the entire Nazi phenomenon, thus coalescing into one of the mostdanger ous cults in the world. Much of what has been written before on thissubject is either unavailable in English or, worse, the stufl ol suchtabloid-style journalism that serious historians are forced to laugh it off asthe result of wild imaginations and the woeful lack of \"primary sources.\" Wewill attempt to rectify that situation as much as we can in the space allottedus, with constant reference to supporting documentation, beginning in thischapter with the strangest of all modern governmental agencies, the mysteriousAhnenerbe: The Ancestral 1 lei itage Research and Teaching Organization.A Personal ConfrontationAs I was researching the Ahnenerbe in the files of the Captured ( man DocumentsSection of the National Archives, 1 heard the archivists discussing the currentattitude of many Americans toward the-Nazis. They were dismayed at the relativelack of sophistication among average Americans when it came to the Third Reich,lamenting the fact that most of us seem to get our information on world historyfrom Hollywood.\"The point of view out there is that the Nazi Pane was some kind of sciencefiction fantasy,\" grumbled one man. The others murmured assent.I thought it was a remarkably perceptive statement coming from these overworkedand highly intelligent custodians of one of the world's most importantcollections of twentieth-century knowledge, and the image stayed with me for along time.Science fiction. That is how many of us think of the war by now, filtered as ithas been through the creative eyes of filmmakers and of the producers of populartelevision programs for a citizenry that gets most of its information fromcanned news shows and made-for-TV movies. It's almost as if the Holocaust were asideshow, something not completely relevant to the tales of Darth Vader-like SSofficers in their black uniforms, jackboots, and silver flashes. In fact, howmuch of the Holocaust ever appeared in such popular television programs asHo-gan s Heroes, for instance, which certainly did not glorify Nazism butinstead made it seem ridiculous? Certainly, the Indiana Jones trilogy goes along way toward depicting the Nazis in that \"fashion,\" a situation Jonesproducer Steven Spielberg has attempted to correct with his more recentSchindlers List.Combing through the files, however, one comes away with a more complex emotionalreaction. Of course, there is that perverse initial thrill when one comes acrossa swastika letterhead for the first time and realizes one is looking at theactual documents of the Third Reich. \"My God,\" you say to yourself. \"Here it is.I am looking at history.\" You realize that you are suddenly a lot closer to theThird Reich than you ever were, and it is not an entirely comfortable feeling.It is as if the printed pages were the spoor of the Beast itself; as if, inreading the lines, you become aware that you are not entirely alone in theforest. H.P. Lovecraft, the brilliant if racist father of gothic horror,depicted the infamous Necronomicon in much the same way, hinting that merely topronounce the barbarous words would be enough to summon unimaginable evil.But then I spent many long hours of many long days in front of microfilmreaders, poring over page after page of official SS documents, diaries, reports,and publications . . . and slowly realized that I was becoming numb with amystifying sense of horror, a horror that was at least partly directed towardmyself For what 1 saw in those pages was the spoor of the bureaucratic Beast:thousands of pages oi boring correspondence, red tape, thank-you notes, officialforms, polite inquiries, expense reports. It was like the contents of the filecabi-nets of any large corporation; like the files of anv of the largecorporations I had worked for in my time. 1 recognized the kinds ol people whokept those files; I recognized their concerns, their anxieties, their hopes,their fears. I began to identify with the authors and recipients of thoseletters, the keepers of those files, the meticulous fillers of those forms.And then, almost surrealistically, among the thousands of pages that marchedacross the magnifying lens of the microfilm reader in blinding profusion, Iwould come across a single word, buried in a report, a letter, a requisition.Dachau.Auschwitz.Konzen trationslager.Concentration Camp.And I would feel the breath go out of me. For I was looking at the records ofpeople like me; people who were working for a large, bureaucratic organization;people who were thinkers, scholars, academics. Authors. People whose interestslay in the bizarre, the unusual, the philosophical, the psychological—theoccult. People specializing in what occult historian James Webb calls \"rejectedknowledge.The men of the Ahnenerbe-SS.And as they filled out their forms, wrote their letters, and filed theirreports, millions of human beings were being tortured and killed in horrible,unbelievable ways by their coworkers. What Hannah A rend t called \"the banalityof evil\" never came home to me quite so strongly as during the days I sat beforethe microfilm screen as if it were a magic mirror into the past, and watchedpeople like me make casual, passing references to the death camps.Ancestor WorshipSo, how to describe the Ahnenerbe?Imagine that the evening adult education program of the New School for SocialResearch had suddenly become an independent government agency with a budget asbig as the Defense Department, with Lyndon Larouche as president and, perhaps,Elizabeth Clare Prophet as the physics chairperson.Or maybe the summer session at the University of California, Berkeley, hadbecome militarized and all the students had immunity from prosecution for anycrime they had committed, or would ever commit, and could conduct any form ofindependent study they liked as long as they wore their black uniforms with thesilver death's head insignia at all times and swore an oath of personal loyaltyto the dean.Then one might have some idea of what the Ahnenerbe was, and of the type ofpeople it first attracted to its ranks.It was a humanities program. With guns.Some traditionally trained historians might find levity a trifle out of place ina study of one of the most heinous \"academic\" and \"research\" institutions evercreated in the twentieth century, but if anything combines both unimaginablehorror and sadism with a pose of sophisticated scientific method as it wasapplied to some of the most ridiculous and unfounded \"scientific\" theories everconcocted, it was Himmler's dream agency, the Ahnenerbe-SS.The roots of the Ahnenerbe are a tangled snarl of various special interests.Depending on the source consulted, it was either founded by Himmler and the Nazi\"eternal pagan,\" ideologue Richard Walther Darre, in 1935, 3 or it had existedbefore that time as an independent institute and was only absorbed into the SSmuch later. 4Whatever source is considered the most reliable, one thing is certain: theAhnenerbe was not founded as an SS unit. Something calling itself the AhnenerbeSociety (\"an association for clan- and heraldry-research assistance, heredityscience and race-cultivation\") had existed as early as 1928. 5 But on the firstof July, 1935, a \"Deutsches Ahnenerbe Verein\" was formally established in Berlinby Heinrich Himmler and Hermann Wirth, along with some associates of Darre. 6According to documents available to the Nuremberg Tribunal, it was formallyincorporated within the SS only on April 1, 1940, even though for yearspreviously its leadership was largely composed of both honorary and career SSofficers. Indeed, according to the available records it is obvious that WolframSievers already held the position of Reichsgeschajh-fiihrer, or Reich's Manager,of the Ahnenerbe with a rank of Ober-sturmfuhrer-SS by 1937^ and had beenassociated with the Ahnenerbe as early as August of 1935. 8 So Sievers \\insistence that it only became part of the SS m 1940 is disingenuous, to say theleast.The Dangerous Element l 73In any event, the Ahnenerbe existed as an independent agency prior to itsincorporation into the SS and may have had its earliest roots as a researchbureau formed by a number of German intellectuals (and outright occultists, likethe Atlantis buff Hermann W'irth) who had been inspired both by the works of thevolkisch writers of previous years and by the exploits of a generation ofromantic adventurers And amateur archaeologists and anthropologists, ageneration that included Wolfram Sievers's defense witness Friederich Hielscher,dnd the internationally famous Swedish explorer Sven Hedin.Hedin, a native of Stockholm, left Sweden in hSSS at the age of twenty on hisfirst trip abroad, to Baku on the Caspian Sea. From that time on, Hedin managedto visit most of Asia from the Caucasus to the South China Sea, but with aspecial emphasis on Tibet. In 1925 (at the age of sixty) he published a memoirof his travels— My l.r an Explorer —which was very well received in Europe andAmerica, as were other travel books he had written on Tibet and China. (Aspreviously noted, at least one of these was in Hitlers small collection o( booksin his early, pre-Putsch Munich apartment.)' Hedin's tales of trekking throughsnow-choked Himalayan passes in search ol tabled Asian cities while both camelsand guides perished in grisly profusion along the route contributed to thegeneral fascination the public had for anything to do with the mysterious East,a fascination due at least in part to the writings of Mme. Blavatsky and herfollowers in the Theosophical Society, who saw the East (and particularly Indiaand Tibet) as the repository of arcane knowledge hidden from the rest of theworld for centuries.The Germans could not help but be charmed by Hedin's accounts of his adventuresin Asia. In My Life as an Explorer he describes his discovery of the ancientChinese city of Lou-Ian in the Taklimakan Desert, and of the artifacts heuncovered there which included an ancient, swastika-decorated rug nearly twothousand years old along with some of the earliest examples in the world ofwriting on paper. What must have bothered at least some of his volkischaudience, however, was his statement that \". . . not a single one of our ancientSwedish runestones is older than the fragile wooden staffs and paper fragmentsthat I found in Lou-lan. ,,,( ' Heresy!(Hedin revisited Lou-Ian in 1934, at the ripe age of sixty-nine. Now, in thevears since the Chinese Revolution, the entire area hasbecome a restricted military zone where atomic testing is carried out andLou-Ian is lost once more to the shifting desert sand.)There is evidence to suggest that the Ahnenerbe itself was formed as a privateinstitution by several friends and admirers of Sven Hedin, including WolframSievers (who would later find justice at the Nuremberg Trials) and Dr. FriedrichHielscher who, according to the records of the Nuremberg Trial of November 1946,had been responsible for recruiting Sievers into the Ahnenerbe. 11 In fact,there was a Sven Hedin Institute for Inner Asian Research in Munich that waspart of the Ahnenerbe 12 and as late as 1942 Hedin himself (then aboutseventy-seven years old) was in friendly communication with such importantAhnenerbe personnel as Dr. Ernst Schafer from his residence in Stockholm. 13Moreover, on January 16, 1943, the Sven Hedin Institute for Inner Asian (i.e.Mongolian) Research and Expeditions was formally inaugurated in Munich with\"great pomp,\" a ceremony at which Hedin was in attendance as he was awarded withan honorary doctorate for the occasion. 14It has even been claimed that Sven Hedin and Karl Haushofer were friends, aclaim that is not completely unlikely as the two had spent considerable time inthe Far East during the same period: Hedin as an explorer and sometimeambassador-at-large for the Swedish government, and Haushofer as militaryattache for the Germans. Given Haushofer's excessive interest in politicalgeography and his establishment of the Deutsche Akademie all over Asia(including China and India, Hedin's old stomping grounds), it would actually beodd if the two hadn't met. Later, as the Ahnenerbe was formally absorbed intothe SS and made an official agency of the Reich, Hedin still maintained contactwith all his old friends there even though, by 1942 and 1943, the Ahnenerbe wassteeped in the blood of projects that would earn its director, Wolfram Sievers,the death sentence.Indeed, by 1941 it was already clear that Haushofer's Deutsche Akademie andSievers's Ahnenerbe were virtually parallel organizations. Letters and newspaperclippings from that period—including Deutsche Akademie correspondence seizedafter the war—show that Dr. Walther Wiist, who was the \"Humanities\" chairpersonat the Ahnenerbe and, with Sievers, part of its ruling administration, was alsoacting president of the Deutsche Akademie.^ As the Ahnenerbe was also at thistime an agency of the SS, Professor Wiist—Rektor of the University of Mu-nich and an expert on Sanskrit, the Aryan Ur-tongue—enjoyed the dubiousdistinction of the SS rank of Oberfiihrer, or Brigadier. And both organizationshad made their field trips to the one place on earth whose name has become anepithet . . . Dachau. 1 \"The Middle Point of the WorldOnce Himmler was fully in control of the SS, he began its transformation into apagan religious order. The headquarters for this cull was situated at themedieval castle of Wewelsburg, near the towns of Pader-born and Detmold in theGerman province of Westphalia, close by the site in the Teutoburg Forest whereArminius made his stand with its famous, Stonehenge-like stone monument known asExternsteine.Here the secret Chapter of the Order assembled once a year. Each member had hisown armchair with an engraved silver nameplate, and each had to devote himselfto a ritual of spiritual exercises aimed mainly at mental concentration. rContrary to the flashy show enjoyed by so many other Nazi leaders—such as theirrepressible Goring—Himmler kept his Order C lasde extremely private. No onewas allowed inside who was not expressl} invited by Himmler himself; thus, onlythe Inner Twelve and occa sionally a select general or two, a Reichsleiter, orsome other official would be welcomed, but only at Himmler's convenience.Secrecy was the key element in the SS and most especially at Wewelsburg.The focal point of Wewelsburg, evidently owing much to the legend <>t KingArthur and the Knights of the Round Table, was a greai dining hall with an oakentable to seat twelve picked from the senior (iruppen-fuhrers. The walls were tobe adorned with their coats of arms; although a high proportion lacked these—asof course did Himmler himself— they were assisted in the drafting of designs byProfessor Diehitseh mh\\ experts from Ahnenerbe. 18Underneath the dining hall with its Round Table in a sunken chamber was to befound the \"realm of the dead\": a circular room whichcontained a shallow stone well. In this well, the coat of arms of the deceased\"Knight\" of the Black Order was to be ceremoniously burned. 19Each of the Inner Circle of Twelve had his own room, decorated in accordancewith one of the great ancestors of Aryan majesty. In Himmler's case, his roomwas designed to reflect his hero, King Henry the Fowler, a Saxon kingresponsible for the first German \"Drive to the East.\" Although some writers haveargued that Himmler saw himself as King Henry's reincarnation, there is alsotestimony that he admitted to speaking with the dead king's ghost at night. Inany event, Himmler created the King Heinrich Memorial Institute in 1938 inQuedlinburg as yet another boondoggle, this one devoted to the revival of theking's spiritual legacy.It was within the great dining hall with its Round Table that Himmler and hisInner Circle of Twelve Gruppenfiihrers would engage in mystic communication withthe realm of the dead Teutons and perform other spiritual exercises. 20During an investigation of the commander-in-chief of the (regular) German Army,General von Fritsch, for \"serious moral offences\" (a charge later found to be amistake resulting from a similarity in name between the general and a cavalryofficer), Foreign Intelligence Chief Walter Schellenberg observed Himmler andhis \"Round Table\" involved in one of these \"spiritual exercises\":He assembled twelve of his most trusted SS leaders in a room next to the one inwhich von Fritsch was being questioned and ordered them all to concentrate theirminds on exerting a suggestive influence over the General that would induce himto tell the truth. I happened to come into the room by accident, and to seethese twelve SS leaders sitting in a circle, all sunk in deep and silentcontemplation, was indeed a remarkable sight. 21SS men were discouraged from participating in Christian religious ceremonies ofany kind and were actively encouraged to formally break with the Church. Newreligious ceremonies were developed to take the place of Christian ones; forinstance, a winter solstice ceremony was designed to replace Christmas (startingin 1939 the word \"Christmas\" was forbidden to appear on any official SSdocument) and an-other ceremony for the summer solstice. Gifts were to be given at the summersolstice ceremony rather than at the winter solstice, and a special factory wasestablished for the manufacture of appropriatelyAryan tschochkes. (A possible, though by no means documented, cause for thisswitch of gift-giving to the summer solstice is the death of Hitler's mother onthe winter solstice and all the grief and complex emotions this eventrepresented for Hitler. Its understandable that Hitler—as the Fuhrer and atleast nominally in charge of the direction the new state religion wouldtake—would have wanted to remove every vestige of \"Christmas\" from the paganwinter solstice festival. As a means of denying his grief? Or as an act ofdefiance against the god whose birth is celebrated on that day, a god who robbedHitler of his beloved mother? It's worthwhile to note in this context that tor anational \"Day of the German Mother\" Hitler chose his own mothers birthday.)These ceremonies were replete with sacred fires, torchlit processions, andinvocations of Teutonic deities, all performed by files of young, blond-haired,blue-eyed Aryan supermen, ceremonies that, according to my informants, had beenrevived in the Andean mountains (a site sacred to the Nazi Horbigerians, of whommore later), at C lo-lonia Dignidad in the 1960s and which were still beingperformed there as late as my trip in 1979.(It is ironic that the establishment of Christmas on December 1^ was itself anattempt of the Church to identify the birth of Jesus with the winter solsticeceremonies of the pagans since Christ was most probably not born in December atall; hence, all I limmler was doing was reinstating a holiday that theChristians themselves had usurped for their own purposes, as indeed the runemanuscript—quoted below—suggests. And so it goes.)Weddings and \"christenings\" (especially at the Lebensborn communities) werereplaced by pagan SS rituals,\" and, gradually, the entire Christian liturgicalrubric was in the process of being replaced by a completely pagan version. Eventhe Hitler Youth were not immune. A so-called \"Nazi Primer\" published during thewar contains many examples of pagan ideology and anti-Christian sentimentdesigned for its youthful readership.Even the selection of Wewelsburg as the cull center was far from accidental.According to Teutonic legend, an apocalyptic battle wouldbe fought in that area between the forces of East and West, and the Easternhordes would be defeated by a mighty storm. Himmler—who highly valued such oldGerman myths—evidently believed he would have a ringside seat at theconflagration that would consume his enemies.Paderborn and Detmold were also important archaeological sites in the view ofthe Ahnenerbe, for they contained important relics of Germany's ancient glory.It was even bruited about that the Nordic World-Tree—Yggdrasil—had its roots inthat region on the border of Westphalia and Lower Saxony and might still belocated, perhaps at the Externsteine site.A typescript copy of an article that appeared in a monthly called Lower Saxonyin 1903/1904 was preserved in Ahnenerbe files. Devoted to this pagan cult centerlocated in the same region as Wewelsburg, it refers to the summer solsticecelebrations that took place there as late as the middle of the nineteenthcentury: 24[They are] like giants from a prehistoric world which, during the furiouscreation of the Earth, were placed there by God as eternal monuments . . . Manyof our Volk are known to have preserved pagan beliefs and their rituals, and Iremember that some sixty years ago, in my earliest childhood days . . . thecustom was to undertake a long, continuous journey that lasted for whole daysand which only ended on St. John's Day, to see those ancient \"Holy Stones\" andto celebrate there, with the sunrise, the Festival of the Summer Solstice . . .Goethe says, \"Nobody can overcome the impressions of his earliest childhood,\"and I have also, despite a long and costly journey, often since celebrated thesummer solstice on those very stones.The summer solstice festival, of course, was kept sacred by the Nazis and, as wehave seen, was the occasion of che \"human sacrifice\" of Walther Rathenau. But totie in this prehistoric monument to twentieth century Aryan mysticism, theauthor—one A.E. Miiller—goes on to say:Especially included foi your consideration arc the sculptures (bund onthe reverse of the l.xternsteine on which were thus originally discoveredthe image of the tree Ydragsil [sic], the World-Ash, whose melancholymyth embraces the Origin, the Life, and the Death of the Earth and itsgenerations.Miiller goes on to describe how images of a human couple seen within the form ofthe root of the World-Ash, Ydragsil {sic), m\\l\\ embraced by the Serpent,Nidhogur (the symbol of a devouring Death), were used by the Church tosubstantiate its own legend of the \"Biblical-Babylonian legend of the firsthuman couple, Adam and Eve, and their fall into sin as a result\" of the Serpent.Miiller complains that the essentially pagan iconography of the four Norns andassociated images were co-opted by the Church into representing other Biblicalstories and that the whole monument was exploited for the purposes of convertingthe pagan population of Lower Saxony to that Semitic interloper, Christianity.Concerning the cultic significance of Paderborn itself, we may refer to a letteraddressed to Wolfram Sievers by one Von Mot/ that is to be found in theAhnenerbe files. Dated January 29, 1937—from Det-mold no less—the author beginsby referring to a recent issue of the official SS magazine, Das Schwarze Korps:I am sending to you now ... six photographs with explanatory text. Maybe thesecan appear in one of the next issues of Schwarze Korps in order to show that itis to some extent a favored practice of the church on images of its saints andso forth to illustrate the defeat of adversaries by [having them] step on them.The referenced essay also mentioned that there are depictions ol the serpent'shead, as the symbol of original sin, being stepped on [by the saints].These depictions are quite uncommonly prevalent. It is always Mary who treads onoriginal sin.Now these pictures appear to me particularly interesting because the serpentrefers to an ancient symbol of Germanic belief. At the Battle of Hastings theflag of the Saxons shows a golden serpent on .i blue field.The Mary Statue at Paderborn was erected in the middle of the past century inthe courtyard of the former Jesuit College. As professor Alois Fuchs relatedseveral times before in lectures concerning the Paderborn art monuments, theartist that created the Mary Statue must have been a Protestant. This is for mecompletely proven because the face in the moon-sickle in every case representsLuther.It is well known that Rome and Judah, preferring thus to take advantage of theirown victims, created victory monuments for them. 25These are motifs which we find throughout the vblkisch and occult impulses inNazism: that the serpent, which represents Satan to Christians, was considered asacred symbol for the Aryans; and that \"Rome and Judah\" shamelessly exploitedthe suffering of their own people by depicting them as heroes or as vanquishersof evil through their agonies (thus reinforcing weak, non-Aryan suicidaltendencies among the oppressed populations of Europe).In a related context, Himmler—in conversations with Schellen-berg—also discussedsuch subjects as European witchcraft and the Holy Inquisition at length. Himmlerevidently subscribed to the belief—made popular across the Channel by Britishanthropologist Margaret Murray in The Witch Cult in Western Europe (1921) andThe God of the Witches (1933)—that the medieval witches burned at the stake bythe Church were pagans; he particularly stressed the fact that \"so much goodGerman blood\" was \"stupidly destroyed\" when thousands of German witches weremurdered by the Inquisition. 26 If it seems odd to the reader that the man whoordered the destruction of millions of Jews and Gypsies would decry the massmurder of pagans by the Church, then he or she may be assured that they are ingood company. Particularly as Himmler—like Lanz von Liebenfels beforehim—actively admired the organization, ritual, and mystique of the Church whiledenouncing its most cherished beliefs:The SS organization had been built up by Himmler on the principles of the Orderof the Jesuits. The service statutes and spiritual exercises prescribed byIgnatius Loyola formed a pattern which Himmler assiduously tried to copy.Absolute obedience was the supreme rule; each and every order had to be acceptedwithout question. 2 ^One of the books recovered from the so-called Hitler Library at Bcrchtesgadenafter the war comes under the heading ol \"pagan rituals,' 1 and deserves a bridmention here.Of the some two thousand volumes thai were recovered (and whicharc now stored in the Rare Book Room of the Library ol Congress inWashington, !).(..) many were of the occult sciences. One in partiallar concerns us at rhe moment, and that is Das Buck (lev Psabnen Deutsch: dasGebetbueh der Ariosophen Rasscn-mystiker undAntisemiten.This can be translated as The Book of German Psalms: The Prayerbook of theAriosophist Race-Mystics and Anti-Semites. It was written by noneother than our old friend, Lanz von Liebentels, he o\\ the Order of New Templars,and is nothing less than a hymnal of hate, a \"pra book\" that proudly callsitself \"anti-Semite.To give the reader an idea of what, typically, the Ahnenerbe thought valuableand worth salvaging in the spiritual legacy of the world, one only has to glancedown the list of works cited in Tod and L nsterblich-keit im WeltbildIndogermanischer Denker {Death and Immortality in the Indo-Germanic ThinkersWorldview) coauthored by R. Schrdtter and Ahnenerbe Kurator Walther Wlist andpublished in Berlin in 1938, bearing a foreword by Himmler.This official Deutsches Ahnenerbe publication contains appropriate quotationsfrom the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Bhagavad-Gita but doesn't stop there. Itgoes on to include everyone from Homer. Socrates, Plato, Cicero, Seneca, MarcusAurelius, and Empedocles to the Eddas, Meister Eckhardt (the darling of thePan-German mystics). Jacob Bohme, one of Dietrich Eckart's favorite philosophersAngelus Silesius and Giordano Bruno (who was burned at the stake by theInquisition for his heretical—mystical—views). The collect ion also containsselections from Omar Khayyam and that other Persian philosopher-poet Rumi. Thisamounts to nothing less than a Nazi \"canon\" of important and accepted texts,appropriate for meditational reflection by prospective SS recruits and thegeneral public alike. ()l course, neither the Old nor the New Testament appearsin the above collection.It was not enough for the Nazis to assume a pagan stance; they had to prove thatit was historically justified. 1 limmler wanted nothing so much as to be able toprove to the world that his personal idiosym cies were the stuff of reality. Inorder to do this, he enlisted the help of an organization that, by its veryname, was devoted to restoring the ancient knowledge of the Aryan forefathers tocontemporary awe: the Ahnenerbe Forschungs-und Lehrgemeinschafk the AncestralHern Research and Teaching Society.Himmler gave the Ahnenerbe official status within the Reich in 1935 (thusprotecting it and its members from the spate of new laws that were designed toban occult-related activity); in 1940 it became a formal division of the SS.With over fifty separate sections devoted to a wide range of scientific andpseudoscientific research, the Ahnenerbe became a boondoggle for Nazi scholarsof every description. There was a Celtic Studies group within the Ahnenerbe; agroup to study the Teutonic cult center Externsteine (near Wewelsberg), which aswe have seen was believed to be the site of the famous World-Tree, Ydragsil orYggdrasil; a group devoted to Icelandic research (as the Eddas were sacred tothe Teuton myth, and since Iceland was considered to be the location of Thuleitself); a group that was formed around Ernst Schafer and his Tibet expeditions;a runic studies group; a \"World Ice Theory\" division; an archaeological researchgroup that scoured the earth for evidence of Aryan presence in lands as remotefrom Germany as the Far East and South America (an idea possibly inspired by thewritings of Blavatsky and by contemporary research \"proving\" that the AryanNorsemen had discovered America hundreds of years before Columbus); the listgoes on and on. 28In fact, it was just such a servant of the Ahnenerbe, SS-Obersturm-fuhrer OttoRahn, who credited the belief of some Nazis that even Latin America held promiseas a land of the Aryans, a view sacred to contemporary Chilean author MiguelSerrano. In Rahn's book Lucifer's Servants he describes a Mexican legendconcerning the mystical Thule:In the wake of Columbus . . . the sails of Ferdinand Cortez crossed the seas. Itwas he who conquered the kingdom of the Aztecs and Mexico for the benefit ofSpain. In an account that he sent to the imperial court one reads that the kingof the Aztecs had bowed to the Emperor because he held [the Emperor] to be thesame Lord of luminous beings and superior essence \"from which had issued his ownancestors.\" Montezuma had also been about to permit Cortez to appropriate allthe idols . . . that is until he, the king—imprisoned by the gold-hungryconquerors and mortally wounded by them—understood who they really were. Herefused to allow them to treat his wounds and, energetically resisting the ideaof converting to Christianity, wished for nothing more than death. And he diddie, the victim of a frightful mistake. ( lortez wis the envoy of the Pope andthe Catholic emperor and not at all of the\"White God\" for whom [the king] and his people had been waiting so long. ThisWhite God was to have come from the ancient land ofTulla or Tullan (which,according to their beliefs, had once been \"a country of the sun\" but \"where nowice reigned\" and where \"the sun had disappeared\")—that is to say: from Thule.Rather than the servants of 1 uci-fer, those whom they had greeted . . . werethe representatives of that \"ilk\" which, shamelessly, dishonors the lace of ourmother the Earth with its filth and its horrors. : ''That \"ilk,\" of course, is the Catholic Church.Ironically, it would be Rahn's organization that would most permanently beidentified with dishonoring the face of the Earth with filth and horror; for itshould be remembered that this was the same organization that commissioned theinfamous medical experimentation taking place at Dachau and other camps; anagenda fully consistent with the Ahnenerbe's program of \"scientific\" research.There has been no complete and comprehensive study of the Ah-nenerbe in Englishso far, and we will not attempt to do so here. However, let us examine severalof the separate sections of this eerie operation by studying the documents thatwere saved from destruction after the war. By doing so, we will find that theAhnenerbc is really the best evidence we have that the SS was a fullyconstituted cult. It the SS was Himmler's pagan answer to the Jesuits—as hasbeen suggested many times, and by the Nazis themselves—then the Ahnenerbc was akind of seminary and teaching college for the future leaders <>l the ThousandYear Reich.The Rune ScholarsAmong the documents that comprise the Ahnenerbc collection at the NationalArchives is an undated manuscript that was evidently intended to accompanyHimmler's most famous \"Christmas gift: the red clay candlestick that was to beburned on the nighl ol the winter solstice by all faithful SS leaders.There is no space here to quote the document completely, and indeed it was meantto accompany some ninety-three illustrations which have not survived with thedocument. However, parts of this interesting work are worthy of translation here as they represent nothing less than acomplete introduction to the subject of runes, from the point of view of a Nazischolar working for the Ahnenerbe-SS. The document begins:The Reichsfiihrer-SS has sent to all SS Leaders the beautiful Swedish peasantcandlestick, fired in red clay, that stands here before us as a symbolicalChristmas—or Yule—offering. It is a replica of a piece that is located in thecollection of the Deutsche Ahnenerbe in Berlin which, on the other hand, isitself a replica of the original that was stored in the Staten Historik Museumin Stockholm and which came from Hallands Province.Such peasant candlesticks in fired clay in the shape of a tower we find not onlyin Sweden, in Scandinavia and in North Germania [sic] but likewise in SouthGermania here in Germany, for instance in Westphalia.It is worthwhile to point out that the use of the word \"Germania\" refers to theancient Teutonic kingdom and not to Germany proper, which is referred to asDeutschland in the original.The anonymous author then goes on for thirty-five, single-spaced pages todescribe not only the candlestick itself but the whole history of the runes, anddoes not resist taking a few potshots at Christianity in the process. Some ofthis will be incomprehensible to those not well versed in runic symbols, but afew paragraphs will give one a taste of the type of scholarship-cum-ideologythat is the hallmark of Ahnenerbe publications:Both the Germanic God-Runes and God-Names— hagal and man, mensch —become, at theChristianizing of the Rune Calendar, Christus, translated as the God-Son, whichin the Germanic meaning is represented as hagal for \"the creators of the mostancient world,\" i.e., of Time and Space. This old German deity, Tuisco (\"fromGod\" or \"from heaven descended\") as well as Tuisto (\"the Twofold Name\") as theRoman Tacitus in the First Century relates in his hook about Germania, comesfrom a word meaning \"Earth Born.The hagal rune had a life of its own, of course, h became the title ol a runicmagazine published by Rudolf John Gorsleben, a friend ofDietrich Eckart and onetime lecturer at Thulc Society headquarters in Munich andlater managed by Werner von Biilou after Gorsleben's death in 1930. (Gorslebenhad served during the First World W.u with a Turkish regiment in Arabia, andthus was probably on the re ceiving end or the Arab forces under that brilliantmilitary strategist, T.E. Lawrence.) The bagal rune—which is really an asterisk— accumulated a wealth of mystical and magical associations under Gorsleben's\"scholarship.\" It became the mother ot all runes, as each of the individualrunes could be discovered hidden within it. To Gors leben, the hagal runesignified nothing less than a mystical diagram for attaining unity with God. 30It is also owing to Gorsleben that we first encounter an occult traditionconcerning crystals, something that is enjoying a rebirth among the New Agers oftoday. Later, concerning a different rune we read:And a thousand years afterwards we discover this 'Son ot the All-Father and theEarth\": Thor or Donar . . . He, the Born-Again, who overcomes the wintry powerof darkness and death, rousing all life from the tombs once more, is representedas a figure with upraised arms. 1 lis rune th fore is the symbolic sign of theupraised arms, two- or three-pointed; the former, the two-pointed Y Y K ^ e runc^ Anglo-Saxon name cen or \"Light\", and the latter the W VJ three-pointed m rune,called \"Man\" (Old Nordic madhr, Anglo-Saxon man\\ and aw Old Nordic peasantrune-song says of this rune that it \"gladdens man and makes the earth increase.\"The \"All-Father\" is, of course, a Teutonic pagan term for Cod. It may beremembered that Sebottendorfl \\ secret Order was called the GermanenordenAll-Father And The Holy Grail, and that Sebotten-dorff's Order publication was(under the influence of Gorsleben and other Aryan cultists) entitled Runes.Further along, we find a slanting attack on the Church:This is the legacy of the Celtic Old Ones, of the most supreme 1 leaven-Fatherand Earth-Mother, which depict the- Year-Wheel and the Soul; the Aryan, Germanicancestral legacy, the former ( hnstmas when the Yule Candlestick—reaching to theNear-Wheel (lod - stands silent next to the Soul of the Earth Mother which,revolving, spins upward.Now, in conclusion, it remains only to clarify a final symbol. Whence comes this\"Soul\" that belongs to the Earth-Mother which, according to the ancient Aryanmyth becomes the Heaven-Son, the \"Joy of Man\"? What is the origin of those \"RedHearts\" which later become prominent on images of the Virgin Mary, the Mother ofthe Son of God Jesus Christ whose festival the Roman Church only decided in theFourth Century AD to celebrate on December 25th, the ancient Aryan WinterSolstice festival? . . . We must turn our gaze back to that Ur-time when ourNordic, peasant ancestors of the New Stone Age erected those mighty clan dolmensthree to four millennia before Christ: the \"Giants' Beds\" of which only a few innorth Germany have survived the irreverent vandalism and brutal profiteering ofthe past two centuries.Much of the foregoing would find a respectable home in any New Age or paganpublication today. Much of it is familiar to students of mythology and theoccult. But as we wind up the Odinist ferverino, we once again come crashinginto a reminder of just who is writing this thesis, and why:Long ago our ancestor, that noble Nordic wife and mother, guardian of her familyand of the meaning of the Homeland, was sacred; she to whom one could go—Seeressand Race-Mother—in order to know what was fit and proper. \"We bow in reverencebefore the image of the German mother,\" said our Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmleron the last Reich's Peasantry Day in Goslar. And so a German doctor oncerecognized the most-sacred image of our ancestral legacy, Earth Mother andRace-Mother, the miracle of the love of the Nordic Mother-Soul: that the sacredand eternal Homeland is renewed from her womb, embracing life, as she preservesand protects unsullied the most sacred spiritual and mental values of Family andRace.And Frigga, Isis, Mary are merely names, Transient veils of the hallowed womb.The stars, suns and men's souls . . .No mortal lips can praise your Majesty enough.() incline, Mother, your divine countenanceAnd guide us to our sweet home in the Eternal 1 Lght.We but wish co stand in faithful watch on the soulot the 1 [omelandi on the Living Tree ol our Race,and by its luhrcr.' 1One can see how these 'lapsed Catholics\" still needed their do saccharin-sweetsentiments and sloppy poetry to get them through the night. The difference wasthe projection of the Catholic Church—poisoned by the Jewish Satan, Jehovah, and corrupted from a pure, Aryan versionof an ancient deity, Krist—as one aspect o\\ the enenn against which they werefinally rebelling. One could otter sonic arm chair psychology on this point,that the repressive sexual, social, and moral environment of Roman Catholicismcontributed to this tremendous backlash against anything Christian; that it wasnecessary to deny the basic tenets of Christianity in order to wreak unspeakablehavoc on the Jews; and that there were enough Catholic priests and bishopsaround to accommodate the Nazis—sometimes eagerly—that the ^ must have felt theywere on the right track, anyway. But if Rome was not the spiritual homeland ofthe Race, where were the occult secrets really being kept?The Iceland ProjectAs we have seen, the Nazis viewed Iceland as the last surviving link to theirancestral homeland, Thule. This was an inheritance from their Ascended Master,Sebottendorff, who understood Ultima I hula, the famous destination of Pytheasin the fourth century BC, to be identical to Iceland. For them, Thulecorresponded to their own Atlantis myth; while the rest of the human race mighthave descended I mm monkeys, the Nazis were convinced that the Aryan racedescended from heaven. (Hence that discussion of the Mensch and Hagal runes assymbolic of a \"descent from heaven\" of the real \"Menschen, the Aryan Man.) Theybelieved that the Icelandic Eddns contained secret keys to their own history,and that possibly more clues still existed on that tiny republic in the form ofdolmens, ancient caves, and prehistoric monuments, etc.To galvanize support for a pan-Nordic union against the subhu-mans, theyarranged for the formation of something called the Nordic Gesellschaft, orNordic Society: an organization headquartered in I U beck that was a pet projectof mystic race theorist Alfred Rosenberg, by now a Reichsleiter and member ofHitlers innermost circle. Yearafter year Rosenberg would address this society composed of members fromFinland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and, of course, Iceland to warn them of theimmediate danger to the \"white race\" coming from the East, and of the essentialunity of the Nordic peoples—based on race and mystic ancestry—demanded by thecombined Soviet, Jewish, and Masonic threat.To get an idea of who attended such meetings and of what was discussed, we onlyhave to read an article in the official Nazi newspaper, Volkischer Beobachter,concerning one such event, attended by both Rosenberg and Soil-Mystic Darre (acofounder of the Ahnen-erbe):The conclusion of the 5 th Reichs-Convention of the Nordic Society in Liibeckgained special importance from a grand speech by Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg .. .. . . the first speaker, National Librarian Dr. Gudmundur Finbogason ofRekjavik, presented a lecture about Icelandic-German cooperation in the field ofNordic Science.Subsequently State Council Johann E. Mellye, the president of the NorwegianPeasantry Association, spoke concerning the Norwegian Peasant Movement. ProtocolSecretary Carl Patric Ossbahr, Stockholm, then spoke concerning Sweden'sNorth-European mission . . .Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg heartily greeted the German and Northern countryparticipants and then began to speak . . .The Reichsleiter reminded us ... of the grave military and revolutionary eventstaking place in the Far East, the Near East, and in Spain. If the Scandinaviannorth and the Baltic states have been spared to some extent from politicalearthquake tremors, such signifies no more than a temporary reassuring momentfor these people and for Europe altogether, and is not to be understood as asign that these people and these nations themselves are able to escape thelarger problems forever. The struggle between Tradition in its various forms andanother Breed coming forth for a New Era shall become everyone's destiny.\"Germany stands since 1933,\" so the Reichsleiter drove home, \"before thequestion: whether historical survival has come to an end or if the gravity ofthese events directly constitutes the makings for a renaissance.After a great struggle within the soul of the German people the entire nationfinally agrees about the personality of the liihrer ... In only a few yearsAdolf Millers Germany has reaped the harvest of an entire millennium.\"This historical fact is big enough to demand attention. It must nam rallyextend widely beyond political limits because German problems. the first ofwhich are the immediate social-political oiks, are also the problems of theremaining peoples. The evolution of the other nations might go more graduallysince they are not under m\\ immediate force of destiny; still these problems arealso theirs.\"We all stand under the same European destiny, and must feci obliged to thiscommon destiny, because finally the existence of the white man dependsaltogether upon the unity of the European continent! Unanimous must we opposethat terrible attempt by Moscow to destroy the world, that sea of blood intowhich already main people have dived!\" (Strongest applause!)' 2The Nordic Gesellschaft even made the ailing Dr. Alfred Ploetz founder of theInstitute for Race Hygiene and the Nazis 1 most prestigious (if ratherreluctant) race theorist—an honorary member about a year before he died. 33 Thuswere the worlds of \"scientific racism' 1 or Social Darwinist eugenics andmystical Nordic paganism and anthropology linked, and to them both the politicalagenda of the Third Reich, which involved not only Lebensraum and a \"drive tothe last but also the extermination of the indigenous populations of the lastern countries. That Rosenberg and Darre would both attend these meetings issignificant, for these men were the premiere pagans in Hitler's inner circle.Where Himmler wished to surround himself with the trappings of atwentieth-century secret society based partly on the Jesuits, partly on theMasons, and partly on the Templars, Rosenberg and Darre eschewed secretsocieties and occult lodges for a more general, more popular state-organizedpagan religion designed to replace Christianity forever. While Himmler sharedthese ideas to a large tent, he was not likely to be seen stumping town to townfor state paganism. He wanted to conduct his rituals in secret, far from theprying eyes of the profane.Thus, while Rosenberg and Darre were doing their best to create the illusion ofa pan-Nordic community, Himmler was authorizing missions to Iceland—underAhnencrbc auspices—to search for pagan relics.Thus we read—in a document addressed to the Ahnencrbc from Dr. Bruno Schweizerat Dermoid, dated March 10, 1938—of .i proposed research trip to Iceland thatsummer:Plan for an Iceland Research JourneyFrom year to year it becomes more difficult to meet living witnesses of Germaniccultural feelings and Germanic soul attitudes on the classical Icelandic soiluninfluenced by the overpowerful grasp of western civilization. In only a fewyears has the natural look of the country, which since the Ur-time has remainedmostly untouched in stone and meadow, in desert and untamed mountain torrents,revealed its open countenance to man and has fundamentally changed frommountainsides and rock slabs to manicured lawns, nurseries and pasture grounds,almost as far from Reykjavik as the barren coast section, a feat accomplished bythe hand of man; the city itself expands with almost American speed as roadwaysand bridges, power stations and factories emerge and the density of the trafficin Reykjavik corresponds with that of a European city.. . . the people forget such ancient techniques as . . . the forge- andwoodworker's art, the methods of grass- and milk-cultivation, spinning, weaving,dyeing; they forget the old legends and myths that were once narrated on longwinter evenings, the songs and the art of the old verses; they lost the beliefin a transcendent nature . . . Their innate Germanic sobriety becomes coldcalculation; pure material interests then step to the foreground; theintelligentsia migrates to the capital and from there swiftly assimilatesinternational tendencies. Genuine Germanic vigor in Iceland is also oftentransformed into speculation and not at all through real trade; excessive prideof homeland drives them to want to be 150% more modern and progressive than therest of Europe. This then often permits the present-day Icelander to appear inan unfavorable light and thus can not usually avoid giving a good German visitora bad first impression.These situations determine our research plan.Every year that we wait quietly means damage to a number of objects, and otherobjects become ruined for camera and film due to newfangled public buildings inthe modern style. For the work in question only the summer is appropriate, thatis, the months of June through August. Furthermore, one must reckon thatoccasionally several rainy days can occur, delaying thereby certain photographicwork. The ship connections are such that it is perhaps only possible to go toand from the Continent once a week.All this means a minimum period of from 5-6 weeks for the framework of the trip.The possible tasks of an Iceland research trip with a cultural knowledge missionare greatly variegated. Therefore it remains for us to lelecionly the most immediate and most realizable. A variety of other tasks. . . should be considered as additional assignments.Thus the recording of human linages (race-measurements) ana 1 the im i tigationof museum treasures are considered to be additional assignment (My italics,P.L.)The following year, Dr. Schweizer proposed the creation of an Icelandic-Germandictionary to help those future Nazi \"researchers\" intheir endeavors, and was joined in this concept by other men of science. It isnot known just to what extent the Icelandic people welcomed this quiet invasionof German scholars bent on performing \"race measurements\" on their citizens, orphotographing valuable museum pieces for possible later, ah, \"acquisition.\"Surely, the SS would have considered anything Aryan in the Icelandic museums asfair game for export, objects for further study and for research into theirAryan forebears.But Iceland—Ultima Thule—was not the only piece ol real estate to which theNazis associated a peculiar Aryan heritage. One ol the most important was thatsad and bleeding country that has not stopped hemorrhaging since the early daysof the Second World War and whose destiny has become such a matter ofinternational publicity and concern. We are speaking, of course, of Tibet.The Tibet ExpeditionAt dinner [Himmler] talked to me on various scientific questions and told meabout an expedition to Tibet. 35—S< HI LLENBERGOne of the more controversial stories circulating about the occull activities and interests of the Third Reich concerns Tibet. Much is made of theNazi-Tibet connection in Pauwels and Bergier's Morning of tin-Magicians (Lematin des magiciens), a sixties international bestseller whose sometimesoutrageous claims of magical forces and sinister conspiracies overshadowed amore serious message that discovers in the occult underworld of the Third Reichthe seeds of a spiritual crisis about to be born.It was therefore with some skepticism that the author approached the vastmicrofilmed records of the Captured German Documents Section of the NationalArchives to see whether or not there was evidence for such a mysterious\"connection,\" and was rewarded by the discovery that several complete rolls ofmicrofilm—representing hundreds of pages of documents—record nothing but theefforts and adventures of the SS-Tibet Expedition led by that tireless promoterof Tibetology in all its forms, Dr. Ernst Schafer of the Ahnenerbe. 36What is even more striking is that the records contain not only Schafer'spersonal and official correspondence, his Tibet notebooks, and his personal SSfile, but also clippings from German newspapers chronicling the \"SS-TibetExpedition\" in all its glory. 37What is compelling in these records is the day-to-day story of Schafer'sstruggle to get his various expeditions off the ground: searching for thefunding, permissions, and support from the Nazi government that were not alwaysforthcoming. It would seem that Schafer's primary goal in trekking through theHimalayas was more scientific in nature—and hence of less immediate value—thanthe Reich leadership was willing to accommodate. After all, much of Schafer'sreporting has less to do with concerns of a military value than it does with theflora and fauna of this inaccessible land. Schafer's academic credentials werein zoology and botany, with some courses in geology, geography, and ethnology.He seems to have been marching in Sven Hedin's footsteps and was indeed for atime the head of the Sven Hedin Institute, the organization based in Munich thatalso became a \"Reichs Institute\" and eventually a separate section of theAhnenerbe-SS. 38 As mentioned earlier, the files also contain correspondencefrom Hedin to Schafer as late as July 27, 1942, in which Hedin signs himself asIhr treu und aufrichtig ergebener (\"Your faithful and sincerely devoted . . .\")w after forwarding greetings from his sister, to Schafer's wife, and to theKurator of the Ahnenerbe, Dr. Wiist. Schafer's SS personnel file shows one tripto East and Central Tibet from 1934— 1936 and another to Tibet (the officialSS-Tibet Expedition referred to in the press) from April 1938 to August 1939 ...in other words, during the period of the so-called \"phony war\" that predated theinvasion of Poland in September of 1939. 40 Thus, we cannot rule out thehypothesis thai Schafer was involved in something more than butterfly gatheringin this historic (and official) trek to the Himalayas at a timeof great international crisis and global tensions. To be sure, NJiafer was notback in Germany two months before preparations were being made to organize aTibetan-North Indian strike force to oust the British from their rule in India.'1Ernst Schafer was born in Cologne (Koln) on March 14, 1910, the son of animportant industrialist and director of the Phoenix Rubber Company, and attendedschool in Heidelberg and Gbttingen before becoming part of a Tibet expeditionorganized by the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia in 1930, whenSchafer was onl\\ twenty years old. He then became a member of the AmericanBrooke Dolan expedition to Siberia, China, and Tibet in 193 1In 1933, Hitler became chancellor of German)- .\\nd it appears as it Schafer wasone of the \"March violets\" who got on the Nazi bandwagon after Hitlerconsolidated his political power that spring. His membership number in the NaziParty was 4690995, and his personnel record shows membership in the SS asbeginning in the summer of 1933, rising in rank to Untersturmftihrer in 1936,Obersturm-fuhrer in 1937, Hauptsturmfiihrer in 1938 and finally toSturmbann-fiihrer in 1942. He had also been awarded the coveted Totenkopfring,or Death's Head Ring, which was the rune-inscribed piece of SS i elry designedby vblkisch occultist Karl Wiligut (described in the following chapter on OttoRahn), and was a member ot Himmler's Personal Staff (as was Wiligut). All ofthis is mentioned to demonstrate that Dr. Schafer was nothing if not the idealSS man, at least on paper. The orders raising him in rank were signed byHimmlcr, and his fiancee had to undergo the usual investigation ol her racialbackground as the prospective spouse of an SS officer. ( I he\\ were married—evidently with the blessing of the Reichsfiihrer -SS in December of 1939,and were busy dutifully producing Aryan offspring three daughters by 1944.)But as an academic, Schafer's published works Include- according to his SSdossier— Berge, Buddhas undB&ren {Mountains, Buddhas and Bears oh my!),Unbekanntes Tibet (Unknown Tibet), and Dachderl {Roof of the World). Among hisarticles can be found this typical one in English: \"Four New Birds from Tibet\"in the 1937 Proceeding* oj the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, So,Ernsi Schafer was also a scientist who published regularly in respected journalson hisdiscoveries, and an explorer who emulated the master, Sven Hedin, by writingbooks about his travels in the mysterious East.Thus, we have established that Dr. Schafer was a man of many parts: one part SSofficer and one part scholar, one part explorer and one part scientist: a NaziIndiana Jones.Schafer was a career scientist who does not seem to have been interested only inthe possible military potential of his travels in Tibet but kept meticulousnotes on the religious and cultural practices of the Tibetans, from theirvarious colorful lamaistic festivals to Tibetan attitudes toward marriage, rape,menstruation, childbirth, homosexuality (and even masturbation). For instance,in his account of Tibetan homosexuality he goes so far as to describe thevarious positions taken by older lamas with younger boys and then proceeds toinform his audience how homosexuality played a significant role in the higherpolitics of Tibet. 43One wonders how Schafer was privy to such intimate detail of Tibetan sexualpractices, and then comes across a report by SS-Ober-sturmfiihrer and filmmakerErnst Krause (who was part of the SS-Tibet Expedition of 1938-39) dutifullyrecording his personal observation of a fifteen-year-old Lachung girlmasturbating on a bridge beam. 44 (It is not known whether Krause took advantageof this opportunity to film this particular episode, but the author was startledto discover that a collection of his film clips—silent, black and white— havesurvived and may be viewed at Tibet House in New York City in VHS cassetteformat; certainly this is one of the most intriguing video documents of theThird Reich.)There are pages of such careful observation of the local people engaged in avariety of intimate acts that would otherwise have been performed privately hadit not been for the ever-present and watchful eyes of the Master Race.Happily, not all of Schafer's observations were of the sexual habits of theLachung and other Himalayan peoples, nor of the flora and fauna, as thefollowing article from the Nazi Volkischer Beobachter of July 29, 1939, relates:Dr. Ernst Schafer, SS-Hauptscurmfilhrer, has now completed the first ( Kim. mSS-Tibci Expedition with extraordinarily great success and willsoon return to (iermany with his guides. The participants ol the expedi-tion visited, as the first Germans, the capital of Tibet, Lhasa, the scat of theDalai Lama, as well as Tibet's second-largest city, Shigatse, the capital of thePanchen Lama, and visited the huge monastery of Tasch-timmps first visited in1907 by Sven Hedin. By comparison, Svcn Hedin's Trans-Himalaya's discoveriesrequired several trips to accomplish. The harvest of the expedition regardingbotanical dnd zoological collections is uncommonly rich and rare and of greatvainAnd an article from DerNeue Tag dated July 21, 1939, is even morenformative: 46Sacred Tibetan Scripture Acquired by the Dr. Schafer-Expedition on Nine AnimalLoads Across the High-Country(Special) Frankfurt —20 July The Tibet Expedition of Dr. Ernst Schafer, whichduring its expedition through Tibet stayed a long time in Lhasa and in thecapital of the Panchen Lama, Shigatse, is presently on its return trip toGermany. Since the monsoons began unusually early, the return march of theexpedition was hastened in order to secure the shipment of the preciouscollections. The expedition has singularly valuable scientific research resultsto inventory. In addition to outstanding accomplishments in the areas ofgeophysical and earth-magnetic research they succeeded in obtaining an extrarich ethnological collection including, along with cult objects, many articlesand tools of daily life.With the help of the regent of Lhasa it was Dr. Schafer who also succeeded inobtaining the Kangschur, the extensive, 108-volumc sacred script of theTibetans, which required nine animal loads to transport. Also especiallyextensive are the zoological and botanical collections thai the expedition hasalready shipped, in part, to Germany the remainder of which they will bringthemselves. The zoological collection includes the total bird-fauna of theresearch area. Dr. Schafer was also able, for the first time, to bag a Schapi, ahitherto unknown wild goat. About SO live animals are on the way to Germany,while numerous other live animals are still with the expedition. An extensiveherbarium of all existing plants is also on its way. Furthermore, valuablegeographical <\\nd earth-historical accomplishments were made. Difficultiesencountered due to political tensions with the English authorities wereeliminated due to personal contact between Dr. Schafer and members of theBritish authorities in Shangtse, so that the unimpeded return of the expeditionout of Tibet with its valuable collections was guaranteed.No further mention is made of the sacred scriptures, the Kangschur, which is thecore document of Tibetan Buddhism, and I have been unable to discover whathappened to it after the war, though (for reasons too complex to discuss here) Isuspect it wound up in a museum in Vienna. (It is worthwhile noting that nowherein the above-mentioned article does the term \"SS\" appear, or \"Nazi.\" Der NeueTag was a newspaper published in Prague, and the article was printed only twomonths before Blitzkrieg began. In an identical article published the followingday in the Hannoversches Tageblatt —a German newspaper—the missing \"SS\" in\"SS-Tibet Expedition\" is faithfully restored.)Sadly, a search of other articles from the same period do not reveal thedisposition of the 108 volumes of sacred scripture.An interesting aside to this story of the official SS expedition to Tibet isrevealed by a list of the expedition members. They include one Dr. Bruno Beger,an anthropologist. Later, Dr. Beger would become better known as one of thescientists who—working for Professor Hirt of the Ahnenerbe—was involved in thecollection of 115 human skeletons at Auschwitz for inclusion in a NaziAnthropological Museum. 47 Assisted by one Dr. Fleischhacker, Beger selected theskeletons while their owners were still alive as Jewish, Polish, and Asiaticprisoners of the death camps. The \"specimens\" were then murdered at Natzweilerconcentration camp in such a way as to avoid damaging the skeletal material andtheir bodies were shipped out for scientifically managed decomposition.Beger's \"mentor\" according to interviews with other Nazi scientists was the sameDr. Ernst Schafer, 48 and Beger even provided Schafer with a collection of Asianskulls while he was collecting over a hundred \"Jewish Commissar\" skulls for theBerlin Institute. Another colleague of both Beger and Schafer was the botanist,Dr. Vollmar Vareschi, whom we find at the Sven Hedin Institute in Munich when heisn't attending lectures with his friends on various pseudoscientific topics. 49Dr. Hirt himself was also involved in the notorious study of the effects ofmustard gas on yet another 150 prisoners at Natzweiler.Much has been made of this expedition, and elsewhere it has been suggested thatthe \"earth-magnetic\" and \"geophysical*' studies— undertaken in the inhospitableterrain of the Himalayas during a timeof the greatest international crisis—were actually experiments conducted byorder of the Reichsfiihrer-SS himself; that is, that they were bizarrescientific attempts to prove the World Ice Theory, a theor) which—had it beenproven—would have provided the Third Reich with an invaluable weapon against itsenemies.The Hbrbiger DoctrineAmong the intimidatingly vast accumulation of Ahnenerbe documents on microfilmat the Archives are manuscripts, journal articles, and newspaper clippingsconcerning the Welt-Eis-Lehre or World Ice Theory once popularized by Austrianengineer Hans Horbiger, \" a favorite of both Eckart and Hitler. Horbiger'svision of a universe composed of spinning balls and particles of ice managed toaccount for even' crank cosmological theory from Atlantis to Lemuria andobviously owed a great deal to Madame Blavatsky's idea that the Earth is farolder than the geologists tell us it is, and that it once had multiple moons and— natiirlich! —multiple root-races. Horbiger's ideas were embraced by some SouthAmerican occultists of the author's acquaintance who believe to this dayHorbiger's contention that the Andes Mountains were once the site of an advancedcivilization since its peaks were the only land mass above sea level during oneof the last great Ice Age \"melt-downs\" . . . about six thousand years ago!Indeed, the Chilean author and Nazi mystic Miguel Serano subscribes to similartheories."},{"pageContent":"The details of the World Ice Theory are too tedious to go into here; suffice itto say that the concept of a universe composed of little more than ice crystalsin various stages of formation and deformation corresponded neatly with vblkiscbinstincts. After all, Nordic Man was a creature of the ice fields and thus thenatural ancestor of the human race: the being most fit to rule in a universecomposed entirely ol snow. (Where Sartre will one day see Nothingness at theroot of the chestnut tree and recoil in horror, Horbiger saw only sleet, andrejoiced.) Did not the ancient Nordic legends refer to the land of ice at thetop of the world, the Teutonic Atlantis or Ultima Thule, as the origin of allLife? And doesn't the very whiteness of ice and snow itself suggest certain, ah,racial characteristics consonant with the divine source of the universe?It was probably no accident that Horbiger counted among his closest friendsOttocar Prohaszka, the Catholic bishop who acted as ideologue for the fanaticalNazi Arrow Cross Party of Hungary.The real value of the World Ice Theory to the Nazis—aside from the fact that itrepresented an alternative, underdog science, and the Nazis were always lookingfor alternatives—was its supposed utility in weather forecasting. The nationthat could accurately predict the weather far into the future was obviously thenation with an edge in military strategy. One need only recall how weatherpatterns disrupted many Nazi campaigns—from the freak flood that destroyed muchof Rommel's materiel in North Africa to the severe winter that blocked Nazivictory in Russia—to know how important it was for the Reich to have a corner onmeteorology.For instance, a publication entitled Zur Welteismeteorologie (On World IceMeteorology) by a Dr. E. Dinies, published by the Reichs Office for WeatherService in Berlin in 1938, quotes from Horbiger's \"epic work\" Glazialkosmogonie(Glacial Cosmology) and provides tables of data comparing ice temperature andair temperature for relative humidity values.With some (perhaps unconscious?) irony, the editors of the Nazi studentnewspaper Rhein-Mainische Studentenzeitung summed up the problem best in theirlead for a series of brief articles on the World Ice Theory. Dated June 1, 1938,the lead-in reads:Our time is rich in theories about the formation and structure of the world.Frequently these days such matters are dealt with by laymen. In our opinion onlyscientists and experts can successfully answer these kinds of questions. Forinstance, there has been a great deal of talk in recent years about the WorldIce Theory. We have asked therefore a variety of scientists to tell us theirposition on the questions piling up concerning the World Ice Theory and we offerthem now to the public. 52And the paper goes on to compare the theories of Horbiger and his coauthor Fauthto those of Galileo!In a manuscript authored by an anonymous SS-Obersturmfiihrcr, we note the sameattempt to put the World Ice Theory into a purely scientific\" framework, withthe same unselfconscious irony:The Need and Format of a New Implementation of the World he TheoryAs the Reichsfiihrer-SS himself firsi spoke out in support of the Vienneseengineer Hans Horbiger's World [ce Theory, he offered, by wa) of substantiation,the following: \"Hans HSrbiger's monument doesn't need to wait a hundred yearsbefore it is built; one can employ these ideas even today.\" Of course, theimplementation of the World he Theory ordered by the Reichsfiihrer-SS must beplanned in accord with scientific methodology. Thus is the manner of working inthe Administration for Scientific Research in the Ahnenerbe unambiguously setforth. At the same time, however, a change from the usual method of implementingthe World Ice Theory has been decided upon as well:A scientifically thorough study of the World Ice Theory, together with a proofof its veracity, should be preserved from false teachers. This is only whatofficial science attempts to do itself.Do we note the presence of a slight inferiority complex? Or was there someinternecine conflict over the manner in which the World Ice Theory was beinghandled by nonscientists within the Ahnenerbe? After all, the theory was a petproject of many occultists and believers in Atlantis, including one of thefounders of the Ahnenerbe, 1 lermann Wirth. This document, dated December 9,1937, might have been part of the ammunition used by a faction within the WorldIce department of the Ahnenerbe (probably being led by that earnest soul, Dr.Scultetus, who wanted the occultists out of the World Ice department so that hecould conduct appropriately ^scientific experiments p ing its validity) thateventually convinced Himmler to put the theory to the test in the frozen wastesof the Himalayas, where variations in altitude, humidity, and temperature couldbe meticulously recorded with the same vivid intensity that Lachung sexualpracrices were observed and logged and the truth—or myth—of the World Ice Iheor) established at last.Schafer returned home from Tibet in the summer ol 1939. By Sep tember, the worldhad changed forever. And on the summer solstice of 1941—a date sacred to thepagan calendar, to the cultists at Pader-born, Detmold, and hxternsteine, and tothe memory of the saerihual lamb, Walter Rathenau— Hitler invaded the SovietUnion, thus ripping the veil from before the tabernacle of the Jeuish.Masonic-Bolshevik cabal.Only a month later, and he was two hundred miles outside Moscow, within easystriking distance of total victory in Russia.And then—inexplicably, astoundingly— he decided to wait.Historians will never agree on why Hitler chose this disastrous strategy. Hesent crucial divisions to Leningrad and the Ukraine while the main army waitedin position for two months before moving on Moscow. It bought the Soviets allthe time they needed, for in October the snow—the politically correct, white,white snow—began to fall.Six months later, the Nazis had lost over one million dead in the freezingwastelands outside Moscow. In summer uniforms, light boots, no winter clothingat all of any kind, the Germans lost more men to the ravages of winter than toSoviet machine guns. Out of the 162 divisions thrown against the Red Army, onlyeight were combat-ready in the spring of 1942. Why did Hitler wait?Because the Horbigerians—under the auspices of the Ahnenerbe's meteorologicaldivision—had predicted a mild winter.The Knighty Death, and the DoubleThe SS-Tibet Expedition was not composed simply of a handful of academics whogot caught up in the war, but of dedicated Nazi scientists with their ownagenda; men who were constitutionally capable of using the \"raw material\" of theconcentration camps for their own research, research which was designed tosupport the blatantly occult racial, anthropological, and archaeologicaltheories of the Third Reich, specifically of Himmler's Black Order, the SS.How could otherwise sane, scientifically trained professional men becomeinvolved in such gruesome and sadistic activity? Dr. Robert J. Lifton, who hasspent twenty years studying the Nazi doctors, has suggested the psychologicalphenomenon known as \"doubling,\" 54 a kind of splitting apart of the personalityto accommodate two types of reality, the normal and the obscene. It may be safeto say that this is also a phenomenon common to many people who become involvedin the occult. It is usually necessary lor serious occultists to conductthemselves appropriately in the \"real world\" while simultaneously maintainingprivately held, complex belief systems that have little incommon with the beliefs of those around them. This is much more than simplybelieving in a different religion or belonging to an unpopular political party.Frequently, the occultist is operating with a totally different set of moral andspiritual values, a set based on aw alternative view of the world. The seriousoccultist of, saw Germany has much more in common with the occultist of NewOrleans or Bangkok than the Roman Catholic has with the Lutheran of any country.It is for this reason that occultists are frequently reviled everywhere they arcfound, for their secret beliefs and practices are considered heinous andinimical to the well-being of the State.In Nazi Germany, however, the State became an occult organization and the secretbeliefs and practices of a select coven of deranged occultists became theofficial policy of the nation/Scientists, doctors. and professional people inevery field found themselves \"doubling\" to the extent that what would beconsidered normal, civilized behavior in a healthy society had to be suppressedin favor of a fanatic belief in the purity of the race and the sacred mission ofthe Occult Messiah. Science was still expected to carry on, however, andscientists found themselves making their knowledge and method subservient to theNew Religion.This might have been a bit harder to swallow had it not been for the fact thatsocial conditions and official policies in the rest oi the world seemed to favorthe Nazi programs. Eugenics policies in the United States were looked upon forconfirmation of the Nazi eugenics programs; prestigious American financiers suchas Henry lord wholeheartedly supported—with cash donations—the Nazi Party fromits infancy; the wholesale slaughter of the Native American population in theUnited States was a practical model for the Nazi Lebensraum program andparticularly for the genocide of Jews, Gypsies, and other indigenous populationsof Eastern Europe; the Catholic Church supported the Party's anti-Communistcrusade; and the British, alter all, gave us the world's first concentrationcamps.Therefore, it became obscenely easy for an armchair academic to suddenly findhimself (and this was, remember, an exclusively male environment) encouraged togo into the \"field\" .is it were and collect human skulls by examining theirliving owners in advance. All tor the sake of scientific research, of course.The cult had made it easy to suspend normal modes of conduct; as in any cult,the cult leadershipThe Black Orderdecides what is, and is not, moral. The cult leader is the sole interpreter ofthe sacred texts. Within the sex cults, for instance, the laws and taboospertaining to sexual morality in society at large were abrogated in favor of theoccult version; adultery was no longer a crime, as an example, and even soprestigious an occult ancestor as John Dee was known to have swapped wives(albeit reluctantly) with his assistant, Edward Kelley, on the advice of anAngelic being. 55 The Judeo-Christian injunctions against murder, fornication,and adultery were similarly suspended under the leadership of David Koresh, forinstance, at his commune near Waco, Texas. In that environment, previousmarriages were effectively \"annulled\" by Koresh, who saw it as his prerogativeto sleep with the wives of the male members of the cult and even with theirunderage daughters. The relevant point to be made is that the cult allowed thisactivity; Koresh's moral universe was reinforced by the acquiescence of hisfollowers and became the only real moral standard for the \"chosen.\" In theirview, the rest of the world crawled blindly through a swamp of spiritualignorance, victim of conspiracies and evil, vested interests. The rest of theworld was to be feared, for it could not allow such a beautiful creation as the(Branch Davidians, Temple of God, Nazi Party) to exist.This is the famous Fiihrerprinzip (Fiihrer Principle) in action.Perhaps, then it would be fitting to end this chapter with a quote from a songcomposed by some concentration camp prisoners forced to build Himmler's GrailCastle at Wewelsburg:And the stones are hard, but our step is firmAs we carry along the picks and the spadesAnd in our hearts,In our hearts the sorrow,O Wewelsburg, I cannot forget youBecause you are my fate . . .And whatever our future is,Nevertheless we say \"yes \" to life.Because soon a day will comeAnd we will be free! SGBy 1943, some 1,285 concentration camp inmates had gained their freedom . . .and were buried in the red earth of Westphalia or burned in the crematorium atNiederhagen.#7#Lucifer's Quest for the Holy GrailAs long as I live I will think ofSabarthes, of Montsegur, of the Grail castle,and of the Grail itself that may have been the treasure of the heretics spokenof in the Records of the Inquisition. I haven't been fortunate enough, I admit,to discover it myself! '— SS-Obersturmfuhrkr C)i io Ram:Probably one of the most outlandish—yet somehow oddly grand, strangelycosmic—endeavors of the Third Reich in general, and of the SS in particular, wasHimmler's search for the Holy Grail. This was an actual program of the SS, aprogram which has since been immortalized in the first and third films o{ StevenSpielberg's Indiana Jones trilogy. The author is not aware of the degree towhich Spielberg was cognizant of actual SS operations designed to acquire suchlegendary treasure, but there is enough fact in the fietion to warrant seriousconsideration in this chapter.In order to understand what Himmler was up to, we will have to look at theclimate surrounding the Ahnenerbe and at what manyreaders probably think of as being a purely Christian symbol: the Holy Grail. Aswe do so, we will come across a fascinating individual whom history has treatedrather shabbily, the young SS officer and historian, Otto Rahn (1904-1939).It was, after all, Otto Rahn who helped popularize the notion that the Grail wasnot the special property of the Catholic Church (should it actually exist, andshould it ever be found). For Rahn, the Grail was an emblem set up in oppositionto the established Church—indeed, was a Luciferian symbol—and for this the Naziswere grateful; for, if Rahn's conclusion was correct, it gave them aphilosophical and historical edge over organized Christianity.The Crusade against the GrailRahn's first published work, Kreuzzug gegen den Graal (Crusade Against theGrail), was devoted to a study of what is sometimes referred to as theAlbigensian Crusade: a war that took place between the Roman Catholic Church anda Christian cult known alternatively as the Albigensians (after the town of Albiin southern France) or the Cathars: \"the Pure.\" The Cathars were a type offundamentalist Christian sect that enjoyed enormous popularity inthirteenth-century Europe, even among the nobility. They were opposed to thematerialism of the Catholic Church and what they perceived to be the corruptionof Christ's teachings by the Church. In many of their beliefs, they were closerto the Gnostics and Manichaeans than to Roman Catholics; indeed, there is agreat deal of evidence to suggest that they might have been a Manichaeansurvival. Regardless of their actual origins, however, they began attractingconverts in large numbers, particularly in France.Their beliefs included the doctrine that Christ was pure spirit and had neverinhabited a human—that is, a material—form; that the dead will not heresurrected in the body, since the body was made ofmatter, whieh the Cathars viewed as Satanic; thai there were twoforces in the universe, one of good and the other of evil; thai proCK ation wasevil, as it increased the amount of matter in the world and trapped souls withinmaterial forms.Lucifer) Quest for the Holy Grail 205That death was good, and not a time for mourning; that there was no particularreason why the bodies of the dead should be revered since the bodies were theevil part of the human constitution.Naturally, they were branded as heretics by the Church and eventually Catholicarmies were sent to destroy them under order of Pope Innocent III in 1209. Itwas from a Catholic commander—a Cistercian abbot, no less—surrounding a Frenchtown composed of both Cathar and Catholic civilians (men, women, and children)that we receive the immortal line: \"Kill them all. God will recognize his own.\"The belief of the Cathars—and of their close relatives, the Albigen-sians orAlbigeois of the Languedoc region of France—that matter was essentially impureand evil, and that only spirit was pure and good is a patently Gnostic doctrine.The belief in two gods—one evil, the other good—is both Gnostic and Manichaean.Hence, it has been argued that the Cathars were an extension of a Middle Easternsect of Manichees or of Gnostics in possession of a \"secret tradition\"concerning the life and death of Christ and the origins of Christianity. TheCathars claimed that the Bible (particularly the Old Testament) was full ofreferences to an Evil God—Jehovah—even as they insisted that the Bible waseither full of errors or had been interpreted incorrectly by generations ofself-serving Roman Catholic theologians. (One should remember that in 1209 theGutenberg press had not been invented and that Bibles were in scarce supply.Those that existed were in the dead tongues of Latin and Greek, and in thepossession of the Church. The average person knew very little of what was in theBible, except for what he or she was told by a priest.)Another Cathar peculiarity is that—perhaps late in their tragic story—theylegitimized a form of ritual suicide, called the endura: one simply starvedoneself to death, or was poisoned, or was strangled or suffocated by thebrethren. They also rejected most of the sacraments of the Church as so muchsuperstitious nonsense. In their anti-Papal stance they were close to the rathermore Calvinist Waldensians with whom they have been frequently—anderroneously—linked.At dinner . . . he spoke of India and Indian philosophy. This led him to speakof a subject which was a hobbyhorse of his: in a lively manner he described tome the result of researches in German witchcraft trials. He said it wasmonstrous that thousands of witches hadbeen burned during the Middle Ages. So much good German blood had been stupidlydestroyed. From this he began an attack on the Catholic Churchy and at the sametime on Calvin; before I had caught up with all this he was discussing theSpanish Inquisition and the essential nature of primitive Christianity. 1SCHELLENBERGThese words from Foreign Intelligence Chief Walter Schellenberg's memoirsconcerning a meeting with Himmler in the Ukraine in the summer of 1942 indicatejust how interested the Reichsfuhrer-SS was in such philosophical andmetaphysical questions, including early Christianity, Calvinism, the Inquisition. . . even the witch trials, on all of which Himmler considered himselfsomething of an expert.The Cathar ideology must have appealed to him and the other Nazis in a profoundway. After all, the very word \"Cathar\" means \"pure,\" and purity—particularly ofthe blood as the physical embodiment of spiritual \"goodness\"—was an issue ofprime importance to the SS. The Cathars railed against the gross materialism ofthe Church; the Nazis viewed themselves as inherently anti-Capitalist, eventhough they were forced to deal with large industrial concerns in order toobtain absolute power in Germany. (To Hitler and his followers, Capitalism wasimmoral and they equated it with the excesses of the Jewish financiers that—theysaid—had brought the nation to ruin during the First World War and thedepression that followed.)The Cathars, in denying the value of the Old Testament and in attacking Jehovahas a kind of Satan, naturally seemed to be in perfect agreement with Naziideology concerning the Jews and, as we shall see, with the current incarnationof neo-Nazi ideologues in the Christian identity movement and in the ProcessChurch of the Final Judgment.Further, the Cathars were fanatics, willing to die for their cause; sacrificingthemselves to the Church's onslaught they enjoyed the always enviable aura ofspiritual underdogs. There was something madly beautiful in the way they wereimmolated on the stakes of the Inquisition, professing their faith and theirhatred of Rome until the end. The Nazis could identify with the ( Cathars: withtheir overallfanaticism, with then contempt for the way vital spiritual matters werecommercialized (polluted) by the Establishment, and with their p.ission for \"purity.\" It is perhaps inevitable that the Cathars should have made asacrament out of suicide, for they must have known that their Quest was doomedto failure from the start. They must have wished for death as a release from acorrupt and insensitive world; and its entirely possible that, at the root ofNazism, lay a similar death wish. Hitler was surrounded by the suicides of hismistresses and contemplated it himself on at least one occasion before heactually pulled the trigger in Berlin in 1945. Himmler and other captured Nazileaders killed themselves rather than permit the Allies to do the honors forthem. Haushofer committed suicide. Even Sebottendorff plunged himself into theBosporus. Perhaps the passionate desire of concentration camp survivors to seeall Nazi war criminals executed for their crimes—even at this latedate—represents an unconscious realization that suicide (like a natural death)is too good for the monsters of the Reich; that, like the Cathars whom theyadmired, the Nazis saw in suicide that consolation and release from the world ofSatanic matter promised by this most cynical of Cathar sacraments.For some reason, it became popular to assume that these same Cathars were inpossession of a mysterious sacred object and that, on the eve of destruction ofthe last major Cathar opposition at the fortress of Montsegur in southern Franceon March 14, 1244, some Cathars managed to escape with this object down the sideof their mountain citadel (then under siege by Catholic troops). This sacredobject has been identified by later generations of amateur historians as nothingless than the Holy Grail. 3Before the collapse of Montsegur, as some (mostly French) authors have proposed,the Grail was in the possession of the infamous Order of the Knights Templar,the Order after which von Liebenfels and Kellner named their respective cults;the same Order that was created by St. Bernard of Clairvaux, the famous abbot ofthe Cistercian Order. Depending on whom one reads, the Templars were believed tohave discovered either the Grail or the Ark of the Covenant (or both?) duringtheir sojourn in Palestine at the site of Solomon's Temple. Several studies havebeen made of the Templar cathedrals—Chartres in particular—to prove that theTemplars left a coded message in stone revealing that they brought a sacredobject of great value back withthem from the East, an object whose tremendous, otherworldly power enabled themto finance, design, and build a series of magnificent churches all over Francein an amazingly short period of time. Indeed, the time line is suggestive for,according to an authoritative work on the subject by Henry Adams, during thespace of one hundred years (from a.d. 1170 to a.d. 1270) the Church built eightycathedrals in France and hundreds of other \"cathedral-class\" churches at anestimated cost of one billion in 1905 U.S. dollars. 4The pseudonymous author on alchemy and architecture, Fulcanelli, contributed tothis idea of a Templar secret tradition in his Le Mystere des Cathedrales, firstpublished in 1925. It has been translated into English and forms the core of yetanother mystical tradition. 5Just why the Cathars should then have found themselves in possession of theGrail remains something of a mystery. Certainly there is a robust literatureconcerning the Grail—known as Grail Romances to the historians—that identify itas anything from a sacred stone that fell from the sky (the lapis exilis orlapis ex coelis) to the actual cup used by Jesus at the Last Supper and whichwas used to catch drops of his blood during the crucifixion. Indeed, Wolfram vonEschenbach's Parzival depicts the Grail as a stone and not as a cup; the olderromance by Chretien de Troyes depicts the Grail as a cup and not as a stone, andthis image is perpetuated in Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. As if to compromise onthis controversy, one of the carved figures on the north door of ChartresCathedral—that of the Old Testament High Priest Melchisedek—is shown holding aCup from which the Stone rises.And from time to time various objects have been found which their owners claimedto be the Grail but none of these have stood up to even cursory scrutiny.Recently, the writing team of Walter Birks and R. A. Gilbert have conspired toput an end to all the speculation. (> Birks served with the British Army in theMiddle East during the war with the rank of major, prior to which he had beeninvolved in esoteric and spiritualist circles m England; Gilbert is an historianof occultism, most notably ol the Golden Dawn. Together, they denigrate thewritings of Rahn tortuous reasoning and linguistic lunacy' 1 and the hook byBaigent, Leigh, and 1 incoln (Holy Blood, Holy Grail) as evidence of a \"lunatictheory\" supported by an \"inchoate mass of irrelevancitFor Birks and Gilbert, the treasure of Montsegur \"never was\": it was not theGrail, not a cache of Templar gold, not the bloodline of Jesus, but \"the powerto transmit the apostolic succession, the seed perhaps of a higher form ofChristianity to be revealed when the world is ready to receive it.\" v) They basethis theory on Biblical exegesis, interpretations oi the Dead Sea Scrolls, thewritings of Josephus and others, and on what remains of Cathar ritual andtheology. Birks was present at a Cathar research site at Ussat-les-Bains in thelate 1930s (although too late to have met Rahn, who also researched and lived atthe site) and was friendly with one Antonin Gadal, about whom more later. Birkshimself states that it was during conversation with a member of the Nosairi sectin the Middle East that he realized the Cathar treasure was not a material Grailat all, but the \"Light-filled vessel\": i.e., a purely metaphorical image basedon the cup of sacramental wine which the Nosairi use to drink \"to the Light\": anemblem of the true teaching of Christianity before it became confused andbowdlerized by the Evangelists and the various Councils. This is all involvedwith a Nosairi tradition of the \"way of the Stars,\" that a human soul, afterdeath, proceeds up a ladder of lights, of stars, to heaven. Birks was satisfiedwith that, and the doctrine of Light provided him with a great illumination (nopun intended); but we have come full circle, for the way of the Stars and thedoctrine of the Light are amply represented by the myths of the Celts, theNordic peoples, and many others in whom Rahn discovered the scattered fragmentsof a lost mystical tradition, and the \"Light-filled vessel\" may be an entirelyappropriate reference to Rahn's rediscovered doctrine of Lucifer, theLight-Bearer.SS-Obersturmfuhrer ParzivalAs mentioned, one of the most famous Grail romances is that composed by Wolframvon Eschenbach, entitled Parzival. It is this particular romance that hasremained the authoritative word on the subject for many people, and which wasthe work that inspired Otto Rahn in his researches (and Richard Wagner in hisfamous opera by the same name).Rahn was an impoverished scholar of history whose soul became inflamed by equaldoses of Wagner and von Eschenbach in his youth.The beneficiary of a classical education in both literature and philology, hespent five years traveling throughout Europe in search of myths, legends, andthe records of heretical cults, all of which he believed would point to theexistence of a native, crypto-pagan, Gnostic-type religion in Europe. Findingmythological and philological links between such varied phenomena as thetroubadours, the Grail legends, European paganism, and the heretical sect knownas the Cathars Rahn felt he had discovered evidence of an ancient Germanreligious tradition that had been suppressed by the Church.Identifying the pure knight Parzival as a Cathar or Cathar manque, Rahn went onto write a history of the Cathar rebellion from the point of view of GrailRomance. Although this sounds like pure Guido von List or Lanz von Liebenfels,Rahn was a scholar of somewhat greater integrity who based his work on acceptedprimary sources (such as the records of the Inquisition, the poems and songs ofthe troubadours, and the medieval Grail legends) and on his own, on-the-sceneresearch.He arrived in the Languedoc region of France in 1931 and there met a gentlemanwell-known in Grail circles, Antonin Gadal. 10 Gadal maintained a private Catharmuseum at the small town of Ussat-les-Bains, a tourist attraction and spa in thePyrenees with an allegedly Cathar connection. He also had an extensive libraryon the subject of the Cathars and the Grail, from which Rahn probably derivedmuch benefit. Gadal was a member of a society called The Friends of Mont-segurand the Grail, of which the noted historian Rene Nelli was vice president (itwas Nelli who would translate Rahn's work into French). 11 The society—as itsname implies—believed that a connection existed between the Cathar movement andthe Grail Romances. This concept had been broached in 1906 by the popular Frenchauthor Josephin Peladan in Le Secret des Troubadours. Former Golden Dawn memberArthur Edward Waite had discounted the theory that the Grail legend had anythingto do with either Cathars or Albigen-sians in a hook published three years later(The Hidden Church of the Holy (trail), but then Waite was in a state olapostasy from the GoldenDawn as he had denied their occult rituals as essentially evil and replaced themwith Christian versions, forming his own rather boringOCCtlll order in the process.In May of 1932 Rahn decided to become an innkeeper to support his researches andinvested in a local establishment at Ussat. By September he was bankrupt, anddisappeared from France only to reappear shortly thereafter in Germany. By then,he had accumulated quite enough information to write his own book on the subjectof the Cath-ars and the Grail, Kreuzzug gegen den Graal, which was published in1933 and translated into French the following year as Croisade contre le Graal(Crusade Against the Grail).Although the book did not earn Rahn a lot of money, it eventually came to theattention of no less an admirer than Heinrich Himmler.According to one version of the story, 12 the Reichsfiihrer-SS personallyinvited the author to meet him at his Prinz Albrechtstrasse headquarters inBerlin. There, he offered Rahn a commission in the SS and virtually unlimitedresources for which Himmler expected Rahn to continue his research into theGrail legends, the Cathars, and related subjects of Aryan interest.According to another version, 13 Rahn was a personal friend of vblkisch\"channeler\" Karl Maria Wiligut—also known as SS-Oberfiih-rer Weisthor—agentleman who had once been certified insane but who nonetheless claimed that hehad perfect recall of the entire ancient history of the Teuton peoples goingback over 200,000 years, a kind of ancient racial memory upon which he couldcall at any time. This was, of course, a very handy ability to possess andHimmler considered himself fortunate to have access to the services of a man whocould fill in those great gaps of Teutonic history that result when a masterrace proves rather lax in developing a written language. Wili-gut's ability was,he claimed, due to the fact that his family's lineage had been kept pure atevery generation down the millennia from that time in the misty past when thegods of air and water mated in humid embrace to produce the milky Wiligutbloodline. Wiligut, another of Germany's rune scholars, clairvoyants, andTeutonic mystics, held salon-type meetings at his home on arcane Aryan topics atwhich Himmler and the young Otto Rahn were said to be frequent guests.Wiligut insisted that Christianity was really a German invention; that Christwas really the ancient Teutonic god Baldur, who was crucified by a schismaticgroup of Wotan-worshiping thugs. Baldur, however, managed to escape to theMiddle East and . . . and . . . well, the rest is New Testament. His remainingfollowers in Germany built acult center sacred to their faith at the prehistoric site of Externsteine, whichwas to become the subject of much discussion and excavation by the Ahnenerbe.(See Chapter Six.)Of course, like most other occult theory, Wiligut's cross-eyed thesis is basedon a number of verifiable historical traditions that can be found in a carefulreading of ancient texts, in this case of the Eddas and other Scandinavian andGothic lore that predate the Christian conversion of these peoples by hundreds(and not hundreds of thousands) of years. Baldur, for instance, was a slain andresurrected god like many other agricultural deities of many other lands. TheNorse Creation story is remarkably similar to that of ancient Sumeria, with theknown universe created out of the corpse of another slain god. That Christianityadopted pagan ceremonies, cult centers, holidays, and myths is by now wellknown; in fact, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify just what a \"pure\"form of Christianity would look like. However, Wiligut's problem—and the problemof many amateur historians in his class—is that he took the myths and legends ofthe ancient European peoples and blended them together with theosophical andother newly coined mystical beliefs with little or no historical basis. Thecommonality of motifs in these various myths from widely divergent sources maybest be explained by the type of research undertaken by MIT Professor deSantillana (as mentioned in a previous chapter) and others who see in thesestories a coded form of astronomical observations. The relatively new sciencesof epigraphy and paleoastronomy may answer many questions previously consideredthe domain of occultism.Yet, on the basis of this and related historical fantasies, Wiligut was made thehead of the Department of Prehistory at the Race and Settlement Office (RuSHA)of the SS, and eventually attained the exalted rank of SS-Brigadefuhrer, orBrigadier, on Himmler's Personal Staff. It was Wiligut who designed theSchutzstdjfcW special Death's 1 lead (totenkopf) ring, a device replete withrunic symbols including the inevitable swastika as well as those of Wiligut'spersonal armorial design. The latter detail implied that somehow Wiligut was,himself, the lastand sole physical repository of glacially pure Teutonic blood; a claimthat was the cornerstone of his philosophy and which gave him thatunique unbroken memory which made him so valuable to those lesser mortals whocould only prove then racial purity hack to the year Irequired of SS recruits) and whose race memory had therefore fallen victim tothe ravages of ancient couplings with diseased and drooling subhumans, such asHungarians.It has been said that Rahn was introduced to Himmler by Wiligut himself, andthat Himmler accepted the young scholar into the SS on Wiligut's personalrecommendation. Wiligut then kept in constant touch with Rahn as the latter wentabout on his travels through France, Germany, and Iceland, hot on the very coldtrail of the mysterious Cathar treasure he believed was the Grail. Hecommunicated his findings to Wiligut periodically in letters that were to beshared with no one else but Himmler, so secret and so important were theircontents. One wonders what these secrets were, for they are certainly not to befound in Rahn's second book, a work published under Nazi supervision. However,some letters from Rahn to Wiligut have survived, 1 ' marked \"extremelyconfidential,\" dealing—for instance— with linguistic evidence of pagan sitesconcealed within modern German place names, and begging the Seer to communicatehis findings with \"the Reichsfiihrer-SS only.\" As these letters are dated asearly as 1935—and signed with a hearty \"Heil Hitler!\"—we can see that Rahn wasintimate with the highest circles of the SS hierarchy by this time. Rahn'sfriend Paul Ladame, however, insists that when he ran into Rahn in July, 1936,on the Joachimstaler Strasse in Berlin, Rahn was resplendent in full SS uniform,bearing the flashes of the Liebs-tandarte Adolf Hitler and, when asked how hehad come to be wearing such a thing, replied \"My dear Paul, a man has to eat!\"15Whether or not Rahn was any kind of real Nazi, his two books do reveal, however,that he believed the Catholic Church had all but destroyed essential elements ofa secret German religious tradition, a tradition whose persecution began withthe Cathars in the thirteenth century and which ended, triumphantly, with thedestruction of the Templar Order a hundred years later. The German tradition wasnot a Christian one in the generally accepted sense. Rather, it was a paganreligion whose elements were appropriated by the Church as a means of dilutingit of its power: the Grail, the knightly Orders, the sacred Quest, and theeternal struggle between Light and Darkness. Except, for the Cathars as filteredthrough the meditations of Rahn, Light in this case was represented by—not Jesusor Jehovah—but by another spirit, the \"Light-Bearer.\" To Rahn, this Entityrepresented the high-est good. To Rahn (at least officially), the Nazi Reich in general—and the SS inparticular—became the servitors of an ancient pagan cult whose god was known tothe medieval Christians not as Jesus but as Lucifer.Lucifer's ServantsAs we saw in the preceding chapter, Himmler's personal agenda was to amassenough data—archaeological, historical, cultural, religious, and occult—to provethat the Aryan \"race\" was superior to all other races on earth and that theGermans were the inheritors of the Aryan bloodline. He also had to prove that,at some point in history, what are now the German peoples owned virtually allthe real estate in Europe. This would not only seem to legitimize Hitler's Driveto the East, but might prove useful in establishing that the Germans had anhistorical right to do whatever they wanted with whatever inferior, mongrelraces they found there.Proving the existence of a hitherto unknown German religious tradition thatpredated Christianity and which was more in tune with the German Volk would go along way toward propping up Himmler's other theories and give substance to thetwin policies of Aryan racial superiority and German claim to the land. It wouldprovide the necessary philosophical underpinning for an occult renaissance inEurope and prove stronger than the various Christian sects that had arbitrarilydivided the race along ideological lines. A German spiritual tradition thattranscended Christian history would provide a blood religion that could unit theracially pure peoples of Europe—Aryans in diaspora— and thus erase nationalboundaries and Christian sensitivities in one blow.those readers of today who find this mission a trifle weird, might the author bepermitted to remind them that no less a modern state than Israel was foundedalong pretty mneh the same lines? Jew ishclaims upon the territory are based upon religious scriptures, and citiZenship in the State of Israel is limited to those who can pTOVt they arc lews.One may remember the difficulty Ethiopian Jews had in emigrating to Israel. Theauthor does not point this out in order to devalue Jewish claims upon the territory known as Palestine before 1948, but toillustrate a point: that great nations—and national agendas— are sometimeserected on such weak timber as a human-interpreted word of God or on the bloodof the \"Aryans.\" If it could have been proven that the so-called Aryan peopleswere at one time in the distant past in control of vast amounts of European,American, and Asian real estate ... so what?)In this dubious endeavor, Himmler had two distinct sets of ideologicalopponents. First of all, there were the genuine scientists who disparaged suchcanonical Nazi claims as Aryan racial purity and the prevalence of an Aryan cultor proto-Christian society over all of Europe and Asia in the distant past. Forthese, Himmler hoped to provide concrete evidence that Aryans (and, hence,Germans) had established communities in such remote locales as Minsk in Russia,northern India, and Tibet. The Deutsche Akademie and later the Ah-nenerbe wereboth heavily involved in the archaeological work necessary to buttress thisargument.His second opponent was the established Christian Church itself. Himmler's dreamwas to create, out of the SS, a new religion based on the pagan elements of whathe perceived to be the original, Ur-Aryan religion of ancient India and Europe.However, many Germans were devout Christians. Hitler himself realized this, andknew that he had to play politics with them for as long as the churches heldpower and as long as the people felt they owed spiritual allegiance to thechurches and what they represented. In this he was as cynical in his dealingswith the Church as he was pragmatic with the Capitalists.Himmler, on the other hand, wanted nothing so much as the destruction—not onlyof the organized Church—but of Christianity itself. And, with the assistance ofWiligut and other like-minded individuals, Himmler drew up new ceremonies and anew liturgical calendar to thoroughly replace Christian versions. He was dealingJudaism the death blow in the camps and with his roving bands of death squads,the linisatzgruppen, under the command of such men as The-osophist and convictedwar criminal Otto Ohlendorf and the notorious Dr. Six. The Church was next onthe list. How better to capture the attention and imagination of the pious thanto appropriate the Grail as a purely pagan and Aryan symbol, actually restoringto the Grail its original character and identity? The Grail figured promi-nently in European folklore as a powerful occult symbol, and was also the basisfor a Wagnerian opera that was just as powerful, just as compelling. It wasassumed that Wagner, an admitted anti-Semite who provided the sound track forthe Third Reich, would not have wasted his time writing a Christian or Jewishpropaganda tract. Therefore, Wagner's own take on the Grail must be consistentwith rest of the Aryan operatic canon that included, of course, the Ring Cycle.It was all Aryan myth and, therefore, part of a single, continuous epic story.Rahn's thesis went a long way to establishing just that. Based on researchundertaken in the Languedoc region of southern France and especially at fabledMontsegur, site of the Cathars' last stand, Rahn believed he had acquired enoughevidence to repudiate any Christian claim to the Grail. The Grail of vonEschenbach and Richard Wagner was redeemed as the ultimate Aryan relic aroundwhich Himmler would build his pagan Temple. The castle at Wewelsburg, with itsRound Table for himself and the members of his Inner Circle, would be the heartof a new metropolis; the chamber containing the Round Table and the crypt belowit would be the precise geographical center of the new city, the Aryan Camelot,and of the New World itself. And what is King Arthur, a Round Table, and Camelotwithout a Grail?Initially, Rahn did not seem to hold pro-Nazi ideas in the least. According tohis friend, the French author Paul Ladame, 16 Rahn thought the Nazis faintlyridiculous. But he was starving. He could not turn down a lucrative offer ofemployment with Himmler, and so he eventually donned the black uniform of the SSand continued his researches better fed and more warmly (if somewhatostentatiously) clothed.He may not have had much of a choice in the matter, but it was a decision thatnevertheless proved his downfall. As Himmler encountered more and moredifficulty in finding hard evidence CO prove his Aryan thesis, he becameincreasingly disillusioned with Rahn And his ilk. Finally, according to Ladame,he gave the frightened youngscholar an ultimatum: he would finish his next hook by October 31,1936 the pagan festival of Samhain—and provide it to the Nazieditors for approval. ( )r else.This, Rahn managed to do. According to one source, he was then sent to Dachaufoi the four months of scheduled military training required o( -ill ss nun (aswas Adolf Eichmann at the same camppicture1 [images/picture1.jpg]Runes: Journal fin German Spiritual Revelations and Sciencepicture2 [images/picture2.jpg]IMig to OstDraTnngbpbiirgOstara, magazine created by [ttrg Lanz von Liebenfelspicture3 [images/picture3.jpg]Unteczefdinetec beontragt fur [fdi (unb tone Pamflfc) bfe Aufnabme q(o Befudiecbee Thule GetellCdioft.

That would have been sometime in the last hall of 1937.rHe resigned his commission in the SS sometime after leaving Da-chau.Then, in 1939, at the age of thirty-five, he was dead.The book that resulted from this relatively unknown Na/i project was entitledLuzifers Hojgesind or Lucifer's Servants* sometimes trans lated as Lucifer sCourt. IK It reads quite differently from Rahn's first book, which was at leastsincere in its effort to portray a kind ol occult underdog group of purists whoheld the secret ol the ages in then hands if only the rest of us would payattention. I.Heifer's Servants, on the other hand, is at least partly a genuineNazi propaganda tract and several passages make a good case for the worship ofLucifer, ii one follows (and credits) Rahn\\s exegesis on several ancient sourcesincluding ParzivaI and the surviving texts of troubadors, Cathars, and evenPersian mystics. Indeed, this idea of Lucifer as a benign or divine being wasfamiliar and congenial to the \"white light\" Theosophists ol the 1920s who, afterall, entitled one of their official German publications Luzifer.The following citations should adequately illustrate this claim (alltranslations by the author, all emphasis by Rahn):It was necessary, in effect, to be faithful to God until death, \"and God willgive to his servant the crown of eternal life,\" .is u is written in the Bible.Having established that, for the Church ol Rome the sole repository of \"Truth\"in the eyes ol ns faithful—the troubadors were members of the servants of theDevil; having also established that they were faithful to the God ol Love; andfinally having established that they celebrated—as numerous examples have provedthe marvels ol the crown of I ucifer, u is permitted to believe thai the) hadfaith in theexistence of a l.ueiferian crown of eternal life (to speak Biblically). Ami ifwe follow this thought to its logical Conclusion, we will sav thai, foi them,the God fff lore WOS none other than I ueifer in person.This hypothesis will become certain il we allow our thought to range morewidely: the god Amor is the god ot Spring, .is is Apollon. . . . Apollon blOUghfback (he light ol the Sun: he is a light hearer. <>i \"I iu iAccording to the Apocafypseoi [ohn, Apollyo Apollon was equatedwith the Devil, and according to the belief of the Roman Church . . .Lucifer is Satan. Consequently, the god of Spring Apollon-Amor is, according tothe doctrine of the Church, the Devil and Satan. 19In a further ferverino on the subject of Lucifer, he writes in the same chapter:There is much more [Light] than in the houses of God—cathedrals andchurches—where Lucifer neither is able nor wishes to enter due to all thesomber, stained glass windows wherein are painted the Jewish prophets andapostles, the Roman gods and saints. The forest, that, that was free! 20As the above two passages indicate, Rahn is using Biblical and Patristicwritings to support his thesis that the Cathars and the trouba-dors were, in asense, Devil worshipers . . . but only so far as they worshiped pagan gods whomthe Church had demonized. In an earlier chapter Rahn notes that Esclarmonde, afamous Cathar saint, \"one of the noblest women of the Middle Ages\" and hereticof the highest rank, believed that Jehovah—the Old Testament God of the Jews—was none other than Satan himself; that Christ never died on the cross and that,therefore, his suffering and death do not redeem the lives or souls of hisfollowers. (This idea that Christ did not die on the cross is one possiblereason why Templar postulants were to trample a crucifix underfoot during theirinitiation ceremony into the Order, and may be the reason there were nocrucifixes at Chartres.) \"Cursed by the Pope, detested by the King of France,she thought—until her dying breath—of nothing other than the religious andpolitical independence of her country.\" 21 These ideas—Jehovah the \"god of theJews\" as the real Satan, inherent falsehoods in the Gospel account of Christ \\life, and dying for the religious and political independence of the state —allhad a receptive audience among the scholars of the Ahncn-crbc and of the SS ingeneral, and still does among the racist and anti-Semitic Christian Identitymovement today. The Cathars had represented a pure form of Christianity thaidenied even large portions ofthe Bible, and they were a [ioIiik.iI threat to the established Church;iinlw Himmler could approve of this point of view married, as itwas, to the idea of a pagan Grail and of the Cathars as \"guardians ofthe ( .rail. ( h.n.u ten/ini; |ehovah .is .in evil demon tallied nicely withthe mass destruction of his followers in the camps, and made the exterminationof the race of Jehovah an even greater spiritual necessity. Now they were nolonger simply members of an inferior race that conspired to rob good Germans oftheir money, their pride, and their birthright; they were also the children ofSatan.Further, and perhaps even more importantly, as the Old Testament Jews wereworshipers of Satan, then Christ could not possibly have been Jewish. Strip awaythe Jewish content of the New Testament and—relying on the Biblical\"revisionist\" scholarship of generations of genuine German academics who castdoubt on the validity of the Gospels themselves—you are well on your way toaccepting Wiligut's thesis that Christ was Baldur, and a Teutonic Sun God!The \"Crusade against the Grail\"—subject and title of Rahn's first book—was thatundertaken by the Catholic Church during its vicious assault on Catharism, inwhich hundreds of thousands were brutally murdered. To Rahn, the Church was theEnemy both during the time of the Cathars in the thirteenth century and right upto the present day. Worse, it was the enemy of all that was pure, and noble, andgood in the world, ideals represented by the Grail: centerpiece of Parzival, ofWagner's operas, of the Morte d'Arthur, and the entire Camelot mystique. Theidea of the virgin knight, on a mystic quest throughout Europe for the SacredCup, must have appealed enormously to the young, virtually penniless scholar.Himmler referred to his SS men as the knights of a new Order, and one mustwonder if Rahn felt—in his heart of hearts—somehow at home in his elegant blackuniform with the silver runes, a new Teutonic Knight on the same sacred questfor the Grail. In his introduction to the French translation of LuzifersHofgesind (La Cour de Lucifer), Paul Ladame insists that Rahn joined the SSbecause there was no option: Himmler offered him a salary, perks, and thefreedom to conduct his own academic research unhindered. To refuse would haveseemed like madness, and perhaps would have resulted in Rahn's eventualimprisonment anyway.Other scholarship on the question provides a somewhat different perspective.Evidence from the Nazi side depicts Rahn as an enthusiastic Grail scholar, anadmirer of Wiligut (a man who claimed that the Bible was a German creation; aman whom anyone in his or her rightmind must have known was a lunatic), and an eager member of the SS.At first glance this is consistent with Rahn's introduction to Lucifer'sServants, which ends with the proud and defiant claim \"My ancestors were pagans.My forebears were heretics.\" 22 Yet, there is a mystery surrounding Rahn'ssudden and unexplained resignation from the SS, a resignation that took place alittle over a year after his leave from military service at Dachau.He resigned his commission in February 1939.He died less than a month later, on March 13 of that same year, supposedly fromexposure while hiking in the mountains. This, from a seasoned traveler, and atrained survivalist (as all SS men were), at an altitude of less than 2,000meters a week before spring! As Ladame puts it, \"to die of cold the 13th ofMarch at less than 2,000 meters, one needs a lot of patience, a strong will . .. and time . . . perhaps one or two weeks.\" 23Thus Ladame disputes the dating, insisting that his friend died in 1937, shortlyafter finishing Lucifer's Servants. 2 ^ Ladame claims that Rahn was no Nazi, andno racist. He insists that the Nazi elements in Lucifer's Servants were not ofRahn's making or, if they were, they were inserted at the command or instigationof the SS. And, not surprisingly, Ladame implies that Rahn was murdered;executed by his former colleagues for reason, or reasons, unknown.Unfortunately, there is some documentary evidence that Otto Rahn was alive andwell at least as late as January 1938, when he gave a lecture—based on LuzifersHofgesind —to the Dietrich Eckart Society at Dietrich Eckart House in Dortmund,in Westphalia ... a lecture that was reported upon in the local newspaper. Fromthe tone of the review, Rahn was in fine form that evening:The Albigensians were- exterminated. 205 leading followers oi 1 uciferwere burnt on a huge pyre by Dominic. ins in iIk- South of France artei alarge-scale priesdy (Irusade in the name o!

The Vicar of Christ could truly burn nun; but he wasmistaken if he believed thai lie burned along with them theii spun.devotion and longing. This spirit became alive again before mam men yesterday,powerfully and visibly, in Otto Rahn, a descendant of the old Troubadours.ould someone as intelligent as Rahns published writings indicate he was, ascholar for whom medieval legend and lore came alive only through carefulresearch and study, have willingly taken tip with a character like Wiligut, whoclaimed that the Teutonic tribes had a verifiable history going back to the year228,000 B.C. . . . when the Earth had an embarrassment of three suns? As much asone may wish to argtie with the thesis of Crusade against the Grail or Lucifer'sServants, there is nothing of the raving mystagogue about Rahn. One likes tothink that his period of obligator)- military service at Dachau opened his eyesto the horror of the Reich, and that—in a final, doomed but proud gesture ofdignity—he resigned his commission in the SS in outrage and disgust at theatrocities he may have witnessed at the death camp associated with the SS basethere; and was then murdered for his insubordination a month later.Then, too, the fact that both Wiligut and Rahn retired from the SS at the sametime—/';/ the same month —is suggestive of some collusion between the twomythologians: the one elderly and quite insane, the other young and quiteintelligent. Rahns exploits and the mystery surrounding his resignation andsubsequent death have received a great deal of attention in European circlesover the years, although they are little known in America. His unusual lifestory has led to considerable speculation that Rahn actually did discoversomething in his travels, and that since he seemed to confide in Wiligut theyboth had to be gotten out of the way to protect the secret. That, in fact, they\"knew too much.\" Wiligut was kept under SS lock and key for some time until theend of the war, and died in 1946; he was eighty yean old and, with hisbackground of mental illness, hardly a serious threat to the Reichsfiihrer-SS.Rahn, on the other hand, was a bit more of a liability and—so the theory goes—hehad to he killed.Either that, or Himrnler decided to can them both at the same time when reportsol Wiligut s earlier hospitalization for mental illness became common knowledgewithin the SS. But why would news of Wiligut s infirmity have jeopardized Rahn\\career?There is an intriguing note in the definitive Study of Wcwelsburg bv Prof. Dr.Karl Htiser to the effect that Rahn was kicked out ofthe SS because of his homosexuality. Himmler had a rabid dislike of homosexuals,and through the auspices of Nazi psychiatrists at the Goring Institute tried tohave several SS men \"cured\" of this \"malady.\" 2 \" Many homosexuals, of course,wound up in concentration camps themselves. Although that was probably not anoption with an SS man as relatively well known as Rahn, he was possibly lookingat some sort of reprisal in the future, either professionally or in some otherway. Unfortunately, we shall never know.One final possibility—though there is no evidence to support it—is that Rahnhimself was the first of the SS men to take refuge in that sad Cathar rite,allowed only to the privileged few, the Perfect; that, in the mountain snowsabove Kufstein, and on the anniversary of the destruction ofMontsegur, themiserable scholar exchanged the secret of the long-sought-after Grail for thatother treasure of the Cathars: the consolation of a noble death.Holy Blood, Holy GrailIf the Cathars and troubadors—heirs of a Gnostic tradition in Europe, possiblybrought over from the Middle East from whence the Templars had brought their ownmysterious rites—were crypto-pagans as Rahn believed, and if the set piece oftheir mythology was the Holy Grail, then it follows that the Grail is not aChristian symbol at all but a purely pagan one. And if the Grail is a paganikon, then the Nazis— overt pagans as they were—saw in the Grail a sacredinstrument of divine power that they could use for their own ends. As theinheritors of the pagan traditions in Europe (at least in their own eyes) theGrail belonged to them. After all, were they not the spiritual descendants o!the Teutonic Knights, a chivalric Order that pressed Germany on in a Drive tothe hast eenturies before Hitler's invasion of Russia?' Were they not the peopleof the Runes? The people of the Pure Blood?Messrs. Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln might have been more correct than theyrealized when they entitled their famous book Holy Blood Holy GraiL For (hem,the Grail was in reality the bloodline of |esus Ghrist, preserved down throughthe millennia and safeguarded In vetLucifer's Quest for the Holy Grail 223another secret society, the Prion- of Zion, which the authors link to anunderground tradition ot Freemasonry dnd Templarism spanningthe centuries and which finds its modern manifestation in the Knights of Malta,Italy's P-2, dnd other such groups.Part ol the problem lies in the term \"holy grail,\" and in the word \"grail\"itself. Messrs. Baigent et. al. consider that the term sangrealzs found in l.eMorte d'Afthur and other Grail Romances is really composed of two words: sangand real that is, blood and royal. (The term sangreal'is usually interpreted tomean san great, \"holy grail.\") It is an attractive theory and to an extentlinguistically satisfying since no two authorities can agree on where the term\"grail\" comes from and what it means. By denying that such a word really has anymeaning at all— that it is merely the result of misunderstanding the syllablebreak in sangreal —we have neatly solved the problem of the Holy Grail byrevealing its true nature as Royal Blood. After all, the Grail makes itsappearance to Parzival alongside a lance that is dripping blood onto the Hoor.This scene is presented wordlessly, without comment, as if in a dream. Was theintention of the author to communicate the fact that sangreal really doesindicate \"royal blood\"? This would have pleased the Nazis enormously if thestory had been current at the time, for the Nazis were nothing if not Bloodenthusiasts after the Foucault model introduced in Chapter One, and—if theycould have somehow linked the concept of \"royal blood\" with a Teutonic Christand the Aryan race—they would have had the basis for a new religious synthesisthat could have brought together all acceptable Christians and pure-bloodedAryans in one, big, happy (if rather inbred) family.By claiming the Grail as their own the Nazis rob Christianity of a huge chunk ofits popular mythology. The chalice a Catholic priest raises during the Massbecomes a pagan cauldron; the mystery of the Blood of Christ becomes a hollowecho of pagan sacrifice. Appropriation of the Grail symbolism then becomes anassault on Christian faith itself: at least, on the popular faith of thelinapenproletar/at of Europe, from the Pyrenees to the Alps to the Caucasus.I hat the Grail was originally a pagan symbol is today virtually be-yond debate; that it was appropriated by romantic elements within the Christianworld 'as was much pagan iconography) is certain. However, had Himmler succeededin producing an actual \"Grail\" during the war, the effect on the Christianpopulations of Europe might havebeen traumatic. Depending on the spin, it would have signaled either the divinemission of the Nazi Party as true inheritors of the ultimate representation ofoccult power ... or the need for a holy war against the black-clad SS, thesatanic monsters who had \"stolen\" God's sacred Cup from the righteous.As it is, history records no such discovery of the Grail by the Nazis, or byanyone else. Birks and Gilbert claim that there is no evidence that Nazihierarchs had any interest at all in the Cathars or in Mont-segur. 28 Yet,Himmler had enlisted the talents of a young Grail scholar in a search for theperfect centerpiece for his secret cult headquarters at Wewelsburg, and put hisfavorite prehistorian, SS-Brigadier Karl Wiligut, in charge of the project.Whether Cathar or Templar, sacred stone or golden cup, finding the Holy Grailwas certainly a dream of Himmler's; his Wewelsburg center was beyond any doubt areverent shrine to the legend of the Round Table. If he eventually gave up onthe search, one imagines he did so only with the greatest reluctance.A final word on Montsegur—this time by Sabine Baring-Gould, an author who wroteextensively on history and travel at the turn of the century—is in order, for itshows how Rahn's feelings were shared by a great many people on both sides ofthe Channel:The treasures of the Albigenses . . . have never been recovered; but the truetreasure, for which they fought and for which they died, the emancipation of thehuman soul from the fetters of slavery in which it had been bound by Rome, hasbeen won by nearly all Europe. 2V#8#The Psychics Search:For Mussolini, theBismarck, Assassins, andthe Human MindMost of what the Ahnenerbe undertook had very little application in the realworld other than for propaganda purposes. If they could prove—through theirarchaeological researches—that the \"Aryans\" had conquered everything east of theRhine to the Chinese border, it would have at least justified (in their ownminds) their military aggression against most of the world. If they could prove\"Aryan\" racial superiority through their anthropological experiments at Dachau,that would justify (again, to their own minds) their extermination of the\"subhumans.\" And, if they could come away from the savage medicalexperimentation in the camps with a coherent scientific study of the effects ofvarious drugs, of freezing and rapid thawing, etc. on humans, then they couldjustify to themselves the unbelievable sadism of their doctors, such as SigmundRascher.Occasionally, Hitler had to receive verification from his colleagues that theexpense of such organizations as the Ahnenerbe-SS was justified. Himmler wasunder a great deal of pressure to show positiveresults. After all, he was spending a lot of money on his SS fantasies,including the fabulous shrine at Wewelsburg, which seemed to have noidentifiable military purpose. Of course, he was also raising his Waffen-SS as aworthy competitor of the Wehrmacht (the regular German Army) and indeed theseelite troops were distinguishing themselves in combat as well-trained,well-motivated, death-defying fanatics. But such competition gave rise tojealousy and suspicion on the part of the old-time generals who had foughtGermany's battles with distinction in previous conflicts. And, when theAhnenerbe's archaeological digs began coming up empty, Himmler was hard-pressedto demonstrate actual value in other areas. In September 1943 he had his chance.The Pendulum SolutionWhen Hitler received word of the imprisonment of Mussolini by the FascistCouncil on orders of the king on July 25, 1943, he was understandablydistraught. On a personal level, although his political platform did not agreecompletely with Italian fascism, Hitler still saw II Duce as something of aspiritual mentor. More importantly, Mussolini was an ally. He had been replacedby Marshal Pietro Badoglio, who at that moment was negotiating with the Alliesfor Italy's surrender. Only two weeks earlier, Allied forces composed of bothBritish and American units had landed in Sicily and were meeting withless-than-enthusiastic resistance from Italian troops. This crisis caused theimplosion at the emergency meeting of the Fascist Grand Council (which had noteven met since 1939), resulting in a demand for the restoration of the monarchyunder King Victor Emmanuel III; in essence requiring Mussolini's resignation asleader of the armed forces. This was enough to alarm the Fiihrer, but in earlySeptember Allied forces had crossed from Sicily onto mainland Italy . . . andBadoglio rushed to sign an armistice with the Western powers. Italy—berefi ofMusso linis leadership—had been handed over to the Allies. Germany had beenbetrayed.No matter what, Mussolini had to be rescued and Fascism oncemore restored to its rightful place in Koine.But there was a problem. No one knew where Mussolini was being held.According to Walter Schellenberg, head of the Foreign Intelligence Division (AMTVI) of the RSHA {Reichsicherheitshauptamt or Reich's Main Security Office) inhis published memoirs, 1 he had no idea where Mussolini had been taken after hisarrest by the Carabinieri. The RSHA was an organization created by the notoriousReinhard Heydrich in September 1939 to combine the various secret policeagencies (the Gestapo, the SIPO, and the Sicherheitsdienst des RFSS or SD) intoa single, monolithic police organization under Himmler's control.According to Schellenberg, Hitler had given orders to find and rescue Mussolinias early as the beginning of August. However, Schellenberg was at a loss as towhere II Duce was being held. And he was already in hot water with the Fiihrerfor suggesting that Hitler withdraw German troops to a position on the wrongside of the Po River to aid Badoglio in his efforts to \"neutralize\" Italy.Hitler considered such reasoning defeatist, and wanted Schellenberg arrested andthrown into prison (at best) or executed for treason (at worst).Himmler (who prized Schellenberg's abilities very highly and who would come torely upon him extensively in the last days of the war) managed to runinterference, and promised Hitler instead that his intelligence service wouldfind Mussolini. Thus, both Himmler and Schellenberg were extremely motivated intheir search for Mussolini, and were willing to try anything.Schellenberg, though, \"had not the faintest inkling of where he was.\" To go onin his words:Therefore, Himmler summoned some of the practitioners of the \"occult sciences\"arrested after the flight of Hess to Great Britain, and had them closeted in aWannsee country house. These quacks were given orders to find out thewhereabouts of Mussolini. 2The \"quacks\" were quite expensive, demanding the very best in food, wine, andcigars, all of which were paid for by Schellenberg's department. Imagine thescene for a moment, and savor it if you will: people who had been arrested andthrown into the death camps in1941 were now, in 1943, summoned to the aid of the Reichsftihrer-SS, HeinrichHimmler himself, on a mission of great importance to the Reich. A hairbreadthaway from being sent back to the camps if they failed and possibly beingtortured and killed as the very \"quacks\" Schellenberg said they were, theyinstead settled in quite comfortably and ordered the best of everything: likeprisoners on death row requesting their last meal. It was either a mark ofincredible audacity or an indication as to how far gone these individuals werethat they were able to maintain their composure under these terrifyingcircumstances and go so far as to make the Foreign Intelligence Service foot ahefty entertainment bill for their \"services.\" And a hefty bill it must havebeen, for it has been the author's experience from direct observation thatoccultists in general have tremendous appetites.For a while it must have been touch-and-go at the country house, and the anxietylevels of both SS officers and psychics alike must have risen to previouslyunrecorded heights. After all, finding Mussolini was a top priority of theFiihrer himself. He was counting on the Italian leader's help in forming a newFascist government and holding the line in Italy against the inexorable Alliedadvance. Moreover, there was danger on other fronts—notably in the Balkans—ofthe Italian Army simply surrendering en masse and leaving vast territories tothe like of Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia. Thus, finding Mussolini was no sideshow.And the outlook for locating II Duce using psychic powers didn't seem toooptimistic at first. Even Himmler must have doubted the wisdom of employing hisformer prisoners in this ultrasensitive intelligence mission.Nevertheless, a \"Master of the Sidereal Pendulum\" succeeded at last in locatingMussolini on an island west of Naples. To do this seer justice, it must berecorded that at the time Mussolini had no apparent contact with the outsideworld. It was, in fact, the island of Ponza to which he had been transferred atfirst. 3In other words, the \"Master of the Sidereal Pendulum\" had success fully locatedthe most famous Italian prisoner ol the twentieth century and with no more thana decent meal, a lew drinks, 2 good smoke, and a pendulum swinging over a map ofItaly.It will be remembered that one of Hitler's closest friends was the\"Master of the Sidereal Pendulum' Dr. (iiubcrlci. Whether Of not itwas this same \"Master\" who worked on the Mussolini problem is not revealed. Yet,Schellenberg's use of the same phrase to describe both men is provocative, ifonly coincidental.At the same time, astrologer Wilhelm WulH was summoned to the office of ArthurNebe, the head of the Kriminalpolizei and an SS-Obergruppenfuhrer who was alsocharged with finding Mussolini. According to Wulffs own account, 4 he drew up aHindu astrological chart and pinpointed Mussolini's location on the same islandof Ponza, which had been identified by the \"Master of the Sidereal Pendulum.\"WulfPs success with this and other projects for Nebe led to the Gestaporeleasing all of his previously confiscated books and most of his papers, s andmarked the beginning of his short career as Nazi astrologer working directly forNebe, Schellenberg, and, eventually, Himmler.As for Mussolini, he was later taken to a hotel on the top of the Gran Sasso (inthe Abruzzi), where he was spectacularly rescued by German commandos and gliderpilots under the command of Austrian-born Luftwaffe officer Otto Skorzeny.Skorzeny will figure later in our account in a somewhat more sinister context,but for now let us examine the pendulum swingers a while longer.The Naval Research InstituteSchellenberg's psychics were not the first pendulum specialists to be employedin an intelligence capacity by the Reich. Earlier, a mysterious department ofthe German Navy used just such a technique in an effort to locate Alliedwarships in the Atlantic Ocean.The best account we have of this agency—referred to rather cryptically by someauthors as the Naval Research Institute —is from Wulffs memoir, Zodiac aiulSwastika,'\" in which he reports that he was recommended as a scientific researchassistant by his friend, Dr. Wilhelm Hartmann, a Nuremberg astrologer anddirector of the astronomical observatory there in 1929, who was obviously in thegood graces of the Nazi regime. Wulff at this time had been recently releasedfrom Fuhlsbiittel prison and had been working for a pharmaceutical corn-pan)-.He had never heard of the institute to which he was now assigned in Berlin, andlearned to his astonishment that the navy was engaged in paranormal research ofthe most extreme variety:All intellectual, natural, and supernatural sources of power—from moderntechnology to medieval black magic, and from the teachings of Pythagoras to theFaustian pentagram incantation—were to be exploited in the interests of finalvictory. 8The man in charge of the top-secret institute was Captain Hans A. Roeder of theGerman Navy. His \"crew\" on this astral voyage was composed of specialists inevery field from astronomy and astrology to ballistics and spiritualism. The toppriority of this motley accumulation of psychics and scientists was the locationof enemy ships.Before the days of satellites and AWACS, there was no reliable method fordetermining the location of enemy convoys beyond actually seeing them (by whichtime it was usually too late to do anything about it). Radar and sonar were goodonly for quite limited ranges. If a system could be developed that wouldpinpoint the location of battleships, destroyers, cruisers, and supply vesselshundreds if not thousands of nautical miles away, then absolute dominion overthe sea could be virtually assured. U-boats could be sent directly to the spoton the map where the enemy convoys had been located and the offending vesselssunk without wandering about for weeks in the open sea looking for targets ofopportunity, wasting precious time and fuel.The navy came up with the idea of using pendulum experts after an experiencewith an elderly architect by the name of Ludwig Straniak, whose home was inSalzburg. Straniak—a master builder who was also an occultist and author of atleast one book on the subject, The Eighth Force of Nature —claimed the abilityto locate anything with his pendulum, and said that if he were shown aphotograph of a ship, he could locate it on a map. The navy decided to give hima try, and Straniak was shown photographs of two of Germany's proudest vcs sels:the Bismarck and the Prinz Eugen. Naturally, these were ships whose preciselocation would have been considered a top military secret for the \"unsinkable\"Bismarck especially was the pride and hope of the whole country. A juggernaut ofarmed nautical might, the Bismarck was the flagship of the new German Navy putto sea in 1941.Its destruction had become an obsession of the British Admiralty. They wouldplay hide-and-seek with it for weeks in a desperate attempt to sink it once andfor all.Straniak studied the photos of both ships, and then held a small device on astring over a map. A pendulum in this instance can be virtually any smallobject—like a crystal, a metal weight, a glass bauble, even a paper clip or anail—tied to a string and allowed to dangle over a map or a chart of numbers andletters (much like a planchette on a Ouija board). Subtle forces are believed tomove the pendulum in various directions depending on the question being asked orthe information sought. In this case, the pendulum was suspended over a map ofthe world's oceans and Straniak would slowly pass it back and forth until eitherthe pendulum began to move on its own accord or until Straniak felt a stirring—aweight slightly in excess of the normal force of gravity and possibly pulling ina different direction—and then the position of the pendulum over the precisecoordinates of the map would be noted at that time.Astonishingly, Straniak did what the British Navy could not. He identified theexact location of both ships.One can easily imagine the consternation of Naval Intelligence officers when itwas learned that a man with a string and a weight could sit in a Berlin officebuilding and locate their most prized warship without benefit of advancedelectronics or a network of spies. And it meant that the British, too, mightpossibly have someone like Straniak working for them, pinpointing the exactlocation of their ships and transmitting that information to the submarinefleet. Indeed, the huge losses suffered by the German Navy due to the success ofthe British Admiralty in locating their ships and U-boats led many to assume an\"occult'' explanation. (They would not realize until the end of the war that theBrits had cracked the German code system.)Straniak's success actually irritated some people in Berlin, who— perhapssuspecting some sort of hoax or weird series of multiple coincidences—demandedthat Straniak be tested thoroughly to determine the extent of his gift. In oneof these tests, a piece of metal was placed on a sheet of paper for a fewseconds and then removed. Straniak was then brought into the room and asked toidentify the spot on the paper where the small metal object had rested.The results were consistent. Straniak could identify the precise spot, even whenhe was not allowed into the room to see the actual sheet of paper used but hadto use the same size paper in a different room.Straniak's odd ability was evidence that there exists in nature a force thatscience has yet to recognize. As usual, this aggravates scientists. So, men ofscience were summoned to Berlin to devise even more strenuous tests for Straniakand the pressure on the old man became too much. Straniak began to fail thesetests miserably, and then to fall ill. It would be awhile—until the 1943 searchfor Mussolini—before the pendulum swingers could cover themselves in gloryagain.Zen and the Art of MemoryAt about this time, astrologer Wilhelm Wulff was brought to Berlin, but on arather different mission. Wulff's other speciality—beyond Hindu astrology andhis own preferred vocation, sculpture—was Asian religion and mysticism,including Hinduism and Buddhism. According to Wulff the Japanese had justcaptured Hong Kong, and in the process demonstrated to the world their suicidalfanaticism. This would have been in late December 1941 . . . that is, only sixmonths or so after the Hess flight to Great Britain and the roundup ofastrologers and occultists that took place, but Wulff puts his internship at theInstitute at March 1942, six months after his release from prison. 9The Japanese troops had thrown themselves bodily into the attack onwell-fortified positions in Hong Kong, anticipating the much-vaunted \"humanwave\" tactic of the Chinese Communists. Japanese soldiers would block the firingapertures of pillboxes and other fortifications with their own bodies. Theywould rush, screaming, into strongly held positions and fall by the thousandsand still not give up the charge. Clearly, the Wehrmacht could use a fewdivisions of men like that and it was Wulff's job—as a specialist in Asianreligion and mystic ism — to come up with a proposal on how best to instill sucha complete and utter disregard for one's own safety into the common (icrmansoldier. 10Sadly, we do not haw am more information at our disposal on these proposals. Wedon't know if Wulff completed them, or if theWehrmacht eventually made use of them if he did. One thing is certain, ofcourse, and that is that the first SS divisions put into actual combat weremodels of just this type of \"complete and utter disregard\" for their own safety.They rushed into extremely dangerous situations and came out victorious. TheWehrmacht had to grudgingly admit their prowess and courage.The incident at the Naval Research Institute concerning Asian psychologicaltechniques modified for German purposes takes us into another realm of psychicwarfare, one that has persisted to this day. As in World War II, the impetus fordeveloping a means of psychologically conditioning combat troops began with athreat from the East. Five \\ cars after the end of the war, another one brokeout in Korea. This time, American soldiers were returning home from briefperiods of captivity in Korea and Manchuria having undergone completepersonality changes. The term \"brainwashing\" became the watchword of ageneration of military men, intelligence officers, novelists, and filmmakers,who saw a whole world of terror and unseen saboteurs in the idea of men whocould control human behavior—Svengali-like—from afar. As usual, the credit forthe invention of this technique was given to unknown masters in the mysteriousEast.But brainwashing was more than simply a method for turning liberty-lovingAmerican troops into diehard Communists; it comprised the entire field ofbehavior modification, including the implanting of false memories and theretrieval of true ones. It also concerned the programming of the perfectassassin: one who would kill without regard for his personal safety . . . andthen forget who had programmed him to kill, and why. 11To these sinister ends an entire menu of devices and theories were employed,from hypnosis to hallucinogens. And the first to experiment with drugs as ameans of altering human behavior were the Nazis.As revealed by statements in Wolfram Sievers's diaries and by other records andNuremberg testimony concerning medical experimentation at Dachau, ,2 theAhnenerbe was actively involved in a program of experimentation on unwittingprisoners with the use of mescaline. Under SS-Sturmbanfiihrer Dr. Kurt Plotnerand an inmate-assistant, Walter Neff, M drinks given to concentration campprisoners were spiked with mescaline and the prisoners observed for signs ofaltered human behavior.This experimentation continued right up to the end of the war. An entry inSievers's official Ahnenerbe diary for February 1945 shows that discussions werebeing held with SS-Hauptsturmfiihrer August Hirt concerning the use of bothmescaline and canabinol by the Soviets, and this being coordinated with RSHA AmtVI, in other words, with Schellenberg's own Foreign Intelligence Section. Theactual entry reads:14. Drugs for various purposes / for coordination with RSHA, Amt VI, SS-Stubaf.Lassig reference Hirt in connection Soviets employment Caucasian rue(Steppenraute?) with Mescaline (synthetic manufacture) and Canabinol. 14It is doubtful that either the Soviets or the Nazis were experimenting or usingmescaline for purely medicinal purposes. Hirt, of course, was one of thoseinvolved—with Bruno Beger, Oswald Pohl, and Rudolf Brandt—in \"anthropologicalresearch\" carried out at Auschwitz, in which the skulls of POWs andconcentration camp inmates were measured in order to develop a standard againstwhich various grades of human and subhuman skull structure could be compared.Sievers's diary for 1943 is full of references to this work being carried outunder Ahnenerbe jurisdiction at Auschwitz.Also being studied—and this, by the notorious Dr. Rascher—was the possibleapplication of Hennyon root extract as a cure for cancer. 15 Rascher alsodeveloped his own styptic formula, 16 and one may well wonder just how thisparticular type of research—the development of an agent to stop bleeding underbattlefield conditions—was carried out. One can be forgiven for doubting thatthe notorious sadist Rascher (whose thirst for other people's pain was exceededonly by that of his wife) used self-inflicted wounds as test samples. In fact,as Nuremberg testimony would eventually reveal, living prisoners were shot atclose range to simulate battlefield conditions and the styptic formula thenapplied to see if it would work.During this same time, the OSS would not consider falling behind its enemies inmind-control research. A \"truth drug\" committee under the direction of I )r. WinI red Overholser.it St. Elizabeth's Hospital inWashington, I >.<. . . cried and rejected mescaline, several barbituates, and scopolamine. Then,during the spring of 1943, the committee decided that cannabis indica —ormarijuana—showed the most promise, and it started a testing program incooperation with the Manhattan Project . . .'These are the words of John Marks, who went a long way toward exposing theorigins of CIA mind-control research in the bloody laboratories ot Dachau in hisbook The Search for the \"Manchurian Candidate. \"And, lest we rest comfortably inthe assumption that our people were not as ruthless as the Nazis, Marks goes onto record that:Wherever their extreme experiments went, the CIA sponsors picked for subjectstheir own equivalents of the Nazis' Jews and gypsies: mental patients,prostitutes, foreigners, drug addicts, and prisoners, often from minoritygroups. 18After the liberation of Dachau, US investigating teams read through theAhnenerbe and Luftwaffe files on the concentration camp experiments, looking foranything that might be useful in a military application. Marks goes on to notethat \"None of the German mind-control research was ever made public.\" 19 Otherthan the hints of it we can discover in Sievers's diary and similar memoranda,that pretty much remains the situation today. A glimpse, however, into thetechniques employed by the Nazis might be had from a look at the famous 1939attempt on the Fuhrer's life by a possibly psychotic individual named Elser whoplanted a bomb in a wooden pillar which went off just a few minutes too late todo the world any good.The Beer Cellar BombingHimmler himself was not unaware of the progress of the mind experiments and tookan avid interest in their outcome. At the time of the attempt on Hitler's lifeknown as the Beer Cellar Explosion of November 8, 1939, Himmler ordered thesuspect—the Swabian engineer Georg Elser—subjected to injections of a \"truthserum\" called pervitin and, eventually, interrogations by four hypnotists. 20Thus, even asearly as November 1939, Himmler's Black Order was aggressively employing drugsand hypnosis in intelligence matters.Hitler had just finished giving his usual November 8 speech in honor of thefailed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923 and had left the building when a bomb went offright where the Fiihrer had been standing. Oddly enough, Hitler had finished hisspeech a few minutes early as if he were aware of the threat. Anyone familiarwith Hitler's speaking knew that he rarely, if ever, cut a speech short. In thisinstance, his change of habit saved his life—just another instance of his famousintuition at work.A suspect—Georg Elser—was picked up and the interrogations began. Historiansstill disagree as to whom Elser was working for, if anyone. Nazis on the scene,such as Walter Schellenberg, tended toward the view that Elser was a psychoticwho worked alone and who had planned the assassination attempt for a year beforecarrying it out. Others were not so sure, and Hitler was determined to show thathe had been the intended victim of a conspiracy.The bombing had the effect of making everyone paranoid. Many Nazi officialsagreed with Hitler and feared that Elser had not acted alone in the attempt, buthad been conspiring with either a Communist cell, an Allied hit team, or evenwith an internal cabal of anti-Hitler Nazis. Himmler was certain that twoBritish officers, Best and Stevens—recently arrested by Schellenberg—wereElser's handlers even though Schellenberg knew it wasn't possible. Arthur Nebe,the Nazis' chief Criminal Investigator, had to endure Himmler's other fear thata left-wing Nazi such as Otto Strasser might have been responsible. Himmler—inneed of confirmation from some source if his own Criminal Investigation peoplecould come up with nothing more substantial than a \"crazed, lone assassin\"—evenwent so far as to enlist the aid of a trance medium to scour the aether lookingfor signs thai the dreaded Strasser was to blame.A further side effect of the Falser bombing was the prediction by the brilliantii eccentric Swiss astrologer Karl Trust kralft (19001945)—of .in attempt on the Fuhrer's life that very day. Kraffi hadtried to warn the Nazis of the possibility, but his report was filed andforgotten.Kraflt's contact within the RSHA (the Reich Security Service) was Dr. HeinrichFesel (1890-1958), an amateur astrologer and yet another student of Sanskrit,who had been recruited by Schellenberg. Fesel worked for AMT VII of the RSHA,the \"Ideological Research\" Division that handled occultism, Freemasonry, andcults. From 1941-1945, this division had been under the leadership of one Dr.Fran/ Alfred Six, 21 a scholarly SS-Brigadefuhrer who earlier became prominentas the leader of the Vorkommando Moskau: a death squad that roamed occupiedRussia, murdering hundreds of civilians, dissidents, and Jews in 1941. Sixjoined the SD in April of 1935 when he was only twenty-six years old; in 1939 hebecame head of AMT II of the RSHA. A year later, Heydrich named him his futurerepresentative in Great Britain after the hypothetically successful Naziinvasion of the British Isles. In other words, Dr. Six would have been largelyresponsible for a program of \"ethnic cleansing\" in England had the Nazis managedto invade and occupy that country.Prior to his involvement with the SS, Six had been the dean of the faculty ofthe University of Berlin, and a professor of law and political science; \"one ofthe most distinguished professors of his generation.\" 22 He joined the NaziParty in 1930, long before Hitler came to power.Dr. Six served about four years of a twenty-year sentence for war crimes afterthe war before returning to work for the \"Special Forces\" section of the GehlenOrganization (the spy cabal of ex-Nazis used by the American CIA for anti-Sovietintelligence work) together with longtime Rosenberg friend Dr. Michael Achmeteliand Dr. Emil Augsburg, a Standartenfiihrer with Adolf Eichmann's notorious S-4department in charge of the \"Jewish problem.\" It is said that Himmler createdthe bizarre occult research division of the RSHA—AMT VII—specifically tor Six,so pleased as he was by Six's enthusiasm for hunting down the enemies of theReich in Russia during the summer of l c )il at SmolenskIn l c )61, Six was still at large and this time working as an agent for thePorsche automobile company.former subordinate, Adolf Eichmann, standing trial for war crimes in Israel, hadworked for Daimler-Benz, Porsche's competitor, -one of the most eager murderersof Jews in the Reich—very kindly showed up in Jerusalem as Eichmann's defensewitness.(As of this writing the scholarly and satanic Dr. Six is still at large and willprobably never serve more than those four years in prison long ago for the warcrimes he committed with such enthusiasm.)When the attempt on Hitler had actually taken place, Krafft began pestering theNazis and calling their attention to his prediction. This was a mortal error,for eventually Krafft ended his days as a guest of the SS and would die in aconcentration camp. He was one of many astrologers who came under officialsuspicion after the flight of Rudolf Hess to Scotland, and wound up arrested andpacked off to the camps, even though in Krafft's case he had previously been onFesel's payroll atAMTVIIoftheRSHA.The \"affaire Krafft\" has been described in great detail by occult historianEllic Howe in Urania's Children, 14 but the salient points should be brieflymentioned here as an indication of the extent to which the Reich usedoccultists, astrologers, clairvoyants, etc. in a climate of total war.Although Krafft's peculiar character made him a difficult person to work with,his brilliance seemed to make him, at times, indispensable. He is typical ofthat type of genius for whom no science has yet been invented; i.e., imagineEinstein having been born in an age when mathematics was virtually unknown. OrMozart, a child prodigy in music, born to a family of cavemen. That Krafft was agenius is probably without doubt; that he was forced to find an outlet for hisgenius in such areas as astrology is probably more an indication that whateverKrafft was born for had not yet been invented than evidence that Krafft wassomehow congenitally neurotic or paranoid, or intellectually impaired.A few months after his prediction about the Hitler assassination attempt cametrue, Krafft was hired by the SS—supposedly under contract to Dr. Goebbels, theNazi propaganda chief—to compose a translation of Nostradamus's famous propheticquatrains in such a way that the medieval French seer would seem to bepredicting a Nazi victory in the Second World War.This was obviously to be used in a propaganda effort against the Allies, and .itfirst the task was undertaken with gusto. Alter a while, though, Kralliexperienced [Kings <>l conscience at distorting the message of the ancient .ist rologer and struggled to make his version .in ptablevision of the original. It should he mentioned th.it krafftwas an enthusiastic Nazi and sincerely believed that Nostradamus had predictedthe Second World War and various German victories.Eventually, in December of 1940, KraffVs version of the Nostradamus prophecieswas published in a limited edition of 299 copies, but it was not enough to savehim from the camps. On June 12, 1941—a month after the flight of Hess—he wasarrested by AMT IV of the RSHA: the notorious Gestapo. This time, even hishighly placed friends in the Party—including the Nazi Governor-General ofPoland, Hans Frank—could not help him. Frank himself had attended the meetingwith Hitler and Bormann in which it was decided to blame the flight of Hess onthe astrologers.Karl Ernst Krafft—the astrologer who accurately predicted the Beer CellarBombing—joined that other famous Hitler seer, Hanussen, in a bitter, undeservedfate, for he died on the way to Buchenwald from Oranienberg concentration campon January 8, 1945.#9#Cult CounterstrikeIt might be assumed from the preceding chapters that the cultic elements of theSecond World War were all on the side of the Nazis. This was not the case, as wewill attempt to show in this chapter. Several rather famous officers of theBritish intelligence services were involved in a campaign to anticipate or evencounteract the activities of the German cults and their grim reincarnations inthe Ahnenerbe-SS, Goebbels's Propaganda Ministry Department AMO (Astrology,Metapsychology, Occultism), the Naval Research Institute, and AMT VII of the SD.This does not imply that the Allies were taking occultism seriously. They didrecognize, however, that the Nazis were taking it seriously and for a while itwas incumbent upon British Intelligence to discover as much as they could aboutthe various occult sciences adopted by the Nazis in general and the SS inparticular. Once they realized thai Himmler was listening to his astrologers,they knew that a few good astrologers working for the British could tell themwhat Himmler's astrologers were telling him.That there is a certain level oi internal consistency in astrology was taken forgranted; chat is, a Sun-Mars square affecting the first and fourth houses olsomeone's natal chart—an event thai could be identi fied by simply referring toan ephemeris and a table ol houses, astro logical tools which are pretty muchidentical no mattei what countr} one is working in could Ik- interpretedsimilarly by both the British astrologers and the ( lermans; or, ai the veryhast, a British astrologeifamiliar with the methods employed by his German counterpart would be able topredict with reasonable success what the German astrologer was telling Hitler,Hess, or Himmler. The fact that such planets were in alignment at all wassomething of which every astrologer anywhere would be aware, and could thus beused in such a way by a capable propagandist to insinuate the success or failureof a military enterprise.And when the Nazis banned the German occult lodges, they provided the Allieswith a useful tool to use against them. The occult lodges had an undergroundnetwork throughout Europe—replete with coded phrases, secret hand signals, andthe like—that could be exploited by the intelligence agencies and it was to thisend that secret agents like future novelists Dennis Wheatley and Ian Flemingtoyed with the idea of using Aleister Crowley's connections in Germany (andamong the secret societies of Europe and America) against the Third Reich.Crowley ReduxThe British War Office had a long memory.During the Great War it was well known that Aleister Crowley had writtenpro-German propaganda from a safe berth in New York City. Crowley'sprotestations that he was really working on behalf of Allied Intelligenceinterests —from the British Secret Service to the American Justice Department—seemed to have fallen on deaf ears back in Great Britain, where Crowley wasofficially characterized as a \"small time traitor\" by the former British navalattache in Washington, Sir Guy Gaunt. However, Crowley's services to MI5 duringthe period between the wars proved reliable enough, and there is some evidencethat he might actually have been telling the truth about his World War Iexperience in New York. According to at least one researcher, the Americansadmitted that Crowley actually WOS working as theirintelligence agent while editing The Fatherland 2nd The International,just as Ciowley himself had always insisted. Whatever one cared tobelieve about Crowley's loyalty and motives, however, by 1941 thesituation had changed dramatically.Hess had been seduced into flying to Great Britain in what was probably one ofthe greatest intelligence coups of the war thus far (a coup that was badlybungled by the British when it actually occurred, for they did not make thepolitical hay out of it that they could have). But who actually did theseducing? Nazi astrologers who advised Hess in all sincerity to undertake hisdoomed \"peace mission\"? A German resistance movement, of which Karl and AlbrechtHaushofer were members, feeding Hess false information concerning theirconnections with sympathetic British nobility?Or was it another cabal entirely?While the whole story of the Hess flight may never be known, there is enoughevidence to suggest that the occult circle around Hess might have beeninfiltrated by astrologers working for MI5.And that's where Aleister Crowley comes in, as one of MI5's oddest—butpotentially most useful—secret agents.In the first place, most of Crowley's cronies on the Continent were beingrounded up and sent to the camps. All the occult lodges were banned, from theGolden Dawn to the Masonic Societies to the OTO, and this was especially trueafter the Hess affair. Ceremonial magicians with outrageous titles of astraleminence were being shoved unceremoniously into Esterwegen and Dachau. Crowley'smany German mistresses had probably wound up in similar circumstances (those whohad not committed suicide or found themselves in mental asylums beforehand),either as social misfits, \"useless eaters\" (a term that covered every variety ofthe physically and mentally handicapped), or simply as guilty by associationwith Baphomet himself.But the leadership of the Third Reich was replete with deranged mystics, evenafter the lodges had been shut and the camps swollen with the presence ofFreemasons, Thelemites, Theosophists, Odd Fellows, and Swedenborgians. Someoccultists were actually being freed to work for the Nazi cause (as described inthe previous chapter). And, interestingly enough, Crowley's oldpartner-in-propaganda, George Viereck, was still operating his pro-Germanapparatus in New York City, this time with .1 decidedly Nazi agenda. Viereck hadactually grown somewhat well-to-do on the constant How of funds coming his wayfrom Party sources in Germany, funds that were paying fbi his adroit hand atpropaganda and disinformation.Was there a chance that Crowley's connections and knowledge of the occultscene—particularly in Germany, but also in the United States—could be used in aconstructive way to aid the Allied causerThe Devil Rides OutDennis Wheatley is the well-known author of dozens of novels as well as a fewnonfiction books. It is said that even Hermann Goring was a Wheatley fan, and aNazi spy in London once communicated to Berlin that Wheatley would make anexcellent Gauleiter for northwest London after a Nazi invasion! 2 In the UnitedStates he is perhaps best known for his occult novels of which three— The DevilRides Out, To the Devil a Daughter, and The Satanist —stand out as more\"hardcore\" than the others. These books introduced modern ceremonial magic toWheatley's audience and combined elements of Thelema— Crowley's cult—with thoseof some Eastern religious practices and the more staid Golden Dawn rituals andTheosophical beliefs in a hodgepodge of cultures that proved nonethelessexciting to that portion of the market that thrills to tales of Satan worshipand secret, worldwide societies that mix sexual initiations with militaryadventurism (an \"Allied\" version of the Nazi Bolshevik-Jew-Freemason conspiracytheory). Needless to say, the Thelemites and Satanists both come out lookingpretty much the same: lewd black magicians with terrible body odor who live infear of arousing the displeasure of Luci-fuge Rofocale, the British ForeignOffice, or some other Demon.()ddly enough, Wheatley is one of the very few occult novelists who actually metthe Beast himself. According to his own account— published in The Devil and AllHis Works —he found Crowley a wonderful conversationalist and had him to dinnerseveral times/ In another place in the same book—a nonfiction summary of occultpractices and beliefs with an emphasis on the seamier side—he mentions casuallythat he worked with Churchill's own Joint Planning Staff during the war in abasement under Whitehall.' What he neglects to mention (for fear of arousing thewrath of Lucifuge Rofocale? or of being prosecuted under the Official SecretsAct?) is that, laboring in an intelligence capacity along with that \"other\"spook novelist, Ian Fleming, he actually once considered using the services ofAleister .'. ley around the time of the Hess flight.This was not so strange as it might seem. In the first place, of course, it waswell known that Hess was mystically inclined and deeply involved with astrology.The German resistance movement knew that the Haushofers had secretly turnedagainst the Fiihrer, and that the Haushofers were also—if onlyperipherally—involved in occult practices; indeed, it was an open secret thatAlbrecht Haushofer was something of an astrologer himself, or at any rate aneducated layman. 5 Who better to debrief Hess the Egyptian-born mystic thananother mystic, one with strong ties to the German occult movement: AleisterCrowley himself?Further, it was probably no secret at all to American and British intelligenceofficials that deep within the United States' own rocket program—and thusengaged in a highly classified race against the Nazi scientists atPeenemiinde—lurked another Thelemite and member of Crowley's OTO, the brilliantengineer Jack Parsons.Parsons was involved in rocket fuel research, principally of the \"solid-fuel\"variety, and therefore his work was vital to the war effort and to thesubsequent space program. A charter member of Cal-Tech and the Jet PropulsionLaboratory, Parsons is probably the only known occultist—and certainly the onlyThelemite—who has a crater on the Moon (dark side) named after him.Although this is not the space to go into the Parsons story in detail, someinformation is necessary to show the extent to which Crowley's organization wasinvolved in magick and the war effort on the side of the Allies and on bothsides of the Atlantic.In 1939, Jack Parsons became involved with Crowley's OTO through the Agape Lodgeof California, then being run by one W. T. Smith, who had been a Thelemite since1915 via the Vancouver Lodge under Charles Stansfeld Jones (\"Frater Parzival\"),an accountant and a very early member of the OTO from the first days ofCrowley's rulership of the Order's English-speaking world community. In 1942—asignificant year as we shall see—Crowley removed Smith from leadership of theAgape Lodge and installed Parsons as its chief.The Agape Lodge was run from Parsons's home in Pasadena, whererituals were held daily and from where Parsons would collect member ship clues,etc. and forward them CO Karl dermer on the I ast ('oast, who would send them onto ( row -ley in London. In Other words, thisOTO Lodge was being run mote or less openly during the war by aman—magickal name \"Frater 210\"—simultaneously involved in critical work for thewar effort, under the spiritual guidance of a former concentration camp inmatewho corresponded regularly with a man accused of being a former German spy, nowliving in London!Parsons joined the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory, California Institute ofTechnology (GALCIT) in 1936, working for Frank J. Malina and Theodore von Karmanat Pasadena on various problems related to rocket propellants. 6 Once Americaentered World War II, the need for discovering a reliable solid propellantbecame crucial, particularly if the Navy was to develop JATO (Jet AssistedTake-Off) aircraft.Try as they might, the GALCIT people could not come up with a workable formula.The fuels they developed had a tendency to deteriorate after only a few days,making them impossible to transport and store aboard ship. All the differenttypes of black powder fuels were tested and scrapped.Finally, it was Jack Parsons who came up with the solution that enabled Americato enter the rocket-propelled aircraft race. In 1942— the year he became head ofthe Agape Lodge and moved its headquarters into his home—he decided to abandonthe black powder concept altogether and came up with a solution that could onlyhave come from someone with a working knowledge of the arcane lore of alchemyand magic: Greek fire/To this day, no one really knows how he intuited the switch from black powder toasphalt and potassium perchlorate. But it worked, and was GALCIT's firstbreakthrough of the war. The solid propellant designed and formulated by JackParsons became widely used by the US Navy in 1944 and 1945 with great success. 8Parsons himself, however, became the subject of what might have been a Federalinvestigation into his occult activities during the war. In April 1945—the monththe war ended in Europe—he became invoked with one \"Frater H,\" who proved adisastrous companion for \\ rater 210. Claiming he was working either for NavalIntelligence or the FBI or even, oddly, LAPD—depending on the source youbelieve, it any—1 rater 11 succeeded in virtually destroying Parsonss life andhis grip on reality. Performing various rituals of sex-magick and angelicinvocations with Frater H, Parsons believed he had contacted some of the samehigher powers with which Crowley had conversedin Cairo in 1904; he even went so far as to communicate these beliefs to theGreat Beast himself, without going into details, pledged as he was to a pact ofsecrecy with these alien beings. Crowley rightly assumed that Parsons was beingmade a victim of some sort of confidence trick just as the mysterious Frater Hwas absconding with money from a joint account he held with Parsons and wound upactually marrying Parsons's girlfriend.By 1948, Parsons had declared himself the Antichrist. By 1952, Parsons—now knownas \"Belarion Armiluss Al Dajjal Antichrist\"— would drop a vial of fulminate ofmercury at his home laboratory and with the resulting explosion one of the morebrilliant—if terribly sad—figures in contemporary occultism would be dead at theage of thirty-eight. Upon hearing of her son's death, his mother committedsuicide the same day.\"Frater H\"—the man who was most responsible for leading Parsons into madness by(among other things) stealing his money and his girlfriend—was none other thanscience fiction author and Scientology creator L. Ron Hubbard.In addition to people like Parsons in America, Crowley's contacts throughoutEurope were numerous and they involved a wide range of people from society-typespiritualists who dabbled in ritual magic to coffeehouse intellectuals andartists of various persuasions to the lowest rungs of civilization. His utilityto MI5 during his Berlin days, when he spied on German Communists, was notforgotten. Further, he had been cultivated by Dennis Wheatley, who found theoccult fascinating and who eventually—according to Anthony Masters—became alow-level initiate in what must have been one of Crowley's own magickal lodges,the A.-.A.-, or the OTO. <; The ostensible reason for this was to study magicunder the Master, so that he could lend an air of verisimilitude to his occultnovels. Anyone interested in seeing how much Wheatley absorbed merely has topick up any of the three above mentioned books and study them carefully. Thereader will find (row lev's A.-.A.*, degree structure used and many of theincantationsand rituals (in appropriately abridged forms) shamelessly exploited fordramatic effa t.( iowk\\ was introduced to Wheadey by the journalist Tom Driberg, who would later become- a labour MP and who fol wars servedas an MI5 spy inside the Communist Party of Great Britain. 10 (Ori-berg,referred to as l Z' in Wheatleys book, joined the Communists and dutifullyreported back to MI5 until being discovered by British spymaster and Soviet moleAnthony Blunt, who had him kicked out of the Party.) While Wheatley admits hefound Crowley fascinating, he did not feel the Great Beast merited the degree ofawe and fear that his followers and detractors, respectively, accorded him. Itwas Driberg who was quick to point out that Crowley did, indeed, possessmarvelous occult powers but, alas, that the ritual in Paris had all but killedhim.This story—which became one of Wheatleys favorite tales and which is repeated inseveral of his books—has Crowley invoking the Great God Pan in the upstairs roomof a hotel on the Left Bank along with the assistance of his \"son,\" thepseudonymous MacAJeister. Evidently the ritual (like the proverbial surgicaloperation) was a success, but the assistant died. Crowley himself—according tothis tale— spent four months in a mental asylum after being found completelynaked and curled up in fetal position in a corner, gibbering. Needless to say,this story does not appear in any of the official biographies of Crowley but itsa great story, nevertheless.(It should be pointed out that John Symonds—whose biography of Crowley, TheGreat Beast, was published in 1951—refers to Mr. Dri-bergs loan of Crowley'sdiaries on his acknowledgments page without giving us a clue as to how Mr.Driberg—Wheatley's \"Z,\" Member of Parliament, and British secret agent—managedto be in possession of them in the first place, so soon after Crowley's death in1947.\" Was the story about the Paris evocation of Pan contained within thosevery pageWheatley—who was friendly with many of the twentieth century's most famousoccultists, including the reincarnationist Joan Grant and the author Rollo Ahmed(whom he may have once tried to recruit into MI5) 12 —also had an abidinginterest in crime and detection. It was in this connection that he happened tomeet one of the most famous names in the history of British intelligence,Maxwell Knight.Knight was the prototype lor Ian Flemings character, \"M\": the Intelligence chiefwhom we always see in the movies giving Sean Con-nerv or Roger Moore hisdangerous, 'license to kill\" assignment. What is not generally known is that \"M\"was also introduced to Aleis-ter Crowley—by Dennis Wheatley—and was actually quite friendly with the Magus.Wheatley had met Knight at a party and the two hit it off right away. Knightwanted to get a book published, and Wheatley helped him to publicize it. Whatthey eventually realized is that they also shared an interest in the occult.Wheatley invited Knight to dinner at his home when he knew Crowley would bethere, and the three of them became quite friendly. Wheatley and Knightapproached Crowley on the subject of magick (Crowley's version, spelled with a\"k\" to distinguish it from both legerdemain and from other, lesser, forms ofmagic), and Crowley agreed to take them on as students. This has got to be oneof the most startling, if amusing, situations imaginable; for here is MaxwellKnight— \"M\" after all—accepting a kind of occult initiation from AleisterCrowley and becoming his pupil! 13 Himmler was obsessed by the idea that BritishIntelligence was being run by the Rosicrucian Order and that occult adepts werein charge of MI5 (a view still held today by such political eccentrics as LyndonLaRouche). How would he have reacted had he known that the formidable MaxwellKnight, head of Department B5(b), the countersubversion section of MI5, was adisciple of Aleister Crowley himself? And that Dennis Wheatley—he of the occultnovels favored by Goring—was also a student of Crowley's and simultaneouslyworking for Churchill's Joint Planning Staff?Oh, how the black candles would have burned that night!Particularly if Himmler had also been told that yet another British secretagent—this time James Bond novelist Ian Fleming of the Department of NavalIntelligence—was plotting to bring Reichsleiter Rudolf Hess to England on anoccult pretext involving . . . Aleister (irowley.As this story is told in several places by respected historians ol the BritishSecret Service, 14 and thus has the seal of authenticity, it is worth repeatinghere for the benefit ol those not normally involved insuch research.It is generally agreed among the various sources thai the outlandish idea olcapturing Rudolf Hess a man largely viewed as Hitler's second in command at the lime -began with Ian Fleming. Fleming,who had been a banker before the war, wound up at the Department of NavalIntelligence in what was essentially a desk job. Hungering formore dramatic employment and realizing he would not get it at DNI, he turnedinstead to Knight, who had a reputation for being something of a maverick (andwho had, more importantly, a direct line to Churchill through yet another mutualfriend of Wheatley and Knight, Desmond Morton). Basically, the idea was this:There had been a rather subversive organization in Great Britain known as TheLink. The Link was ostensibly an Anglo-German \"cultural society\" once under theauspices of a Sir Barry Domville, who had also once been Director of NavalIntelligence from 1927 to 1930, but who had since been interned because of hispro-Nazi sentiments and connections. The Link had been under Knightssurveillance in the 1930s and then dissolved when enough evidence was foundimplicating it in espionage activities and the like.Fleming—whiling away his time behind a desk at DNI—had been reading the files onDomville and an idea occurred to him.He thought that if the Nazis could be made to believe that The Link was still inexistence, they could use it as bait for the Nazi leadership. The point was toconvince the Nazis that The Link had influence sufficient to overthrow theChurchill government and thereby to install a more pliable British government,one which would gladly negotiate a separate peace with Hitler.But whom among the Nazi leadership was naive enough to fall for the story?Rudolf Hess had always been something of an Anglophile and it was known throughintelligence sources—probably by way of the Haushofers and their Resistancecircle—that he was anxious for peace with England so that Germany couldconcentrate on defeating Russia, the \"real enemy.\" Hess also had a reputationfor being something of a gullible sort who surrounded himself with mystics andstargazcrs.It was but a short leap from there to realizing that Knight's friend and occultmentor, Aleister Crowley, would be quite useful in such a context. Also, it ispossible that Fleming—poring through the DNI files as he was—had come across Sir(iuy C iaunt's World War I records on Crowley. Gaunt, it will be remembered, wasBritain s naval attache in Washington during that war, and therefore l)\\Ts manin America. He also ran an effective espionage campaign in the States that keptaneye on pro-German activities, and was even running agents inside the AustrianEmbassy. Gaunt had succeeded in arranging the capture of an important Germansaboteur—Captain Franz Rintelen von Kleist, who was responsible for severalexplosions at US arms factories—and eventually retired to Tangier with the rankof admiral. When Crowley's hostile biographer, John Symonds, wrote to Gauntconcerning Crowley, it was Gaunt who agreed with Symonds that Crowley was just a\"small time traitor.\" 15 Gaunt had kept Crowley and The Fatherland on his listof usual suspects, and had discussed him with A. J. Balfour (the ForeignSecretary) and Basil Thomson (the Secret Service's liaison at Special Branch,Scotland Yard) advising them both not to worry about the Great Beast, that Gaunthad everything under control. 16 Unfortunately, owing to the Official SecretsAct and the strange, twilight landscape of the secret services, we shallprobably never know Gaunt's real take on Crowley.Fleming and Knight pondered the problem for a while. Crowley's personality wassuch that the two spies were unsure how far they could control him in the field.Even more importantly, Crowley's intelligence contacts were probably well knownto the Germans since his early Berlin days spying on Communists for the British;thus, Crowley's cover was probably already \"blown\" in spook parlance, althoughthe well-publicized raid on OTO headquarters in London in reprisal for Crowley'sostensibly pro-German activities during World War I might have been used toconvince the Nazis that Crowley was really their man.However, they turned to astrology. Via a Swiss astrologer known to Fleming,astrological advice was passed on to Hess (again, via the Haushofers and by Dr.Ernst Schulte-Strathaus, an astrological adviser and occultist on Hess's staffsince 1935) advocating a peace mission to England; further, the Duke of Hamiltonwas persuaded to let it be known that he would entertain a visit from Hess forjust that purpose. May 10, 1941, was selected as the appropriate date since anunusual conjunction of six planets in Taurus (that had the soothsayers hummingfor months previous) would take place at that time. 17 The aspect would signalimportant and long-lasting developments in the mundane world. It was .i mostauspicious time lor an undertaking of global ramifications, and this wasprecisely the day I less chose to fly, solo, to Great Britain to meet with theDuke of Hamilton to discuss a peacetreaty between England and Germany that would allow the Nazis free rein on theContinent and particularly against the Soviet Union. (It is for this reason thatthe Soviets steadfastly refused to allow Hess to leave Spandau Prison after theNuremberg Tribunals; Hess's mission—had it been successful—would have permittedthe destruction of the Soviet Union and the probable massacre of most of itspopulation by the SS.)Indeed, to Hitler both the astrologers and the Haushofers were guilty of somekind of conspiracy. In what was eventually known as the Aktion Hess, theastrologers were rounded up and sent to the camps while Albrecht Haushofer waspicked up for questioning by the Gestapo.The rest, as they say, is history. On that day, coincidentally the date of thelast major air raid on Great Britain, Hess made the flight, landed in Scotland,and was promptly arrested. Oddly, however, the British government did not makethe use they could have of this outstanding intelligence coup and Hesslanguished in prison. Fleming tried to obtain permission for Crowley to debriefHess in order to develop intelligence on the occult scene in the Third Reich andparticularly among the Nazi leadership, but suddenly the \"secret chiefs\" turnedcold toward the idea. 18 For reasons which were never made clear—and whichprobably had more to do with internal British politics and the danger ofexposing a genuine pro-German cabal of traitors high up in the Britishgovernment—Hess was treated as a pariah almost from the moment he landed and achance to learn once and for all about the genuine extent of an Occult Reich waslost forever. The idea that Hess had been lured to Scotland by BritishIntelligence—and possibly with the help of the American OSS—was suspected bymany in Gcmian\\. When Hess's Messerschmidt was inspected by aeronauticalengineers, for example, they found numerous examples of American-made parts,including the tires and the gas tank, which gave rise to rumors that the Allieshad been more than cooperative in the effort to ensure the Reichsleiter made itsafely to Scotland. 1 '' What is more mysterious is why, once Hess had arrivedsafe and sound on British soil, he was then totally ignored and the incidentshrugged off as the aet of a madman, much to Hitler's relief as it was identicalto the way he was handling it in Germany. What could have been a majorpropaganda coup against the Nazis went utterly wasted, as if by tacit agreementon both sides.Crowley's efforts to help the British war effort did not end with Hess, however,for he plied MI5 with all sorts of plans for occult propaganda. According topublished sources, these were not implemented. Yet, there was one cultcountermeasure that smacks of Crowley's fine Thelemic hand. In a way, it hadbeen recommended by Crowley, but its execution was left to another section ofBritish intelligence led by Sefton Delmer of the Political Warfare Executive.Astrological WarfareCrowley felt that profit could be gained by dropping occult pamphlets fromplanes onto the German countryside. 20 While the exact nature of these proposedpamphlets has never been revealed, it seems safe to say that they would have atleast contained predictions about the outcome of the war and descriptions of theNazi leadership as \"satanic,\" etc., and perhaps even details of the occultpractices—both real and invented—of the Nazi elite. While that idea wasrejected, a similar one was eventually developed on both sides of the Channel.While the Swiss astrologer Krafft was working up his faked Nostradamuspredictions (as described in Chapter Eight), there was yet another astrologerworking for the spooks, this time for the Department of Psychological Warfare inLondon. Holding the rank of captain in the British Army, Hungarian-born Louis deWohl made much of his connections with Nazi astrologers and managed to convincethe Secret Service that he could be of inestimable value to the war effort. 21This was to be exploited in two ways. In the first place, de Wohl could informBritish Intelligence of what the Nazi astrologers were telling Hitler, Himmler,and the rest of the leadership. In other words since he was familiar with themethods employed by those astrologers closest to the halls of power in Berlin—hewould know when I litler was being advised lo attack or retreat, negotiate orfight,declare war oi sue for peace.In the- second place, he could he counted on to provide falsifiedological information chat would be disseminated among the Geiman astrological community, causing them to counsel peaceful negotiations and toadvise the Nazis of the impossibility of winning the war.To this end, a forged version of the popular German astrological magazine,Zenit, was produced by de Wohl and his collaborators— among them the notedoccult historian and wartime spook Ellic Howe—and dropped behind enemy lines.Virtually identical to the original Zenit (down to the classified ads), itnonetheless contained subtle Allied propaganda in the form of astrologicaladvice.It would be the annoyingly helpful Wilhelm Wulff who would be handed a copy ofthe magazine and who would identify it as a clever British forgery toSchellenberg, all the while marveling at its authentic appearance. Crates of ithad been intercepted on the way into Germany from Sweden, and the publisher'sname had been given as the famous Dr. Korsch, an astrologer who had died in thecamps years earlier. Thus, while it would not have fooled the Nazis themselves,it might have succeeded in alarming the general population, which was starvedfor astrological advice anyway. As it is, we shall never know the extent towhich the forged Zenit could have been useful for, as mentioned, crates of itwere seized by the Gestapo before they could be distributed. But another occultoperation of the British intelligence services did work admirably well.An OBEfor an OBE?The intelligence operative known by her code-name, Anne, probably never receivedthe Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her amazing work for the SecretService during World War II, but she certainly deserved it for she performed oneof the most amazing feats of intelligence gathering of that or any war. Shepenetrated to the heart of the Reichswehr in Berlin, copied classifieddocuments, and reported on secret conversations between military leaders . . .and all without leaving her armchair in London. She did it by utilizing herspecial gift of astral travel, what New Agers today refer to as \"Out of BodyExperience\" or . . . OBII his charming and intriguing story is given in only one place the author isaware of, a book entitled Women in Espionage by a formerCzechoslovak government official whose book on Rudolf Hess— Hess: The Man andHis Mission —appears in many World War II bibliographies. The official's name isJ. Bernard Hutton, and he claims to have tracked down and met the mysterious\"Anne\" . . . who unfortunately remained loyal to the Service (and to theOfficial Secrets Act) and would not divulge any details of her exploits onbehalf of MI5. However, he was able to determine that \"Anne\" had one dayappeared at the office of an \"Intelligence chief\" with a sealed letter ofrecommendation from one of his friends. I like to think this \"chief\" was MaxwellKnight, whose tolerance for the occult was no secret, but that is purespeculation on my part.No matter. \"Anne\"—a former ambulance driver whose poor health had forced her toretire—professed to be able to obtain information on Nazi military intentions by\"mind-traveling\": that is, she would lean back in a chair, close her eyes, and\"travel\" to the place desired and eavesdrop on what was being said. She couldeven read documents and—with her photographic memory and command of the Germanlanguage (the result of some student years spent in Berlin and Zurich)—relaytheir contents completely and accurately upon her \"return.\"Anne was tested several times by the Service, and found to be quite reliable.She was then \"sent\" on various intelligence assignments to Germany and partsunrecorded, successfully bringing back the war-critical data as required. Mr.Hutton reports that Anne's information was treated with respect and that\"British political and military strategy was influenced and helped by Anne'sreports.\"\"Compared to the trance medium employed by Himmler to uncover the conspiracybehind the Beer Hall explosion, Anne wins by a landslide. One wonders if anyNazi psychics were ever aware of Anne's spiritual form wafting through the hallsof the Reichswehr, the Reichstag, or perhaps even the bedrooms at Hitler'sBerchtesgaden retreat, recording everything she saw with her ethereal—yeilethally photo graphic—second sight?The Yonkers Connectionlest the readei come away with the suspicion thai the cult countei strike w.isstrictly .1 British affair, the author hastens to point out oneparticularly interesting American contribution, in the person of SamuelUntermyer.Sam Untermyer was reportedly a member of the Golden Dawn in New York City, 23and was well known in local legal and political circles as something of aphilanthropist as well as a formidable attorney. According to investigativejournalist Maury Terry, a British newspaper called Untermyer a \"satanist.\" 24 Tothe British press, of course, this could have meant anything from Theosophist tocannibal. Considering Untermyer's accomplishments and sentiments, however, theauthor tends to agree that, if anything, he truly was a member of the GoldenDawn.In 1903, he purchased the former estate of Samuel Tilden in Yon-kers. Tilden wasfamous for his unsuccessful bid for the presidency against Rutherford B. Hayesin 1876. This property—known as \"Greystone\"—became a public park afterUntermyer's death in 1940, and it would be here at Untermyer Park (withinwalking distance of David Berkowitz's Yonkers apartment) that the Son of Samcult would have its earliest meetings—and where it sacrificed dogs to Satan—thirty-seven years later.But Untermyer was also well-known for his persistent anti-Nazi crusade in NewYork, a crusade which began in 1933 with Hitler's accession to power in Germanyand which did not end until Untermyer's death in March 1940.s Untermyer wastireless in promoting a boycott of German products under the aegis of his\"Non-Sectarian Anti-Nazi League to Champion Human Rights'' and the \"WorldAnti-Nazi Council.'' The World Anti-Nazi Council was a truly globalorganization, with representation in Asia, Africa, and South America as well asin Europe. Untermyer even financed a touring exhibit of Nazism across the UnitedStates in the mid-1930s. More than that, however, he also threw his considerableresources behind the hunt for Nazi agents who were pouring into the country fromfreighters and steamship lines at New York's west-side piers. As evidence invarious Congressional investigations at the time had shown, Untermyer's was aname the Third Reich had learned to fear. In May 1935 Sam Untermyer enlisted theaid of a volunteer investigator, Richard Rollins, in a campaign ofcounterespionage against the various Nazi and Fascist gangs who were openly andaggressively recruiting in the United States at that time, primarily under theleadership ol Fritz Kllhn, the notori-ous head of the German-American Bund, who was on the payroll of the Third Reichand who had marched in Berlin at the head of a Bund column during the Olympics.Rollins was named chief investigator for a secret society, referred to only as\"the Board\" and under the leadership of Untermyer, composed of individuals andorganizations whose identities have never been revealed.Rollins went on to great success against the Bund, the Silver Shirts, the BlackLegion, and the Klan, among others, always with the discreet but powerful forceof Samuel Untermyer and \"the Board\" behind him. How this old Golden Dawninitiate and tireless anti-Nazi crusader would have felt about his belovedGreystone estate being used for Satan worship is left up to the reader'simagination.In Rollins's published memoir of his anti-Nazi escapades—/ Find Treason —wediscover a bizarre account of the fascist Black Legion initiation ritual, whoseoath is revealing, indeed:In the name of God and the Devil, [it begins] and by the power of light anddarkness, Good and Evil, here under the Black arch of heaven's answering symbol,I pledge and consecrate my body, my limbs, my heart and my mind and swear by allthe powers of Heaven and Hell that I will devote my life . . . 26The oath goes on to include a Masonic-type injunction that, should the initiatebreak his oath, he will be torn to pieces, scattered over the earth, and soforth, and ends with \"In the name of God and the Devil, Amen.\" What interests ushere, however, is the invocation of both God and the Devil: a peculiarity thatwill crop up again in the neo-Nazi Process Church of the Final Judgment, a groupthat (as we shall sec in Chapter Thirteen) has been implicated in several of thetwentieth century's most ghastly crimes.Thus, as we have been at pains to prove, the cult war was not entirelyone-sided. The stones about Louis de Wohl, Aleister Crowley, Jack Parsons,Dennis Whcatlev, Iau Fleming, Rudolf 1 less, Ellic \\ [owe, Maxwell Knight, andthe mysterious Anne all demonstrate thai British Intelligence took the occultaspects of the conflici very seriously and like their Nazi counterpartsexploited whatever it could, nomatter how bizarre or \"unscientific,\" to ensure final victory and the survivalof its people. Everyone reading this book already knows who won that conflict;but perhaps they are not aware of the occult ramifications of the finalGotterddmmerung and of its legacy to a new generation of cultists and Nazis.picture16 [images/picture16.jpg]Witches' Sabbath in America*America?

Depend upon it, it willcome. '-Gauleiter KochHitler came to power in Germany on a day sacred to the pagan calendar, and woulddie by his own hand on another sacred day. As there are only eight days of majorpagan importance—called Sabbaths in modern parlance—the odds against this mustbe pretty high.For those interested in such coincidences—perhaps what Swiss psychologist (andsometime Nazi admirer) Carl Jung would have called svnchronicity\"—I submit thefollowing in addition to the November 9 coincidences mentioned in Chapter Four:April 30, 1919. The seven Thulists are murdered by the Red Army in Munich.April 30, 1945. Adolf Hitler commits suicide in Berlin as the Red Army advanceson the city.Also:April 30, 1975. Saigon falls to the North Vietnamese Communists.Thus April 30 had grim associations for not only was it the famous Witches'Sabbath of German folklore but the day on which the seven Thulists—theUr-Nazis—were murdered by the Reds. While it provided the spark that ignited thepopular revolt against the Bavarian Soviet, it also served to oust BaronSebottendorff from the Thule Society and thus to rob the cult of its mostcharismatic and powerful leader. If we were to take only the above three datesas a guide, we might be forgiven for thinking that April 30—the Witches'Sabbath—is an auspicious day for Communism as well, and that their celebrationof May Day is perhaps but another indication that, on some level, they realizethis. But what about the Witches' Sabbath that Gauleiter Koch speaks about inthe quotation above? Is America— North and South America—ripe for conflagration?"},{"pageContent":"We have focused on the Nazi Party as a cult, and the Third Reich as a governmentof dark initiates.

This wassomething that was noticed by many of his associates, and remarked upon in theirmemoirs. 2 Stalingrad seemed to rob the Occult Messiah of his strength, and hebegan to withdraw more and more from his inner circle of friends andacquaintances. He grew even more short-tempered than usual, and started to makeserious strategical mistakes. Ignoring the advice of his generals, he demandedvictory after victory, refusing to retreat or to listen to appeals to negotiatewith the Allies. The idea of negotiation, to Hitler, was tantamount to treason.Offenders would be sent to the camps.Then, of course, came the D-Day invasion of June 1944 and suddenly Europe wasswarming with well-armed and well-fed British and American forces. A monthlater, and a cabal of patriotic but terrified German officers and civiliansplanned and carried out the assassination attempt on Hitler by placing a bomb ina briefcase beneath a conference table where Hitler was discussing militarystrategy with his staff. The bomb went off, but the Fuhrer (once again)miraculously survived.As in the Rohm purge ten years earlier, Hitler demanded the death of thetraitors who had conspired against not only himself but Germany. Guilty andinnocent alike were either executed or offered suicide as a way out. Theunfortunate victims of \"Operation Thunderstorm\" included Professor KarlHaushofer and his eldest son, Al-brecht. As we saw previously, ProfessorHaushofer was sent to Dachau, where he survived the war. Albrecht was imprisonedin Berlin and later taken out—ostensibly to be moved to a safer location asRussian shells were falling on the city—and shot against a wall on a sidestreet. Albrecht's connections with the Resistance movement had become known;what is not known is the extent to which the Gestapo ever discovered hisputative involvement in the disastrous Hess affair.The search for traitors and would-be assassins involved in the July plotcontinued right up to the last days of the war: to April 1945.Himmler's final days are ably recorded by his favorite astrologer, WilhelmWulff, in Zodiac and Swastika, and in the memoir of theman who hired Wulff, Foreign Intelligence chief Walter Schellenberg, as well asin Felix Kersten's memoirs. What is remarkable about all of these is the picturethey give us of the terrified head of the most dreaded police force and secretsociety in modern history—second, perhaps, only to the Office of the HolyInquisition itself—asking Wulff for astrological updates on the political andmilitary situation as the war was rapidly coming to an end. Kersten andSchellenberg were trying to get Himmler to commit to a deal with the Alliesthrough the mediation of the Swedish government and the World Jewish Congress,but Himmler's constant indecision from day to day and hour to hour made itimpossible to reach any kind of settlement. Himmler would keep referring to theoath of loyalty he took to the Fiihrer as being sacred; this enabled him to feelhe had a moral reason for what was really moral cowardice. Himmler wascontinually being advised to have Hitler either arrested or shot, and to takeover the country and negotiate with the Allies; but his fear that the plan mightpossibly fail (after all, Hitler had already survived several assassinationattempts) made him choose to do nothing and bear those ills he had, rather thanfly to others he knew not of. Further, Wulff had advised Himmler that Hitlerwould not die from an assassination, although his aspects for the end of Aprillooked particularly bleak. A prognostication like that only seemed to confirmHimmler's worst fears.In the final days of the conflict, Wulff was by Himmler's side day and night,ready at a moment's notice to cast a chart . . . even going so far as toaccurately predict Allied air raids; a talent the Nazi High Command might havemade better use of much earlier in the war.Wulff was summoned to Himmler's quarters at Harzwalde on the day Germany learnedof the death of U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt—Friday, April 13, 1945—andtold to bring all his charts with him, including those of Martin Bormann, AlbertSpeer, Seyss-[nquardt, Count Schwerin von Krosigk and Field Marshal Schorner tosec who among them might be appropriate for the formation of a new Germangovernment. He also brought the charts oi Churchill, Eisenhower, and Montgomeryto determine the outcome of peace ne gotiations with them through ('omitBernadotte oi Sweden. To under st.iiul how desperate I limmler was for this typeol astrological advice, it must be remembered that transportation andcommunication setvices were .ill hut nonexistent .it thai Lite date in the w.ir. Wulff w.is.u Ins home m Hamburg, and the fact th.it .i phone c.ill got throughto him at all is amazing in itself. Hamburg was being heavily bombed at thetime, and the phone and electrical lines were severely damaged.WulH was then expected to negotiate his way—with the car and driver reserved forhim by Himmler—along the shell craters, bombed-out vehicles, wounded soldiersand civilians, and the corpses of the less fortunate along the road, meanwhiledodging lethal strafing runs by Allied planes, just to be able to arrive atHimmler's hideout to (in effect) read him his daily horoscope.Alas for the Reichsfuhrer, he had waited too long. Events were running alongfaster than anyone had thought possible. Wulff spent Hitler's fifty-sixthbirthday at Harzwalde with Himmler, Schellenberg, Kersten, and a representativeof the World Jewish Congress, pondering the gloomy situation and trying tonegotiate—unsuccessfully—for the release of ten thousand more Jews.In the last days of April, Wulff finally managed to extricate himself from thedeadly scene at Harzwalde and made his way home to Hamburg. A few weeks later,and his most famous astrological client— Heinrich Himmler—would be dead by hisown hand after chewing a cyanide capsule while a prisoner of the Americanforces.Thousands of miles away, Rudolf von Sebottendorff—the man who started it all inrented rooms of the Four Seasons Hotel with a \"literary-cultural\" society, anoccult society known as the Thule Gesellschaft— ended his own life by drowninghimself in the Bosporus, grieving for the end of the Third Reich he had helpedto create in those heady days on the streets of Munich when the swastika bannerwas the symbol of all that was good and right in the world, the last bestdefense against the horrors of Communism and the Jewish-Bolshevik-Masonicconspiracy to rule the globe.But not all the Nazi cultists were dead by war's end, not by any means. Some ofthe most notorious would remain alive to stand trial at Nuremberg, while stillothers would go into hiding aided and abetted by one of their sworn enemies, theRoman Catholic Church.The Vatican RagThe mass destruction <>t files thai took place at the end of the war is oneindication of how aware the Nazis were of their culpability foracts that would be considered heinous by the rest of the world. Most of theLebensborn records were destroyed, for instance, rendering the tracing andidentification of babies born out of wedlock or stolen from their homes in theOccupied Territories virtually impossible. Thousands of people now alive todayin Germany and in the rest of Europe as well as in North and South America donot know who their parents—and particularly their fathers—were. Many are thedescendants of high-ranking officials of the SS who were encouraged to \"breed\"with the racially pure maidens of the Lebensborn communities.The records of many of the concentration camps were also destroyed as therelentless advance of Allied troops brought them closer and closer to themurderous estates. The results of medical experimentation on prisoners wereparticularly sensitive and haste was made to destroy both the documentaryevidence and, where possible, the physical evidence as bodies—and bodyparts—that had been experimented upon were burned in the crematoria.But another indication of Nazi guilt lies in the fact that many of the SS divedunderground immediately it became apparent that they had lost the war, and thatthe Allies were condemning the Schutzstaffel as a criminal organization; thiswas certainly a precedent in modern history, for the armies of the vanquishedare generally disarmed and the divisions dissolved, but rarely have all themembers of an entire military and police apparatus been declared criminals primafacie. This was not so of the regular German Army, the Wehrmacht, which wasimmune from such treatment. The horror and outrage of the Allies was reservedsolely for Himmler's secretly occult and openly pagan Black Order, and for thedoctors who helped carry out sadistic medical experimentation under the aegis ofthe Ahnenerbe-SS.This resulted in an underground movement of SS personnel across Europe and outto North and South America and North Africa. The Order functioned, even indefeat, as solidly as it had during the days of victory. Safe houses and secrettransportation were arranged for the SS, who were being hunted all over theworld. Some SS officers, confident that their identity was successfullyconcealed, remained behind in Germany to help organize this \"undergroundrailroad\" and are stillthere today, as numerous reports and published research have shown.The secrei and often lethal OI)l SSA was not merely a fantasy of fi< tioriwriter Frederick Forsythe; it existed then (in various forms, fromthe fiendishly effective Die Spiyine to Hans Ulrich Rudel's Kamaraden-werk) andstill does as I write these lines.What does seem fantastic, however, is the assistance given to many of these menby what was always believed to be their sworn enemy: the Roman Catholic Church.While Ladislas Farago—mentioned in the Introduction to this book—must becredited with bringing this story to worldwide attention,' it is useful to knowthat, since then, it has been corroborated many times over by other authors. 4Why would the Catholic Church help the very men who had vowed to eradicate it,who had participated in pagan rituals designed to replace those of Christianity,who worshipped Baldur and Thor and Freya in candlelit ceremonies in the forestsand castles of Bavaria, Thuringia, Westphalia, and the other German Lander? Menwho had caught and imprisoned thousands of Catholic and Protestant clergymen,sent them to the camps, and executed them in cold blood?Was it simply that the Church found common cause with Nazi anti-Semitism, andfigured it would help them now and deal with Nazi paganism at a later date? Orwas it more practical than that? Did the Church hope to negotiate a separatepeace with the Nazis so that they both could concentrate on \"the real enemy' :international Communism?There is certainly enough evidence to suggest that both of the above rationalesplayed parts in the Church's unofficial policy toward the SS. In the early daysof the Party, few German Christians of any denomination would have been upset bythe blatant anti-Semitism shown by Hitler, Streicher, Darre, Rosenberg, et al.Hitler very carefully sought to cultivate Christian (and especially Catholic)support for the Party as they remained a substantial voting bloc within thecountry. Indeed, the Catholic Center Party played a pivotal role in Reichstagelections that catapulted Hitler to power. And just as he wooed the financialsupport of leading industrialists in contradiction to his personal beliefsconcerning the evils of that \"Jewish invention,'' Capitalism, he also courtedthe powerful Catholic and other Christian lobbies in the country. He knew hecould not afford to alienate them entirely from his program, at least not untilafter he had won the war; for this reason he occasionally found it valuable toattack occultism and volkiscb paganism in his speeches, even while encouragingit among his entourage and condoning its manifestation in the SS.On its side, the Roman Catholic Church played a similar game of realpolitik withthe Nazi Party, while at the same time many Catholic priests performed heroicservice underground in rescuing Jewish and other potential victims from thecamps. But there were those Catholic officials who found themselves in secretagreement with much of the Nazi platform, particularly where the potentialthreat of Russian Communism was concerned. Pope Pius XII, for example, wasnotoriously silent regarding the fate of the Jews and was eager to avoid anyconfrontation with the Nazis. He jumped to praise the Fiihrer, however, when thelatter moved against the \"godless Communists\" in the East. Like many of hiscontemporaries, he figured the Allies were shooting in the wrong direction.It should be remembered that this was not an unusual position to take. Manyotherwise respectable Allied leaders felt quite similarly. Even General Pattonwas known to have growled on occasion that they had fought the wrong enemy, andlobbied for permission to take his famous spearhead right into the Soviet Union.5 It was this attitude that—directly or indirectly—permitted many war criminalswho had committed ghastly crimes against humanity to escape forever the longreach of the Nuremberg Tribunal and even, in some cases, to find themselvesworking in official capacities for the Allied intelligence services in theirCold War against the Soviet Union.While Patton may represent the peculiar stance of a United States Army four-stargeneral, it would be Bishop Alois Hudal who would carry the fascist flag for theVatican/'Born—probably in Austria—on May 31, 1885, he was ordained a Catholic priest in1908. The parallels between his career and that of Lanz von Liebenfels arestriking. In the first place, both were Austri-ans, born within eleven years ofeach other (von Liebenfels was born on July 19, 1874, in Vienna-Penzing). Bothentered the Catholic priesthood, with von Liebenfels entering the Cisterciannovitiate in July of 1893 and taking his solemn vows in September 1897, elevenyears before Alois \\ Indal.Hilda! became a professor of Old Testament and Oriental Ian gliages; vonLiebenfels, under the direction of the ami . Semitic novicemaster Nivard Schldgl, also studied precisely Old Testament and Onental languages and would later (in DOS) become such an acknowledged expert inthis field thai he was chosen to he one of the editorsof the Monumenta Judaica, a collection of early Hebrew and Aramaic sources forthe books of the Old Testament, along with a panel of Jewish and Protestantscholars. Von Liebenfels was selected as the Catholic editor because of hisunequaled knowledge of these ancient texts. The first five volumes of thisseries had appeared by 1908, so it is certain that Hudal would have been quiteaware of his Landsman, Lanz von Liebenfels.What is even more certain is that, as the years went by, Hudal would have becomean admirer of von Liebenfels's work in the Pan-German community for Fr. AloisHudal himself became something of an Armanist and fellow traveler. Just as vonLiebenfels became the head of his own order of knights, the Order of the NewTemplars, Hudal became Procurator General of the Order of German Knights, aCatholic institution.And, on May 1, 1933—in honor of the pagan holiday approved by the Nazis andknown as Walpurgis or Beltane to the Celts, celebrated with the famous Witches'Sabbath at midnight—Father (now Bishop) Hudal presided over a meeting in Romeattended by over seven hundred members of the German expatriate colony there,including many Church officials, Nazis, and Nazi leaders such as local SA andHitler Youth officials. On that occasion, he made a fiery speech defending theNazi Party and its program in a blend of Catholic and Teutonic slogans, endingwith the battle cry of Arminius (the hero of the Pan-Germans, volkisch cultists,and Aryan mystics) in the Teutoburg Forest: \"German unity is my strength, mystrength is German might.\" It was Arminius who was the inspiration for Guido vonList's Armanen-scbaft, the cult that List formed to worship Wotan and toinstigate a return to the old, pagan, ways of the ancient Teutons. For AloisHudal to invoke Arminius at this gathering in Rome was tantamount to aligninghimself with the neo-pagan, Pan-German, volkisch movement represented by list,Liebenfels, and Sebottendorff.This strange little man then went on to publish The Foundations of NationalSocialism in which he outlined and defended the Nazi Party programs, includingthe exclusion of the Jews, in no uncertain terms. Soon, his efforts in combatingMarxism—a legacy of his friendship with the future Pope Pius XII, EugenioPacelli, which dated from 1924—became widely known as the Aktion Hudal in Nazicircles. Like many anti-Communist and pro-Nazi Catholic leaders such asArchbishop Ivan Buchko of the Ukraine (who managed the incredible escape of theentire Ukrainian Waffen-SS division of eleven thousand men plus their familiesto North and South America and Australia), 7 Monsignor Krunoslov Draganovic (whohelped the Croatian Fascists escape justice, many to Argentina), 8 and layCatholic Gustav Celmins of the Nazi Latvian organization Perkonkrusts and leaderof the Latvian SS (who became an important member of the notoriouslyanti-Communist Intermarium Society 9 of the Roman Catholic Church which, inaddition to helping Nazi war criminals escape justice, also served as an arm ofGerman intelligence), Hudal was greatly admired in Nazi circles and every effortwas made to cooperate with his underground network of spies and collaboratorseven as official Nazi policy remained stridently anticlerical.Intermarium itself is interesting, not least because one of its goals was theestablishment of a new Holy Roman Empire of Eastern European nations encirclingthe atheistic Soviet Union. 10 Intermarium developed a close workingrelationship with Alfred Rosenberg, 11 who was not only the Nazis' chief paganideologue but also a Baltic native who was tremendously sympathetic toanti-Soviet causes of any kind. After the war, many Intermarium notables becameinvolved with the CIA and other Western intelligence services. On Intermarium'sagenda was the formation of an exile army of anti-Communists, many of whom wouldbe former Nazis, to defend Europe's borders against the Soviet Union andeventually to partition the USSR into small, separate ethnic enclaves a la theAlfred Rosenberg and Heinrich Himmler plans. 12 This involved dividing andconquering the Soviet state and thus eradicating the \"cancer\" of Communismforever while ensuring that the Russians could never again consolidate theirpower and threaten the world. Intermarium, like Hudal's Caritas Internationalis, was to provide escape routes and \"ratlines\" for fleeing Nazis for manyyears, supplying the necessary passports and travel documents as well assteamship fare to ports all over the world. One wonders how today's Roman (atholics would feel about their Sunday donations, Widow's Mites, Peter's Pence,and other charitable contributions being used CO help finance the survival ofHeinrich liimmler \\ Black Older.Some of the beneficiaries oi Hudal's operation—which was being nm by CardinalMontini (the future Pope Paul VI) in lus capacity .is Vatican Secretar) oi Stateinclude Heinrich Mullet, the Gestapo chief who once debriefed astrologer WilhelmWulfl, Walter RaufF,who was in charge of the mobile gas vans in which thousands of Jews weremurdered, and (alleges Farago and many other European officials) Hitler'ssecond-in-command, Martin Bormann himself Miiller disappeared at war's end andfollowed the ratline to Argentina along with Eichmann, Mengele, and so manyothers, comforted in exile with a suitcase full of American dollars. Rauffturned up in Chile. Bormann—according to Farago—did them all one better, andarrived in Buenos Aires dressed as a Catholic priest, a Jesuit.In what must be one of the most sickening scenes to any believing Catholic isthat of Bormann—as \"Father Augustin\"— celebrating Mass at the Cathedral of SanJuan de Dios in La Paz, Bolivia, where he escaped when Argentina became too hot.(Klaus Barbie would find a safe house with another Nazi \"priest\" living inBolivia, in this case a Croat war criminal—see Chapter Eleven.) He alsoperformed weddings, baptisms, and other sacraments while serving in the role of\"auxiliary priest.\" This, of course, is the ultimate blasphemy. The most-wantedwar criminal in the world, a devoted Nazi since the 1920s, special assistant topagan mystic Rudolf Hess and third in line for leadership of the Reich afterHitler and Goring, a man whose womanizing was excused by his wife because byfathering children out of wedlock he was only doing his sacred duty by theFatherland to produce as many Aryan citizens as possible . . . this man with theblood of millions on his hands, celebrating Mass and dispensing Holy Communionto the faithful in the fiercely Catholic country of Bolivia . . . what BlackMass could ever be Blacker?And they call Aleister Crowley a Satanist!We will return to the exiled Nazi leaders in the next chapter for they are thespringboard to today's problem of neo-Nazism, neo-Fascism, and racism around theworld. As recent discoveries have made clear, many hundreds (if not thousands)of Himmler's Black Order managed to escape capture and set up shop in SouthAmerica where they still wield tremendous influence.NurembergNot all the SS men managed to flee, however. Some of the worst names in Germanhistory were captured alive. Alfred Rosenberg, theBaltic-born architect and rabid anti-Semitic, anti-Christian ideologue fromHitler's early days in Munich with Dietrich Eckart was captured and made tostand trial. Rosenberg was sentenced to death, and alone of all the condemnedNazis nearly collapsed from fright on the way to his execution.Hermann Goring, defiant to the end, took his own life in his prison cell ratherthan permit his captors to do the honors.Hess—whose story has occupied so many of these pages for it highlights theextent to which occultism was employed on both sides of the conflict—was sparedexecution but was sentenced to life imprisonment at Spandau; real lifeimprisonment, for the Russian vote made it certain that he would never beparoled even after many attempts by British and American authorities to have himreleased on humanitarian grounds. The Soviets felt that Hess had gone to Britainto arrange a separate peace so that Germany could invade Russia with impunity.World Jewish leaders wanted Hess to stay in Spandau since he had been asignatory to the infamous Nuremberg Laws, laws which robbed Jews of their rightsas German citizens and as human beings, and which paved the way for theatrocities of the camps. They felt, and quite rightly, that life imprisonmentwas better than Hess deserved since his policies had helped exterminate manymillions of innocent human beings.When Hess died the New York Times ran a cover story on his life, 13 and tried toexplain why the British did not exploit the Nazi's flight to Scotland as well asthey might. To the British psychiatrists, Hess was a borderline madman. Asproof, they cited his interest in astrology, his paranoia, and his lapses ofmemory. (One wonders what they would have made of Ronald Reagan. Where wasBritish psychiatry when we needed it?)But an interesting sidelight to the Hess story concerns one of the Alliedinheritors of Nazi medicine, particularly in the area of mind control. 1 'I Ik- above news story notwithstanding, British psychiatrists had .il readyexamined I less and decided Ik- was sane enough to stand trial, hut theAmericans wanted to perform their own examination, lor this purpose, theScotland-born 1 )r. Ewen ( ameron was sent to (lerman) to interrogate 1 less anddraw up a psychological profile of the Reichs Deputy. Before In- was able to doso, he was approached by .AllenDulles, the man who was so successful running spies for the OSS (Americasprecursor to the CIA). Dulles asked Cameron to perform a small service for himduring the course of his examination.There was reason to believe—said Dulles—that the man in custody was not RudolfHess at all, but a double! He asked the astonished Dr. Cameron to find some wayof getting Hess to show Cameron a scar he should have received from an accidenthe had long before the war. If the scar was there, it was probable that theprisoner really was Hess. It it wasn't, then the man was an impostor and perhapsa plant by British Intelligence to disguise the fact that they had executed thereal Hess soon after his arrival in Scotland.Needless to say, Dr. Cameron agreed to Dulles's request and— during the courseof many hours of intense psychiatric examination— attempted to get the prisonerto remove his shirt for a routine physical. The guard, however, refused to allowHess to remove his handcuffs to enable the examination, saying that he had nosuch authorization. Cameron had to return to Dulles with the sad report that hewas not able to verify whether the man in the prison cell was the infamousmystic Rudolf Hess.Cameron's failure did nothing to cool Dulles's appreciation of his talents,however, for the psychiatrist soon became the architect of the CIA's notoriousMontreal-based mind-control project at the Mount Royal clinic in the late 1950sand early 1960s, a project whose goal was to discover a means of countering theeffects of Russian and Chinese brainwashing and to develop an American versionfor use as an offensive weapon. The experiments were nearly the equal ofanything the Nazis themselves had come up with under the aegis of theall-powerful Ahnenerbe-SS and were, indeed, based at least partly on the resultsof those concentration camp experiments, the records of which had beenconfiscated by American intelligence, becoming part of CIA and Pentagon filesshortly after the Nuremberg Tribunals. As CIA investigator John Marks pointsout, ls the records of Ahnenerbe-SS experimenters Dr. Kurt Plotner and WalterNeff regarding mescaline and hypnosis research at Dachau were sent back to theStates and never revealed. Thus, the files of Nazi brainwashing, interrogation,and mind-control experiments using drugs, hypnosis, and torture— techniquesassociated today with the worst of America's religious cults and secretsocieties -are still classified if indeed they survived at allthe famous shredding of MK/ULTRA documents ordered by Richard Helms in the1970s.In a related development, Hess's final statement before the Nuremberg Tribunalon August 31,1 946 was never finished. As it seemed he was in danger of ramblingon forever, the president of the Tribunal ordered him to cut it short andhistory was cheated out of a bizarre tale of mystical phenomena (or saved thedreary task of recording the paranoid fantasies of a mass murderer, depending onyour point of view). But there are elements within Hess's statement that bearrepeating here for they either cast doubt on the pronouncement of his sanity(and thus question his fitness to stand trial) or they are evidence that someform of mind-control was being tested on Hess while he remained a prisoner inthe Tower.Some of my comrades here can confirm the fact that at the beginning of theproceedings I predicted the following:. . . That witnesses would appear who, under oath, would make untrue statementswhile, at the same time, these witnesses could create an absolutely reliableimpression and enjoy the best possible reputation. . . . That some of thedefendants would act rather strangely: they would make shameless utterancesabout the Fiihrer; they would incriminate their own people; they would partiallyincriminate each other, and falsely at that. Perhaps they would even incriminatethemselves, and also wrongly. ... All of these predictions have come true. ... Imade these predictions, however, not only here at the beginning of the Trial,but had already made them months before the beginning of the Trial in Englandto, among others, Dr. Johnston, the physician who was with me . . , 16At this point, one would imagine that Hess was simply being realistic. It wasnot unusual for the Nazi defendants and witnesses to invent all sons of storiesand alibis to excuse away their crimes (Sievers is just one possible example);Hess may have tried to insinuate that the prosecution witnesses were all lying.The Nuremberg jurors were CC1 tainlv in no mood to entertain such a notion, andthat might havebeen the end ol it except thai I less went on to sa}:lii the years 1936 to 1938 political trials were taking place in one- ol thesecountries. I hese were c haracterized by the fat i thai the defendant!accused themselves in an astonishing way. For example, they cited great numbersof crimes which they had committed or which they claimed to have committed. Atthe end, when death sentences were passed upon them, they clapped in frenziedapproval to the astonishment of the world.But some foreign press correspondents reported that one had the impression thatthese defendants through some means hitherto unknown, had been put into anabnormal state of mind, as a result of which they acted as they did. rHere Hess is obviously referring to the infamous show trials which had takenplace in Stalinist Russia. It should be remembered that the Soviet Union formedone-fourth of the Nuremberg Tribunal, along with France, Great Britain, and theUnited States. Later on in his statement he specifically mentions the \"Moscowtrial.\" One imagines that this is a decidedly unwelcome tactic on the part ofthe defendant.Hess goes on to link the method used to mentally condition these Russiandefendants to the acts of otherwise sane Germans carrying out atrocities in thecamps. His implication is that mind-control was used in a massive way torobotize the German population. He wisely drops that rather pathetic line ofapproach, but then his statement takes on a strange angle all its own:I said before that a certain incident in England caused me to think of thereports of the earlier trials. The reason is that the people around me during myimprisonment acted towards me in a peculiar and incomprehensible way, in a waywhich led me to conclude that these people somehow were acting in an abnormalstate of mind. Some of them— these persons and people around me were changedfrom time to time. Some of the new ones who came to me in place of those who hadbeen changed had strange eyes. They were glassy and like eyes in dream. . . .Not only I alone noticed these strange eyes, but also the physician who attendedme at the time. Dr. Johnston, a British Army doctor, a Scotsman.In the spring of 1 942 I had a visitor who quite obviously tried to provoke meand acted towards me in a strange way. This visitor also had these strange eyes.Afterwards, Dr. Johnston asked me what I thought of this visitor. Me told me—Itold him I had the impression that for some reason or other he was notcompletely normal mentally, whereupon Dr. Johnston did not protest as I hadexpected, but agreed with me andasked me whether I had not noticed those strange eyes, these eyes with a dreamylook. Dr. Johnston did not suspect that he himself had exactly the same eyeswhen he came to me.The essential point, however, is that in one of the reports of the time, whichmust still be in the press files on the proceedings—this was in Paris, about theMoscow trial—it said that the defendants had had strange eyes. They had hadglazed and dreamy eyes! 18This Kafkaesque monologue goes on to cover British concentration camps (implyingthat the Nazi camps were no worse, and that concentration camps in general mustbe an internationally recognized means of solving what Hess calls\"incomprehensible riddles\"), and then winds up with a speech in which Hess isclearly leading up to an exposition of just what exactly happened to him in thespring of 1942, prefaced by oaths to God that he will tell the truth and callingGod as his witness.\"In the spring of 1942\" he begins, then is cut short. The president of theTribunal tells him he has already used up his twenty minutes. Hess demurs, thenagrees to end his statement by simply saying, \"I am happy to know that I havedone my duty to my people, my duty as a German, as a National Socialist, as aloyal follower of my Fiihrer. I do not regret anything. If I were to begin allover again, I would act just as I have acted, even if I knew that in the end Ishould meet a fiery death at the stake . . ,\" 19 A fiery death at the stake.Hess imagining himself as heretic, or witch?Was Hess insane? What had happened to him while he remained a prisoner of GreatBritain? Why was his flight to Scotland not exploited in a more obvious manner?What was the relationship between the mysterious, Scottish-born Dr. Johnston andthe Scottish-born Dr. Gameron, the mind-control expert? The author feels certainthat, owing to the Official Secrets Act, we shall never know the whole storyabout the Nazi's most famous mystic, Rudolf 1 less.As for Hess himself, who practiced yoga conscientiously while imprisoned inSpandau, he never abandoned his occult beliefs and was said by his wile to be inconstant telepathic communication with her until the day he died.And what about Martin Bormann? Did he really die in Berlin in the final days ashas been reported? Or was Farago right? Did Martin Bormann escape to SouthAmerica?Ironically enough, as I write these lines in the early days of 1994, newevidence has come to light to suggest that the much-maligned Ladislas Farago mayhave been correct after all. Hundreds of files newly released by the Argentinegovernment of President Menem show that many more Nazis managed to flee to SouthAmerica than had ever been previously imagined, not even in the wildest dreamsof veteran Nazi hunters. 20 Included in these records—which consist of officialfiles of the Argentine police and intelligence services—are the faint traces ofel gran fugitivo. As the files reveal, the American Ambassador to Argentina hadcome into possession of intelligence that neatly confirmed Faragos claim thatBormann had managed to make his way into Italy through a series of safe housesand then shipped out to Buenos Aires. Due to a typographical error intranscription, the province to which Bormann had subsequently fled wasincorrectly identified and the Argentine officials—at that time, working for theadministration of pro-Nazi and pro-Fascist Juan Peron—shrugged their shouldersand replied that they could not help the American authorities as no such townexisted in that province!These newly released reports will, hopefully, help vindicate the late Mr.Farago's efforts to track down the most famous Nazi war criminal of all, andrehabilitate his most controversial work, Aftermath.The Interrogation of Wolfram SieversThe Ahnenerbe, for all its reputation for horror, is mentioned only rarely inthe forty-two-volume set of the published Nuremberg Trial transcripts. I heinterrogation of Wolfram Sievers covers less than fifty pages in total,1 andmost of the evidence at the time was in the form of his Ahnenerbe Tagebuch ordiary and which contained references to the camps and to the hideous experimentsthat took place under his stewardship. It is from his diary that we learn, forinstance, of former SS-Tibet Expedition member Dr. Bruno Beger's involvement inthe anthropological research 1 ' being undertaken at Auschwitz. We learnof the Ahnenerbe's medical experimentation involving cancer cures, coagulatingagents, and low- and high-pressure research using human guinea pigs, freezingresearch using prostitutes to \"thaw out\" frozen concentration camp prisoners,etc. In the coagulation experiments, for instance, living human beings were shotwith live ammunition to create wounds to which would be applied variousexperimental styptic formulas to see which could be used in the field as aninterim measure to stop bleeding until proper medical attention could beobtained.Before the Tribunal, Sievers did his best to extricate himself from the medicalexperimentation taking place at Dachau and Auschwitz under his jurisdiction, andeven went so far as to claim he was actually a member of the Resistance—callingon his old friend Dr. Friedrich Hielscher (who was imprisoned by the Gestapo forhis role in the July 20, 1944, assassination plot against Hitler) as acorroborating witness 22 —but the Nuremberg jurors weren't having any. Sieversadmitted to being present at some of the above-mentioned experiments, and otherwitnesses put him on the scene of many more. Sievers, who claimed to be littlemore than the business manager for the Ahnenerbe and a relay center for reports,\"one of these distinguished Nazi post offices\" in the words of one Nurembergattorney, 23 was eventually prosecuted himself during that series of trials (theDoctors' Trials) which took place after the celebrated Nuremberg Trials of Hess,Goring, et. al., at which he testified.Wolfram Sievers—Himmler's aide and chief of the Ahnenerbe— was given the deathsentence and executed in 1947.The records of the Ahnenerbe, however—some ninety microfilm rolls at theNational Archives alone—remain a treasure trove for the historian of thebizarre. It is an enlightening task to wade through the thousands of documentsdetailing research in astronomy, anthropology, ethnology, archaeology, Icelandiclore, Celtic studies, rune symbolism, Tibetan religion, the World Ice Theory,and Norse paganism and to realize that this massive undertaking by hundreds <>luniversity professors and serious academics was pointed directly ai worldconquest and genocide. These Nazi academies and \"mythologians\"- the [oseptl (ampbells and Mircea Eliades of their country in some cases— were as at home mthe foul ahhatoirs of the death camps as they Wm the lecture halls of the great German universities. To them, Auschwit/ .md Dachau were simply other forms of laboratory aiul school279room; higher education in the lower depths ... a continuation of scholarship byother means.Many of these men escaped justice. The former Catholics and Protestants who hadbecome converts to Nazi paganism—and there is truly no fanatic like aconvert—made their way to freedom and, as numerous interviews by a wide range ofjournalists has shown, they remained (and remain) unrepentant: true believers inthe Cult of the Black Order, Himmler's Schwarze Orden. And, as they grow old anddie, they leave behind a new generation of believers who carry on the rites of anew faith—sometimes in secret, sometimes openly—in their adopted lands.# 11 #AftermathThis year, think twice about Germany.— Lufthansa Airlines Advertising slogan, circa 1970With the dispersal of Nazi war criminals throughout the world—aided and abettedby elements within the Catholic Church and the Central Intelligence Agency—thecult of the Nazi Party was preserved. It would have been in any case, for— likeSatanism, the cult with which it is popularly associated—its symbols andrhetoric have survived in the documentary films, newsreels, histories, novels,and in popular movies and television shows.The Nazi underground has been glamorized to a large extent, particularly byHollywood. Such films as 77?^ Boys from Brazil and The Odessa File —both basedon best-selling novels—help perpetuate theidea of a secret society of evil geniuses bent on world domination through madscience and single-minded politics; in other words, a typical cult (if a bitmore successful and affluent than most). The N.i/iimage is .i coherent one, much more comprehensible and identifiablethan thai of the armies and nations that opposed it dining the war. It had asingle Symbol, die Swastika, ami a single leader. Hitler. It hadan elite priesthood of murder and ritual, the elegantly black-clad SS with itssilver death's head emblem. Nazi fashion and regalia have even survived today inthe erotic fantasies of many sadomasochists and other fetishists, and it sharesthis peculiarity in common with satanism and \"black magic.\"By comparison, American propaganda films made during the war show a casual,wise-cracking, gum-chewing, sloppy, unshaven, and generally disheveled GI as theepitome of Allied resistance to the Nazi threat. That was supposed to makeAmericans feel better. The enemy was impeccably dressed, spoke fluent Englishwith an exotic accent (our boys knew about four words in German, two of thembeing \"mach schneir), never had a hair out of place, and had Continental mannerseven when torturing spies. And, of course, scenes of the concentration camps andthe mass murder of Jews virtually never appear in these films as it took yearsbefore the Allies would officially admit that the death factories even existed.The anti-intellectual, deliberately unsophisticated pose of the typical AmericanGI—as depicted by Hollywood—was supposed to be somehow equivalent to moralsuperiority: a troubling perspective that exists to this day in ourentertainment media and even among our politicians and religious leaders.Brilliant students are portrayed in television sit-coms as hopeless, sociallymaladjusted \"nerds\" in vain competition with the handsome but brain-dead jockswho have become teen idols. Former vice president and convicted felon SpiroAgnew was famous for his attacks on what he called \"pseudo-intellectuals,\" and aglance at former President George Bush's bedside reading would make a highschool English teacher blush. Nixon himself, besieged on all sides by protestingcollege kids, had an abhorrence of the intelligentsia as revealed in his famousWatergate tapes. As the author once had occasion to remark to some survivors ofChina's Cultural Revolution in Beijing, intellectuals arc treated as the enemyin every country: in China as Capitalists, in America as Communists. Theyagreed.Somewhere along the line, somewhere between Joe Goebbcls and Joe McCarthy,Americans began believing—and embracing— their own propaganda.And those Americans for whom intellectual and cultural sophistication heldcertain attractions that could not be matched by Iowa corn-country square dancesor homespun Bible Belt homilies found them-selves having more in common with the Hollywood image of the typical SS officerthan with the type of American GI portrayed by, say, Frank Sinatra, John Wayne,or Henry Fonda. As a certain, subtextual cultural identification with the SSbegan to take place among our basically intelligent but incompetently educatedAmerican youth it would not be long before political identification would occur. . . with unfortunate consequences.As they filtered into South America, the escaping Nazi refugees brought withthem their brotherhood, their talent for organization, and all their oldloyalties. They had also become a criminal organization, one that was—at leaston paper—being hunted down by the nations of the world. Branded as internationalcriminals, it was no great moral leap from the name to the game. They becameinvolved in the drug trade, arms dealing, and international terrorism. Theunholy alliance between Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie and fascist Italianterrorist Stefano delle Chiaie in Bolivia is just one example among many.Unlike other \"patriotic\" organizations that, forced underground, became criminalsocieties—the Sicilian Mafia and the Chinese Tongs come readily to mind—theNazis did not abandon their core beliefs. They retained their religion ofanti-Semitism and Teutonic superiority, and the rest of the world continued toidentify Nazis this way. In Argentina, they began to reissue their primarytracts. Everything from Mein Kampfto the Protocols of the Elders of Zion wasrepublished in Spanish-language versions for the edification of the masses.Moreover, such men as Wilfried von Owen—a senior aide to Propaganda MinisterJoseph Goebbels—would retire peacefully to Buenos Aires to write neo-Nazi tractsfor publication in Europe. 1 The Nazis came to realize that not all SouthAmericans were \"subhumans\"; many were the children of German, Swiss, and Italianimmigrants who had come to South America over a hunched vears ago during variousmigrations, just as they had to the United States. Although they were now theSpanish-speaking eiti/ens ol Colombia, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile,Uruguay, and Paraguay (lor instance), their blood was still \"raciallypure.'South America had been a magnet lor Na/i personalities e\\en lulore the I Rohm,the SA commander who was murderedin the famous purge of 1934, spent several years training troops in Boliviaafter the Beer Hall Putsch. Max Sollmann, one of the youngest participants inthe Putsch and the future Lebensborn leader, lived for many years in Colombiaafter l c )23, returning to Germany only in 1934. 2 Richard Walther Darre, thepagan high priest of the Third Reich, was born in Argentina. And, of course,Baron Sebottendorff himself traveled throughout Latin America in his incarnationas a Mexican consul.For those who find this odd it should be recognized that in Latin Americagenerally, and in Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile in particular, there is anelement of the population that still considers itself \"European\" as distinctfrom the local \"Indian\" peoples. Europe is worshiped from afar as the naturalhomeland of these second-, third-, and fourth-generation Italians, Germans, andothers. European fashion, literature, music, and cuisine are preserved—as if ina time capsule—in major cities like Buenos Aires in Argentina; in Bolivia, theGerman population forms the cultural and economic elite of La Paz; and in Chilethere is an entire region of the country—centered in Valdivia—where the localnewspaper and even the street signs are in German; and where, during the war,the Nazi Party was firmly entrenched.This was the environment in which the fleeing Nazis suddenly found themselves.It was congenial, familiar, and in many cases all too anxious to accommodate menthe rest of the world considered monsters but who were greeted as if they were aEuropean government-in-exile. All this, coupled with the fact that many Naziswere cooperating with the American intelligence services and had the protectionof the Church, ensured that even the local national governments would go out oftheir way to see to it that they were not inconvenienced by extraditionrequests, arrest warrants, and the other annoying demands of international law.Also, many Nazis came with their own funds: enormous sums of money that had beenembezzled from the Party treasury or stolen from their Jewish victims.But South America was not the only place Nazis found refuge. Nazis— particularlyNazi scientists —were welcomed in certain Arab Countries in North Africa and theMiddle List (Otto Skorzeny's assistance to the Nasser regime in Egypt is wellknown, for instance) and, ot course, we had our own Nazi elite serving in theAmerican space program including, but not limited to. Dr. V/ernhcr von Braun.ManyNazis, including former SS officers, worked for American intelligence servicesin Europe after the war. And future President Richard Nixon himself assisted inthe protection of known Nazis both in his home state of California and as vicepresident under Eisenhower. 3And in Switzerland, perhaps one of the more outlandish Nazi survivals yet:admirers of Ostara publisher and Hitler mentor, Lanz von Liebenfels, whosurvived the war he midwifed and who died on April 22, 1954.The Abbey ofThelemaBefore we follow the ratlines of the Nazi Cult to North and South America, aglance at its European survivals will do us well. As I write these lines [1994],a neo-Fascist has just won a tremendous victory in the first-ever democraticelection on Russian soil. Vladimir W. Zhirinovsky—whose ultra-nationalistLiberal Democratic Party won heavily—has already met with right-wing politicalleaders (including a former SS officer) during a tour of Germany and Austria. Hehas even gone so far as to recommend that Bulgaria should annex Macedonia(shades of Anschluss!), a now-sovereign nation that was once part of Yugoslavia.4There are those who play down Zhirinovsky's potential for harm by citing hiselectoral victory as nothing more than a protest vote by the newly democratizedRussian people who are fed up with a variety of other political leaders,including current President Boris Yeltsin. But then, they said similar thingsabout Hitler.An entire book could be written about Russian occultism and its effect on thepolitical life of Europe, from Blavatsky to Yuliana Glinka and Sergey Nilus toRasputin, and to the most recent emergence of a millennial cult in the Ukrainethat predicted the world would end in November, 1993. But it might be better atthe present time to keep our eyes on the more blatant of the Nazi survivals, andwhat better place to begin Our Study than with a modern -day Abbey oi 1 helemain the German-speaking district oi Appenzeil, Switzerland.The Swiss () i () is noteworthy for several things. In the firsi place, they areprobably the best organized and most profitably run Thdemic (i.e., Crowleyan) enterprise on earth. From all accounts, including but notlimited to Mr. King's, s they perform the most perfect of all Gnostic Masses (anoccult version of the Catholic Mass) to be found. Although, as someone who haswitnessed many a Gnostic Mass in the States, the author must offer the provisothat virtually anything would be an improvement. Further, they run a guesthouse,a printing press, and operate their own apothecary specializing in \"Paracelsian\"remedies: an industry for which the Nazis would have given them high marksindeed.What calls our attention to the Swiss OTO, however, is an item recorded byFrancis King in his Satan and Swastika^ in which he mentioned that—in the firstissue of its newsletter E.O.L. Mitteilungs-blatt, dated June 9, 1954—the Abbeypublished a Memorial notice for Lanz von Liebenfels, calling him a \"shiningexample of unswerving faith and the very highest virtue\"! 7 That the best-runexample of a Thelemic community should have openly praised one of the spiritualfathers of the Third Reich is a phenomenon that is troubling, to say the least.That they are serious Thelemites and devotees of Aleister Crowley cannot bedenied. How, then, do they manage to reconcile these two conflictingphilosophies?This is a problem that vexes the student of modern occultism, because admirationof Crowley and his philosophy has emerged in organized Satanism, neo-Nazipolitical parties, racist hooliganism, alienated teenagers, and jadedrock-and-rollers alike. Crowley once wrote—in an attack on Arthur Edward Waite,a former colleague in the Golden Dawn and the author of many books onoccultism—\"Magick is a mirror, wherein who sees muck is muck.\" 8 One couldperhaps also say, \"Crowley is a mirror in which one who sees a Nazi, is a Nazi.\"As Crowley was certainly an anti-establishment sort of fellow, and as Nazism isabout as anti-establishment as you can get in most countries, it would followthat Nazis might find a kindred soul in Aleister Crowley. Yet, one would thinkthat the OTO of Switzerland—an organization that is arguably the oldestcontinuous Thelemic Lodge in the world—would know better.The implications arc distressing.We may remember that the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO)—the (ierman occult Order towhich Crowley belonged and of which he became its somewhat disputed OHO (OuterHead of the Order)—had splintered into various factions around 1925. One group went with Crowley.Another remained independent of Crowley and his religion of Thelema. Stillanother became the Brotherhood of Saturn, an organization that survived the warand also exists to this day.Recourse to a useful flowchart provided on electronic bulletin boards bysomething calling itself the \"Boleskine Chapter of the Thelema Grand Lodge OTO\"9 indicates that the Swiss OTO has direct lineage to both Karl Germer andTheodor Reuss via Frater Paragranus (Josephus Metzger) declaring the latter tobe OHO although whom it recognizes as OHO at this time is not clear. What isclear is that this Swiss lodge was once the private domain of Theodor Reusshimself, presumably when he went to Ascona in the waning years of his life andfounded the same \"Mysteria Maxima Veritas\" Lodge. The Lodge continued under theleadership of Karl Germer as OHO even after Germer left for the United States,but after Germer's death it seems to dangle off the edge of the flowchart as theOrder itself went through several sea changes with Kenneth Grant's Nu-Isis Lodgein England, Grady McMurtry's operation in the States, and various otheroffshoots such as Brazilian Marcelo Ramos Motta's version of the Order, whichwas successfully sued by the McMurtry gang in a United States court. 10 Germerhad died without leaving a Templar heir, and the resulting fracas has servedonly to splinter this already heartily splintered organization still further.In conversations with the author, Grady McMurtry—several years before his deathin 1985—related that in 1941, before Jack Parsons totally lost control of hislife, he initiated McMurtry—then an army lieutenant—into the OTO. McMurtry laterserved in the European Theater in some capacity and made Crowley's personalacquaintance in London at about the time Crowley was strategizing with the likesof Fleming, Wheatley, and Knight. Crowley elevated McMurtry to the IX° in theOTO hierarchical scheme—-the highest rank attainable save by those ruling asOHOs—and McMurtry then returned to the United States after the war, still underGermer's leadership there. Once Germer died, however, several individualscalling themselves OHO began running their own OTO organizations. As recently asthe 1980s, (Ik- American outfit now legally recognized as the OTO inthe States claimed adherence to a set ol vile regulations published inwhat is known .is the Blue Equinox, i.e., Crowley's hardbound periodical that was usually published in white covers and which was, only once, boundin blue covers; hence its informal title. These archaic strictures are a legacyof Crowley's early German period, mixed with elements of a monarchical Victorianhangover, which have become incomprehensibly precious to those otherwiseantiestablishment hippie types who constitute the leadership of the Order. ThatCrowley later repudiated the \"Blue laws\" and adopted the stridently libertarianviews of the more succinct Liber OZ) x —which was published in London andCalifornia in 1939 as the world was being plunged into the Second WorldWar—seems clear to this author, who finds himself in general agreement with whathas been written on the subject of Kenneth Grant, 12 who more than anyone seemsbest qualified to serve as OHO of the Order . . . the cosmic wisdom of theAmerican legal system notwithstanding.It was McMurtry and his adherents, however, who—on the basis of some rather thinevidence and the loose interpretation of some Crowley correspondence—managed toconvince a US District Court judge that his claim to rulership of the OTO wasgenuine. Thelema never had that much luck with worldly courts, and there is noreason to suppose that this case was an exception. McMurtry continued to workfor the US government in various capacities before retiring to run the OTO in1969 after the disastrous theft of vital documents and irreplaceable books fromGermer's widow, Sascha (who was also beaten up in the process), in 1967. Itseems that the perpetrator of this crime was believed to be yet anotherorganization calling itself OTO, this time the \"Solar Lodge of the OTO,\"implicated in the Charles Manson case which exploded with the Tate/La Biancamurders in August of 1969. As the above chronology makes clear, McMurtryremained so out of touch with the OTO that it would be two years before helearned of the attack on Sascha Germer and the theft of the OTO \"family jewels.\"One cannot help but form scenarios in one's mind with such an embarrassment ofparanoid riches at one's disposal. We have shown how (Crowley was involved tosome extent with the spymasters of MI5, including those famous personalitiesDennis Wheatley, Ian Fleming, and Maxwell Knight, during World War II andparticularly during the Hess affair. McMurtry, an Army officer, was initiated byParsons at Cal- lech in 1941 before going overseas to obtain greater initiationsfrom Crowley himself during the war. McMurtry, who mustered out of the army withthe rank of captain, went on to work as an analyst for the government whilesimultaneously teaching a course in poli sci at George Washington University inWashington, DC in the sixties. The scenario that presents itself is intriguing.One wonders if—as the US federal government has been known to do with many othersuspect organizations, including the Ku Klux Klan and the Black Panthers—theyhad not infiltrated an agent into the American OTO who eventually became one ofits leaders? After all, L. Ron Hubbard himself once claimed to have infiltratedthe OTO for either LAPD, Naval Intelligence, or the FBI, depending on thesource. 13 Was McMurtry on a similar mission, this time for the army or for somesecret, frantic faction thereof? After all, Hess had flown to Scotland in1941—the same year McMurtry joined Parsons's Agape Lodge in California. McMurtrythen shipped out for Great Britain, where he met Crowley who was beingconsidered at that time for a role in the debriefing of Hess. Did the fledglingAmerican intelligence services want to know what the rather more professionalBritish services were up to with Hess and Crowley? Was McMurtry then\"reactivated\" at the time of the Manson killings to investigate the possibleinvolvement of the group calling itself the \"Solar Lodge of the OTO\"?Alas, there is absolutely no evidence at all to support what has been imaginedin the preceding paragraph. None whatsoever. Not a shred.And, as there has been much litigation over the history, reputations, andlegitimacy of the various OTO lodges, the author must demur at this point andinstead refer interested readers to such sources as the first edition of EdSanders's The Family 14 for more detail on the so-called Solar Lodge of the OTOand other ancillary information. Chapter Ten in that edition is the relevantmaterial; it has been deleted entire from later editions, including the recentlyreleased paperback update that boasts a photo of Charlie Manson on the cover . .. replete with swastika tattoo. The litigious McMurtry gang at work? Also,please note that Chapter Five of the original is also missing. That was thematerial on the Process Church of the Final Judgment, a Scientology oHshootih.it was implicated in various crimes ol a heinous nature in the hue sixtiesand whose nefarious reputation has been resurrectedby investigative journalist Maury Terry in The Ultimate Evil a studyof the links thai may exist between the Son of Sam cult and the Manson Family via the Process Church. It should be remembered that the Process isin the line of descent—should we say, apostolic succession?—from Jack Parsonsand hence of the OTO. (The wife of the founder of the Process even claims to bea reincarnation of Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels!) ls If any of the rumors,half-truths, and innuendo concerning the Process are ever proven, then it may bethat Parsons actually succeeded in incarnating his Antichrist in California.To Live and Die in LAWe must at once employ investigators in England to follow and check the reportsof trials and police announcements concerning missing children, so that we caninclude short announcements in our broadcasts, that a child has disappeared insuch-and-such a place, and that this is probably the result of a Jewish ritualmurder . . , 16— Heinrich HimmlerDuring the height of the Satanic Cult Survivor hysteria in the late eighties andearly nineties, an otherwise respectable doctor and professor—a published authoron psychotherapeutic technique and on the uses of hypnotism in psychotherapy—D.Corydon Hammond was quoted in a two-part series of articles on the phenomenon(published in the New Yorker) x ~ as saying that he believed the prevalence ofsatanic cults in America today was due to the influence of Nazis who had becomeinitiated into satanism and black magic by a mysterious rabbi during the war.These Nazis then emigrated to the United States where they set up shop andorganized the underground satanic movement that has been accused of thekidnapping and murder of children and young adults.While this may seem like another case of the blood libel in fin de siecleAmerica instead of fin de siecle Europe or Russia, we should pause for a momentto digest what is being stated and who is stating it:1. Mysterious rabbi initiates Nazis into black magic and satanism. (Thiscomplies with most anti-Semitic literature of the pastthousand years or so, except for the Nazi part, which is a new twist. During theMiddle Ages Jews were believed to be sorcerers and demonolators and mostgrimoires of the period contain Hebrew prayers and writing as part of theirrituals.)2. These Nazis then disappear into the fabric of American life after the war,presumably along the same ratlines that served so many other war criminals.3. They form underground cells of satanic composition.4. They begin to prey on unsuspecting Christian children, abusing them sexuallyand murdering them in horrible, unspeakable ways. (The blood libel, in all itspristine ugliness.)5. They even breed children for use as human sacrifices in their rituals. A nicetwist on the Lebensborn concept and one even the Nazis didn't think of.6. This theory is put forth by a respected psychotherapist who teaches at theUtah School of Medicine.The \"blood libel\" was a technique used to instigate pogroms against the Jews inEurope, in modern times used effectively in pre-Revolu-tionary Russia and, ofcourse, by Julius Streicher in the pages of his anti-Semitic rag Der Sturmer.Simply stated, the blood libel accused the Jews of murdering Christian childrenin horrible ways as human sacrifices during secret ceremonies in the temples.Whether the children had, in reality, been murdered by anyone even vaguelyJewish was not important. Whether the children had been murdered at all wasirrelevant. Whether there were any missing children or not was not the issue.The blood libel—or the ritual murder charge, as it was also known^was aninvention of yellow journalists who, working for the government or for someright-wing faction, published these unfounded, inflammatory stories in adeliberate attempt to instigate pogroms against the local Jewish population. Theattempts usuallyworked. Thousands ol Jews were murdered by angry mobs ni.iiiv timesover many years before the I lolocaust began by using this technique. In thepresent-day version of the blood libel, however, we seem to lack a readilyidentifiable social or ethnic group .is a convenient target. Satanists are lewand far between and relatively invisible. So, comparativelv Speaking, are \\.i/is. What, then, is the value of the blood libel ifthere .ire no sot i.il oiik .ists to ilestn iWell, perhaps there are.One of the worlds most famous—positively archetypal—social outcasts is theaforementioned Charles Manson. Manson has perhaps concretized evil for an entiregeneration. Accused, tried, and convicted of ordering the Tate/La Bianca murdersof 1969, Manson remains in prison at the time of this writing, consistentlydenied parole year after \\ car as he serves a life sentence for the murders.Although much about Manson remains a mystery, there is enough evidence to showthat he borrowed at least some of his act from Scientologists during one of hisprevious prison terms, and even wrote an article for the official Processmagazine. Manson told his followers that he wanted to instigate a race warbetween blacks and whites in America, believing that he and his Family wouldsurvive the holocaust by hiding out in the desert. After the smoke cleared andthe blood dried, they would then come roaring out of the desert to take chargeof what was left of the planet Earth. Noting Manson's anti-Semitism and hishatred of blacks, it's easy to see how he figured the race war would end.Mason has claimed to be both Jesus Christ and the Devil, a claim that seemsludicrous at first glance but is easy to understand once one knows that theProcess believed that Jesus, Satan, and Lucifer were equal members of a triunepower of the universe. This quasi-Gnostic belief is nothing new—it is, afterall, warmed-over Manichaeism—but in modern dress it can seem scandalous andfantastic.As he spent more and more time in prison after the Tate killings, he becameinfected with Nazi ideology, probably via the Aryan Brotherhood, which serves asa violent, all-white \"gang\" both within the prison system and without. As iswell known, he eventually carved a swastika into his forehead, and formed arelationship with James N. Mason of the Universal Order, 18 an offshoot of theAmerican Nazi Party of George Lincoln Rockwell. Mason eventually realized thatManson was the latest incarnation of Adolf Hitler, and began to devote all histime to promoting Charlie's philosophy among his neo-Nazi brethren.It is no exaggeration to say thai the Manson killings stupefied theentire nation. A lovely, pregnant, blond actress who starred in B-mov-ies billwho had never harmed anyone was hideously mutilated and slain in her own home bya band of men and women who also slashedand killed her houseguests. Ironically, although all the perpetrators were whiteGentiles—\"racially, they are all tops\" according to Mason— the image of theshort, long-haired, bearded Manson ordering the death and mutilation of SharonTate could have come from the pages of Der Stiirmer or Ostara as an example of asubhuman species violating the pure Aryan Woman. Manson as agent provocateur?Indeed, his idea was to frame the blacks for the murders. Thus, the blood libelat work.But link Manson with Nazis and the Process, and you have a perfect formula for adifferent sort of blood libel. In middle-America's confused understanding ofworld history and current events, what image could be more potent than a CharlesManson/Nazi/Satanist conspiracy to destroy American youth? Add that little extrafillip of anti-Semitism in Dr. Hammond's analysis (that the Satanic Nazislearned their occultism from a rabbi) and you have it all. Mysterious Men InBlack with vast occult powers, rampaging sexual urges, and demonic bloodlustcorrupting and murdering America's children with reckless abandon. Who can betrusted? Obviously, only mainstream fundamentalist religious groups; onlypatriotic, right-wing political groups. The more conservative, the better. Theseindividuals have no fear of the man waving a large cross and shouting the nameof Jesus, of God and Country. They fear . . . the Others.Streams of Satanic Abuse Survivors have gone running to therapists with newlyretrieved \"memories\" of these ritual murders, contributing to a growing nationalhysteria (at least on the talk shows). While none of these \"victims\" remembersthe names or addresses of the actual persons involved in the killings and theabuse, or can in any other way identify the perpetrators, the horror these\"victims\" feel is still palpable. They want justice. They want to punishsomeone. But in these politically correct times, at whom can one point a finger?Certainly not at the Jews. Nor at any other ethnic or religious group (unlessone considers these mysterious satanists members oi a religious group; they arenot to be confused with members of Anton I.aVev's Church of Satan). Alas, onemust he content to he a victim without an identifiable—and hence punishablevictimi/.ei . The whole point about thesealleged ntank organizations is that they an- well organized, highlysecretive perform their rituals in remote settings, and breed their ownchildren for sacrifice so that there- .tie no birth records and certainlyno death records, either. In other words, they commit the perfect crimes, and ifit wasn't for this suddenly vast array of \"survivors,\" we would never even knowthe cult existed.Unfortunately, all the hype concerning Satanic Cult Survivor Syndrome hasobscured the fact that neo-Nazi cults, embracing some form of occultisminherited from their SS forebears, do exist and do intend harm—violent harm—formost members of the human race. In fact, it is almost a mistake in some cases tospeak of neo-Nazi cults, for the Nazi era is still very much with us and hasbeen lovingly preserved by unrepentant war criminals in safe havens inArgentina, Brazil, Chile . . . and the United States.While Dr. Hammond's thesis may be a bit extreme, there can be no doubt thatNazis escaped to America, and that they brought their cult of race mysticism andswastika worship with them. Combined with the legendary Nazi hatred for Judaismand Christianity, this cult is still blatantly pagan although it would be anexercise in hyperbole to consider it \"satanic\" in any strict, ideological sense.Nazis do not worship the Devil as such; for them, as for other pagans of variouspersuasions—including the benign Wicca movement—the Devil is purely aJudeo-Christian concept. Only someone still in the thralls of some form ofJudeo-Christianity would consider going to all the trouble to worship Satan.Yet, the various gods and goddesses that compose traditional Nordic paganism areviewed as demons by the Catholic Church. They were certainly \"false gods,\" andto worship them would have been enough to send anyone to the stake during theInquisition. Witches' Sabbaths are not Black Masses, but participation in themwas reason enough for execution. Hence, Himmler's sympathy for the witches whowere destroyed by the Church during the Middle Ages; they were, after all,fellow travelers to the Nordic Armanen brothers and the Celtic Druids. Thus, thedifficulty in drawing lines of demarcation where the Church sees none. To theconventional Catholic point of view, witches and Druids and Nordic pagans are ofa piece with sat.inists: in the Church's eyes they all worship the Devil.The writings and speeches of Nazi apologists like Walther Darrc, AlfredRosenberg, Hcinrich Himmler, Baldur von Schirach, and Hitler himself make itclear jList what the Nazi platform was on organized religion and the future ofAryan spirituality. They understood the con-cept of \"spirit\" to be racially determined. Thus, there was a \"Jewish spirit\" asdistinct from an \"Aryan spirit.\" The spirit was, therefore, a function of theblood. Previous authors, such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain, had written thatone could somehow \"become Jewish\" simply by associating with Jews long enough;for Chamberlain and others, race was not the determining factor in what thelater Chinese ideologues would term \"spiritual pollution\"; rather, theenvironment itself was the critical element. Although Hitler greatly admiredChamberlain, he insisted that the German spirit was a vastly different creaturethan the Semitic spirit, and that racial purity determined spiritual purity. Inthis way, all possibility of individual, personal spiritual advancement wasdenied. One was either born perfect, or one's soul was doomed from the outset.And there was no mystery about who was who: your birth certificate told thestory. There was no such thing as a \"human spirit\": there was only a racialspirit. And should a German woman have sexual intercourse with a Jew only once,her soul would become polluted forever and her children—even if engendered by anAryan male—would always contain a taint of Jewish corruption; hence the racialNuremberg Laws which forbade sexual intercourse (let alone marriage) betweenJews and non-Jews in Hitler's Germany.When the Nazis escaped along the ratlines to the Americas, they brought thesebeliefs with them. They remained as indispensable a part of their spiritualrepertoire as Mein Kampfor the Protocols. And they functioned as silent mastersbehind a legion of front men in the host countries, financing the publication ofwhat most of the world would consider \"hate literature\" but which to the Nazisremain their sacred scriptures. These men were in urgent need of somethingsimilar to what the Chinese call \"reeducation\" or what the cult fighters call\"deprogramming,\" but the world did not understand the Nazi Party (andparticularly the SS) as a cult and was not equipped to deal with the problem;and the continued threat oi Communism and the need for an overwhelming solutionto the Communist \"problem\" made these veteran anti-Communists valuable men tohave as intelligence agents, saboteurs, and military advisers wherever theCommunist threatwas present.That is why we witness a resurgence in Latin America, for instance, oi everyform <>f Nazism, from political parties that parade the swastika .md other runicdesigns as official emblems to pogroms against variousethnic minorities—usually the Native American populations—to totalitarian formsof government that were established to defeat the greatest enemy or Nazism afterthe Jews, International Communism.A casual observer might decide that these political coruscations are isolatedincidents, the black-leather fantasies of a handful of crazed and chronicunderachievers trying to get our attention. Unfortunately, this is not the case.The flashy neo-Nazi groups of Latin America perform a valuable service for theold war criminals in hiding. They take the public's political temperature, so tospeak, while at the same time taking the heat off the Kamaradenwerk. And a majorplayer in that underground Nazi network—the ratline par excellence —was OttoSkorzeny.Hitler's CommandoSkorzenys career as the creator of Hitler's elite commando force— trained inforeign languages, sophisticated weapons, and demolition devices, various formsof aircraft including experimental planes, and combat and assassinationtechniques—is celebrated all over the world. It was Skorzeny, after all, whoperformed the impossible rescue of Benito Mussolini from under the nose of hiscaptors. It was Skorzeny who dressed members of his force in American uniformsin one of the last battles of the war and thus contributed to many Americandeaths by means of the artful deception.And it was Skorzeny who inherited the responsibility for maneuvering the stolenNazi art treasures out of Germany and occupation hands into Spain, Portugal, andeventually to South America. These art treasures formed the capital with whichSkorzeny financed Die Spinne Spider), his version of ODESSA (the Organization offormer SS Officers), and with which he aided the escape and survival of many ofhis former colleagues, including (but not limited to) Eichmann and Mengele.Skorzeny never stood trial at Nuremberg when he was easily one of the mostimportant war criminals ever to survive the Occupation. Instead, he made himselfuseful to American intelligence and, later, to West German industrialists andreconstituted Nazis enjoying the protection of Adenauer. He figured prominentlyin the Peron re-gime in Argentina and was even entrusted with bringing Evita's body from Italyto Argentina after the death of her husband.Skorzeny was a fanatic Nazi who kept the pagan faith throughout his career untilhis death from cancer in 1975. His involvement with the regimes of Farouk andNasser in Egypt went so far as to include creating an Egyptian Gestapo staffedalmost completely with former SS officers, a measure that received wholeheartedsupport from CIA Director Allen Dulles, who was at that time involved withReinhard Gehlen in developing an anti-Communist espionage service within theranks of the CIA. It is evidence of this kind of collusion between the CIA andformer SS officers, Nazi financiers, and concentration camp doctors that hasgiven rise to speculation about Nazi mind-control methods being developed underCIA auspices in the decades after the war (with a nod to Dr. Hammond).The commando unit Skorzeny created under Hitler remained largely intact afterthe war and formed the network of SS men around the world—financed by Nazi moneyhidden in various European and South American treasuries—that contributes to thesurvival of Nazi ideology today, more than fifty years after the end of WorldWar II. With so much support being given to these men by variousgovernments—including America's—is it any wonder that Nazism is enjoying a kindof spiritual rebirth all over the world? Estimates range as high as seventythousand former SS officers—members of Himmler's elite Black Order, initiatedwith pagan ritual into his version of the Masons and Jesuits rolled intoone—remained at large after the war. As such, it constitutes one of thelargest—and best-funded, best-trained, best-equipped, and best-connected—cultsin the world today. And the second generation is being trained and indoctrinatedin the streets of London, Berlin, New York, Buenos Aires . . . and in secret,heavily armed estates like Colonia Dignidad.The Ratlines. \\n undeclared war is being waged in Latin America today againstthe democratic institutions and the independence of the New World republics.This WOT is being conducted with fearful efficiency by theAftermath 297soldiers of the Third German Empire, who have been distributed by thousandsthroughout the political underground of this continent. They are the agents ofAdolf Hitler . . , 19— Hugo Fernandez Artucio, writing in 1942To appreciate the ease with which lines of communication and transportation wereset up between the Nazis in Europe and their support groups in South America,one only has to look at the history of South America in the twentieth century,particularly during the war years. Beginning in the 1930s, there were waves ofGerman immigration coming to the continent. At first, these were German Jewsfleeing the newly established Aryan state. Then, Nazi diplomats began replacingtheir Weimar counterparts in embassies from Bogota to Buenos Aires, and formingrelationships with local Nazi parties in these countries. Of all the SouthAmerican nations, those most likely to welcome Nazi influence were Argentina,Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia. All of these countries had high concentrations ofGerman-speaking people in influential areas of government and commerce. Bolivia,for example, had a relatively open immigration policy and visas could simply bepurchased. The Bolivian airline, LAB, was owned and operated by Germans, asituation that Allen Dulles would fight hard to change as it posed a strategicthreat to US interests. Of course, Ernst Rohm had worked in Bolivia in the 1920sas a military adviser.Bolivia also had—and probably still has—a homegrown Nazi Party: the OrganizacionNacional Socialista Americana (American National Socialist Organization) orONSA. 20Chile, by comparison, had no less than three Nazi Parties when the war brokeout, 21 plus was host to an exiled Bolivian Nazi Party; this is one of thereasons why Chile remained the only country in South America that did notdeclare war on Germany. One of these parties, the National Socialist Movement{Movimiento Nacional Socialista or MNS), founded by Jorge Gonzalez von Marees in1932, was an attempt to build Nazism with Chilean characteristics (to paraphrasean old Maoist slogan). The members of this party were actually referred to asNacis, but by 1 937 the movement became disaffected with Hitler and, althoughstill remaining basically anti-Semitic and nationalistic, it severed itsrelations with other Nazi and Fascist organizations inChile. It attempted a coup against the administration of President Alessandri,but was brutally suppressed when fifty of its members were murdered without atrial. Eventually, the Nacis threw in with presidential candidate Aguirre Cerdaand helped him win by a narrow margin, so their influence was not altogetherimaginary. We will look at more modern—and more lethal—Nazi movements in Chilein the next chapter.But by far the most blatantly pro-Nazi and pro-Fascist government in SouthAmerica was that of Argentina's Juan Peron. A critical link in the Nazi ratline,Peron's government bent over backwards to accommodate fleeing Nazis and, asrecent revelations have shown, more than one thousand such war criminals managedto find safe haven in Peron's Argentina. 22Prior to Peron's accession to power in 1946, however, Argentina had become afocal point for Nazi strategy in the region. The Party Leader (Parteileiter) forSouth America was headquartered in Buenos Aires. 23 The Party Leader was atleast nominally in charge of all SS, SA, Arbeitfront, Hitler Youth, and Gestapoactivities in the entire region. In Berlin, the Nazi Party had a separatesection and a secretary-general for the Nazi Party of South and Central America.To better appreciate this policy, one merely has to imagine—for instance—thesheer audacity of having a United States Republican Party of Pakistan, forinstance, or an American Democratic Party of Rumania. We who tend to think ofour political parties as purely domestic affairs have to rearrange our thinkingwhen it comes to understanding the Nazis, who saw themselves as eventuallyruling over the entire globe. In this, they were not too different from theirmortal enemies, the Communists, who organized in foreign countries but who owedtheir allegiance to Moscow. The essential point of departure, however, is thaithe Communists were consciously international while the Nazis were national. TheNazi Parties in South America were not independently operated affairs, not evenon paper. They were simply divisions oi the greater Nazi Party in Germany, andall the same rules applied (i.e., as regards race, religion, etc.). Afull-blooded Native American Peruvian, for example, would have no more ehanee oljoining the Nazi Party m I .i Paz or SUCK than would someone one-quarter |ewishin Berlin.Argentina had a Nazi-style party in power for a while in 1943 whenthe Grupc de Oficiales Unidos or GOU executed a neat coup thai resuited in a short-lived, pro-Fascist military dictatorship. 24 Previously, theUriburu government of 1930-32 had attempted to create a selfconsciously ItalianFascist government there, with mixed results that ended in failure. WhileArgentina remained passively pro-Nazi and pro-Fascist during the war (and onlydeclared war on Germany at the last possible moment), it did not succeed inbecoming the Nazi dream state until 1946.Juan Domingo Peron had served as a military attache to Mussolini's Italy beforethe war broke out and liked what he saw. Like so many other Latin Americangenerals, he found the totalitarian power structure of Fascist Italy and NaziGermany appealing. Even more, the swaggering machismo of II Duce and the flashyblack uniforms and jackboots of the SS helped to form a persistent idea amongLatin military leaders of what a real army and a real government should looklike. That is, they admired the surface manifestations of the movement and thebrutally simple approach to administrative problems favored by the right-wingtotalitarian regimes. No one could accuse the platforms of either Fascism orNazism of being hard to understand; Communism, by comparison, was largelyintended to be a \"scientific\" approach to government and economics and requiredlearning a whole new vocabulary and doing at least some reading. There wasn'tmuch reading required of the aspiring Fascist or Nazi. Even Hitler, it is said,did not read most of the books he owned but scanned pamphlets which containedbrief quotations from the literary and philosophical giants of German history.He could thus quote these dead white gentlemen as if he had read their entireworks. 25 This was the approach favored by the right-wing extremists who sawthemselves as men of action rather than as political philosophers.Many who write on the Nazi scene in South America have disparaged the movement.They claim that Nazism could never gain a real foothold in South America becausethe history and culture of that society is so different from that of Germany orItaly. 26 For one thing, because the population is so diverse, a racial programcould never succeed. For another, long exposure to North American forms ofdemocracy would mitigate against the creation of a purely nationalisticpolitical force.Unfortunately, this perception of South American politics is only partiallycorrect. It is true that the populations of many Latin countriesare racially diverse; that does not stop those of white skin from looking downon those with dark skin. It also does not stop those of largely Europeanancestry from discriminating against those of Native American blood. The vastdestruction of indigenous peoples taking place in the Amazonian rain forests isbut one example of this callous disregard for those of different race. SouthAmerica is as class-conscious as any other region; at times, even more so.Family connections are everything, from Colombia in the north to Chile andArgentina in the south. One's last name can prove an entree to the country club,or a permanent ban from the seats of power and influence.As for North American democracy, the people of Latin America know all too wellhow it has been used against them; the overthrow of Salvador Allende in 1973 wasonly one example. One could cite Guatemala, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic,and El Salvador as others, not to mention the repeated attempts to assassinateor overthrow Fidel Castro of Cuba.Thus, Nazi sensibilities became popular among the vested interests in Bolivia,Argentina, Chile, and Ecuador, and virtually everywhere in South America thatboasted an elite ruling class that was almost invariably white and non-Indian.While it was difficult in some countries to organize an anti-Semitic party dueto the tiny and relatively uninflu-ential Jewish populations there, the emphasiswas switched to anti-Communism. And, as Communists began to organize among thelowly and dispossessed (usually Native American) peoples of Bolivia, Chile,Argentina, and the rest of South America, anti-Communism took on some racistcharacteristics.Christianity—particularly Roman Catholicism—is a strong force in Latin America,perhaps less so now than during the 1940s and 1950s, when religious laws in manycountries were virtually indistinguishable from federal laws (legislationpertaining to marriage, divorce, and abortion come readily to mind); butnonetheless, the Church still wields moral power and its \"liberationist\" priestsand nuns arc well loved by the poor. Thus, in Latin America, the Nazis facedsome ol the same philosophical and cultural hurdles that they encountered inChristian Germany. Yet, while pious Catholicism is the norm amongthe poorer and middle-class populations ol I aim America, Oa uliism was popularamong the elite and the educated classes. I 'hey indulged ineverything from spiritualism to Gnosticism to ritual magic and Rosi-crucianism,particularly in the urban areas. This, coupled with some native occult beliefssuch as Santeria, Macumba, and a host of other practices that are the product ofAfrican and Native American religions mixing with imported Roman Catholicism,produced an atmosphere that was conducive to cults and nontraditional religioussects. Further, many otherwise intelligent Latinos of the author's acquaintanceexpress surprise at the vehemence which the name of Hitler or the subject ofNazis arouses in many a norteamericano. While many Latins would notautomatically embrace der Fiihrer, they do tend to see him as a brilliant, ifflawed, statesman who could not have been the demon the \"northern\" press makeshim out to be. While most of the population would resist Nazism as a foreignimport, if nothing else, and a not very useful alternative to democracy orCommunism, the oligarchies of these countries tend to admire Nazism as aphilosophy dear to their hearts: an ideology where might is right, and willpower (plus automatic weapons) is everything. And, since members of theChurch—including individual priests, nuns, and bishops—have recently becomeinvolved in anti-government protests and conspiracies from Central to SouthAmerica, at times even siding with Communist and Socialist extremists againstright-wing dictatorships . . . well, then, who needs the Church?For these reasons the Nazi Party remains as antagonistic as ever toChristianity. While some Christian prelates may see in the Nazi Party a usefulbulwark against the greater evil, Communism, by far the most popular priests andbishops in Latin America are the antigovernment preachers and martyrs. And now,with the collapse of Communism in Russia and Eastern Europe, the Party mustreevaluate its usefulness to a host of military regimes. The ongoing struggle ofSendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas in Peru, for instance, is a boon tothose aging Nazi antiterrorism consultants who still ply their trade in theSouth. While the antigovernment forces in South America may eventually changetheir program from doctrinaire Communism or Maoism due to lack of supportabroad, they will persist in their policy of overthrowing the relative handfulof powerful families in charge of the I at in American economies.And then, of course, there is the drug trade.ImagineNazis and their sympathizers are rarely boring. At the very least, they arerevolting and perhaps even ridiculous. At best, they are surreal. One such caseis that of Carlos Lehder Rivas, 27 a former kingpin of the Medellin drug cartelof Colombia: neo-Nazi, multimillionaire drug lord, convicted felon, prosecutionwitness against former Panamanian President and Santeria practitioner ManuelNoriega, and huge John Lennon fan.Lehder's father was a German engineer who managed to emigrate to Colombia beforethe end of the war. Carlos Lehder himself was born in 1947, the product of aunion between his German-born father and Colombian mother. His parents divorcedshortly after Carlos was born, and his mother took him to New York City, wherehe eventually wound up selling pot in the Bronx as a teenager before gettingarrested for grand-theft auto at the age of twenty-six. He had been stealingcars since he was eighteen.By 1975, he was out of jail and back in Bogota. Three years later, and CarlosLehder was one of the richest men in the world. He had understood that the keyelement in any narcotics operation was transportation, and—with his newlyacquired pilot's license—he set up a marijuana transport system that was themarvel of South American criminal enterprises.Not content with being a mere drug trafficker, however, Carlos Lehder decided hewanted to run the country. By 1983 he had formed a political party—theMovimiento Civico Latino National (MCLN)—a rabidly nationalist, anti-American,anti-Communist, and neo-Nazi party in which Hitler was extolled as \"the greatestwarrior in history,\" 28 and Lehder's own open involvement in the drug trade wasnothing less than a means of toppling the imperialist forces (the United Stales)and destroying their influence in Latin America. He opened a resort hotel, thePosada Alemana (German Inn), a pastiche of Bavarian-style are hi tecture, with astatue of Lehder's idol, John Lennon, as centerpiece ofthe hotel's disco: a club which blared a constant stream of Beatles musk .it allhours of the day and night The statue itself is worthy of attention for hereLennon is depic ted in the nude, wearing Only a \\a/i helmet, holding .i guitar,and with a bullet hole in his heart! I low thepeaceful, antiestablishment and pro-love pop singer and composer was linked withNazism in Lender's mind is anyone's guess; perhaps Mr. Lennon's marriage to aJapanese woman was enough to convince the drug dealer that Lennon's sympathieswere with the Axis powers?In any event, Lehder's many speeches to the press and to crowds ofcuriosity-seekers in his hometown of Armenia consistently invoke this theme ofNazism and the drug trade, equating cocaine with the atomic bomb: the secretweapon of the Nazis in their ongoing struggle against capitalism and Americanimperialism. Most DEA agents regarded these speeches as the ravings of acoked-up narcotraficante . . . but then there was that little matter of amilitary coup in Bolivia, a coup masterminded by drug-runner and former Gestapochief Klaus Barbie with the assistance of a secret Masonic organization based inItaly.The Butcher of LyonBarbie—like so many other rabid Nazis—had been a devout Catholic in his youth,joining several Catholic youth groups in and around his childhood home of Trier,close to the borders of France and Luxembourg on the Mosel River. Trier was thescene of many violent clashes between the French and the Germans during andafter the First World War, and later between the Nazis and those who opposedthem during the chaotic thirties. At some point, Barbie experienced a kind ofspiritual crisis and—on April 1, 1933—he joined the Hitler Youth at the age ofnineteen.The previous month, Hitler had offered to compromise with the Church, calling itan essential part of German folk (volk) heritage. While previously the Churchwas certain that it would suffer severely under the Third Reich because of thelatter's aggressive neo-paganism, this new attittide was welcomed with reliefand many clergymen jumped on the bandwagon. This might have been the reasonyoung Barbie decided to throw in with the Nazis, but his real motivations areunknown.Several months later, after the signing of the German-Vatican Concordat on July20, 1933, the bishop of Trier scheduled a rare public showing of thatcathedral's famous Robe.The Robe is supposedly that which was worn by Christ on his journey up Golgothato be crucified.One of the most famous relics in Catholic Europe, the robe was only exhibited atsupreme moments in history, and its showing involved the organisation of aninternational pilgrimage. The bishop could not have invented a more perfectstroke of international propaganda for the new Nazi authorities. 29Nazi dignitaries attended the showing, along with contingents of uniformed SA(Storm Troopers). The showing lasted for several months, during which pilgrimsfrom all over Europe made their way to the cathedral for this once-in-a-lifetimeglimpse of one of the Church's most holy relics. It is one of those scenes onerarely sees in the movies: an ancient Catholic cathedral, files of altar boysswinging censers, red-robed prelates chanting in Latin before a sacred relic . .. and columns of Storm Troopers in swastika armbands as the honor guard!While there is evidence that Barbie may have secretly joined the Nazis evenbefore 1933, 30 it is certain that by 1934 he had already attained a positionwith the SD, the Sicherheitsdienst or Secret Service, a division of Himmler'sSS.Eventually, his work for the SD progressed to the point that Ober-sturmfiihrerBarbie became Gestapo chief of the French city of Lyon in November 1942. It isfrom that point on that his record of barbarity and cruelty—a record that earnedhim the nickname \"Butcher of Lyon\"—was begun.Barbie was responsible for sadistic, horrific crimes against the Jews,Communists, and the French Resistance. He took a particular delight ininterrogations, and eyewitness accounts of his participation in the torture ofmen and women in the basement cells of Montluc Prison are enough to turnanyone's stomach. In the case oi Maquis leader Andre Devigny, lor example,Barbie ordered his pel Alsatian to attack the defenseless prisoner, a man whohad already been subjected to \"savage heatings, the cold-water treatment ol thebaignoire, injections,and red-hot irons placed on the soles ol his feet, ' I he dog began b)ripping Devigny's clothing from his body with Ins fangs and then continued bytearing the man's flesh from Ins hones.Miraculously, Devigny survived this encounter with Barbie and went down inFrench Resistance history as the only prisoner ever to escape from MontlucPrison. Unfortunately, the use of trained, vicious dogs as interrogation andtorture tools also survived and was implemented with gusto in the Nazi fortressand cult center in Chile known as Colonia Dignidad. (See Chapter Twelve.)At the end of the war, and with a price on his head and a warrant for hisarrest, Barbie managed to find employment with American intelligence in Germany,specifically for the US Counter Intelligence Corps, or CIC/ 2 As a Nazi turnedinformer and spy, Barbie entered into such illustrious company as ReinhardGehlen, Otto Skorzeny, and SS Colonel Freddy Schwend. Barbie soon proved veryuseful to his American handlers, developing an intelligence network thatextended from penetrations within French intelligence all the way to EasternEuropean emigre groups and intelligence services there.But Europe got too hot for Barbie. Wanted by the French for war crimes committedin Lyon, Barbie knew his days of enjoying the patronage of his Americansuperiors were drawing to a close. The Americans could not afford to let Barbiefall into French hands, for fear that he would reveal American intelligenceoperations against them. (To the Americans, the French intelligence service wasriddled through with Communists and could not be trusted. They spent almost asmuch time spying on their Allies as they did keeping tabs on the Soviet Union.)So, they arranged his escape along the ratline to South America; and for thispurpose they used the offices of a Croatian priest, Dr. Krunoslav Draganovic,himself a war criminal and Fascist (a member of the dread pro-Nazi Ustase)wanted by the Yugoslav authorities but who enjoyed the protection of the Vaticannonetheless.Like Barbie, Fr. Draganovic was also in good company. He was not the onlyCatholic priest in Yugoslavia accused of war crimes. The atrocities committedunder the aegis of the Fascist State of Croatia— formed in 1941 under AntePavelic—outdid even the Nazis for sheer brutality. While the Jews were certainlyon the list, so were the approximately two million Eastern Orthodox Serbs, whowere forced either to convert to Roman Catholicism ... or be put to death. Evenconversion was no guarantee of safety, as many new converts (men, women,children) were dragged from their first Mass and executed on the streets outsidethe churches. One Franciscan priest was even the com-mandant of a Croatian concentration camp. 34 Actions such as these mitigateagainst Vatican protestations of innocence, or the equally disingenuous argumentthat an accommodation had to be reached with the Nazis to prevent furtherbloodshed or the murder of innocent Catholics.These were the people Draganovic represented and for which an arrest warrant wasissued, although he never served any time in prison and was never even tried ina court of law. This is the man who arranged Barbie's escape for the CIC.After a series of adventures, Barbie found himself (and his entire family) a newhome in Bolivia in 1951 with a visa made out in the name of Father Roque Romac(the pseudonym of yet another Croat war-criminal priest, a Franciscan whoministered to his newfound flock in the area of Cochabamba) and for a whileBarbie was the perfect bourgeois businessman. Then, forming and cementingrelationships with the underground Nazi cult in South America—and among men suchas Skorzeny, Freddy Schwend, Eichmann, and many others—Barbie, as \"KlausAltmann,\" began to carve out a position of influence in the various shiftingmilitary regimes in La Paz. It will be remembered that Bolivia had been host toGerman immigrants for years before the war began, and was a target of USintelligence efforts (notably under Dulles) to neutralize their influence onBolivia's political life. 35 Barbie fell in with the German emigre community,and— linking up with wheeler-dealer Freddy Schwend and, eventually, Italianpro-Fascist terrorist Stefano delle Chiaie—found himself a lucrative position asa lieutenant colonel in Bolivian IntelligentSchwend and Barbie began running guns between Bolivia, Peru, and Chile usingtheir contacts in the Kamaradenwerk (the informal association of ex-SS officersorganized by Luftwaffe ace and Hitler pel Colonel Hans Ulrich Rudel) and amongthe more fascist ol the various Latin American governments who became theirclients and, occasionally, their suppliers as well. The gun trade eventually ledthem into the drug trade, where the abilities of Barbie as a military organizerwere enhanced by the arrival ol Stefano delle Chiaie. Delle Chiaieenjoyed a serious reputation abroad as a master terrorist who \\\\^\\ beenresponsible for a series of lethal bombings throughout Italy in the latesixties, lie had also been involved m an aborted military takeovei »>t thecountry in 1970, and had to flee ltal\\ for the relative safety ofFranco's Spain. It was in Spain that he met—and cultivated—\"El Brujo,\" Argentinas own version of Rudolf Hess: Jose Lopez Rega, self-professed Rosicrucian,Peronista, mystical advisor to Isabel Peron, founder of the notorious AAA deathsquads . . . and member oi Propaganda Due, P-2, the supersecret Masonic societydedicated to the overthrow oi the Italian government and its replacement by aFascist regime. 37 Lopez Rega was an intimate of such men as P-2 founder LicioGelli who spent many of the postwar years in exile in Argentina, plotting torestore pro-Fascist, anti-Communist governments in South America as well as inEurope and using his own version of Hitler's 'dangerous element,\" the initiatorysecret society P-2, as his vehicle tor bank manipulations and the subversion ofgovernments.As we shall see in the next chapter, delle Chiaie would also become involvedwith Michael Vernon Townley, the American terrorist and Spy who planned andorganized the assassination of former Allende minister Orlando Letelier inWashington, D.C. on behalf of Chile's secret police, DINA. Townley, of course,was a frequent visitor (and adviser) to Colonia Dignidad.With all this talent cropping up in Bolivia, it was inevitable that thephenomenon known as ' narco-terrorism\" would be born. Elements of Italian,Argentine, and Bolivian mercenaries—trained and led by former SS officers—formedthe security detail (known as the melodramatically nomenclatured Fiances ofDeath) for Bolivia's drug smugglers and even warded off violent attacks fromColombia's rival Medellin cartel. For some time it seemed that Barbie and hisfriends could not reach any higher and then came July 1980 and the Garcia Mezamilitary coup, masterminded in part by Klaus Barbie and Stefano delle Chiaie andfunded by Argentine intelligence and the shadowy P-2.The coup ushered in a new period of severe and brutal military repression in thecountry, as perhaps could be expected of a government created and managed bydrug smugglers, terrorists, Fascist cult-ists, and Nazi war criminals. CarlosLehder's inspiration had obviously been the Me/a/Barbie coup, and Nazigatherings took place rather openly in La Pa/ complete with swastika banners andraucous singing oi the 1 lorst Wessel Song\" in Bolivian clubs and bars. Barbiecontinued as chid oi internal intelligence\" and delle Chiaie went abroad toforge links between the government of Bolivia and such legendary homicidalmadmen as Major Roberto D'Aubuisson of El Salvador, theman who ordered the assassination of Bishop Romero. At home, Barbie concentratedon removing all opposition to his growing narcotics trade . . . with theapproval and assistance of the government.Eventually, though, the sadistic dream had to end. Delle Chiaie was fingered inthe bombing, in August 1980, of the railway station in Bologna, Italy, in whicheighty-four passengers died. He dropped from view, narrowly escaping capture.The foreign press had already identified Barbie as the \"Butcher of Lyon\" wantedby the French government. And, slowly, Barbie's spiderweb world began tounravel. A civilian government was elected in Bolivia by a population finallydriven to outrage by the excesses of the Cocaine Army and in February 1983,Barbie was extradited to France to stand trial almost forty years after the endof World War II.Barbie's story is instructive for two reasons. In the first place, itdemonstrates the danger and continuing threat of the Nazi underground againstpolitical regimes all over the world. In the second place, Barbie remained acommitted Nazi: a man who bought into the cult of Nazism with his whole heartand soul and who never, ever, lost faith with the religion of Hitler, Himmler,Hess, and Rosenberg. The racial conceits; the anti-Christian, pro-paganideology; the anti-Communist crusade ... it was all present in Barbie's reign ofterror in Bolivia and included the other organizers of neo-Nazi intrigue,Skor-zeny and Rudel.Drugs, guns, murder-for-hire, military coups, instruction in Nazi torture andinterrogation techniques, Nazi nightclubs and the \"Horst Wessel Song\" . . .these are all the hallmarks of what is often mistakenly referred to as\"neo-Nazism.\" There was nothing \"neo-\" about Klaus Barbie. He was the genuinearticle. And there was nothing \"neo-\" about Colonia Dignidad, the latest in along line of concentration camps and cult centers courtesy of the Third Reich.# 12 uIs Chile Burning? TheOverthrow of Allende,the Murder of Letelier,and the Role of ColoniaDignidadThe demon of world domination has spoken. He has proclaimed the great secret:the world can be dominated. Bowed with weariness, the peoples demand subjection.And those who resist will be tamed by terrible blows and sufferings. Modernsociety is charged with a magical current which in all men creates the samethoughts . . .'KONRAD HhlDEN(Emphasis mine—P.L.)The followers of Crowley also speak of a magical current. In their wo rid view,the operative wave of energy for the New Age is something called the \"93current\"; and, like the currentdescribed in Heiden's biography of Hitler, this current \"in all men creates thesame thoughts.\" To the Thelemite, these thoughts are of personal freedom: afreedom that is not bestowed, like a favor, by some benevolent authority butinherited as a birthright; in other words, the 93 current is akin to what mostpeople think of as the New Age or the Age of Aquarius . . . except, perhaps,with a bit more of a bite. To Hitler, however, these \"thoughts\" were instead ofthe master/ slave complex: a mutual need for subjugation within the heavilyritualized context of the necromantic cult. As we shall demonstrate, hisnecromancers are hard at work restoring the current to life in Latin Americatoday.As we saw in the previous chapter, the Nazi underground in SouthAmerica—established long before the war began—was in full swing in the fifties,sixties, and seventies. Yet, after the death of Juan Peron— probably theirstrongest supporter among the South American dictators—the Nazis knew they hadto find another venue for protecting their lives and their interests. IsabelPeron (Juan Peron's third wife) was sympathetic to the Nazi cause, but a trifleinsane. She surrounded herself with occultists, Rosicrucians, and other psychicsycophants (such as Jose Lopez Rega, the right-wing fanatic and occultist, andP-2 initiate, known as El Brujo, \"the Witch\") in a style that would have madeRudolf Hess blush. She was eventually eased out of power and placed in anasylum.So, the natural destination for refugee Nazis thus became Chile. Sharing a longborder with Argentina striated with hidden mountain passes across the Andesthrough which the Nazis could secretly come and go as they pleased, Chile alsoboasted a large German-speaking population that had been in place for nearly ahundred years. These descendants of Chile's first German immigrants were now inpositions of power and influence in the country, so much so that when 1 returnedfrom my visit to Colonia Dignidad my seatmatCS on the plane business people fromFlorida—solemnly affirmed that no commerce of any kind was possible in Chileunless you went through \"the Germans\": lawyers, bankers, industrialists,manufacturers of every type . . . like an anti-Semitic stereotype in reverse,.ill these (theysaid) were Genn.ins. This means not merely Chilenos with German SOUnding lastnames, but people who Steadfastly hold onto then Ianguage, their culture, and their German heritage in the midst of what used to bethe longest-running democracy on the continent.Certainly, the capital city of Santiago boasts many fine German restaurants—adisproportionate share, one might think. One evening during my stay, I happenedto be dining in the downtown Sheraton Hotel. Pages carrying signs with smallbells paraded through the lobby and dining rooms, looking for \"Sr. Schwarz\" or\"Sr. Miiller\" or \"Sr. Schulz,\" rarely a Gonzalez or Rodriguez. Never a Smith.And Santiago's version of Central Park boasts an enormous sculpture—replete withbusty Valkyries and heroic Nordic workingmen— dedicated to the German Immigrant.This, across the street from one of Santiago's finest German restaurants, anestablishment that shares the same building with the Israeli legation!And all was just fine until 1970, when the unthinkable happened.A professed Socialist and longtime political celebrity in Chile, SalvadorAllende Gossens was elected president of the Republic in a three-way vote.During the height of the Vietnam War, the drug-and-peace culture of the sixties,and worldwide student revolt against the establishment, there was suddenly ademocratically elected Marxist president in America. This was cause forrejoicing everywhere there was even a hint of liberal or left-wing sympathy,even though quite a few of those who applauded Allende's election were notMarxists. For many people, Allende's success at the polls was simply anindication of the strength of the democratic process. A Socialist had become theleader of his country without firing a shot, in a free and open election, and inthe Western Hemisphere besides.Allende became the toast of the revolutionary elite. He is seen chatting nowwith Fidel Castro, now with Pablo Neruda, now with Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Akind of Latin Camelot was taking place in Chile as artists, writers, musicians,philosophers, and academies crowded around the new president, talking of humanrights, emancipation of the working class, and the extrication of Chile'seconomy from the death grip of the norteamericanos. For years in the streets ofNew York City one had become familiar with posters showing thebearded-and-bereted Che Guevara—the martyred Argentine hero of the Cubanrevolution—and one grew accustomed to the various Socialist and Communistsplinter groups who marched in the streets of Greenwich Village shouting\\Venceremos\\ But here, in Chile, it hadactually happened. Legally. In the fine old democratic tradition that the UnitedStates was supposedly sworn to uphold throughout the world and particularly inthe sphere of influence covered by the Monroe Doctrine: Latin America.But Richard Nixon was president of the United States, and Henry Kissinger washis Torquemada. Democratic or not, freely elected or not, chief executive of asovereign nation or not, Salvador Allende Gossens had to go.And nowhere was that sentiment more strongly shared than among the members ofthe Nazi underground.The Mountains of MadnessIs it the Andes Mountains, perhaps, that give Chile its unique spiritualcharacter? One of the most literate nations on earth (at the time of Allende,anyway), it surpassed the United States in the proportion of its people whocould read and write. And this relatively tiny country had given the world notone but two Nobel Prize-winning poets.To the metaphysical Chilean author Miguel Serrano, 2 the Andes are the West'sequivalent of the Himalayas. Where a North American might expect llamas insteadof lamas, he sees these venerable peaks as the spiritual domain of ancientsupernatural forces; he believes a secret priesthood resides somewhere withinthe Andes chain, possessing the secrets of immortality, and of communion withthe gods. Serrano— whose books on Jungian-type themes are familiar to NorthAmerican readers—also wrote on the metaphysical aspects of Hitler's Germany in avolume which has not been translated into English nor made available in theUnited States, even in the original Spanish. While 1 was in Chile, I bought acopy and was startled by the fact that this author of the charming littlealchemical low story, El/Ella, would havewritten so extensively on the initiatk aspects ol the Third Reich in such termsof open admiration, insisting thirty years after the war—that National Socialism would he the salvation of ()hile!I purchased the tome in an enormous bookstore, the si/e of one of oursuperstores except that this was in Chile m 1979. At the same table browsed atall, thin, well dressed man in a full length, gTCJ heanl.I had seen this man at least once before, in New York. At the moment, I couldnot place the connection but thought it strange that 1 would run into him here,so far from the streets or Jackson Heights.This man would dog my steps during my stay in Chile. It seemed wherever I wentin Santiago, he would be there; sometimes even ahead of me. And he would be oneof the last people 1 would see before 1 had to leave the country in anexpeditious manner two weeks later. In Chile, it was suddenly becoming difficultto tell the mystic from the Fascist.Colony of RighteousnessThose who follow those stories of ritual child abuse we read about in thetabloids and hear about on such talk shows as \"Maury Povich,\" \"Oprah,\"\"Donahue,\" \"Geraldo,\" et. al., know that the thread that runs through all ofthem involves a satanic cult in a remote area that kidnaps or breeds childrenfor sexual abuse, torture, and human sacrifice. To those who scoff at theseoutrageous claims, we have only to point to Colonia Dignidad as a prime exampleof all the \"survivors'\" worst nightmares.Paul Schafer was one of the founders of the Colony of Righteousness and was, andis, its only leader. Schafer jumped bail in German) in 1961 on charges of childsexual abuse,* but that did not stop him from taking a group of families withhim when he fled to Chile, arriving there in 1962 at the age of forty witharound sixty \"blond, blue-eyed settlers\"' . . . including some children who werebrought there under false pretenses, taken from their families back in Germany.His flock came from the town of Siegburg, across the Rhine from Bonn, whereSchafer claimed to be a psychologist, and where he ran a youth home where thesexual-abuse charges originated. Schafer, also the leader of a Baptist sect (asect which evidently condones sexual intercourse between adults and childrenamong other peculiarities), bought an old ranch called 1:1 Lavadero about 250miles south ol Santiago in the Parral region and quickly converted it into aself-sufficient, model community known as Colonia Dignidad, the \"Colony ofRighteousness' or \"Dignity Colon)/'The population of the Colony eventually grew to about 350, composed of 250adults and 100 children. 5 According to reports in the Chilean and German press,the sexes are rigorously separated and sexual intercourse is forbidden 6(except, one gathers, at the discretion of Schafer). And, since sex isprohibited, the only way the Colony has been able to increase its population hasbeen by \"importing\" children from Germany. 7 German authorities have beeninvestigating charges that from thirty to forty children reported missing fromthe Bonn and Cologne areas have wound up at the Colony. 8 Thus, charges of bothchild abuse and international child abduction have been leveled at this remotecult community by eyewitnesses, escapees, and responsible members of the WestGerman and Chilean governments. The parallels between Colonia Dignidad and thestories told by \"satanic cult survivors,\" however, are even stronger.Spanish is not spoken; instead only German, and, oddly, English are used. 9Old-fashioned, 1940s-era clothing is worn and fourteen-hour workdays are thenorm. No television, radio, or newspapers are allowed in the Colony. There is,however, a shortwave unit on the premises which is used to communicate with anoffice the Colony maintains in Santiago and which was probably the radio I heardbeing used during my visit.The Colony established a free clinic on its premises: free, that is, on specificdays of the week to members of the local population. They also have their ownfactory for processing meat, a sixty-five bed hospital, a bakery, dairy, flourmill, machine shop, power plant . . . and their own airfield. By 1985, they hadeven opened their own roadside restaurant on the Pan American Highway.Accounts of the size of the Colony vary from news report to news report.Everything from 12,000 acres 10 to 37,000 acres\" has been offered, and accountsof its operations also include a mine, a lumber mill, and a gravel factory. Theauthor believes it is sale to say thai the ( iolony has grown considerably overthe years and thai estimates ol a 37,000-acre settlement might not he lar fromthe mark, considering the other purposes to which the ( olonv was put bothduring and afterthe Allende regime.In \\')().y .i yeai .liter the ( olonv lust established itself in Chile, thePartido National Socialista Obrero de Chile (the National Socialist ChileanWorkers Party) was formed under the leadership of Iran/Pfeifler. 12 Taking more than its name from the National Socialist GermanWorkers' Party, it became famous for its swastika banners, armbands, Fascistsalute, and Heil Hitlers as it attracted approximately ten thousand members itsfirst year. And Pfeiffer's was only one of many neo-Nazi organizations inChile—including the lethal, swastika-brandishing Pa ma y Libertad {Fatherlandand Liberty) Party founded by Pablo Rodriguez Grez, 13 a member of JorgeAlessandri's unsuccessful L970 presidential campaign—but it was the only one tohost a \"Miss Nazi\" contest, to which Nazi organizations throughout South Americasent their dewy, swastika-eyed contestants. For those who like to keep track olsuch things, the winner in 1968 was the rather chubby brunette Senorita Portena,obviously selected more for her value as a sturdy breeder of future StormTroopers than for any traditional, chauvinistic, petit-bourgeois estheticconsiderations. 14It was in this climate that, in 1966, the first of many accusations againstSchafer and the Colony surfaced when Wolfgang Muller escaped the \"watchdogs,electronic alarms and six-foot barbed wire fences\" IS to describe life insidethe Colony. Muller—who had been brought over from Germany as a member of theoriginal Siegburg group when he was sixteen—claimed that he had been forced intoslave labor at the Colony, was beaten, and had been sexually abused by Schaferin Germany when he was twelve years old. One of Miiller's more interestingclaims—especially in light of later events—is his insistence that Schafer hadgiven him \"memory-altering drugs\" 16 when Muller attempted to rebel or to revealthe details of his abuse at Schafer s hands. He also complained of electroshocktreatments being administered by camp doctors (shades of Barbie at MontlucPrison). After his third escape, he wound up at the West German embassy inSantiago and now lives in that country under an assumed name, still afraid forhis life. rMuller also revealed the existence of several former Nazis who lived at theColony but denied that Nazism was part of the Colony's ideology. Later that sameyear, another escapee—Wilhelmine Lindeman— appeared with the same story ofmind-altering drugs. This time, there was medical proof of her story: doctorsdiscovered evidence of injec-tions on her body. 18The author has been unable to obtain Schafer's war record, but it is clearthat—born in 1922—he was of draft age when the war was inits early stages. As virtually every able-bodied man was eventually pressed intoHitler's \"total war,\" Schafer must have spent at least a few years in uniform.But whose? The Wehrmacht's, or the black-and-silver uniform of the SS? His openfriendship with anti-democratic, pro-Nazi regimes and his hosting of severalformer Nazis indicates that he did not spend the war years in the camps as apersecuted Baptist minister. His self-professed background—however flimsy orfraudulent—in psychology, his knowledge of mind-altering drugs, and (as we shallsee) of specific forms of torture seem to indicate a somewhat more sinistereducation than Baptist Sunday school or Wehrmacht close-order drill. Indeed,when I \"met\" Paul Schafer in 1979, he was the epitome of the \"Hogan's Heroes\"stereotype of the SS officer, although he wore a brown uniform with a Sam Brownebelt and a campaign cap, an outfit that was more Storm Trooper thanSchutzstaf-fel. One imagines that the SA commander Ernst Rohm was more his idolthan Heinrich Himmler . . . but who can say?The charges against Colonia Dignidad in the sixties came to nothing. Authoritiestended to disbelieve Wolfgang Mailer's more outrageous claims, and WilhelmineLindeman later recanted her story when the Colony informed her that her husbandhad arrived from Germany and was living at the Colony. She disappeared back intothe sadistic embrace of Schafer and his cohorts, and was never heard from again.The Chilean Senate, to its credit, began an official investigation . . . but\"amid charges of bribery, the inquiry was dropped.\" 19Then, came the election of Salvador Allende, and the Colony took on a moreactive role in the political life of Chile and within the criminal milieu of theUnited States of America.The attempt to deprive Allende of his electoral victory began immediately afterhis election, and the telexes flew like curses between Santiago and Washington.The Chilean generals conferred day and night on the feasibility of staging amilitary coup that would prevent Allende from taking the oath of office, andthis plan almost succeeded except that incumbent President Eduardo Frei finallyrefused to support antidemocratic measures; a heroic move considering the amountof prea stire being put on him by ITT, the CIA, and the generals. While thisis not the place to go into a deep discussion of the Allende regime andus aftermath, a little of the background is necessary to appreciate dieextent to which Nazi organizations—and specifically the Nazi cult centered atColonia Dignidad—maneuvered to overthrow yet another South American government.Eventually, AJlende was sworn in as president and the generals began a series ofconspiracies aimed at destabilizing the new regime with the connivance ofChilean business interests, the US Ambassador to Chile Edward Korry, and ITT.(It should be remembered that ITT had a history of supporting Nazi regimes.Walter Schellenberg, head of the Foreign Intelligence section of the SD, wasnamed to ITT's German Board of Directors and remained on the Board for theduration of the war, and was paid a director's salary by the home office in NewYork.) 20 Funds were routed through to the truckers' union, for example, toenable it to go on a protracted strike. Anyone who has been to Chile knows thatthe country needs the truckers to survive: it is one, two-thousand-mile-longhighway from the desert in the north to the snowy wastes of the south.On December 2, 1971—after a year's worth of destabilization attempts by Chile'sagricultural, industrial, and mining oligarchies—a tightly orchestrateddemonstration of roughly fifty thousand housewives marched on the PresidentialPalace, La Moneda, to protest Al-lende's economic policies. It is worthwhile tomention that these fifty thousand women were the wives, mothers, and mistressesof Santiago's wealthiest citizens and that the march originated in the exclusivePro-videncia section of the city that the upper class calls home. They marchedon the palace carrying pots and pans which they banged together, creating acacophonous din, and were accompanied in their procession by members of Patria yLibertad acting as a kind of bodyguard. 21 The \"Empty Pots\" demonstration—inwhich some women actually clashed with police—was carried on most major wireservices and scenes were shown on the nightly news in the United States with theimplicit suggestion that these women represented the poor people of Chile whowere starving due to Allende's mismanagement of the economy. It was an artfulpiece of disinformation, and it certainly worked to great effect outside Chile.By the spring of 1973, however, rumors of an impending military coup wererampant in the capital. Among the conspirators creating discord both in the cityand in the countryside was a young American, Michael Vernon Townley. Townley wasa member of Patriay Libertadand an associate of other right-wing terror groups. A right-wing fanatic himselfwho carried out assignments for a variety of masters, Townley also contributedto the development of the interrogation program at Colonia Dignidad. 22Working directly for, and reporting to, the generals, Townley was given the rankof major in the Chilean Army and together with Colonel Pedro Espinosa and theChilean Secret Police (DINA), liaised with Patria y Libertad to create a climateof terror in the country conducive to a military coup. Patria y Libertad hadalready planned one coup attempt earlier in the Allende regime and was ripe foranother. When the time finally came—in September 1973 with the military invasionof Santiago, the bombing of La Moneda, and the assassination of Allende—theroving, Freikorps-like bands of Patria y Libertad and the Chilean Nazi Partywere cleaning up the streets and rounding up the usual suspects: intellectuals,students, artists, Communists, outspoken opponents of the army, and outspokendefenders of the president. 23Most of these prisoners were taken to the National Stadium, including two youngAmerican men who were subsequently murdered. 24 Many were tortured and thenexecuted. Many others were simply \"disappeared,\" their bodies foundlater—sometimes years later—in shallow graves and in roadside ditches.A few others—the most unfortunate of all—found themselves at the Colony.Concentration Camp ChileOne of Townley's tasks in the immediate aftermath of the coup was to establish astate-of-the-black-art detention center at Colonia Dignidad. 25 The followingstory would seem fantastic were it not supported by eyewitness accounts,statements of DINA defectors, and later United Nations, US, German, and Chileangovernment and Amnesty International reports.If we were to believe Paul Schafer, Colonia Dignidad is nothing more than a (Christian religious commune organized around somewhat ( alvinist lines of hardwork and prayer. II we are to believe virtuallyeveryone else, Colonia Dignidad is ail after-hours club on a side streetin Hell. Colony leaders had already established firm ties with the military longbefore the coup. According to Farago, it was a favorite hangout of Chilean AirForce officers (and, of course, Martin Bormann and Josef Mengele). Schafercultivated government connections through both his Santiago-based office and hisColony, where he also maintained a radio link with various DINA (secret police)operatives abroad in Colombia, Venezuela, and Europe. 26 Inquiries into theColony's operations were effectively hushed with the strategic placement ofbribes, all the way up to the Senate. And somehow the Colony had bribes tospare.According to the soldiers I spoke with that night in Parral, the mail arrivesvirtually every day with envelopes full of money for the Colony. As it turnsout, some of this money comes from pensions being paid to Colony residents fromthe (formerly) West German government^ (one of the reasons all the Colonyresidents are German citizens?) But the soldiers I spoke with insisted thatmoney came in from all over the world, including the United States. Its sourcecan only be a cause for speculation, and concern.With the coup, however, the Colony got a chance to put its electro-shock andnarcotics \"therapies\" to the test. Townley and DINA agents had the run of theColony, both at Parral and at the Colony office in Santiago. Js While DINAmaintained contact with its agents all over the world through the Colony's radiolink, Townley helped design the specially equipped interrogation cells. Thesewere tiny, soundproofed rooms built underground where \"political prisoners\" weretaken not only for actual interrogation of a political or military nature, butalso for the purpose of developing new methods of torture.At first, each prisoner was questioned closely to obtain sufficient informationconcerning his or her personality in order to develop an appropriate torture andinterrogation scheme. This individualized approach is already well known to theintelligence professionals the author has come into contact with over the years.The ostensible goal is to enable the interrogator to so finely tune the tortureprocedure that the victim surrenders his or her will more completely, moreexpeditiously. In practice, however, and with such a \"scientifically\" adjustedscheme of programmed sadism, there is tremendous room for an interrogator who isso inclined to subject the victim to unimaginable suffering over a long andsustained period of time. That this is what, in fact,took place at the Colony is beyond doubt for, certainly, there was nothing\"scientific\" about the dogs.In Colonia Dignidad prisoners have allegedly been subjected to different\"experiments\" without any interrogation: to dogs trained to commit sexualaggressions and destroy sexual organs of both sexes. 29I have used the exact words of the United Nations report of October 1976 toavoid being charged with unnecessarily embellishing my account withsensationalistic hype.According to the same UN report:The detainees' heads are covered with leather hoods which are stuck to theirfaces with substances that are supposedly chemicals. In these [underground]cells, interrogations are carried out through electronic equipment, includingloudspeakers and microphones, while detainees are tied naked to metal frames toreceive electric shocks. 30(When the Colony was finally visited in 1986 by a group that included Chilean,West German, and Amnesty International officials, the underground rooms whereprisoners had been held and tortured were discovered and identified.) 31What has been described, therefore, is a scene that not even the Nazi death campcommandants were able to invent: torture and interrogation by remote control!Individual prisoners in hermetically sealed, soundproofed cells underground,tied to metal frames, being asked questions by invisible interrogators over aloudspeaker and being jolted with electricity from a remote control panel whenslow in answering. And the man who helped design this infamy was the electronicsexpert and radio freak, the American Michael Townley.A Death in WashingtonTownley would probably have remained unknown to most Americanshad it not been for the assassination ol Orlando Letelier and Ronnie Moffit indowntown Washington, D.C. Letelier had been Allendes ambassador to the I fnitedStates and his minister ol defense in the lastdays of the president's administration, and had been one of the first to bearrested once the generals took over. Letelier had then been transferred, firstto the prison ship Esmeralda and then to Dawson's Island, a frozen wasteland atthe far south of Chile, where he was tortured and starved for months beforepressure from the world's governments forced General Pinochet—who had namedhimself dictator-for-life of the country—to release him and send him into exile.Letelier was not one to turn his back on his country. He waged what can only becalled a tireless, global campaign to destroy Pinochet's government by peacefulmeans. He spoke eloquently before trade unions, longshoremen's unions, andwhoever else would listen, urging them not to cooperate with the Chilean regime.The result was the refusal of these unions to unload Chilean vessels, totransport Chilean goods, and a general consciousness-raising among worldgovernments concerning the severe human rights abuses that were taking placeunder the openly pro-Nazi Pinochet and his Nazi-trained secret police, the DINA.That is when Pinochet ordered Letelier killed and—through his henchman ColonelContreras of DINA—selected Michael Townley to carry out the assassination. 32Townley had already met Pinochet in the company of Stefano delle Chiaie, theItalian terrorist and compadre of Nazi conspirators Klaus Barbie, FreddySchwend, and others. 33 Delle Chiaie had brought his friend, Prince ValerioBorghese, with him. The prince had been the main organizer of the aborted coupagainst the Italian government, and was a member of Licio Gelli's Masonic P-2society. 34 Between them, they were able to provide professional advice,logistical support, and commandos sufficient to carry out the program of huntingdown all of Pinochet's enemies including, but not limited to, Orlando Letelier.By August of 1975, Townley was in Europe on an assignment from DINA to murderCarlos Altamirano, a Chilean Socialist leader. Delle Chiaie had intervened,saying that Altamirano was too difficult a target, and recommended another enemyof the Chilean junta, Bernardo Leighton. Receiving the green light fromSantiago, Townley arranged for the hit to be carried out. Leighton survived theattack, however, even though he had been seriously wounded. 35Pinochet, Townley, and delle Chiaie would meet again, this time in Madrid, wherePinochet was attending the funeral of colleague andfellow traveler Generalissimo Francisco Franco, the Fascist dictator of Spainsince the days of the Spanish Civil War. 36 Then, in 1976, Townley—with the aidof a group of the ubiquitous anti-Castro Cubans—set the bomb which blew up thecar carrying Orlando Letelier and his assistant, Ronnie Moffit. The car explodedby radio remote control just outside the Chilean Embassy in Washington, D.C., infull view of Letelier's mortal enemies. Eventually, Townley would be apprehendedand would plea bargain his sentence by giving details of his escapades to the USgovernment and turning in the Cubans who helped him carry out the assassination.The resulting revelations enabled the US government to issue an arrest warrantfor Townley's longtime boss, Colonel Manuel Contreras of DINA; a warrant that,predictably, was never honored by the Chilean government. 37The Colony Under SiegeThis century has seen its Waco, its Jonestown. It has survived, limping, itsAuschwitz, its Cambodia. It stares with a kind of numb horror at its Bosnia andSomalia. But there may be yet another conflagration awaiting its last years inColonia Dignidad.Shortly after Letelier's murder, a DINA informant—Juan Rene Muiioz Alarcon, aformer member of the Socialist Party—made a deposition to a human rights groupin Santiago run by the Catholic Church. 38 In that taped statement, heidentified Colonia Dignidad as one of the sites where the \"disappeared\" had beensent in the years following the Pinochet coup.Juan Munoz was stabbed to death shortly after making his deposition.That same year, 1977, reports were published concerning testimony by one SamuelFuenzalida—a former DINA agent—who admitted transporting political prisoners toColonia Dignidad in 1974 and turning them over into the personal custody oiLagtrkommandant SchafiIn 1984, Georg Pakmor and his wife Lotti managed to escape the (Colony.Tragically, their adopted son was lefi behind. They confirmed reports oibeatings, drug injections, and othei brainwashing techniques by Schafer and his medical staff to the West German government. 40According to reports published in the Washington Post on Christmas Day 1987, theWest German government at that time was sending anywhere from $48,000 to $80,000in pensions to Colony members each month. AxThat same year, an American citizen mysteriously \"disappeared\" while hiking nearthe Colony. Boris Weisfeiler was an American who was born in Moscow. Althoughhis body was never found, the Chilean government officially concluded that thehiker had drowned in a river near the Colony. 42In 1988, the Pakmors appeared before a Bonn government subcommittee and gavedetailed testimony about the conditions at the Colony. They testified that youngboys were being given injections in their testicles, and that Schafer wasobserved by them viciously beating a young girl bloody. 43 Testimony fromanother witness—Hugo Baar, a cofounder of the Colony who escaped in1984—referred to the famous Mercedes-Benz limousine, the one that blocked myescape in June of 1979. According to Baar, the limo is bulletproof and heavilyarmed. Occasionally, Schafer is known to loan it to his good friend, GeneralPinochet. 44Obviously, in spite of the rising storm of publicity, nothing was being done tostop Schafer or to close his hideous Colony. Yet, all that began to change in1990 with the establishment of the civilian government of Patricio Aylwin (aformer Allende opponent). On February 1, 1991, President Aylwin ordered therevocation of the Colony's nonprofit charter after an investigation that beganshortly after his inauguration. 45 Unfortunately, Paul Schafer's right-wingfriends in Chilean Congress have been running interference in the courts andthereby prolonging the ugly situation in Parral. 46Germany's former ambassador to Chile, Horst Kullak-Ublick, who was one of thefew people allowed inside the Colony, was interviewed in a Chilean newspaperabout his visit.The people inside the Colony [he said] are simple, industrious people, most ofthem farmers from Bavaria . . . My impression was that they were all hypnotized,under the command of one person, Paul Schafer . . . The answers we received werecompletely monotone, always theAnd, in case there was any doubt, President Aylwin's own commission reportedthat, indeed, the Colony had been used as a DINA torture and detention center.More importantly, the report revealed that the Colony had loaned its own doctorsto the secret police. These doctors spoke only German, and—in a sickening replayof the selection ramps at Auschwitz—listened to recordings of Wagner and Mozartin the torture cells while they \"treated\" the prisoners. 48The government report also revealed that the Colony had served as a conduit forgun-running, the weapons having been smuggled in from Argentina . . . andGermany. This was, of course, during the same period of time that Klaus Barbiewas running guns into Chile from Argentina, Bolivia, and Germany: a circumstancethat is highly suggestive. Put together Barbie, delle Chiaie, theItalo-Argentine P-2 Society, Schwend, Rudel, and Skorzeny, the overthrow ofAllende with the connivance of neo-Nazi groups like Patria y Libertad and theChilean Nazi Party (not to mention the CIA and ITT) and Wolfgang Miiller's sworntestimony concerning Nazis at the Colony, and you can easily come away believingthat Farago was right, after all. In fact, Farago didn't know the half of it.Perhaps the most sobering evaluation of all was given by former Colony leaderHugo Baar who said—in an interview published in Time magazine—\"I fear for thelives of the Dignidad people if it comes to conflict there. I am certain thatshootings cannot be avoided, and I say that out of deep conviction.\" 49Waco in the Andes? A Nazi Jonestown?With the exception of Farago's statement concerning \"voodooism,\" the newsreports are all suspiciously silent about the religious practices conducted atthe Colony. Although Schafer is represented as a schismatic Baptist, nothing issaid of what—if anv—religious services were being held there. That the Colonyleadership is fanatically German and devotedly anti-Communist is a given; but,then, so arc many up-Standing German citizens. That the Colony leadershipproudly supported a right-wing military coup against the constitutionallyelectedSocialist president is also now beyond doubt. That the military juntaitself was blatantly pro-Nazi as was virtually the entire nation duringthe Second World War—is also proven. Why would Sthalei h.ivcpicked Chile as a place to run to once things got hot in Germany, itnot because he knew it was—and largely still is—a Nazi rehige? Why would heallow his premises to host Nazi war criminals—as has been testified by WolfgangMuller, for instance—unless he were in sympathy with the Third Reich? And whatservices did he perform tor the Reich as a young man during the war? From theforegoing, the author feels it is safe to assume that Schafer was not hiding inthe Andes Mountains to practice a particularly devout form of BaptistChristianityThe only other evidence the author has to offer is what he was told bv soldiersof the Chilean Army the night before his visit to the Colony. \"They have theirown religion,\" they assured me. \"They celebrate festivals that are not on theChristian calendar.\" Accepting for a moment that Chile is largely a Catholiccountry and that the practices of a traditional German Baptist might seemstrange or unusual to a soldier of rural background and upbringing, thecelebration of holidays \"not on the Christian calendar\" gives one pause.Christmas, after all, is still December 25 whether or not one is a Catholic or aBaptist. The only possible deviation from that date for a Christian would beRussian Christmas, celebrated by members of the Russian Orthodox Church whostill employ the Julian Calendar. There was nothing remotely Russian Orthodoxabout the Colony, except perhaps for its anti-Communism. (Elements of theRussian Orthodox Church during the war were notoriously pro-Nazi, but that isanother story.)"},{"pageContent":"So, we are left with a bit of a mystery.The soldiers went on to reveal that these celebrations took place at night andinvolved candlelit processions and chanting. At times, great bonfires wereburned. These could either be harmless religious processions such as those theauthor himself was a participant in as a child, or something a bit moresinister. With the Colony's activities over the last thirty years beingrelentlessly revealed in all their revolting glory, one must assume that itsreligious practices were more in keeping with the pagan cult activities of theThird Reich than with the holy day festivities of Sts. Peter and Paul CatholicChurch of Commercial Avenue, South Chicago. Although the author did what hecould to get out of candlelit processions as a boy, he was never able to concocta story about injections in the testicles or demonic clop.II the author's informants were correct, the only reasonable assumption to makeis that the sect practices a form of Teutonic paganism,observing the traditional sabbaths of April 30, August 1, October 31, andJanuary 31 in addition to the solstices and equinoxes. These, of course, are thesame festivals celebrated by the child-snatching, baby-breeding satanic cultscurrently the object of so much attention in the American press; they are alsothe holy days of many other, much more benign, pagan sects including theembarrassingly folksy Wicca phenomenon. As the Colony is known forchild-snatching, child sexual abuse, and weird religious observances, it getsthe author's vote as the only real, verifiable, satanic cult fitting theprofile, a cult from which \"satanic cult survivor syndrome\" is more than today'spsychological fad. Further, it goes some length to represent the fears of Dr. D.Cory-don Hammond, who posited the existence of a satanic cult run by former Nazibrainwashers.In other words, Colonia Dignidad has it all.The Colony has since changed its name from Colonia Dignidad to Villa Baviera(Bavarian Village), 50 an innocuous-sounding title that nevertheless emphasizesits sinister heritage, for we have now come full circle in our study of Nazioccultism: from the elegant Four Seasons Hotel in Munich, Bavaria's capitol, in1919 in the days of the Thule Gesellschaft and their successful overthrow of theCommunist regime to the \"Bavarian Village,\" a concentration camp in modernChile, and its involvement in the successful overthrow of a Socialist president. . . and the fiendish torture and murder of its opponents and the brainwashingof its residents.The murder of Letelier and Moffit; the assassination of President Allende; themilitary coup in Chile; the detention and \"remote control\" torture of politicalprisoners; the training of sadists; the Western Hemisphere's own concentrationcamp; missing children; sexual abuse; more murder; Nazis in the Andes, runningguns, drugs, and escaping justice, keeping their twisted faith alive forFatherland and Race; a monomaniacal cult leader, prepared to take his peopledown with him; brainwashed slave-laborers; soundproofed rooms for rape andtorture; bizarre religious rituals far from the prying eyes ol sot ici\\; doctorstorturing and killing in the service of the State.The many separate strands that make up the fabric ol the late twen tieth centuryare snarled in a tight little knot known as Colonia 1 Kg mtlad.# 13 #Nazi Occultism TodayMyths do not necessarily disappear with the circumstances that first producedthem.

It is more than religion; it is the determination tocreate a new man. 2— Adolf HitlerWe may think that what we have been discussing so far is a mere curiosity of thepast. No one—save for a few crazies, Skinheads, or white supremacists—believesin the authen-ticity of the Protocols of the Elders ofZion anymore, do they? Noone believes in the superiority of a supposedly \"Aryan\" race. There is no moreHolocaust. World War II is over. It only that were so.The world is still in the grip of World War II; in fact, it is still in the gripof World War I. With the collapse of Russian Communism,the map of Eastern Europe is slowly coalescing into the old boundaries. Whatused to be Yugoslavia has now reverted into a melange of independent republicsthat despise each other and still cling to a pre-World War II mind-set. Croatiais beset with rumors of the old, anti-Semitic Ustase coming back to power as oldNazis are rehabilitated for new government posts. 3 And the myth—incredible asit may seem today—of a Jewish-Masonic conspiracy to rule the world is being usedas a rationale for that region's despicable program of \"ethnic cleansing,\"another euphemism (like \"final solution\") for genocide. 4Israel—a creature of World War I—is still not at peace. The Nazis whoorchestrated a continual campaign of warfare and terror after World War II (frombases in Egypt, Syria, and Europe) have given way to Muslim fundamentalists whohave become, if anything, more racist and more superstitious in regard to theJews than the Nazis could have ever hoped for. The Nazis, who had no love forthe Muslims, are now sitting back and hoping that the Arabs and the Jews(Semites all) finish each other off.And what about America?Nazi occultism in America goes back as far as Nazism in America, which is tosay, from the beginning. Its origins and early development are, if anything,more secret and obscure than those of its German manifestation because the NaziParty was considered a subversive movement in the United States and its moreflamboyant leaders (such as Fritz Kuhn) were often hauled in front ofCongressional committees—such as the Dies Committee or the House Un-AmericanActivities Committee—or subject to the resources of individuals andorganizations which were expended in uncovering criminal wrongdoing by membersof the various Nazi and Fascist organizations operating on American soil. InGermany, Nazism was homegrown. In America, it was an imported threat, a foreignpower operating on American soil.Initially, if we look at such organizations as the German American Bund, we findthat American Nazism was fueled by propaganda smug gled in from (Germany via anyone ol .1 dozen sea and land routes. I he /cv/s of Nazism became more importantthan the physical presence of Hitlei et al. since there was no television andair travel between the two countries was not what it is today (even allowing forthe fact thatHitler was the first national leader to use aircraft during an election campaignto visit several cities on the same day). American Nazis hadto relv upon the [Minted word tor virtually all of their information concerningNational Socialism, and the printed word in this ease was rything from MeinKampf and the Protocols to Alfred Rosenberg's Myth of the Twentieth Century.George Viereck—Crowley's former boss—was a natural source for much of thispropaganda, secure as he was in the paid employ of the Third Reich. FatherCoughlin, the infamous anti-Semitic Catholic priest and rabble-rouser fromDetroit, was another source. In fact, in Coughlin we have the somewhat bizarreexample of a Catholic priest promoting Rosenberg's pagan ideology by sellingMyth of the Twentieth Century from his own concession stand in front of hisShrine of the Little Flower, along with a nice selection of swastikas.Naturally, the predicament of American Nazism escalated when the United Statesentered the war in December 1941. From that moment on until about the earlyfifties, the activities of American Nazis—when revealed—were the stuff ofespionage stories and spy fiction. But in the fifties, the ;/^-Nazi movement wasborn (largely as a result of virulent anti-Communism) and several groups took tothe streets. Eventually some of them, such as the American Nazi Party of GeorgeLincoln Rockwell, would become well known. Others, such as the NationalRenaissance Party, would not attain quite the same heights of publicity as theAmerican Nazi Party, but that wasn't for lack of trying.Aside from the purely political, however, many of these organizations eitherformed an inner, occult circle of their own (such as in the National RenaissanceParty) or formed ties to secret cults and weird religions (such as those betweenthe Ku Klux Klan and the NRP, or between Pellev's neo-Nazi Silver Shirtsorganization in the 1930s and the UFO-contactee I AM cult).''From the other direction, that of the cults themselves, some took on openly Nazicharacteristics. The Church of Satan (founded on Walpurgisnacht 1 ( )66)published rituals which were said to be genuine Nazi ceremonies; and the leaderof Church of Satan offshoot Templeot Set made a special pilgrimage to Himmler's occult center, Wewels-burg, to cop some astral rays. The Process Church of the Final Judgment— whichsported a swastika-style emblem and glowing tributes toNazism in issues of its official magazine—boasted a leader who claimed to be thereincarnation of Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels. 8 In this chapter, wewill examine these movements, many of which the author himself has observed fromclose range. If nothing else, they provide evidence that the link between Nazismand the occult is ubiquitous and remains strong after all these years. They alsotell us something important about this \"political\" phenomenon known as Nazism,for why do many cults openly admire and/or emulate Nazism rather than, forinstance, Communism or the Christian Democrats? In the first place, a propos thefamous dictum of Marx, \"religion is the opiate of the people\" and has no placein a scientifically ordered society such as Socialism or Communism attempts tobe. Indeed, the occultism in Russia was all on the side of the \"White\" oranti-Communist forces, a phenomenon of which Rasputin was but a single example.But in the second place cult members understand the link between the essentiallyoccult aspects of the Third Reich and their own magical practices. The followingexamples go a long way toward proving that—even if mainstream historians andpolitical science majors don't agree or understand why—the occultists themselvesrecognize that the Nazi Party in general, and the SS in particular, was a cult .. . just as Hitler and Himmler had intended. Further, it was one of the best runand most efficient cults in the history of the world. Its modern-day devoteescan hardly be blamed for admiring its effectiveness, if nothing else.Modern ThulistsWe have all seen each other somewhere before, and in the same way we will seeeach other again in the next world?HlMMI.I K TO HIS ( iRUPPl M I HKI KS1 )\\( ii \\ir, \\o\\ i MB] r [936Today, the ideals of the Germanenorden y Thule Society, 1 \\s\\ Society, and theOrder of the New Templars are alive and well, ai home and abroad. One modernneo-Nazi party founded in America basedits entire ideology not only on the writings of List, Liebenfels, andSebottendorff but also on Blavatsky and even, to an extent, Aleister C rowkv andAnton LaVey (the founder of the Church of Satan). This was the NationalRenaissance Party of James Madole. His tracts were cleaned-up, modern-dayversions of Ostara, replete with theosophical And occult references whichsupposedly bolstered Madole's anti-Semitic philosophy. His members wore runicarmbands and quasi-Nazi uniforms to rallies, and had extensive links with the KuKlux klan, as the author can attest from personal acquaintance with both Madoleand certain prominent Klansmen, notably Roy Frankhouser (who at one time alsoacted as an FBI informant). James Madole, until the day he died, lived in hismother's apartment in New York City—an apartment he had decorated as acombination of satanic chapel, Hindu ashram, and Nazi Party headquarters.Fascinated with snakes and panthers, there were large brass representations ofthe former with red glass eyes, and a heavy golden pendant of the latter, whichhe hung around his neck in lieu, I suppose, of the Iron Cross, First Class.Madole was a relatively congenial human being in polite company. Completelybald, he bore a scar that he claimed was the result of a brick thrown at him bya demonstrator many years ago, and he had an entourage of young men in a motleyassortment of uniforms who acted as his personal bodyguard, his SA. He possesseda thorough knowledge of the war and was fascinated by stories of the heroismshown by German troops in combat, particularly against the Russian Army. He hada serious junk food habit, downing enormous quantities of ice cream and milkshakes, and grinned (or grimaced?) at inappropriate times.He also brushed away any consideration of the death camps as being irrelevant tothe big picture. While acknowledging that the Jews were murdered in the millions—he was not, at least as I knew him, a Holocaust revisionist—he foundjustification for genocide in his theosophi-al worldview. After all,\" he wouldclaim to his shocked or admiring listeners, if the Jews have souls, they willall be reincarnated anyway, and this time not in Jewish bodies (since we willhave exterminated them all) but in Aryan bodies, as members of the Master Race.If they don't have souls, then they aren't human anyway. So, what's the problem?This, of course, is a slight deviation from the \"Jewish soul\" idea of someearlier Nazi theorists.His vision of the ideal society was a combination of his reading of Plato andBlavatsky. He saw society structured along the lines of the Indian caste systemin a \"pyramid of power\" as he called it, with the common laborers at the bottomholding up the merchants, warriors, and Brahmins in various levels to the top,at which he placed the All-Seeing Eye that is to be found in Masonic designs andon the back of the dollar bill. This was a concept borrowed from Blavatsky byway of Himmler, who found the caste system equally compelling and who identifiedwith the Kshatriya caste, the Warrior Elite.One could say with some justification that the National Renaissance Party wasquite small and hardly a military or a political threat to America or anywhereelse. But the point to be made is that this Party—with its extensivephilosophical framework—exerted an influence over other racist organizationswhich lacked the pseudo-intellectual underpinnings of the NRP. Forging linkswith the Ku Klux Klan, the NRP went on to attempt to bring the Church of Sataninto the fold, an approach that Anton LaVey wisely rebuffed. 10 Madole wasattracted to LaVey's Nietzschean philosophy and crypto-Nazi rituals; butLa-Vey's organization promotes fierce independence as a way of life. The slavishobedience required of a Nazi organization would be repugnant to a genuine,LaVey-style satanist. Madole would die without having made this—to him—importantconnection, and the National Renaissance Party would die with him.In the interim, however, his close association with the Klan enabled him toinfluence those Klan members who were literate enough to appreciate his lengthyprinted discussions on the esoteric background of the Nazi Party and his\"theosophical\" take on racism. When I visited Klansman Roy Frankhouser's\"church\" in Reading, Pennsylvania, the occult influence (on the decor if nothingelse) was striking. A flag-draped altar with a row of human skulls wearingKaiser-era spiked helmets was the least of it. The upstairs room where 1 satwith Irank-houser, waiting for a contingent of Madole's Nazis to arrive as theKlansman melodramatically placed a Lllger on the table between us .is itexpecting violence from vour bantamweight correspondent, was further evidence of the influence <>t ou ultism on the American supremacist movement. Portraits of Nazis and Klan cross burning photos m cheek by jowlwith framed Nordic pagan emblems and runes, and volumes by Blavatsk) weresandwiched in between the obligator] MeinNazi Occultism Today ?>^\\Kampf, biographies of Hitler, Himmler, et. al., and histories of the war.The Ku Klux Klan itself was formally organized around occult principles. AlbertPike, a former general in Robert E. Lee's Confederate Army and chief ofintelligence, was responsible for writing up the constitution of the neworganization at a meeting of Klan leaders in Nashville in 1867. Pike was a Masonof the Scottish Rite and head of us Southern Jurisdiction at the time. He wasalso a disciple of the French occultist Eliphas Levi, who had so much influenceover Blavat-sky's German patron, Marie Gebhard (Chapter One), and whose writingsinspired generations of occultists in America and Europe, including AleisterCrowley, who claimed to be a reincarnation of the French magician. Thus, eventhis the most celebrated of homegrown, American racist societies had its originsamong Freemasons and European ceremonial magicians, and was organized by yetanother spy-turned-mystic.As if to reinforce that link Robert Shelton—as is well known by now—attempted toform an alliance between his United Klans of America organization and LaVey'sChurch of Satan. LaVey refused the compliment, as he did with the NationalRenaissance Party and other neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups. This has notstopped the Klan from forming links with other Satanic groups in America andabroad, however, including occult-oriented biker gangs and, of course, Skinheadclubs.Frankhouser himself was nothing if not a joiner. In his career, he has belongedto the American Nazi Party, the National States Rights Party, the Minutemen, andthe above-mentioned United Klans of America, as well as Madole's NationalRenaissance Party. With over sixty arrests for everything from inciting to riotto disorderly conduct, he was nicknamed \"Riot Roy\" by his fellow Klansmen, butthat didn't stand in the way <>t his gradual assumption of leadership positionswithin the Klan. In 1 ( )6S, he was appointed Gland Dragon in charge ol thePennsylvania \"realm\" and extended his recruiting program into neighboring NewJersey, New York, Maryland, and Delaware.In 1974, he was indicted on explosives charges. He blew his cover as a federalsnitch at th.u time, claiming that he had infiltrated the Black Septemberorganization and had thereby prevented (he assassinations ot Zionist leaders inAmerica; certainly a strange accom-plishment for an avowed Nazi and anti-Semite. Yet—bloodied but unbowed—by 1987he was serving as an \"aide\" to convicted felon, presidential hopeful, and occultconspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche and was convicted himself of obstruction ofjustice in regard to a LaRouche credit card fraud scheme. 11Another modern Thulist is the notorious leader of the White Aryan Resistancemovement, Tom Metzger, whose newsletter stumped for Nordic, neo-Odinist paganismfor years before he was effectively silenced by criminal indictments andlawsuits brought in the wake of the murder of an Ethiopian immigrant in Portlandby Skinheads he had indoctrinated and trained. 12 His syndicated talk show was aforum for all sorts of wild-eyed racist and religious theories, but the lawsuitshave severely hampered his ability to attract new members. The ChristianIdentity movement—which is large now and which continues to grow at an alarmingrate—has picked up the baton. It has abandoned Metzger's overt paganism for afanatical type or \"white\" Christianity founded on anti-Semitism and racism, andacts as a unifying medium for otherwise disparate Klan, neo-Nazi, and Skinheadfactions throughout the Americas and Europe. Given the support enjoyed by theThird Reich among German Lutherans both in America and in Europe, and thesometimes tacit, sometimes overt assistance given to the Nazis by the CatholicChurch and in the person of such sick individuals as Father Coughlin of Detroitand his followers, it is perhaps inevitable that the next phase of Nazioccultism will be an \"initiated\" interpretation of the Old and New Testaments, ala that of Otto Rahn and Karl Wiligut, in which the Jews become descendants andworshipers of a Satanic Jehovah and the mythical, misnomered Aryan Race becomesthe true inheritor of divine right, the \"real\" Chosen People. 13A New Protocol?To (hose historians and sociologists who fed that the paranoid vision of realitypresented as truth in the pages ol the Protocols of the lilders of /.ion wouldnever find a home on modern American soil, one merely has to shift one'sperspective for .i moment and review what istaking place among the African American population today. WhileNazi Occultism Today \\\\^many might disagree with the extreme views expressed by Louis Far-rakhan and hisaides,\" there is still a strong element or suspicion among African-Americanswith regard to white conspiracies against their lives, suspicions that—ofcourse—have some basis in reality. With recent revelations concerning theTuskegee Syphilis Project as well as what we already know about the raceeugenics programs that were in place in over twenty American states in thetwenties and thirties—combined with the long history of slavery, bigotry, andracial brutality in the United States—it is no wonder that rumors concerning awhite conspiracy to kill off the African-American population are commonplace. AsPatricia A. Turner points out in her important study, / Heard It through theGrapevine: Rumor in African-American Culture, these rumors take the form ofbeliefs that various edible commodities—such as Church's Fried Chicken orTropical Fantasy fruit punch—marketed in black communities contain chemicalsdesigned to make black men sterile; or that the FBI (or the KKK, or both) wasresponsible for the Atlanta Child Murders; or that AIDS was created by Americanscientists as a chemical-biological weapon being tested on African and Haitianpopulations; or that whites have been responsible for the drug epidemic amongAmerican blacks as part of a well-planned genocide program that also includesthe above elements. These fears of a widespread conspiracy by the government—agovernment owned and operated by a white majority bent on the destruction of theblack race—or by the Ku Klux Klan (a secret society) in cooperation withelements of the government, are so similar in essence to the tears promulgatedby the Protocols that one can't help but marvel at this little-understood socialphenomenon, and worry about its implications tor the future of American racerelations. In America, anti-Semitism among the black population is an extensionof several hundred years of general white oppression, oppression that can beproven. I here never existed any proof of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy againstanyone, much less of a worldwide conspiracy of Freemasons; by contrast, theenslavement and murder of blacks (and Native Americans) by American and EuropeanWhites is thoroughly documented. I bus, these \"rumors\" among theAtrican-American population have-some basis in reality; and a \"Black\" Protocolswould be a bit more difficult to refute. Natural expressions of outrage,therefore, can be exploited more easily by those vicious elements withinAmerican soci-ety that desire a violent end to the race conflicts that exist in our culture.White America would never be able to promote the idea of a black conspiracyequivalent to the \"Jewish-Masonic\" conspiracy since the African-Americancommunity has so obviously been an underclass in this country for centuries; butit could use the perfectly understandable anxieties of the black populationtoward the intentions of their white neighbors as a means to instigate a racewar from which it believes only the whites would benefit. This was CharlesManson's intent in 1969, and it is a mission that has been adopted by a newgeneration of neo-Nazis (including the occult-oriented Universal Order of formerAmerican Nazi Party member James Mason) today.The occult aspect of the American right is usually ignored (as it is in mosthistories of the Third Reich) since white supremacy is considered largely a lawenforcement or human rights issue here in the States. In telephone conversationwith researchers over at Klanwatch I learned that the cultic aspects of theSkinhead, Klan, and neo-Nazi movements here were not the focus of any particularstudy or concentration by them or by their patrons at the Southern Poverty LawCenter in Montgomery, Alabama. While they acknowledge that initiation rites ofvarious types are employed, this element of the \"white underground\" is usuallyglossed over. Such Skinhead initiation ceremonies as the bringing back of thesevered ear of a victim (as related to me taking place among Skinhead groups inand around Port Arthur, Texas) are treated as footnotes to the larger, socialand criminal, file that is gradually developing around life in the radicalright.Nazis and SatanismThat indefatigable chronicler of serial killers, Dr. Joel Norris, once revealedin an article for Penthouse COWrittcn by Jerry Allen Potter entitled The DevilMade Me Do lt xs that convicted murderer, cannibal, and self-professed satanisiStanley Dean Baker had a swastika tattoocarved Oil his left arm and that his girlfriend had a swastika tattood between her breasts, and that Baker had himself carved swasti kas into thebodies of his ritual vk t mis. I le told investigating officers about hismembership in a Cllil operating in the Santa (in/ Monntains near Los Angeles that combined elements of satanism with Nazi iconography.This was during the time of the Manson trial, and elements within the Bakerinvestigation believed that the Santa Cruz cult was a sister organization of theManson cult, and that both were \"splinters\" of some larger, older society inwhich ritualistic murder with Nazi overtones is a central feature. Thisconcept—that there exists m the land a Nazi-oriented satanic cult—was givenfurther impetus when Charles Manson himself carved a swastika into his ownforehead. Many of his gnomic proclamations include a defense of the Third Reich,and he has blamed America for starting the Second World War (a point of view inline with that of such Nazi apologists as Father Coughlin).Convicted of murder, Stanley Baker served only fourteen years in prison eventhough he had stabbed a man, dismembered him, and devoured his heart. While inprison, Baker began his own satanic cult and also managed to construct a totalof eleven weapons, which were eventually confiscated by prison authorities. Noneof this activity, however, stood in the way of his obtaining parole after onlyfourteen years of incarceration. What is interesting about the Baker case is theearly manifestation of a Nazi/Satanic Weltanschauung in California, and theexistence of a cult—sometimes linked, perhaps erroneously, with the ProcessChurch of the Final Judgment—that practiced human sacrifice and various otheratrocities on kidnapped victims. It has been revelations such as those in theBaker case that have fueled the fears of those who believe in the Satanic CultSurvivor phenomenon.To get a clearer picture of the twilight world where Nazism and Occultism meetin the twentieth century, however, we would do much better to begin with theTemple of Set.The Temple of SetAs mentioned, the Church of Satan was founded on Walpurgis-nacht—that is, April30—1966, the twenty-first anniversary of Hitler's suicide and nine years beforethe fall of Saigon. Much has already been written about the Church and itsflamboyant founder and leader,Anton Szandor LaVey. The basic elements that comprise the Church of Satan may begleaned from any of LaVey's works most of which are still in print, such as TheSatanic Bible and Satanic Rituals. These books, together with the Necronomicon,are often found at cult sites in the United States and have been—rightly orwrongly—featured on various radio and television talk shows on the dangers ofmodern-day satanism.LaVey, however, is hardly your fiendish, blood-sucking, baby-killing satanist.If nothing else, he has been far too public a person. A serious look at what hehas written will illustrate the point that the Church of Satan is basically ahedonistic cult; a kind of Playboy fantasy with horror sound track. That's notto say that some fairly strange activity did not take place at the Church'sheadquarters in San Francisco. It is well known by now that Manson Family memberSusan Atkins was a member of the cult, 16 and that actress Jayne Mansfieldperformed the cult's rituals in her own home the year preceding her tragicdeath. 1 \" It is also known that LaVey acted as technical consultant forPolanski's film, Rosemary's Baby, a story of modern-day satanism in New YorkCity, 18 in which he also played the part of Satan. One can only stand back,slightly dizzy, as the coincidences pile up: for Polanski's wife was, of course,Sharon Tate, who was murdered by the Manson Family of which Susan Atkins (aChurch of Satan member) was a prominent figure. Thus we have, for thoseinterested in Zen semiotics, the wife of the director of this satanic film beingkilled by a minion of Satan who was (however briefly) in the director's ownemploy! Further, Witch high priest Alex Sanders claimed that Ms. Tate had beeninitiated into his version of witchcraft while she was in England on locationfor another film. It is such tight, incestuous little knots in the warp and woofof the American experience that make it easy to sec elements of an occultconspiracy caking place in the culture. 1 hat this \"conspiracy\" may be largelyunconscious and unpremeditated in nature does not necessarily comfort theresearcher; rather, such .1 theory can imply a more pervasive, more insidiousevil.Nazism does figure to some extent m 1 a\\ e\\ \\ philosophy, however, and TheSatanu Bible honors such figures .is Karl riaushofei while Satanic Ritualscontains German occult ceremonies. LaVey's feelings tow.ml Nazi politicalparties, though, are typified by Ins scorn ol apossible Satanic concordat with the National Renaissance Party mentioned above.But when it conies to former Church or Satan member Michael Aquino and hisespousal of Nazi occultism we are on solid ground.Michael Aquino first encountered satanism on a visit to LaVeys Church of Satanafter watching LaVey and his satanic entourage attend the premiere of Rosemary'sBaby in 1968. Aquino became fascinated by LaVey's philosophy and began tocorrespond with him . . . from his post as a US Army intelligence officer andpsychological war-tare expert in Vietnam.In 1970, Aquino found himself stationed in Kentucky, where he began a Church ofSatan grotto and corresponded heavily with members and prospective members ofthe Church. LaVey authorized him to write the Lovecraftian \"Call to Cthulhu\"ritual for use by the Church and, indeed, Lovecrafts idiosyncratic metaphysicshas been exploited more than once by Aquino over the years, which is anotherindication of how the Necronomicon has managed to enjoy cult status among bothsatanists and \"white light\" cultists alike.Aquino eventually obtained a masters degree in political science from theUniversity of California (at Santa Barbara) and ultimately a doctorate from thesame university. Thereafter, he began to report directly to the Joint Chiefs ofStaff as a lieutenant colonel with top-secret clearance. In the meantime,Aquino—tired of LaVey's grandstanding and what he perceived to be the founder'santi-intellectual bias—had split off from the Church of Satan to form his ownorganization based on a personal revelation, the Temple of Set.To Aquino, Set is representative of a certain force in nature that is notnecessarily identical to the Satan with which most Christians believe they arefamiliar. That is, Set is not the personification of m/but <>t ideas inopposition to those of Christianity: a separate, personal theology thattranscends Judeo-Christian metaphysics to include this Dark lord/ Thus, whileChristians may view Set as evil owing to its opposition to their own religion.Set (according to Aquino) is not evil in any objective sense.Aquino took a decidedly intellectual approach to satanism, and issued afifty-page \"required reading\" list, lie reorganized what was essentially aChurch ot Satan command structure and staffed his Circle of Nine with former COSmembers. I lis wife, I.ilith Sinclair of theChurch of Satan's New York grotto, was known to the author during her daysrunning an occult bookstore on West Fourth Street in Manhattan, down the blockfrom his favorite Chinese boutique. Lilith had appeared in various magazinepieces every time Newsweek or Time wanted to run an underresearched story onwitches or devil worship. Tall, with strikingly beautiful ebony black hair andchiseled, fashion-model features, she makes the perfect complement to Aquino'srather more studied Prince of Darkness-in-mufti appearance. Together they haveappeared on television talk shows—such as Oprah Winfrey's— eloquently defendingtheir brand of satanism and excoriating cult murders, ritual child abuse, etcetera with calm reason and studied, logical argument.But then there was that Wewelsburg episode . . .Consistent with Aquino's decision thoroughly to explore the Dark Side of humanexperience is a fascination with Nazi occultism. Aquino believes that he candivorce the occult aspects of the Third Reich from its political, social, andcriminal aspects. To that end he performed the Wewelsburg Working, a magicaloperation in which the occult essence of Wewelsburg—and thus of Himmler's SScult center with all its mystical resonances—is distilled into an engine ofpower that can be used by Aquino to effect a satanic renaissance.He visited Wewelsburg in the early eighties and was duly impressed by Himmler'soccult fantasy, some of which was still intact. On one of his visits heperformed a magical ritual in the North Tower of the castle, a ritual designedto unleash the power of Wewelsburg on the rest of the world: to jump-start thenext phase of human evolution. As Hitler says in the beginning of this chapter,the National Socialist mission was just that, to create a new man; certainlythis theme is to be found all through Nazi writings and speeches from the veryearliest days. But what is wrong with this approach to evolution?Human evolution is Darwin's engine, one Blavaiskv would ride to the end of theline. In a sense. Origin of Species and The Descent ofMan launched the craziness of the twentieth century. Among Christians, you'reeither \"fur u or agin it,\" as if evolution were a [iolnu.il platform. Amongcertain Na/is (and certain Satanists, like Aquino) evolution has io be helpedalong, directed, pushed in the right diition. If the author may he permitted .1 person.il observation, the mistake the Nazis make in this regard is probably quite similar to the ones theCommunists have made with respect to dialectical materialism and history:Communism, according to Marx, is the result oi a natural process. It is a forceof history. If Marx is correct, then we will all one c\\a\\ find ourselves livingin Communist societies because Capitalism will inevitably give way to Socialism,which will then give birth to Communism. From this point of view, the downfallof the Soviet Union is due more to the premature creation of a Communist statein a feudal land in the midst of a Capitalist world than it is to any inherentflaw in Communism itself. Russia went from an agriculturally based societydirectly into a Communist society, which was a violation oi pure Marxist theory.The same problem is evident in the People's Republic of China today, which hasto make accommodations with a tree-market economy in order to survive.The same may be true for evolution. Darwin saw evolution as a force of natureand, in a sense, it is therefore also a force of history. We may be living in anage where the very essence of a human being is undergoing a subtle—perhapspsychic—change. It is said that humans are the only creatures who are consciousof their own inevitable death; that what differentiates us from the rest of theanimal kingdom is the certain knowledge that we will one day die. Perhaps now,after Darwin, we have also become the only creatures who know that they are aprocess, creatures constantly in the state of becoming. There will inevitably bethose of us who, anxious for the next phase and worried that it wont come outthe way we want it, will try to engineer evolution along certain lines that seemsensible to us today but which might spell disaster tor us tomorrow. (It hasbecome a staple of recent stand-up comedy routines, for instance, that if globalwarming proceeds apace only the dark-skinned races will survive, a lack ofpigment being no protection against the suns deadly ultraviolet rays.)Thus, from a purely pragmatic point of view, the Nazi occultists were blind tothe enormous damage they were doing to the human race by limiting its racial—andthus its genetic—options so drastically. Along with the enormous numbers of Jewsthat were killed, virtually the entire Gypsy population oi Europe was alsodestroyed. This loss can never be replaced. Oi course, it is to the credit ofsome contemporary occultists like Aquino that they distance themselves and theirphilosophies as tar .is possible from a defense of genocide or mass murder;the evolution they seek is a purely spiritual one, with no element of Nazieugenics. The author agrees with Aquino's observation that the Third Reich was astate governed on magical principles; that is, after all, the thesis of thisbook. But the author cautions that—worthy as the Nazi phenomenon is ofinvestigation and exegesis—not every magical state merits the emulation of othermagicians. At the risk of sounding preachy, the Third Reich was an occult devicethat blew up in the faces of its creators because of its inherent design flaws;rather than try to build a better bomb, today's magicians might be better servedby understanding its power source and diverting it toward more peaceful (andproductive) uses. Aquino's approach to Nazi occultism is an intellectual one. Asa lieutenant colonel in the army and someone schooled in psychological warfare,who served in that capacity in Vietnam, Aquino's professional reactions to thesimilarities between psychological operations and the techniques both of highmagic and Nazi occultism are understandable. While Aquino does not advocate massmurder, it is simply too easy to identify his interest in—and use of— Nazioccult techniques with a general approval of Nazi atrocities, and this is whathas hurt his reputation in the \"occult community.\"Unfortunately, there are more than enough Nazis in the world today who do notshare Aquino's relatively benign approach to the rites of Satan and Swastika.For instance James Mason's Universal Order—which advertises in the satanicnewsletter The Black Flame: International Forum of the Church of Satan —sports a\"backward spinning\" swastika symbol superimposed on a pair of scales. 19 Thereader may recall that Charles Manson carved a swastika on his forehead, butsince he did so in a mirror the effect was a swastika spinning in reverse fromthe direction he had intended. James Mason (who boasts he joined the AmericanNazi Party at the age of fourteen) retained that particular form of the swastikaeven as he extolled Manson as the next Hitler, and the 'Greatest livingphilosopher of revolution in the world today/' The collected writings ofMason—as well as his thoughts on George Lincoln Rockwell and the National Socialist Liberation Front (an even more lanaiuversion of the American Nazi Party)—is entitled Siege. Advertising blurbs m TheBlack Flame hail it as the \"Mein Kampfoi the 90's\"; adubious distiiu tion to be sure.In the same issue of The Black Flame can be seen another full-page advertisementfor something called the Abraxas Foundation (which can be reached at the samepost office box as Storm Productions, which markets Siege). 20 The logo ofAbraxas is yet another rune, one used in SS-OberKihrer Wiligut's own signature,and its official journal is called Wake. Presented as a publication devoted to''Social Darwinism, Primal Law, Resurgent Atavism, Blood Mysticism\" and more, itpromises that the reader will be instructed on how to integrate the'darkest aspects of man and nature\" in his or her life. The premier issuecontained articles on \"Nature's Eternal Fascism\" and \"Long Live Death.\" Althoughpublication in the Satanic The Black Flame does not imply total acceptance bythe editors of the content of these ads, it is safe to assume that theadvertisers know where their market is.In the same issue, an article by Jeffrey Deboo entitled \"Naziism [sic], Racismand Satanism\" 21 gives the Church of Satan's party line on why Nazism andLaVey-style satanism are basically incompatible. \"Naziism is not Satanic. Racismis not Satanic,\" writes Deboo. \"Anti-Semitism is not Satanic.\" And from astrictly Church of Satan standpoint, this is true. But individuals such as JamesMason and organizations such as the Abraxas Foundation do not follow AntonLaVey's philosophy as much as they may admire that forerunner of modern,\"mainstream\" satanism. And their thoughts, their ideals, are being perpetratedon another generation that can neither remember World War II nor identify itsprinciple players. The new scriptures of international racism and resurgentNazism are being written today not by politicians but by occultists. Not by theinward-looking, Golden Dawn-type of ceremonial magician bent on acquiringKnowledge and Conversation with his/her Holy Guardian Angel, and not by thefolksy, back-to-the Earth, Wicca-style worshiper dancing naked in the forests,kissing trees; but by a peculiar breed of dark magician: occultists who arelittle more than frustrated SS officers yearning for the day when a magicallyoriented totalitarian regime takes the field once more and settles the world'sproblems by the oldest and simplest expedient available, the two-step formula ofexclusion and annihilation. These individuals understand the secret source ofNazisms power, even if academia does not.Death s Head y SkinheadThe leader of a New York OTO lodge once told me, almost in passing, that CaliphGrady McMurtry had initiated several \"skinheads\" he had met in a bar into theOTO. At the time the word meant nothing to me. I assumed \"skinhead\" was thecolloquial term for a young military recruit who typically has been shorn of allhis hair. Therefore, the fact that the biker-jacketed, former army captainMcMurtry would have initiated a bunch of buck privates into the Order in amoment of drunken hubris made perfect sense to me.It was only later that this episode took on a whole new meaning.There is a tremendous amount of ignorance in the United States concerning thefacts of World War II, particularly among the young. In fact, as recentscreenings of Spielberg's Holocaust film, Schindler's List, before minorityaudiences in America's inner cities have shown, there is very little sympathyfor Jews. Black and Latino high-school students from Oakland, California, forinstance, have expressed the opinion that since they grew up with gruesome,technicolor violence all their lives, the type of violence depicted in theblack-and-white Schindler's List seems almost comical by comparison. Indeed,they laughed out loud in the theater (which caused a minor sort of cause celebrefor a while). Experts on the scene, surprisingly, did not condemn this behavioras racist; instead, they saw it as a lamentable result of the general ignoranceamong America's youth concerning anything having to do with Hitler, the ThirdReich, and the Holocaust.\"Certainly, as the author was growing up in the Bronx in the mid-sixties andattending high school there as a history honors student, there was virtually nodiscussion of the Second World War in class. The history texts carried thestory, but it was toward \"the end of the book\" and we never—even in honorshistory—managed to reach thai section o( the text before the year's end. What Iknew about Hitler inthose days was whatever I saw in the movies or on television, plus whatever Ihappened to pick up from relatives who had served in the armed services or fromneighbors who were survivors.This continuing lac Is of education at the secondary-school level contributes in its own wav to the list of the Skinhead phenomenon herein the United States (and probably in Germany as well, where open and frankdiscussion of the Third Reich is understandably an uncomfortable experience,coupled with the fact that many parents and grandparents had somehowparticipated in the Third Reich in some capacity and are either loath to discussit with their children and grandchildren or speak about it in somewhat differentterms than we do here; certainly there are very few Jews left in Germany to setthe record straight). After all, young men are quite probably getting the storyof the Third Reich from those very individuals who have the most to gain bypainting Hitler as a misunderstood genius, and his eugenics programs as modelsof scientific objectivity.A survey by the American Jewish Committee in 1993, for example, revealed that anastounding number of Americans do not believe that mass killings of Jews hadtaken place during the war. The same percentage of Americans could not identifyAuschwitz, Dachau, and Treblinka as concentration camps. 23Another survey, this time by the Anti-Defamation League of B nai Brith in 1992,shows that twenty percent of Americans are still prejudiced against Jews, andthat thirty-one percent of Americans think that Jews have too much power. Butthese percentages decrease sharply in direct relation to the amount of educationreceived, the lowest percentage of anti-Semitism being found among thecollege-educated. 1 'The Skinhead phenomenon itself was born among the poorly educated, economicallystressed lower-income classes of Great Britain. At first, it was only a socialorganization that had no overt racist ideology or character. It was little morethan a club for adolescent sons of white, English workingmen to gather together,drink beer, and listen to a particular, angry form of rock music (called Oi)that was being born in the row-house and public-housing districts of London andLiverpool. The members—in addition to the shaved heads from which they taketheir name—wore heavy, steel-tipped work boots, knit shirts, and suspenders.Some sported tattoos on their hands, arms, or heads. Like many youthful fads, itattracted the disaffected young who were simply looking for acceptance and asurrogate family to replace what was often a miserable home life in the Englishslums.However, as Great Britain's unemployment rates began to climb there was agradual move among the Skinhead groups to blame the economic situation onimmigrant workers (particularly the Pakistanis)who, they believed, were taking their jobs away from them. A punk-rock groupcalling itself White Power became popular among the Skinheads with its overtlyracist and anti-Semitic lyrics. The British National Party—a neo-Nazi,ultra-right-wing, ultra-racist political party in England—began recruitingSkinhead clubs as the shock troops for its own interpretation of civildisobedience and eventually much of the Skinhead movement was transformed froman apolitical street gang to a kind of British Freikorps.In case the point is missed, in a local 1993 election in East London the BritishNational Party managed to elect Derek Beackon—an unemployed truck driver andself-proclaimed racist—to a council seat there, garnering 1480 votes even thoughexperts had put the membership of the National Party at no more than a thousandin the whole country. It was the first time the Party had won any kind ofelection anywhere, and their success was met by a wave of protest and racistviolence throughout East London as police officers and civilians alike werewounded in some of the worst fighting since the Poll Tax riots of 1990. A speechby Conservative MP Winston Churchill—the grandson of the famous wartime primeminister—did not help matters when it included a plea for the cessation ofimmigration to Great Britain in order to preserve the \"traditions of Englishlife.\" 2SRacial attacks have jumped seventy-six percent in^Great Britain since 1988,accounting for nearly eight thousand such incidents in 1992 and about the samein 1991. 26 Although England is largely recognized as the birthplace of theSkinhead movement, it has taken much stronger root in Germany, where Skinheadviolence is more dramatic and widespread. In 1992, over two thousand neo-Naziattacks there resulted in seventeen deaths, including the famous firebomb attackon a Turkish apartment in Molln that claimed the lives of one woman and twoyoung girls. 2 And, to make matters worse, there is an international network ofracists using the Skinhead groups as recruiting platforms all through Europe andAmerica.lor instance in 1991, in the wake of more than two hundred arsonattacks against foreigners in a single two month period in Germany, AmericanKlansman Dennis Mahon paid a visit Do that country toform links with racist groups there. In October of that war he ji ranged atypical Kl.in c toss hurnint; in a forest outside Berlin, attendedby local neo-Nazi Skinheads. 2 That same yeai .i march honoring Ru-dolf Hess was attended by representatives of seven European countries,-'\" andlocal police investigators have evidence pointing to the existence oi a Canadianneo-Nazi Skinhead group operating in Germain/' Further, the Independentnewspaper of Great Britain reported that a training ground outside Vienna wasbeing used for paramilitary exercises by British neo-Nazis.' 1ertainly, the number of former Nazis who wound up serving in Adenauer's postwargovernment was a scandal, and gives the lie to those historians who denigratethe charges that there exists in Germany a Nazi conspiracy on the governmentallevel. Even if we do not count such outspoken neo-Nazis as Franz Schonhuber, forinstance (a former commander of the Waffen-SS who runs the Republican Party ofBavaria), the number of covert Nazis-in-place in Germany and other worldgovernments represents a serious threat to national—and global—peace; perhapsnot today, or even tomorrow, but soon the lack of concern on the part ofcitizens and politicians alike will be shown to have permitted the rebirth of aparticularly virulent form of cult behavior.For instance, as recently as 1993 roughly a hundred German neo-Nazis went on arampage in Aurich armed with clubs and tear gas guns, which they used to attacka leftist youth club there. (The attack was successfully repulsed by police.) 32But the Nazis finally crossed the line when they mailed a letter bomb to themayor of Vienna, who was wounded in the attack which took place on December 5,1993. The mayor, Helmut Zilk, was a Socialist and an outspoken advocate ofminority rights. He was one of six individuals targeted by the same group, andone of five who were injured. The sixth bomb—addressed to a member of theAustrian Green Party—was intercepted by police and defused before it couldexplode. 33A police investigation of the affair revealed the existence of a neo-Nazi hitlist oi some 250 intended victims, ranging from journalists to priests,politicians to social workers/' As the German and Austrian governments becomemore zealous in pursuing neo-Nazi hate groups and prosecuting them for theircrimes, research has revealed that the groups are becoming more sophisticated inthe use of forged identification papers, high-tech explosives, and undergroundguerrilla-type operations including running safe houses all over the Continent.They are supported by well-wishers who perceive a definite threat to theirjobs and income levels from the influx of foreign immigrants to Western Europeafter the collapse of Communism. Afraid that their way of life is under attackfrom refugees from the civil war taking place in former Yugoslavia as well asfrom Rumania and other former Eastern Bloc nations, and including importedTurkish and Asian labor, they offer clandestine support to those willing tocarry out acts of terrorism that, they hope, will scare the newcomers back East.(A similar movement in South Africa—the Afrikaner Resistance Movement—is anopenly neo-Nazi group agitating for the creation of a \"volkstaat,\" or \"People'sState,\" an all-white enclave in the predominantly black republic.) 35In the United States, the neo-Nazi movement has also attracted attention becauseof its potential for violence. The Silent Brotherhood, for example, is run by aneo-Nazi who gives the official name of his organization in German as BriiderSchweigen. Groups such as the Silent Brotherhood, the Aryan Brotherhood, theAryan Nation, the Aryan Resistance Movement, the White American RevolutionaryArmy, the White Aryan Resistance, Robert Miles's Mountain Church of JesusChrist, and something called the Church of Jesus Christ Christian have all beenimplicated in various felonies throughout the South and West, including armoredcar robberies, counterfeiting, and assassinations. The murder of Denver radiotalk show host Alan Berg on June 18, 1984, by The Order is one example of thelengths to which these groups will go. 36The Order is perhaps one of the most secretive, and yet most violent, of thesegroups. Patterning itself on an identically named organization in the famousracist novel, The Turner Diaries, The Order was also responsible for the largestarmored-car robbery in US history. Taking place in Ukiah, California on July 18,1984 (exactly a month after the murder of Berg), the heist netted The Order aStaggering $3.6 million. The Order's founder and leader, Bob Mathews, intendedto use some ol that monev to purchase sophisticated laser weapons thatwould allow him to knock out the 1 os Angeles power grid (once again,this was a plot element in The Turner Diaries). Eventually Hie Orderwas routed and its members either killed in fireliglu.s 01 Serving timein federal prisons; hut not before some ol the money they managed tosteal wound lip spread around in tin coflfers ol \\anous othei rightwin roups.According to one informant who cold the story to former Ordermember Thomas Martinez, The Order was receiving contributions from German\"families\" living in South America. 38 This German Nazi-South AmericanNazi-North American Nazi link is reinforced by stories that German neo-Naziterrorist Manfred Roeder, lor instance, met with Dr. Mengele in Brazil as lateas 1978 before coming to the States and meeting with American neo-Nazi groups.Roeder was eventually convicted of the 1980 firebombing of a Vietnamese shelterin Hamburg, Germany, which killed two of the boat people.The fact that Mathews's organization is called The Order is very revealing. Theonly other \"Orders\" in contemporary racist history are, of course, vonLiebenfels's Order of the New Templars and Himmler's own Schwarze Ordtni, theBlack Order or SS. It should come as no surprise that Hitler himself saw thevalue in such homegrown American racist cults, for he once sent Kurt Llidecke—aprominent businessman and member of the intimate circle around Hitler beforewinding up in Oranienberg concentration camp—on a special mission to America tovisit the Imperial Wizard of the Invisible Empire of the Ku Klux Klan, HiramEvans, to form an alliance between the Nazi Party and the Klan.Many of these groups have informal links with each other and through somethingcalled the Christian Identity movement, which claims that the US Government isbeing run by Jews, and that Jews are the sons of Satan and must be exterminated;in this tortuous theory (eerily familiar to students of Nazi ideology), the\"rear' Lost Tribes of Israel are the Aryans and the Jews are merely descendantsof Cain. Like such SS theorists before them as Rahn, Wiligut, Dane, Rosenberg elaL they have reinterpreted Christianity to the extent that Up is down, white isblack, and good is evil. The Lord of the Jews thus becomes Satan, even thoughthey may secretly believe that their own god is a white warrior-demon, alight-bearing spirit known as Lucifer. Cynically, these \"ministers\" of theanti-Semitic \"churches\" preach an un-recognizable Christianity with one voice and instigate pogroms andassassinations with another. In the absence of a real grass-roots pagan movementin America, they have adopted the trappings of fundamentalist Christianity astheir mythic vehicle. But it is a secret, occultChristianity th.u they represent, for they are only the modem inanities-tations of the original Ku Klux Klan which met at night in the woods, dressed inhooded white robes, burning crosses, and swearing oaths in Masonic-styleinitiation ceremonies. One cannot imagine the same rituals taking place betweenFidel Castro and Che Guevara; it is a typically right-wing phenomenon, and itspolitical overtones are almost universally racist, supremacist, andtotalitarian. The Christian Identity movement is itself probably an attempt tocreate a \"white\" fundamentalist Christianity as distinct from the \"black\"Southern Baptist and Pentecostal denominations. By putting a different spin onthe Old Testament and the Chosen People, the Christian Identity \"ministers\" hopeto exclude not only Jews from the New World Order, but also all other races,with their unevolved, \"polluted\" form of Christianity.The occult—if only in its outward trappings of elaborate, candlelit ceremoniesin the night accompanied by terrifying oaths sworn on the skull and bones—is anintegral part of these organizations; it's the glue that holds them together andwhich helps to create the sense of family, of a union based on blood, that is soessential to the functioning of these groups.The ranks of these fledgling Nazi organizations are filled with young menlooking for surrogate families in a social pattern that is very similar to theone that can be found among those who join cults and secret societies. Jim Jonesand David Koresh (leaders of similarly Christian cults which are far morepopular here among the right-wing than openly pagan cults, which are usuallyseen as representative of hippie-style countercultural revolt) both operated onthe basis of what was known in the Third Reich as the Fiihrerprinzip or \"Fiihrerprinciple\": that the leader must be obeyed blindly in all things. Although oneis accustomed to hearing the term Fiihrer applied to Adolf Hitler, the word wasactually used in a wide variety oi titles and ranks oi social and militaryresponsibility within the Reich. The SS ranks, lor instance, .ill had the word\"Ftihrer\" attached to them, such as Obersttirm-ftihrer otStandartenfilhrerotGruppenfiihrer, Thus, a pyramid oi powei was developed whereby each rank owedabsolute allegiance and obedi encc to the rank above, culminating (oi course) inthe supreme leader and Fiihrer oi all Germany, Hitler himself. Since this systemmeant that individuals had no real independence oi thought oi action, u alsoimplied that individuals were not separately culpable (<>i an) acts thejmight commit. \"1 was only following orders\" became the cliched response erf thewar criminal when confronted with the hideousness ofhis crimes and, indeed, within the context of the luhrer principle it was aperfectly logical (it morally reprehensible) response. In German, it was calledbefehlnotstand, and as such was an integral part of the Fiihrerprinzip.Once individual action is proscribed, individual responsibility (within thecontext ot the cult) also ceases to exist. That is why any such group is to befeared, from neo-Nazi Skinhead gangs to David koresh-stvle religious cults. Theyare virtually identical in social function. Their members are isolated fromsociety in a tight circle of fellow \"true believers\"; thus paranoia becomes aninstrument of the Ftihrer, who uses it to instill a sharp sense of camaraderieamong his followers and a deep suspicion of anything coming from the outsideworld. This leads inevitably to the stockpiling of weapons and to preparationsfor a \"day of judgment, a Holocaust that will cleanse the earth of thenonbeliever, the Semite, the subhuman. The conspiracy theory of world governmentis a necessary element of both the neo-Nazi organization (which sees the worldas being run by a Zionist cabal, called ZOG or \"Zionist Occupation Government\" ala the Protocols) and the fanatic religious cult (which understands the world tobe in the grip of Satan and his followers). Like James Jesus Angleton of theCIA, hunting for the Soviet mole he could not see but \"knew\" was there allalong, these cult leaders insist that the invisible conspiracy—an invisiblegovernment—is very real, and very dangerous. And matters are only made worsewhen otir governments are caught in the act of concealment and conspiracythemselves, thus giving weight to the arguments of the cults that the wholeworld—governments, schools, churches, social institutions, the arts, thesciences, even reality itself— -is the result of a spiritual/politicalconspiracy to destroy humanity in thecourse of some xatank mission to rule the globe and populate it with demons.( heap air travel and the information superhighway (elements of which arealready m place) are making it easier for these cults to communicate with eachother and to influence each other. German Skinheads are training m Croatia;Canadian Skinheads are training inGermany; American (Clansmen are burning crosses in Berlin; TomMeTZger had his own cable television show; and white supremacistsroutinely advertise and recruit through computer bulletin-board systems that areaccessible by anyone in the world with a telephone and a modem.One of the nations with the largest OTO affiliation anywhere was, at least untila few years ago, Yugoslavia. The author does not have reliable data on thepresent status of these lodges. Either the Thele-mites have taken up arms tocontribute to the genocidal free-for-all ... or, more likely, they are nowrunning for their lives while being hunted by a new incarnation of Himmler's SS.That would be ironic, of course, for Dr. Rudolf Steiner—the founder ofAnthroposophy and a former OTO leader himself—was born in the town of Kraljevecjust outside Zagreb in what is now Croatia.SummaryIf, after all the arguments given in the preceding pages, we still have aproblem regarding Hitler as a cult leader (and the Nazi Party as a cult) that isprobably because he was more successful than most. Shrewder, more pragmatic, andmore charismatic than most other cult leaders, he also came along at the righttime for a Germany that was suffering humiliation after its military defeat inWorld War I, a severe economic depression, and the annexation of its territoriesby neighboring countries. In a sense, the siege mentality so indicative of cultlife was already in place by the time Hitler arrived on the scene promising aheaven on earth to those willing to die for the cause. In the end, the onlytroops he trusted (particularly after the July 1944 assassination attempt) werethe black-clad officers of Himmler's SS, the elite Order that had been designedalong purely pagan—and anti-Christian, anti-Jewish—lines, a cult priesthoodwhose headquarters at Wewelsburg was outfitted like a Nietzschean Camelot toreceive the Aryan Holy (irail.Should the West lose complete faith in its politicians, and in itspolitical and judicial processes, and should the economy slide back I towardcoll. ipse, then this pathetic handful ol cults abroad in the laud will surelygive birth to a new Messiah and Americans many <>iwhom don't believe (he I lolocaUSl ever took place even if they doknow what it was—will embrace a cult leader the likes of which we have neverseen. The coming chiliastic panic that is almost sure to set in with the turn ofthe century will give rise to apocalyptic cults promising salvation at theexpense of the rest of humanity: a selt-selection process involving the Chosenand the Not-Chosen. Racial hatreds will be manipulated and exploited by allsides in this conflict because, in the end, it will be easier to discriminateagainst someone on the basis of something obvious, like skin color, than it willbe on the basis of one's personal philosophy, political affiliation, orreligious denomination. In this war, one's skin becomes one's uniform, anddefection is not possible. There will be no more open discussion of ideas,because ideas will be suspect. Reading will become the privileged occupation ofa handful of cult leaders who, like the priests and bishops of the Middle Ages,will edit and interpret the meanings of texts for the benefit of a functionallyilliterate congregation. Signs and omens will foretell the coming of a New Man,a Divine Leader, a Messiah who must be obeyed if destruction on a massive scaleis to be averted. And the people—confused, embittered, hungry, fearful—will bowtheir heads and accept the inevitable. They will trade in their freedoms foreverfor the promise of security today.And Hell will be full of secret delight once more.Epilogue: Hasta La Vista, BabyMy driver squeezed shut his eyes. His knuckles were white as he gripped thesteering wheel like a life preserver. He faced forward, even when beingquestioned by the men who crowded around his side of the car, peering throughthe windows into the backseat looking for an Israeli kidnap team a la Eichmann.\"How many of them are there?\" they asked.\"When did they arrive?\"\"Where are they staying?\"To all of these questions my driver could barely open his mouth to reply.They tried a more soothing tone next.\"Listen, we have to be careful, you know. These Israelis have diabolicintentions towards us.\" That was the word they used: \"diabolic.\"In the meantime a youngish man in an old-fashioned blue lab coat knocked on thewindow on my side of the car. I rolled it down.And he spoke that phrase that every true aficionado of the war movie and the spyflick longs to hear in real life, but knows he never will. There, in thefoothills of the Andes Mountains, with a white Mercedes-Ben/ limousine blockingmy escape through a remote eon trolled gate and with burly security men—old men,with the mark ol war and brutality on their faces like the sign ol Cain-covering c\\er\\angle ol escape, I heard it in .1 thick, German accent. \"Your papers, please.\"I handed my p.issport through the open car window, knowing lullwell it was .1 dangerous thing to do hut not knowing how to avoid it. [ftheywanted to, they could certainly have managed 10 drag me fromthe car, and that would have been the end of it. My passport was passed back tosonic people in the reception building—it that is what it was—and 1 didn't seeit again for about a half-hour. At the time, 1 had no idea what they were doingwith it and assumed they might have been making a photocopy or were examining itto see if it was genuine.The young doctor, if that is what he was, began to ask me questions, hirst inGerman, then in Spanish. I decided I did not want to dicker tor my lite in aforeign tongue, so pretended no knowledge of either language. Finally, the manbegan to speak to me in fairly good English but with that accent that, toAmericans, sounds so comical in war movies. But before he began questioning,Paul Schafer arrived and positioned himself at the rear of my car, where I couldnot, at first, see him. He asked the questions, in German, and the doctortranslated them into English—and my answers into German.\"Why are you here?\"I used the story I had come up with on the bus ride down. It wasn't very good.\"I am studying German emigration to South America.\"The high-pitched bark of a laugh Schafer gave that admittedly lame excuse wasstraight out of the same war movie as \"Your papers, pica-Then they demanded the film from my camera.I was loath to give that up, but again there was little I could do. I removed itfrom the camera, handing it through the window of the still-locked ear door tothe young doctor. It had photographs of the reception area, the gate, and thetown of Parral.As 1 tumbled with the camera I managed to turn to the side and glance out therear window. There I saw a man dressed in a brown uniform with no flashes orother identification that I could see. He was portly, and appeared to be baldwith a head shaped like an artillery shell. He wore a sott campaign-style capand a Sam Browne belt that diagonally crossed his ample (lame. Basically, helooked like a militarized faster egg. I tried to get a glimpse ot a holster, butSchafer kept strutting back and forth, pacing behind the car as his security menwere inspecting it from all angles and even going so tar as kicking the tires.It was a standoff, and I didn't know why. Certainly my driver thought I was donefor, as I discovered later. On the way up to the place I had asked him quitebluntly if the Colony was in any way a \"Nazi\" community, or if Nazis were knownto live or visit there. As the guardians of Colonia Dignidad descended on thebeat-up Chevrolet, I wished I had kept my mouth shut. The driver had volunteeredthat, indeed, everyone knew it was an estancia nacista. I replayed ourconversation back in my mind at fast-forward and almost winced when I rememberedI had asked him about Bormann.And about Mengele.Few people knew it at the time—and I certainly wasn't one of them—but Mengelehad died earlier that year in Brazil. Everyone in Parral knew Mengele's name, ofcourse, but my driver could not confirm any rumors that he had been there. But\"many, many Nazis\" had visited the Colony over the years and Bormann was onename that few men dared to whisper, even on the pitch-dark evenings of a Chileanwinter. Even to their friends.Finally, my passport was handed back to me. For some mysterious reason, they hadsuddenly decided to let us go. We had been held there for about three-quartersof an hour or longer.The gate swung open electronically and the white Mercedes vanished. Schaferdisappeared. Many of the other men blended back into the landscape, and I waswarned to return to Santiago immediately and to leave the country at once. I wasnot welcome in Parral, and Chile could easily become a hostile environment.It had taken us about an hour to make the twenty-five-mile drive lip the dirtroad to the Colony from the Pan American I [ighway that morning.It took us twenty minutes to make it hack.We swerved around oxen in the road, children playing, huasoi on horseback . . .all at an alarming speed. My driver was so relieved we had gotten nut alive hewas laughing and sobbing. u \\Que milagro\"Yit veiled, .md banged on the dashboardfor emphasis. What a miracle. The gringo was still alive.When we arrived at the town, the driver dropped me at the square from where wehad left less than three hours earlier. I paid him, and tipped him heavily. Itwas only another hour or so until my bus would arrive and take me back toSantiago, so I decided to wait around the central square still shaken by whathad happened and angry as hell thai I had lost my film containing the only knownshots of Colonia Dignidad kk in captivity.\"A moment later, two more soldiers walked up to me. This was a different pairfrom the two I had met with Senor Molinas that morning.\"(Sefwr Levenda?\"I swallowed. They knew my name.They asked to see my passport. They passed it between themselves, stared at myphoto, then at me, then carefully wrote down my name and passport number incolored ink in their notebooks. Then they started to ask me about my trip.\"You are the one who went to visit La Colonia.\"I nodded, my mouth dry. I could only imagine I was being arrested.It seemed the whole town knew where I had gone and what had happened. Thesoldiers certainly knew all about it and, from the direction they had come andthe amount of time elapsed, I knew they hadn't yet had a chance to talk to mydriver. They must have been reached by radio from the Colony. That meant thatthe Colony had its own communications procedures with the army. The implicationswere unnerving.\"What happened?\"\"Were they armed?\"\"Did they take you inside?\"\"How did you get out?I answered them as best I could. Were they armed? Yes, sure they were armed, butthey didn't brandish their weapons openly. They didn't have to. And the heftybulges in their jackets and coals along with suggestive pattingS after theartless fashion of hoods everywhere told the story quite eloquently.Once I had answered their questions to their satisfaction, they gave me much thesame advice as had the ( icrmans.\"Leave Parral on the next bus.\" No problem.\"And you had better leave Chile, too. You are a very lucky man.\"Sometime later my bus arrived, and I boarded it gratefully. It was a bitcrowded, but I found an aisle seat toward the rear and settled in for theroughly 250-mile return trip to Santiago.Then, every fifty miles or so, the bus could come to a stop in the middle of thehighway. The doors would open, and soldiers would come on board. These were notthe same, dusty, down-home troops I had chatted with, and drunk moonshine with,in Parral. These men were smartly turned out with cold stares and automaticweapons. They would confer briefly with the driver, who would gesture toward myseat. One of the soldiers would walk down the aisle toward me and ask to see mypassport. I would get a long, hard look, and then they would leave and the buswould be allowed to continue along its way.This happened about four times. On the last two occasions it was enough for thesoldiers to stop the bus, talk to the driver, give me the \"look,\" and nod.But every one of them, at every stop, knew my name.When I arrived back at the Grand Palace Hotel I found a note waiting for me. Iwas confirmed on the next flight out of Santiago for the United States, leavingthe following day. The message could not have been clearer. I was unofficiallybeing declared persona non grata by the Pinochet regime because I had had thetemerity to stand in the parking lot of Colonia Dignidad and take pictures ofthe reception building. For this, I was graced with military roadblocks all theway back to the capital and a seat on the next flight out of the country. And itwouldn't stop there.For the next eighteen hours until my flight I could not shake the bearded man.He seemed to be everywhere I was, and was frequently there ahead of me. He wasstanding nonchalantly outside the Grand Palace I lotd when I went downstairs lora last, long look at Santiago. He was in the German restaurant that eveningwhere I brazenly went to order my last meal, sitting at a lout; table when Iwent in, mii rounded by what appeared to he students from the University. When Iwalked to my table, they stopped speaking and wen- silent until Ihad placed my order. I could feel their stares like cold raindrops on ni\\' skin.A fan hours later, as I walked along 1 luerfanos on my way back to the hotel,the bearded man was once again ahead of me. Just standing there.And when my taxi arrived to pick me up the next morning, he was Standing acrossthe street. This time, he was openly staring at me from that glowed like twobrass cartridges.1 le was such a conspicuous figure that I can only assume that I was meant tonotice him and to take his presence as a kind of warning. But I had seen himseveral times before my trip to Colonia Dignidad. Mow had he known what I was upto? So few people back in New York knew w here I was going, or when. I went overa mental list of people who would have been in a position to notify elements ofthe Chilean security police—DINA—as to my itinerary. I could count them on thefingers of one hand, and still have spares.One was a Chileno who was a victim of Pinochet's regime. Conceivably he couldhave betrayed me to DINA, but only if they had something to hold over him.Family, maybe a wife, back in Chile whose life would be in danger unless hecooperated with them. But I knew—or, at any rate, thought I knew—that this wasnot the case.And then there was an occultist.Suddenly the pieces began to fall into place. The occultist was a member of a\"satanic\" cult in New York with ties to Brazil and Argentina. It was entirelypossible that this person secretly disapproved of my venture to Chile, and tookthe opportunity to notify cult members of my trip. My opposition to Fascism andtotalitarianism was well known in occult circles in the United States, and I hadappeared on radio and television talk shows debating Nazis, Klansmen, andSaian-ists iof the Church of Satan variety). The bearded man, therefore, wasquite possible not connected with DINA at all but with this cult that boasted somany South American connections. They had even produced a Spanish-languageversion of Crowley's Book of the Law although they were not pan of GradyMcMurtrys O.T.O.()n the plane back, the seriousness of my predicament finally hit me. All theanxiety that 1 had not allowed myself to feel during my capture by the Nazis ofParral, the army roadblocks, and the conspicu-ous tail by the bearded man, descended upon me like an anvil. I spent most ofthe trip to Miami in the plane's rest room, vomiting.When I arrived in Miami and passed through Customs and Immigration procedures,the last installment of my adventure then took place. As I came through the linewith my luggage, preparing to re-check it for a flight to New York, three men insuits left their position by the opposite wall and approached me. One of the menflipped open an identification wallet and closed it again rapidly, too rapidlyfor me to make out what agency he represented. But he was from my owngovernment.\"May I see your passport, please?\"Once again, I proferred my very popular documents to yet another governmentrepresentative. At least, I thought, this time it was United States officials.Certainly, I had nothing to fear from them?They stood around me for a moment, framing me in a kind of mis-en-scene. Ithought I detected a smile, but it could have been a sneer. Without explanationthey returned my passport to me, thanked me, and allowed me to pass on my way.When I looked back, they were no longer there.Sitting in the lounge, waiting for my flight to be called, and finally wonderingwhy I had been stopped by those three men, I picked up a copy of the Miaminewspaper. And nearly dropped it.There, as a banner headline, was the reason I had been allowed to leave ColoniaDignidad alive: Germans extend statute of limitations ON WAR CRIMES.I scanned the article quickly as if it were a telegram addressed directly to me.It said that the West German government, meeting in Bonn, had voted to extendthe statute of limitations on Nazi war crimes. The statute had been due toexpire that month. What the vote meant was that the German government couldcontinue to hunt down the monsters who created, aided, and abetted theatrocities of the Third Reich . . . forever. It meant that whoever was hidingout atColonia Dignidad would never be safe.I had probably stumbled into their domain as the vote was being counted. Theyperceived my presence there .is a device intended toprovoke ihem into some kind of action that would Swing the volenst them. Eithei diat, or they assumed thai I was there to negisteitheir reaction in sonic way; or as the advance guard ot a new contingent ofIsraeli commandos (which was, indeed, what they had suggested to my driver). Inany of these cases, it would not have been prudent to drag me from the car andshoot me. Instead, they allowed me to escape unharmed. It was a tacticaldecision, and it saved my life. 1 lad 1 turned up a day later—after the outcomeof the vote was made public—I have no doubt I would have been enlisted in theranks ot the \"disappeared,\" tortured and murdered by the men of ColoniaDignidad.A month later, in August of 1979, Jack Anderson's column published a story aboutColonia Dignidad. It included references to secret CIA testimony before Congressand to Amnesty International reports on human-rights abuses taking place there.It spoke a little of the torture that was a main feature of the Colony; itmentioned that the (lolony had been used as an interrogation center for DINA,the Chilean secret police, where technocrats were trained in the black arts oftorture and for the first time I realized just what I had escaped from.Two weeks later I was fired from my job with a large, multinational corporationthat did a lot of business with the Chilean military (and the armies ofvirtually every free-world dictatorship).A week after that, and I was followed down a Brooklyn street at six in themorning by a taxi full of bald-headed, beefy thugs—perfect strangers—shoutinganti-Semitic epithets at me.A few days later, and I was approached by a strange man in the Astoria sectionof Queens. Sporting a straw hat and dressed in a white suit with an impossiblered carnation in his lapel (he reminded me somehow of the Peter Loire characterin (lasablanca), he tugged at my arm and whispered to me in an accent I couldnot place: Don't worn. You are among friends here.\"Before 1 could ask him what he meant, he walked away with a smile dnd dissolvedinto the streetscape.In the months immediately following my return, I made several overtures tovarious agencies and media in an attempt to tell not only Diy personal story hutto warn interested parties th.it there was more .it stake in pursuing Nazis inhiding than revenge for what happened at the death Camps. It was my contentionthat the Na/i undergroundposed a serious threat to peace, particularly in South America, and that worldgovernments should ardently hunt these war criminals, sadists, and butchers tothe ends of the earth for national-security reasons if nothing else. I told mystory to Jack Anderson's people by phone, and to Simon Wiesenthal's people, andto members of various Jewish groups of my acquaintance. I was met with politeattention . . . and reluctance to become involved in that particular spin on theNazi war-criminal story. The involvement of Colonia Dignidad in the Pinochetregime was well known; the CIA had reported as much to Congress. AmnestyInternational was compiling horror stories of torture and sexual abuse. But thefull details of Klaus Barbie's reign of terror in Bolivia were not yet revealed;and Farago's book was still being laughed off the shelves. There was simply nointerest in the story of a single man (possessing no journalistic credentialswhatsoever) who had visited Colonia Dignidad in search of a story about \"Nazivoo-dooism.\"And then the fall of Communism, the rise of the Skinhead phenomenon, elevatedlevels of racial violence in American streets, revelations concerning the ritesof human sacrifice at Matamoros, the Branch-Davidian massacre at Waco, and\"ethnic cleansing\" in Bosnia, all contributed to a growing sense that somethingis terribly wrong out there; that perhaps the ghoulish specter of the ThirdReich had not been put to rest after all, and that it takes more than bulletsand B-movies to exorcise a demon.And I hauled out my notes, and refreshed my memories, and decided to write thisbook.We have seen how some occultists—what Aleister Crowley would have called\"Brothers of the Left Hand Path\"—were responsible for creating a peculiar moralenvironment from which the bizarre religious, racial, and political theories ofthe Third Reich germinated. We have also seen how the notorious Protocols of theElders of Zion was introduced to the Western world by a Theosophist when it wasalready on the verge of being discredited in Russia. Indeed, both directly andindirectly, that fabulous creation of Madame Blavatsky her I heo BophicalSociety—can be (bund at the root of virtually all ol the occultsoeieties that gave use to the Thule ( .esellsc halt and, eventually, CO theThird Reich itself. This influence w.is preserved among those contentporary neo-Nazi cults—such as the National Renaissance Party— whose leadersunderstood the tremendous impact Theosophical thought exerted on the ListSociety, the Order of the New Templars, the Golden Dawn, and (eventually) on thepolitical platforms of the Nazi Party. Racial theory including the superiorityof the Aryan ra^e/ the supreme significance of the swastika and other runicemblems, the universal application of an initiated interpretation of worldmyths, and a ^scientific\" approach to religion ... all of this can be tracedback to Theosophy. Certainly, eugenics programs were in place in the UnitedStates that proved to be the model for the German variety; Lebensraum tacticshad been used by the United States against the Native American population forcenturies; and racial laws forbidding marriage between blacks and whites were inplace all through the American South. But in Nazi Germany, these programs weregiven a certain, moral foundation in the writings of the Nazi \"Church fathers\":List, von Liebenfels, Darre, Rosenberg, and in the speeches of Hess, Himmler,and Hitler himself. What were vicious little social programs of dubiousscientific value in the United States became elevated to the level of literallycosmic importance in Nazi Germany. No dissent was permitted; no discussion orargument tolerated. And those who did disagree were exiled, tortured, murderedby the State.This was not simply totalitarianism at work. The wholesale slaughter of the Jewsand other \"subhuman races\" was of virtually no political or economic value tothe Third Reich. On the contrary, the Holocaust was an expensive and extremelyproblematic program. Vital resources were diverted from the war effort to thepursuit and execution of isolated, powerless groups of people who posed no realthreat to the State. Human resources as well as valuable raw materials werewasted in the design, creation, and maintenance of the death camps. I here wasno earthly reason for all this. It was not logical, not pragmatic. I heHolocaust could only be considered of value in a strictly metaphysical sense tothe Nazis: they actually believed they were engaged in a spiritual struggle oftruly divine proportions, that the Jews were the children of Satan—a subhumanspecies that, through its demonic collaboration with Freemasons and Communists,was intent on destroying the world and delivering its ashes to their Lord andMaster, the lather of Lies.To fight these insidious demoniacs, the Nazis created a secret society of theirown. Borrowing the \"skull and crossbones\" motif from the Freemasons and dressingin black uniforms, initiated in candlelit ceremonies in awesome arenas, wearinga ring inscribed with magical runes, these sorcerers of the Right preparedthemselves for battle with the Eternal Enemy of the Left. This was not politics.This was not economics. The SS was a cult, and its high priest was a man whobelieved himself to be in telepathic communication with the spirit of a Saxonking; a man who destroyed the lives of over a thousand concentration campprisoners in the creation of his Grail center at Wewelsburg; the same man whocreated the Einsatzgruppen, the roving bands of SS men who hunted down Jews andcommissars with equal ferocity and fed them to the crematoria; the same man whogleefully ordered \"scientific\" experimentation on living human subjects in thedeath camps.This enormity was too great to simply disappear at war's end. He hadindoctrinated his people all too well. They were the initiates of an elitesecret society and would not trade in their beliefs, their cherished ideals, fora green card or a farm in Bolivia. They possessed \"secret knowledge\"incomprehensible to the profane, to the noninitiate, and jealously guarded thisknowledge to their dying days, passing it on to select members of the Aryan Raceso that the flame would never be extinguished.The flame, that is, of a particular Hell.From a purely philosophical point of view the Nazis' reluctance to simplyjettison Christianity altogether is compelling. They could not just ignore theChurch and go on about their pagan business. I'hev had to demonize the Church toa large extent: they had to identify it as the Enemy. One cannot help but wonderif this was not due to a deep sense of betrayal; that in their hour of need theGerman people looked to the Catholic Church (or to the Lutheran ministries, orto any of the other Protestant denominations) for succor and (bund its spiritualstrength—its moral courage- wanting. The ambivalence of the Nazi \"churchfathers\" to the ( atholU (Ihurch in panic ul.tr is strik ing: they wanted torenin something of value from their childhood idea of (Christianity (for vonLiebenfels, lor instance, it was the exten sive liturgical calendar, tinpageantry, the hyperorganized and ritualized lifestyle, the myth of the Grail and the Knights Templar), but they wantedto throw out Canon Law, the Papacy, and Christian moral values. They wanted torediscover the Cathar tradition as they understood it: a kind of proto-Christianpaganism; a Cnostic, illuminated version of Christianity, perhaps, but withoutthe strict moral code that the Cathars were known to adhere to. The Nazis sensedthat there was something wrong, something dark, at the heart of Christianity—aLie—and the reaction of the Catholic Church itself is telling for, in itssilence and in its meek acquiescence to the evils being perpetrated by theNazis, it betrayed a shocking sense of doubt in its own institutions. Catholicbishops openly assisted the Nazi hierarchy. C atholic monks took part in theHolocaust. And, when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, Pius XII applauded.Were the Nazis somehow blackmailing the Church with evidence of some monstrouscrime that has never come to light {did the Nazis find the Templar treasure?were they in possession of the Grail?), or was the Church's notorious lack ofconviction during World War II somehow evidence that the Church itself had lostits own faith?When each year that passes brings more revelations of how the United Statesaided and abetted the escape of Nazi fugitives, how can we instruct our youngpeople on the evil of the Third Reich? When high-ranking Roman Catholicclergymen ensured the survival of thousands of war criminals by providing thempassports, safe houses, and transport out of Europe . . . when the Church hascovered up the sexual abuses perpetrated by its own priests . . . when it hasbeen revealed how the Catholic nuns of Montreal, virginal brides of Christ,tortured the orphan children under their own care as late as the fifties Andsixties . . . how can we speak to our children about morality? Wouldn't it be anormal reaction to try (as did the Nazis) to rescue the idealized portrait of agentle Jesus, God of Love, from the clutches of the (Ihurch? Worse, how can weinsist that these same Nazis are the very portrait of all that is wrong withsociety, with civilization, with power run amok . . . when we shamelesslyexploited their talents during our Cold War with Communism, both in Europe (withthe Geh-len organization) and in South America?Thus, with a growing number of white men taking part in rausi .macks againstJews, blacks, and Asians and using the Nazis as theirrole models, we find ourselves in a desperate moral dilemma. Since Vietnam, andthrough Watergate and Iran-Contra, the American people have become cynical abouttheir elected officials, about their lies, their treachery, and about the abuseof power that seems endemic to Washington. Clearly, the idea of moral politicalleadership seems a quaint memory. Who, then, will tell the Skinheads andwhatever new generation of neo-Nazi ideologues and radicals that comes along inthe next few decades that Hitler was a psychopath; that the social programs ofthe Third Reich were a monstrous fraud; that the racial ideas of the Nazi Partyhad no basis in science; that the SS was not an institution to be emulated, thatit consisted of murderers, rapists, junkies, and thugs?Sadly, we must expect that when we say these things to our children—and to ourchildren's children—they will point to Klaus Barbie and Reinhard Gehlen andWerner von Braun and Otto Skorzeny and Freddy Schwend and Valerian Trifa andPius XII and Paul VI and Bishop Hudal and hundreds if not thousands of othersand ask, \"Then, why?\"And if America's cults become the surrogate families for children who have beenabused, neglected, or scorned at home (or at the Boy Scout troop, the day-carecenter, even in church), we may never even have the chance to hear the question.For, as Charles Manson—neo-Nazi mystic par excellence —once prophesied at histrial with regard to his own Family:\"What about your children? These are just a few. There is many, many more comingright at you.\"NotesNA: National ArchivesCDS: Captured Documents SectionEpigraph From Thomas Mann, Doctor Faustus, p. 244.In i roouction: At the Mountains of MadnessMy defense of Farago is probably idiosyncratic since such is not a popularattitude to take toward Aftermath. For instance, in a footnote to his The OccultRoots of Nazism, Goodrick-Clarke lumps Aftermath together with such pop novelsas The Holcroft Covenant, which is either an oversight from that otherwisecautious author or a deliberate underestimation of Farago's work.( )n<j of the shrillest critics of Farago's work is Gerald L. Posner, whoselatest offering, Case Closed, purports to \"prove\" the Warren Commission'sfindings that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of PresidentKennedy. Posner attacked Farago in a book, ooauthored with BBC televisionproducer John Ware, entitled Mengele: The Complete Story. In this work, safelybegun two years after Mengele's death in Brazil, farago is needlessly andbrutally characterized as au incompetent, venal swindler who was duped at everyturn in his quest for Mengele, a quest which resulted—says Posner—in the murderof an innocent man wrongly assumed to be Mengele (pages^-274). Incredibly, Posner lays this crime at Farago's door; an ironic leap forsomeone who criticizes the JFK conspiracy theorists for similar \"leaps.\"' We mayhe certain that Mr. Posner will provide thereading public with more such proofs in the future in his zealous defense ofgovernment-approved cover stories and socially acceptable mythology. Perhaps abook that will prove Senator Joe McCarthy's famous list of suspected Communistsin the U.S. government was genuine or a study proving that George Bush hadnothing at all to do with Iran-Contra?1.

Many popular histories of the Nazi occultism phenomenon unfortunately suggestthat Hitler was everything from ritual-practicing satanist to trance medium andassociate the Thule Gesellschaft with all sorts of dcmonolatry, or what GoldenDawn member and Nobel Prize-winning poet William Butler Yeats used to call\"Dhyabolism.\" Trevor Ravens-croft's best-selling Spear of Destiny spins a wildtale of Hitler attending seances with Dietrich Eckart and of the Golden Dawn,the Thule, and all sorts of Far Eastern cults being part of some giant satanicweb: essentially turning the Protocols idea around on its defenders by implyingthat there is a worldwide conspiracy of Freemasons and that they are all Nazis!A saner approach—and the one the author hopes is being adequately defendedhere—is that Hitler's worldview was the product of influences from such occultlegends as Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels, and that he derived much ofhis cosmology (including his platform concerning race) not from politicians butfrom occultists, such as those in the Thule and including such men as Eckart andRosenberg, who were fellow travelers. In this sense, then, Hitler was a tool ofother occultists: men who were intelligent, well read, well traveled, andinsightful into the workings of the human psyche. Lanz von Liebenfels saw hisdreams realized in Hitler, and said as much during his lifetime. Hitler devouredI iebenkls s writings and even met the Master. For an impoverished nobody withhis own delusions of grandeur, that meeting alone was more important than mosthistorians realize.As for the Thule being somehow linked to foreign occult societies: althoughthere is very little, if any, hard evidence for this, anyone who studiesoccultism (particularly those forms of the last century or so) knows thatoccultists keep track of each other; they read each other's books, incorporateelements of each other's rituals and philosophies, and meet for drinks hopingthe other will pick up the tab. Thus, while Guido von list would never admit toborrowing heavily from the Golden Dawn, for instance— since occultists neveracknowledge their sources unless they are appropriate!) ancient and thereby longdead—such an influence can be traced by the acute researcher. This does notimply thatList would have been sympathetic to the Golden Dawn's teachings, only that hesaw something bright and shiny there and picked it up for his own tiara.7. Sklar, p. 55.8. Ibid.9.

He was asked by the (lestapo to signa statement that he had not been maltreated by them, which he did (in order toleave Nazi territory) and appended the cited remark.Chapter Six: The Dangerous ElementThe memoir of Walter Schellenberg was helpful here, as well as the CapturedGerman Documents section of the National Archives, individual items as citedbelow. But a word must also be said for Michael Kater's definitive 1974 study ofthe Ahnenerbe, which has so far not been available in English. During one of myfirst visits to the National Archives in 1977, Kater's name came up invariablywhenever the Ahnenerbe was mentioned. His sometimes witty, sometimes justifiablycontemptuous, but always insightful rendering of the activities of thisorganization made for a congenial traveling companion during the final days ofwriting this book.1.

(This is also another indication thatthe Ahnenerbe was under SS control long before Sievers's stated claim—in frontof the Nuremberg Tribunal—that it only became part of the SS in 1940. Whilethere is some mystery as to where all of its funding came from before 1940 whenthe Ahnenerbe became part and parcel of Himmler's Personal Staff, there can beno doubt that SS officers filled its upper ranks. Thus it was managed and run bySS men regardless of where the money came from initially.

Speech of Khalid Abdul Mohammad, Nation of Islam National Spokesman, at KeanCollege, N.J., Nov. 29, 1993, included the following remarks: \"You see everybodyalways talk about Hitler exterminating 6 million Jews. That's right. But don'tnobody ever ask what did they do to Hitler? What did they do to them folks? Theywent in there, in (iermany, the way they do everywhere they go, and theysupplanted, they usurped, they turned around and a German, in his own country,would almost have to go to a Jew to get money. They had underminedthe very fabric of the society. ... I don't care who sits in the seat at theWhite House. You can believe that the Jews control that seat that they sit infrom behind the scenes. They control the finance, and not only that, theyinfluence the policy making. . . . You're not the chosen people of God. Stoptelling that lie. . . .\" (Reprinted in New York Times, January 16, 1994, p. 27by ADL) It's interesting and ironic to note that the above is in total agreementwith both Nazi propaganda and neo-Nazi propaganda; the Nation of Islam, ofcourse, would be the first on the Nazi hit list (after the ADL) if ever a whitesupremacist organization took power in the United States. Further remarksdetailed a desire to murder white babies, women, old people, and the mentallyand physically infirm in South Africa: essentially a program of racial eugenicsidentical to Hitler's except, of course, that only those of raciallyinferior—i.e., white—blood would be subject to these measures whereas in NaziGermany the mentally and physically infirm and the aged were destroyedregardless of race.15.

In fact, this became a very different book from the one I set out to writea year ago.In the last twenty years I have been on familiar terms with several of theoccult lodges and political parties described in these pages; I am not certainif one should acknowledge organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan or the NationalRenaissance Party, or the dark lords of Colonia Dignidad. I don't know if theyears I have spent on the periphery (or in the middle) of such groups as theChurch of Satan, Scientology, the various OTOs, the Craft, StarGroup One, andthe many, many schismatic churches, sects, and underground temples of NorthAmerica, South America, Europe, and Asia—years that have certainly beenenlightening—merit a comprehensive rundown of all the personalities that havehelped shape my . . . well, my Weltanschauung, if you will.Instead, I will confine myself to thanking a few key people who made my life—andthis project—easier.A really decent study of Nazi occultism would have to be many thousands of pageslonger than this one and would probably lose the general reader in a morass offootnotes and citations in German, Icelandic, Russian, Latin, Hebrew, Arabic,Greek, Sanskrit, French, Spanish, and God knows what else. What I had to contentmyself with in the interim, however, was this study—this expose if you will—ofthe general outlines of occult theory and practice among elements of the ThirdReich with a particular emphasis on the Thule Society, the SS, and theAhnenerbe-SS. In order to help me accomplish this, I was fortunate enough tohave the help of many devoted individuals who may not have believed in my storybut who supported my efforts to tell it.Ingrid Celms—once herself a victim of the Third Reich—helped with many of thetranslations from German into English of core Thule documents from the early(pre-WWII) period. She performed this inher spare time and with great (and perhaps distasteful) labor, and for this shehas my heartfelt thanks. It should be pointed out, though, that I performedother translations and am ultimately responsible for any errors that may havecrept in.I should thank the resources and staff of the New York Public Library, MainBranch at Forty-second Street and Fifth Avenue, always my second home no matterwhere my first one happens to be.The staff at the Westerly Public Library performed admirably in helping obtainhard-to-locate items from outside the state library system; they and theinterlibrary loan program are to be commended.The people at the Southern Poverty Law Center and its creature, Klanwatch—andparticularly Klanwatch researcher David Webb— provided tremendous assistance inlocating examples of contemporary racist activities in the United States thathad a bearing on my thesis. These courageous individuals under the leadership ofMorris Dees stand up to the Klan and the neo-Nazis every day of their lives—sometimes under dire threat—and are to be warmly applauded.The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith was a source of information onSkinhead activities and statistics that were informative and vital to my work.Many thanks.The Religious Movement Resource Center at Fort Collins, Colorado, was veryhelpful in helping to assess the cult aspects of the Skinhead movement and insuggesting other lines of inquiry.Ms. Amy Schmidt of the Center for Captured Records at the National Archives wasparticularly generous with her time, for which I will always be grateful. Andearlier, in the seventies, I had several fruitful conversations with Dr. RobertWolfe at the National Archives, which led me onto the right path with regard tolocating Ahnenerbe documentation and introducing me to the work of MichaelKater.Amnesty International—in particular Ms. Betsy Ross—provided valuable assistancein locating documents and testimony concerning the operation of ColoniaDignidad.Tibet House was the unexpected source of an actual film of the Ernst SchaferSS-Tibet expedition, something which I previously had no idea existed, .is wellas an official OSS film of the 1942-43 Brook Dolan expedition. My thanks to Ms.Erin Gould and to Mr. Norbu ( Ihophel for their help in locating andinterpreting this valuable resource material, and in providing me with a list ofother individualsand organizations specializing in Tibetan studies from the point of view offoreign expeditions.As always, Judith McNally provided her excellent critique of the manuscript inearly stages and suggested revisions.
